review/summary: The proper glass to enjoy a fine tequila
review/text: These are sturdy glasses that go thru my dishwasher constantly. They feel well balanced in your hand when held by the stem. The body of the glass is short and allows the color of the tequila to travel upward. If your buying fine tequila or just sipping your favorite variety, this is the perfect glass.

review/summary: 1 Tequila, 2 Tequila, 3 Tequila, Floor
review/text: Just kidding about the floor.  You won't want to put any shooting tequila in these glasses.  If you want to shoot, stick to your shooters and cheap tequila.  If you enjoy sipping tequila by itself or with nice a plate of carnitas, these are the glasses for you.  I received two sets for Christmas 2010 and have not been disappointed one little bit.  I went out and bought two bottles of my favorite tequilas after I received them, both anjeos.  The first is Jose Cuervo (keep reading) Reserva de la Familia and the other is 4 Copas.  These are two very different, both high end, anjeos that you enjoy even more so when served in these glasses.  With the narrow bowl, you can get more of the aromas from the tequila without the burst of alcohol you would get from a wider bowl.  This allows me to enjoy the aroma and full flavor of the tequila with each sip.<br /><br />As far as the durability of these glasses?  I haven't tested them for durability nor will I do so.  Like anything you value, treat them kindly.  Like other reviewers have said, wash and dry the bowl while gently holding the bowl and wash and dry the stem while gently holding the stem.  That being said, I ran these through the dishwasher before I used them the first time and they came out great.  But I was careful in stacking them too.<br /><br />And finally, a tip if you want to find some high end tequila at a mid level price, go to a store that rhymes with bostco.  I paid 75.00 for the bottle of 4 Copas Anjeo at a discount liquor store.  For about 35.00 I tried a 1 liter bottle of Kirkland Anjeo.  Same deep color, same rich aroma, same sipping quality, and you get more too.  Tequila!!!

review/summary: too fragile unless you are a girlie-man tequila drinker
review/text: I like the glass. It definitely is the glass for drinking Tequila. they truly let  the aromas and flavors of fine tequilas be discovered by the drinker.  The problem is that they are so very fragile.  I broke one while gently drying it. The stem separated cleanly from the rest of the glass. I broke another,  again while drying this time I was lucky that I didn't cut my hand with the broken glass. For the price I'm not sure if thy are worth all the trouble.

review/summary: Delicious and quick to cook
review/text: This is a good price for wild rice.  The packages are individually wrapped, about 2-3 cups of rice in each bag. You get a box of twelve bags.  One bag makes a good sidedish for a family of 4 or five.  The rice cooks fairly quickly so you do need to watch that it doesn't overcook and get mushy.  If it does overcook not to worry, add sauteed mushrooms and onions, and a little half/half or cream and make a really easy and delicious mushroom and wildrice soup.

review/summary: If you're gonna drink junk.... Drink good junk!
review/text: I met the local distributor (Shawn) while he was delivering product to our neighborhood store, and I've been buying it since.  I know that I will never put down the soda or energy drinks, so I figured that I may as well drink one that is good for me.  I've actually lost 10 lbs by substituting soda and monster energy for this drink.  I have no illusion that this is a magical cure all drink, but all the ingredients are natural, all the calories are dietary(from honey), and it contain none of the chemical simulants that the other "energy" drinks do. I actually don't consider this an "energy" drink, but a healthy substitute for them and soda.  Like I stated before, I'm not gonna put down the soda, so if I'm gonna drink junk... I'm gonna drink junk thats better for me!

review/summary: Slightly Suspicious
review/text: RevHoney was sponsoring a Homecoming 5k race at my college, and they were giving out all of their products. Looking at the ingredients list, they don't actually list Raw Honey, or Honey, they call it "Rev Honey". In all descriptions of their drink, they say that Rev Honey includes raw honey, not that Rev Honey is raw honey. I feel like it's a little suspicious, but I don't doubt that there is raw honey.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is mediocre on this product, and after our 5k, it's making my stomach hurt. Some may love the taste, but it's not my cup of tea.

review/summary: An energy drink without caffeine? Excellent concept!
review/text: I did not realize that there was an energy drink made without caffeine until I stumbled upon this product in Amazon. What an excellent concept! For those who have a difficult time consuming caffeine because it makes you jittery but still need a little extra boost to get your through the day, then you definitely need to try RevHoney Berry Rain. The concept behind the energy boost is that RevHoney is made from real honey so the honey blend mix in the beverage provides the added energy kick. This is an excellent product that actually tastes really good too. I now drink RevHoney not only for the energy boost but as a substitute for a cola as well because it is a healthy drink so it is better for you than the cola drinks. I would definitely recommend this product!

review/summary: Ahmad Earl Grey Tea ~ The Most Exquisite Earl Grey I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I first came across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea a number of years ago, while I was visiting a friend who lives out in Seaford, Long Island (NY). I was waiting for her to meet me in a mall, there, & I just happened into a Mideastern grocery-deli to browse and look at the great variety of exotic foods & spices they had for sale.<br /><br />By & by, I started getting thirsty & asked the shopkeeper whether he had cups of hot tea for sale. He showed me the varieties of tea they had & I chose Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, since Earl Grey has been my favorite ever since I was introduced to it back in the late '70s by an English friend of mine, who would prepare it with milk or cream & sugar or honey.<br /><br />Well, I had had excellent cups of Earl Grey tea in the past -- Twinings, Bigelow, Island-Rose & others -- but nothing I had previously tasted had fully prepared me for the sublimely fragrant, yet delicate & nuanced bouquet of aroma & flavor that literally "took me by surprise" upon my first sip of Ahmad Earl Grey Tea... aroma & flavor that was not just a simple one-dimensional taste but one that seemed to unfold as you drank it, revealing delightfully unexpected subtleties, layers & shades of enchantingly fragrant aromas & flavors.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the high quality of the tea leaves & the bergamot used to impart the flavor were clearly distinguishable to me in the tea's unmistakably delightful yet delicate aroma, not only when opening the box of 100 tea bags, or the individual envelopes containing the bags of tea... but quite detectable, in the tea bag itself, even after having made a cup of tea or two, making me wonder whether they might have discovered some very effective, secret manner of infusing the bergamot aroma into the tea leaves, or the tea bag, such that the aroma didn't dissipate after having made a cup of tea, or even while standing on the shelf of the grocery, as I've noticed sometimes happens with lesser grades of Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />In any event, after such an incomparable experience with Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, it is the only Earl Grey tea that I choose to drink, unless I happen to be out somewhere where it is, unfortunately, not available.<br /><br />It is at such times that I am so appreciative to have come across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea.<br /><br />Though I've often purchased it at Mideastern food markets, for instance in Astoria, Queens, where it is readily available at rock-bottom prices & fresh from the importers, nevertheless, for those of you who are too far away to do so, the fact that it is available here on Amazon.com is already quite a boon, especially if you order a number of packages of it to lessen the impact of the shipping charges, though, if you already have amazon Prime, that will be a boon as far as shipping charges are concerned.<br /><br />If you do order Ahmad Earl Grey Tea & try it, I'm quite sure that you'll find that it soon becomes for you, as it has for me, "a most exquisite delight, definitely not to be missed!"

review/summary: Tastes great, but too many 'special effects'
review/text: If it were for taste alone, I'd give these cookies 5 stars.  They're pretty much indistinguishable from ordinary high-carb chocolate chip cookies.  Very tasty!<br /><br />However, this product contains inulin, a poly-fructose that is not digestible, at least not by humans.  Turns out, bacteria in the colon love inulin.  They metabolize it like crazy, creating lots of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane in the process.  Needless to say, after eating a few of these cookies, you may have to tie the blankets down on your bed to keep them from being blown off.  But if you're the sort who is amused by digestive music, these cookies might become a favored treat.

review/summary: mediocre, at best.
review/text: I didn't like these cookies. I don't know why reviews here on Amazon and on netrition are saying how sweet they are, because they aren't sweet at all. They only taste like almonds and oats. The texture isn't good, and they fell apart before I could even get them off the pan. The directions said not to grease the pan but I think you'd have to, despite having an entire stick of butter in the mix.<br />According to the nutrition facts (when you do the math) the package is supposed to make 34 cookies (a 2" 2-cookie serving, makes 17 servings). It told you to drop tablespoons of dough and I used my tablespoon cookie scoop but it only made 24 cookies.<br />I suppose these cookies were better than any other of the low-carb cookie recipes I've tried from cookbooks, but they still were not good enough to make again and I'll probably end up throwing most of them away. I'm on a low-carb and low-calorie diet and with a whole stick of butter in the dough I don't think it's worth the calories I'd have to sacrifice to eat a mediocre cookie.<br />I suppose when I want to eat a cookie, I just want to eat a darn cookie. I suppose I want to taste sugar (or something like it), not oats or almonds. When you have a sweet tooth, who reaches for oats or almonds? I don't even like oatmeal cookies; maybe that's one reason why I don't like them.

review/text: Maybe it's because these were the first cookies I'd eaten in a couple of months, but I found them too sweet by about 50%.  They are quite tasty, if little cake-like in texture.  They satisfy the urge to have a cookie.  But when one is trying to avoid sugar, having a low-carb treat that has too much of it is kind of disappointing.  I kind of wish they let you add your own sugar to taste.  That would also let you control the carbs more.

review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

review/text: I cant figure out why Gerber 2nd peas are so hard to find in the store...I see something green and its always green beans! We go through peas so much in my house with my child and this is the only way we are going to buy them from now on. The box is very compact and I just remove the top and leave stored them right in the box. It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.<br /><br />One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff.

review/text: This is a great find for our family. First off, mixed vegetables is one of the best flavors of baby food. Its also sometimes hard to find in the stores near me that typically have a very meager selection. This eight pack takes care of our needs for a while, and everything comes neatly shipped in a compact little box that you can tear the top of and keep them all together. Every tub arrived and it had a really long expiration date. You cant go wrong!

review/summary: Instant Potatoes...As Good As They Get!
review/text: I have tried lots of different products over the years when it comes to Betty Crocker. Some were really great and I use them everyday in my kitchen, others were a 'one time flung'.<br />I bought these intitally because they were made from Yukon Gold Potatoes that are a family favorite to start with. I had my doubts but the the first time I made them they were GREAT! even the picky eaters at my house asked for seconds. My only thing I think that would improve them was in the labeled servings per box. I needed to make BOTH pouches to feed 2 adults, 2 teen boys and one tween girl.<br />They are a good alternative for quick & easy dinners or for when company is here but no very cost effective for regulars family dinners.

review/text: We drink soy milk primarily in the summer as my family's stomachs don't handle dairy AND the Texas heat well. We've tried many brands before but I ordered this brand while on sale. This isn't a favorite and I probably wouldn't order it again. It's not very tasty and would probably do better with add-ins... not so good just straight. Yes we have found "chunks and lumps" as my son says. He won't drink this unless it's blended...defeats the purpose of having these small portable packages!<br /><br />It's just OK, isn't one of my favorite soy milk drinks and not one I'd serve to company.

review/text: Because of a dairy allergy, we've been a soymilk household for many years. We've bought many types: Silk brand, Trader Joe's, store brand, refrigerator, shelf stable, individual servings, etc. And we've enjoyed all of them.... until we bought this product - Pacific Natural Foods Enriched Vanilla Soymilk, 8 oz. packages. This is by far the WORST soymilk we've ever had. As other reviewers commented, it's chunky. And no matter how much you shake it, it's still chunky. My kids refuse to drink it and send it home in their lunch boxes unopened. I don't recommend this. I do recommend trying another brand!

I'd be interested in trying the chocolate. But I did not care for the taste of this myself and think I'll stick to Silk when I make my next purchase .. but overall do recommend as an option for milk alternatives.

review/text: We had a great aunt who used to make this soup every year for our family reunion in Lancaster, PA. Of course she did a marvelous job! But Chunky is giving her a run for her money! The soup is really delicious. It is loaded with corn, potatoes, carrots and of course BIG chunks of WHITE meat chicken! It's the perfect soup to microwave in two minutes when you don't have the energy to cook and you know you'll be getting a nutritious AND filling dinner or lunch or heck, even just as a snack. Very tasty and not too salty tasting at all! Of course being a "canned" soup it is high in sodium but you don't taste it as being high in salt. The flavors are very well balanced. Your family will love this on a snowy day! I eat it all year-round though! Enjoy everyone!

review/summary: Tasty, satisfying soup, but don't eat too often!
review/text: OK, so one can is 2 servings.  So double those nutritional numbers if you eat the whole can (as I, and I expect many, do). That's 400 calories, not too bad, but 180 of those are from fat (oops!).  Also you're getting 70% of your daily sodium, 1680mg. and 50 mg of cholesterol (16%), 40g carbs (14%), 6g fiber, 8g sugar and 20g of fat.  Definitely not health food territory. So, I wouldn't eat this soup too often.  But, occasionally, it's fine (in my opinion).<br /><br />That said, it is very tasty and very satisfying.  The quality seems good, nice texture, good broth, good potatoes, nice corn flavor, OK chicken, and so on.  I enjoyed my first bowl very much.  Definitely a nice treat on a cold day.  An ok value using subscribe and save with free shipping.  Nice to have these on hand for a quick meal. Definitely one of the better tasting Campbell's chunky soups I've tried.  (If they could reduce the cholesterol, sodium and fat, they'd really have something.)<br /><br />Overall, a very tasty and satisfying soup.

I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.

review/summary: It's the best!
review/text: Costco Warehouse consistently delivers on any product they decide on stamping their 'Kirkland' logo on. Their sweetener is definitely the BEST on the market in terms of price, but most importantly, taste. I am a Costco member and have been using this brand of sweetener for at least 4 years. The 1,500 sachets lasts me almost 2 years. I use it almost every day since I'm a prodigious drinker of hot teas (even in 100 degree weather). I also use the sweetener in baking cookies, drinking coffee on occasion and for anything else that requires a sweet taste. There is no aftertaste. NONE! Even stevia can be exceedingly bitter if too much is used. Not with the Kirkland sweetener; too much just results in it tasting too sweet, that is all. It is just like using white sugar, but without all the debilitating side effects of using such a toxin. It's also much better to buy this product from any of the Costco warehouses dotted around the U.S. It's well worth paying the yearly membership with all the items you can buy there at fantastic prices. The sweetener retails for under $17 at a Costco warehouse.

review/summary: Scoby DOA
review/text: It is a cut-up piece from a big scoby and it looks unhealthy on arrival.  Its color is dark brown and it is shedding layers.  A label says it is supposed to be good till Jan. 2013, four months away from when I received it.  I tried to make kombucha out of it but no scoby formed after two weeks.  The sweet tea solution smelled musky and unpleasant.  This kit is going back.

review/summary: For the cat with hardwood floors
review/text: My cat loves toys.  She wasn't too crazy about Petmate's Cat Crazies toys, but these Looney Loops are her favorites.  I brought these home and she abandoned her previous favorites (which is good since they were stuffed mice which were falling apart) and actually gets upset when she slides one of these toys under the furniture and can't reach them.  She hasn't lost interest in them in over 6 months.  I originally bought them at PetSmart, but they've either been out of stock or no longer carrying them.  I'm very happy to find them on Amazon.<br /><br />These are great because they move quickly across the floor and she can bat them atound.  And they're QUIET, which makes them great for her night-time play sessions.  If you step on them you won't get injured (a rule for any cat toy in my house.)  They're durable.<br /><br />I don't know how they'd do on carpet -- I image they're a hard-floor toy.

review/summary: My Cat's Favorite Toy
review/text: My cat loves these so much that I bought ten packs of them just in case they stop making them.  Seriously.  She purrs the minute I pick one up.  She likes to play fetch with these so any time I'm around she brings one to me and meows until I throw it for her.  Then she has a great time chasing it around the room until she catches it.  I have to put them away at night, though, since she'll bring them to my bed and meow for me to throw them.  This is the best cat toy ever.

review/summary: My cat ADORES these
review/text: I bought these after trying several other toys to keep my cat happy while I am at work, and he loves them!  He wraps them around his paws to chew on, loops them on door stops for the 'twang' fun, tosses them in the air and brings them to me to throw for him (the only thing he fetches--self taught by the way).  They are quiet and don't hurt your feet at o'dark hundred when wandering around the house.  My cat even plays with them in bed next to me and I never wake up! Petsmart still carries them for around $2-3 (saw them today) and I have passed them on to other family members with cats.

review/summary: The Most Amazing Cat Toy!
review/text: I just bought my 6 month old kitten these, just to try them out. She loves batting around paper balls and paper-clip type items so I was happy to find something that wasn't expensive and seemed something she would like. SHE LOVES THEM! It's been about 25 minutes and she is still batting it around, carrying it in her mouth and having her crazy kitten moments! It's the perfect cat toy. To big to swollow, quiet and durable, bright colors, cool shape and cheap! She is having a ball. It works on carpet or hardwood floors too!<br /><br />I also recommend the PetMate Crazy Spinners. She really enjoyed those also!

review/text: You wouldn't think these simple little plastic curls would make even a mild-mannered cat act like a fool, but they DO.<br /><br />You know how cats go nuts for the plastic pull off the milk/water jug? These are made on the same principle but stronger and more to hold onto.<br /><br />The beauty is in the simplicity. (Like how cats usually like the BOX the fancy gift came in instead of the fancy gift...and would rather sleep on a dictionary than a 100 dollar bed.) Big cats and little cats both liked it. And you can't beat the price. Five paws-up.

review/text: Got these for my cat. She's high maintenance and I wanted a toy that would keep her interest. And wouldn't fall apart like her rabbit fur mice toys.<br /><br />At first when I opened these up she was...unenthused. She batted them around a few times and then walked off to play with her other toys. Then, about a week later, I found her going *nuts* around the house. I thought it was another mouse she was chasing and then saw it was one of the Looney-Loops.<br /><br />Now she loves them, and will carry them around the house and chase them for hours. A great, simple cat toy--I just needed to give it time.

review/summary: Crazy Cat Toy
review/text: Our 15 week old kitten was raised playing with wand toys, before we adopted him.  This is the only toy he will play with that doesn't require me to interact and play with him.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE playing with him, but I am a student and I do need some time to myself for studying.  He rolls them around on the floor, puts his arms through them (like bracelets) and then flings them across the room, hides and stalks them, and basically acts just plain goofy with them.  I plan on getting a few more of these to have spares on hand as he looses them under the entertainment center every now and then.

review/text: My kitten loves this toy.  I have hardwood floors so I watch her run around and play with it all day long.  She can literally spend hours playing with it alone.  I've seen her put it insides shoes, boxes, any type of storage and try to bat them around and out for fun. The cutest part is when she picks it up with her mouth and carries it around with her.  She's carries it around all over the house and I find it laying everywhere, even on my bed. But the funniest was when I actually found it in her litterbox! Guess she liked it so much she took it with her when she had to potty.

review/summary: My cat is obsessed!
review/text: In general, my cat is pretty indifferent when it comes to store-bought toys. She tends to prefer balls of tinfoil, paper bags, cardboard, etc. The first few days, she was not really into these. Then she saw the way they bounced and rolled on the linoleum kitchen floor and is now completely hooked. She goes totally nuts; smacking into cupboards and rolling all over the floor playing with these. The plastic is stiff enough that they roll well but pliable enough that she can pick it up in her mouth, chew it (she's never broken off a piece to eat), stick her paw through the middle; it's hilarious to watch. They are pretty hardy so even when you inevitably step on them in the dark, they bounce back into shape pretty well. My only complaint is that they only come 3 per pack. If I could buy bulk, I would because there is an entire pack under my refrigerator right now! Every time my kitty gets one stuck under something, she goes nuts trying to get it out, so if I can't get it easily I break out another. They used to sell these at one of the chain pet stores but not anymore. I recommend buying 2 packs at a time cuz they will be under your furniture pretty quickly!

review/text: I've tried all kinds of cat toys and wasted a lot of money on toys she's played with a cople of times then never touches again. Then I bought the looney loops and oh boy she absolutely loves them! She chases them all over the apartment, bats at them, and loves digging them out from under the couch. She plays with them so much they no longer resemble their original form and I had to throw them away they were so ratty in shape. I went into panic mode when my local store was out of them and didn't get them back into stock for ages. Then I found them online! I bought a whole bunch so I wouldn't be caught without any of her favorite toy. I don't know why she loves playing with them but she does! I highly recomend them!

Until I found these. He goes nuts. He is always carrying them around in his mouth. Then will drop it and start batting it around. When that one 'escapes' he goes back to his basket and grabs another. His favorite thing to do is go into an empty bath tub with one of these. He can spend hours in there playing.<br /><br />I highly recommend these. They don't shed, they don't fall apart, they don't break, and they are completely washable!

They do work best on hard floors, but carpet isn't a deal breaker since they're tossable. If Tabitha isn't playing with these, it's generally because she's sleeping, or because they're all lost under the furniture. Buy extra.

review/text: We have been buying these toys since our oldest cat was a kitten in 2004 and they are the favorite of all three of our cats (and many others that we've given them to).  They are safe to be left out but do eventually wear out and break (it takes about a year of our cats heavy use and us stepping on them occasionally).  We had to monitor our cats with them when kittens, though, because the toy would get stuck on paws because the loops are big enough to fit a small cat's paw inside.  Two of our cats fetch with this toy and will carry it around in their mouths to bring it to us.  We have even found one sleeping with the toy at night!

review/summary: Better than the milk-ring type toys
review/text: Even though these toys will roll under furniture, they are the best toy for our cat - a ragdoll.  because these actually move over tiles/floors (as opposed to the milk-cap types that just sit there after being tossed), this is the cat's favorite toy.<br /><br />i actually would recommend getting two packs, since they get udner furniture so easily.

review/summary: Strange Fun Toy
review/text: These actually work very well on a carpet as well. My cat loves them, and he bats them all around and because they are lightweight, they bop and fly everywhere and he chases them! A cheap, durable (you can step on them, and chances are, your cat will still love them!), entertaining cat toy!

review/summary: Kitty was not impressed
review/text: I found these at a local pet store but my cat won't play with them at all. She just stares at them like they are aliens from Mars. Some of the best things in life are free (sort of). Here's a tip to save you some money. Pull the ring off your milk container or orange just container and flip it off the counter and watch your cat go wild! My cat loves 'milk rings'. Her all time favorite toy above anything I have purchased that is an actual 'cat toy'. We have them all over the house.  Bottles of vinegar have a nice wide loop to pull off too. My kitty loves them because they fit so well under anything she can bat them under (like the furniture or the refrigerator).

review/summary: Exellent full strong flavor
review/text: This was my first purchase of Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups for my Keurig. I was hoping it would be at least as good as making a pot of tea. I was not disappointed. In fact, I find them to have a fuller body and stronger flavor than a cup from a tea pot. It is handy and quick as popping one in and pushing the brew button.<br /><br />My biggest concern when making this purchase was that it would pick up the flavor from a previously brewed cup of coffee. It did not. As a precaution I do rinse the inside of the cup holder before I brew a cup of tea, however, even times when I don't I can't tell the difference. So now I can have a great cup of Twinings Earl Grey with better results than a brewed pot of tea, much faster and with less waste. I fully recommend this product.<br /><br />I might also add, I have tried many brands of Earl Grey Tea and Twinings is the only brand that I enjoy. I'm elated that I can now get it in K-Kups! Thanks Twinings!!
