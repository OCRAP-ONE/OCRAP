review/summary: My Baby loves it!
review/text: My baby boy loves eating this food, better than some Earth's best Stage 3 foods.  It doesn't taste too bad either.  I love the sweet potatoes in the food.  The pouch is great for on the go, not having to worry about glass food containers breaking in the diaper bag, especially when we go for hikes.

review/text: It smells delicious but unfortunately my 11 month old was having problems with the Amaranth.  He does eat some finger foods - mango, peaches, carrots, etc... but for some reason he was having problems with the Amaranth - maybe it was too grainy for him.  Will try it down the road again.

review/summary: Doesn't taste good.
review/text: I make my own baby food but when we travel I give my daughter plum organics and happy baby food. She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip.

Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors.

review/summary: Too Thick
review/text: I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.

review/text: This stuff is so good I seriously almost ate it myself.  I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato-based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1/2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little "mmms" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato/acidic flavor of this meal.

review/summary: Reformulated for the worse
review/text: I used to be a huge fan of this.. wild salmon, 4g of protein, other great ingredients.. just ordered another 16 pack and discovered they have reformulated it to be completely different. It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option.

review/text: I have been making my son's baby food but needed a break since he's starting to eat more.  I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched.

review/text: The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product.

review/summary: Easy and Baby Loves It
review/text: My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients.

After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.  I'd suggest you try ONE pouch to see if you like it before you purchase several.

review/text: First, the other happy baby flavors have been a hit with my baby and me.  But this mama grain is indescribable.  I knew it as soon as I opened the pouch...The smell is awful...But I figured we would try it anyway.  I only wish I had the video camera out...Baby didn't like this one at all and I can't blame him.  Recommend buying one pack regardless of the price before getting the 16 pack.

review/text: This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,<br />and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this brand and they<br />were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all.

review/summary: My cats love this product
review/text: I really do like the Healthy Baby Baby foods.  I buy them with the Amazon Prime free shipping.  I also "subscribe and save".  I get 16 at a time.  The baby doesn't mine eating the same flavor each day for 16 days, but at the end of 16 days, he smells like cat food.  Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it- you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one- and constant- complaint.

review/summary: Blend your own baby food
review/text: I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75.

review/summary: Recipe changed with no warning - packaging pictured is out of date
review/text: My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.

review/text: Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with bread dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!

review/text: I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!

review/text: So I bought these when my baby was 7 or 8 months old thinking that these would be a great starter snack food and an alternative to Cheerios (which I hadn't yet given to my baby). These are not a melt in your mouth type of early baby snack. My little on is now almost 10mos with two teath and now better prepared for these hard/crunchy snacks. The flavor is tasty and I love the idea that they're organic, just best for older ones, not reccomended as a first snack.

review/text: These taste fantastic. I think I ate the majority of them, even more than the kids. I will say that they are a bit crunchier than the other brand of "puffs" and don't dissolve as readily. I bought them for my 7 month old but ended up only feeding him a few of them broken in half or smaller b/c he was having some trouble chewing them without many teeth. My 2 year old loved them though. I would recommend them, but for toddlers.

review/text: My kids are 5 & 3 1/2 and are pretty much over Cheerios these days. A few days a month they eat a light breakfast in the car so I researched (heavily!) a snack that was both very healthy (really healthy, not vitamins and minerals in Lucky Charms healthy) and special/unique and delicious. This fits the bill. Elmo makes all kiddos happy, of course, and this tastes/smells like a blueberry muffin. They aren't sticky or messy and they're really a tasty snack anytime. My husband and I have been known to share a few!

review/summary: Choking hazard??--note my update in comments
review/text: I should start out by mentioning that we typically love Earth's Best products.  The baby food is a staple in our house.  Recently, we tried the "Snackin' Fruit Hearts" for our 11 month old daughter.  She loves them.  Over a couple weeks she has eaten half of the 1.4oz container.<br />Today I tossed the remainder.  Our daughter has choked on this finger food product on three occasions during this half container, twice requiring life-saving actions.  To date our, daughter has not choked on any other food of any kind other than an occasional cough while drinking milk, but these have been very minor events compared to the choking incidences involving the "Snackin' Fruit Hearts".  As I mentioned she is a walking 11 months old toddler, has 8 teeth for biting and crunching, and has no problem with other similar or dissimilar foods, so I am hesitant to think that she is just having difficulties with eating this type of food.  I don't know why this particular product is problematic and poses a such a risk to her.  I also don't know to what degree this is rare or not with this product.  I also sent this review to Earth's Best not to rant or even complain, but simply to make them aware of our history with this product so that they will be informed to possibly make adjustments to the product or consider a warning label or statements on the product instructing a minimum age (over 1yr?) or at least *constant supervision* (no statement currently on the packing mentioning age or chocking hazard/supervision).  The world is dangerous enough for little ones, it seems food shouldn't be a risk to a young life.

review/text: I bought this box at the store when I first started eating gluten-free and I was craving things like toast, waffles, and COOKIES!  This mix was really excellent at feeding my craving- I usually make the entire box and divide the dough into three parts into ziploc baggies and freeze for a rainy day.  It is like having my own gluten-free cookie dough that I can easily defrost and bake whenever I want.<br /><br />To the mix, I add carob chips since I am also dairy-free and can't eat the milk in milk chocolate chips.  Also, instead of butter, you can use something vegan like smart balance which is made exclusively of vegetable oils.  When they bake, the carob chips just melt and become all gooey like real, luscious chocolate chips, with the rest of the cookie crunchy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside.  Be warned, though that they flatten out quickly so leave plenty of room on the baking sheet between each cookie!  They are a real treat when I need a pick-me-up!  While they are quite expensive on Amazon, they were $2 more per box at the store so Amazon's price is actually a deal.

review/summary: Best gluten free brownies you will ever eat!
review/text: I bought this mix for the first time at the Stonewall Kitchen in Maine.  I thought the price was a little high, but I had to give them a try.  These are the best brownies, whether you are gluten free or not, that you will ever eat.  They are chocolately, chewey, flavorful.  If you are gluten free and miss having a "normal" treat, this is it.  No grittiness, not dry, will not fall apart.  They are well worth the money.  When I make them I plan on freezing a few but never get to because they are gone to soon.  No one would be able to tell they are gluten free.  I guarantee you will love them.

review/summary: Amazing...the best brownies gluten free or not
review/text: My mom picked up a box of this mix for us. It turned out to be the best brownie mix ever - gluten free or not. My hubby (who does not eat gluten free) tried them without knowing what they were and he raved about how good they are. If you are eating gluten free, you have to try these.<br /><br />The only downside is the price - kind of a pricey treat. But maybe that's good. Otherwise we'd make these all the time!

review/summary: I can't tell it's GF! :)
review/text: Though these aren't quite as good as a Ghirardelli Mix (with gluten, naturally), it is a very decent brownie on any scale.  When you take into consideration it's GF, it's kind of miraculous.  The gritty texture, heavy weight, and funny taste I've come to associate with gluten-free products are completely missing here.  These feel, taste, and look just right. :)

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: The smell is absolutely heavenly. I never smelled vanilla extract like this. It smelled sooo pure and I could tell it was good quality. The owners are so friendly,kind and easily to work with. I had some shipping problems that were of my own fault and I called them at 10:00pm thinking the answering machine would pick up and tell me their hours so I could call in the moring before they ship my order. But, Eric, one of the owners, picked up and was shockingly friendly. I apologized for disturbing him but he didn't seem to mind and continued to help me.<br /><br />P.S. You should also try their Hawaiian vanilla while it lasts! It's even more fragrant then the Mexican!!!!!

review/summary: Pure Mexican Vanilla Extract
review/text: I recently received my order for this Mexican vanilla extract.  When I opened the bottle and smelled it, the aroma was heavenly - I've never smelled a vanilla extract that has this intense vanilla smell.  When I compared it to the extract I've been using, the difference was very obvious.  I'm looking forward to using this Mexican vanilla in my recipes!  It's not the purest vanilla extract offered, but when I looked at the ingredients of the pure vanilla product, I didn't like what I saw and opted for the vanilla extract, which has fewer additives.

review/summary: Very fast delivery of a truely oustanding Vanilla
review/text: The seller (Arizona Vanilla Company) was amazingly fast and courteous with its delivery.  With standard shipping, it took 2 days.  The shipping was only charged once with the other product (Hawaiian Vanilla) I ordered with it.  For the product itself, it's amazing.  I can smell that teaspoon that I use in baking and I can taste the difference in the cookies.  The only deterrence is the price.  In most cases, I use Kirkland (Costco brand) vanilla for baking, but for Mexican recipes and special occasions, I use this Mexican Vanilla product.  I don't have to worry about running out for Christmas baking (today is December 14).  This is truely the delicious difference making ingredient in my baking.

review/summary: not vanilla as I know it
review/text: I am not happy at all with this product at all. I brought some Mexican vanilla back with me on my last trip and this vanilla smells like pure alcohol.<br />It has a harsh smell. The real Mexican vanilla has a beautiful warm, rich smell with just a hint of... cinnamon perhaps?<br /><br />I am sorry that I bought 2 bottles of the stuff. Oh well, maybe it will get better with age or if I cook with it.<br /><br />John

review/summary: A decent Kona blend
review/text: This coffee is a good Kona blend comparable to other brands of 10% Kona coffee with "Lion" brand Kona blend being my personal favorite. While I generally prefer whole bean for the freshly ground brewing, I think the "blending" of Kona beans may be a little inconsistant and I found the Millstone ground 10% Kona blend to have a little better Kona flavor overall.

review/summary: Good Kona coffee
review/text: Bought this to work with my Keurig (self-fill cups) and wanted a Kona coffee.  It's good, but not the same as the Lion coffee that is the other Kona coffee I drink.  It's a tad more bitter, while the Lion is smoother and richer.  That being said, I am still drinking this every day until it's gone.  Not bad at all, especially for the price.

review/summary: best mild-tasting coffee
review/text: Of all the coffees on the market, I have found that Millstone Breakfast Blend is the most-consistently mild, smooth tasting coffee. Of course this is because of the light roast. For those of you who do not know this (most I suspect) the lighter the roast, the more caffeine. Therefore you can make this coffee concentrated, with no unpleasant flavor, and lots of caffeine kick. Yes, there are undoubtedly some light roast specialty coffees, but this choice is both fair traded and price-competitive.<br /><br />The Millstone Kona Blend tastes essentially the same as Breakfast Blend, but is not fair traded and has no advantages I can taste vs the straight Breakfast Blend.

review/summary: Not very fresh Beans Are Very Dry
review/text: I was very disappointed in these.  I am trying to use them up by mixing with some fresh roast beans when grinding them.  These seem like old stock because the beans are practically dessicated and not fresh roasted at all.  No sheen on the bean to speak of.  A lot like your typical pack of hotel coffee.  Would not recommend or reorder.

review/text: I didn't enjoy this blend at all.  If you're a fan of Starbuck's coffee (which I think is so over-roasted it tastes burnt), then you won't enjoy this.  If you're looking for a lighter roast, this is a good price...but the flavor was simply the worst "Kona" blend I've ever tried.  Maybe your taste will be different!  I'll be moving on to a different blend.

review/summary: Perfect for Espresso Drinkers Needing STRONG Coffee!!
review/text: I've suffered through having to always go get coffee out as my other half likes/needs the lower strength Donut Shop mild stuff, and I finally broke down and got me a case of 50 of these WONDEFUL Green Mountain Dark Magic K-cups.  THEY ARE PERFECT for someone that likes a strong, bold, delicious cup of coffee (and not that mild brown water some others drink)!  If I could afford espresso all the time, I'd do that, but this is a very close second and the taste is consistent.  Not one ground has come through into the cup (whereas other k-cups do).  This is some good, bold, flavorful coffee!

review/summary: Love the coffee but...
review/text: My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Just finished off my first Amazon packaged (50 count) box, and am impressed with the quality of the k-cup (ZERO wasted cups - no cups with broken seals, and no cups that resulted in a cup full o' grounds).<br /><br />My 5-star rating comes with a caveat.  It's not the best coffee I've had, but it is very good.  I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead.
