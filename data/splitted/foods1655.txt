review/summary: Not a hit
review/text: My cat wouldn't even take a bite of this. I figured maybe he was just being picky again, so i gave some to my younger cat who eats anything. She also wouldn't touch it. When i spend this much money on cat food, i expect it to at least smell good enough for my cats to taste it. This just smells like old fish.

review/summary: Great Food - Cats Should NOT Eat Dry Food
review/text: I don't know why this is not known to everyone, everywhere, but cats should eat a grain free, wet food diet. They cannot digest or get any nutrition from grains, so there is no reason for grains to be in cat food, yet to save money, they put it in. Also, cats naturally have a very low thirst drive, and with the correct diet, they will hardly ever drink water. If they are on a dry kibble diet, they will have to drink to get their water, and with the low thirst drive that is natural, a lot of cats don't get anywhere NEAR the amount of water they need. Cats on a dry food diet are likely to have kidney problems or urinary tract problems that could be prevented just by changing to a wet food diet. This is so important, and I urge everyone who loves their cat to get them off the dry food, and over a couple weeks, switch them to a grain free, wet food diet. Sorry to be preachy, but the word needs to be spread!<br /><br />This Weruva food is a big hit with my kitty, and it is a proper grain free wet food that makes sure he is getting the water he is supposed to get. Yes, it is canned in Thailand, but it is in an all human grade food facility. I would be much happier if it was all done in the US, but it has been reviewed by reputable sources and scored well. The other bonus, at least with the chicken flavors, is that they smell good! No stinky cat food smell, but in fact smells like something you might want a bite of. The cashier at the pet store I used to get this food from said he had eaten it, and it was good! Of course, it is also important to give them a variety, so I give him some of the "fishy" ones too, but the chicken smells great. I would recommend this food, but whether you feed this one or another one, please feed a grain free wet food diet to your cats!

review/summary: Seems to Be High Quality, But Be Aware "Product of Thailand"
review/text: I ordered this for some time but have recently stopped.  My cats took a while to begin to like it, but once they got used to it, they really liked it.  It appears to be good quality.  I have tried the Chicken and Nine Liver varieties.  That said, I was disturbed to notice, printed on the bottom of the cardboard containing the cat food, that it is a product of Thailand.  As of the writing of this review, Amazon's site does not indicate the country of origin.  There have been several very large, very disconcerting recalls of pet food from Thailand or containing ingredients from there over the past decade.  And the food safety record of Thailand of "human grade" food has also been very spotty.  As an aside, I quote "human grade" because I recently learned that that term, unfortunately, has no legal definition.  I decided to give the item 3 stars because it seems of good quality, but chose to not rate it higher because of the lack of disclosure of the country of origin and the overall price.

review/summary: The Cats Love This - But There's Something that Bugs Me
review/text: I ordered this cat food because we have two cats in the house and we have an agreement to keep the cats on more natural or organic foods.  They really seemed to like the cat food with fish in it, and my friend swears by the Weruva foods.  So I went ahead and ordered a case of 24 - 3 oz cans.  And of course, both cats loved it!<br /><br />But there's one thing that's really nagging at me.  Weruva cat foods, according to their "advertising" on the label, are manufactured and processed in a facility that processes human food.  To me (but what do I know?) it seems like a good thing for the cats, and perhaps not such a good thing for me.  I'm not feeling really great about this whole idea of the place where my food comes from also processes cat food.  The cardboard box gave me a few more clues - since it said in rather large letters - Made in Thailand. (It's also on the individual cans and packages - in really teeny tiny letters.) And so then I thought, "Well, I don't buy anything from Thailand so I should be ok."<br /><br />I'm usually not that squeemish - my father was in the meat production business - first as a buyer, then as a USDA live animal inspector and I also spent quite a few years of my childhood on or around farms.  I get the ranch/stockyard/processing plant connection - I've seen it up close and personal.  But then I remembered that Phillips Crab, the makers of the Maryland cakes with restaurants and food processing - which originally came from the Chesapeake Bay - was now processing blue crabs "farmed" in Asia.  And it seems that often tilapia in the market comes from Asia.  Now I'm wondering what else is from there - and more importantly - how do they handle their food production that's for the US market.<br /><br />Bottom line - Weruva's great for cats and they love it, but perhaps we need more information on our how our own foods are handled.

review/summary: GREAT GRAIN FREE OPTION
review/text: After MUCH research and two complete urinary tract blockages we discovered that our cat SHOULD NOT be eating grain. Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market. Manufacturers like to insert grain into pet food to their reduce cost and create inexpensive calories. Grain causes alkaline urine in both cats and dogs. Alkaline urine leads to crystals and bladder stones and develops when an animal eats pet food with grains and fillers (high carb diet). Our pets need only meat, organs and water for proper nutrition and you are not "spoiling" your pet by feeding them an all wet food diet. Kidney failure is one of the most common diseases in cats and I have learned that I'm putting unnecessary strain my cat's kidneys by feeding him crap food. I purchased 8-10 grain free options for my cat to try out because it's very difficult to get an animal to change their diet once established. Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken was a clear winner with my cat Otis and I highly recommend it. If you think you can't afford a grain free diet for your kitty, please consider the $4,000 I have spent unblocking my cat's urinary tract when crystals formed (emergency procedure). Also, be wary of so-called prescription diets that the vets insist will remedy the problem, they are also full of grains and fillers.

review/summary: It Used To Be Better...
review/text: My cat is a picky eater, and loves his chicken. So Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken has been a huge hit with Hercules for the past year or so. That is, until the last two cases. I've been noticing that it looks a little grey, and not so much like freshly cooked chicken. Then I realized that I was throwing out about 1/3 to 1/4 of each serving, something that never happened before. Then I happened to compare an older can with one of the newer ones: Bingo! While the ingredients are the same, it looks like the amount of potato starch has been vastly increased. And the cat doesn't really like it as much.

review/summary: Real Quality Nutrition
review/text: I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food.<br /><br />At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food.

review/summary: 5 paws up! Expensive but worth every single penny
review/text: I lost 2 cats from kidney disease (most likely caused by melamine-tained cat food in 2007-8). When I got my new fur-baby, I swore it would never happen again.<br /><br />While there are several promising options that provide excellent feline nutrition AND meet mama's exacting standards, the part I hadn't factored in was having a picky cat. Most canned food has a pate-like texture... which she won't touch. There are a few sliced/chunks in gravy options... she licks up the gravy and leaves the rest.<br /><br />Weruva, however, she gobbles right up. Licks the plate clean - even the flavors with peas and other veggies.  I'm super impressed with this food - it meets my standards for food safety (grain free; human-grade; no yucky additives for color/odor/flavor; free range; hormone/antibiotic free, etc.) AND the darned cat will actually eat it.<br /><br />A few bonus features for this food:<br />- It's the only canned cat food I've found that doesn't make me gag when I open the can. Looks appetizing, like you've opened a can of progresso or something.<br />- Pleasant to non-existent odor when I open the can, spoon the food onto a plate, etc. My small apartment appreciates this!<br />- If any shreds remain on the plate, doesn't gross me out to wash with the same sponge I use on my own dishes.<br />- The... err.. end results in the litter box are also nearly non-existent as far as odor goes. My small apartment definitely appreciates this!<br /><br />I haven't tried her on any of the fish flavors (I can't stand the smell of fish at all and I'm not a fan of the Menadione that must be added to fish-based cat food), but here's my cat's expert opinion on the flavors she has tried:<br /><br />Paw Lickin' Chicken: Just plain and simple, shredded chicken breast in a light clear gravy.  I think this is the one she gets least excited about, so I don't feed it too often.<br /><br />Grandma's Chicken Soup: One of her favorites. This flavor tends to have much more liquid and less meat than the others so I wouldn't use it as a primary food. However, I like to rotate this one regularly and feed it more often in warmer weather to ensure she's getting enough moisture. Also contains peas, carrots, & pumpkin.<br /><br />Funky Chunky: Probably her 2nd favorite. Similar to Grandma's Chicken Soup, but much less broth/gravy and much more meat. This one also has peas, carrots, pumpkin, and the shreds of meat are larger.<br /><br />Nine Liver: Her 3rd favorite, which surprised me. Shredded chicken breast and chicken liver, no veggies. The liver pieces are actually fairly small tidbits, not huge chunks like they look to be in the photos.<br /><br />Green Eggs and Chicken: Shredded chicken breast, peas, spinach, and little bits of egg. She isn't as fond of this one, so I've stopped buying this flavor. Pretty sure it's the egg she doesn't like, as she does like another flavor that contains spinach.<br /><br />Peking Ducken: By far, her favorite. Shredded chicken breast, small tidbits of duck breast, pumpkin. I was quite surprised by how much she loved this flavor -especially since I only bought the first can of Peking Ducken on a  whim. (It would be one of the more expensive flavors!)<br /><br />On the Cat Wok: Another favorite. This one has shredded chicken breast and shredded beef, with pumpkin.<br /><br />Steak Frites: Shredded beef, sweet potato, & pumpkin. She prefers "On the Cat Wok" so I think she's not as fond of beef, but she's content to eat this flavor about once a week.<br /><br />I serve Grandma's Chicken Soup, Funky Chunk, 9 Liver, and Peking Ducken in heavy rotation, tossing in the occasional can of On the Cat Wok, Steak Frites, and Paw Lickin' Chicken.<br /><br />If your cat is extremely picky, I suggest trying Paw Lickin' Chicken.  If you feed fish, I've heard that Mack & Jack is the kind cats like the most.

review/summary: Chicken Soup for the Cat's Soul
review/text: Although my cat is not a finicky eater, he really loves Weruva's Grandma's Chicken Soup! Because I need to get more liquid into his diet (he has been diagnosed with struvite crystals and needs to ingest more liquid), this soupy food is the perfect way to do that. And finally, I like this cat food because it is "real" food, not chopped up by-products like many cat foods. As a result of feeding my best furry guy this food, he has had fewer digestive problems and no urinary issues.

review/summary: Particular Puss Loves this Food!
review/text: So, I have a HUGE cat (not fat, just laaarge) who has never had issues with being choosy about cat food until this past year. She'd kind of pick at a food for a week or so, then just completely stop. Getting her to eat consistantly has been a huge battle, and I've been worried because she's been losing weight which is not good on her gigantic Maine Coon self.<br /><br />I don't have much money, but finally did the math and figured out that buying cheaper food and then throwing half of it away wasn't saving me anything...invested in the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken cat food. It came a few days ago, and I think the year of struggling to find something Beatrix will eat is finally over. She LOVES this food. She's taken to lounging by the bowl and casting pitiful looks of longing at me whenever its not on hand! lol She's happy, so I'm happy. And its no lie that this is human quality food. I haven't actually eaten any of it, cause...well...yuck, but it looks like better quality than the chicken you get at KFC! lol Plus, and this is big because I live in a small apartment...there is almost NO odor to it like most wet cat foods...just smells slightly chickeny.<br /><br />I've also noticed that her tummy seems to be bothering her less if the litter and furball issues are a good indicator. Good food = happy cat. Give it a whirl.

review/summary: The best cat food out there
review/text: I got my cats on this food after I found one of them urinating blood and refusing to use the litterbox.  The vet told me he didn't have crystals, and after two visits they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.  They wanted me to put him on the Hill's Science Diet for urinary health, but I read the ingredients, which include by-products and rice, and decided to do my own research to find a better quality cat food.  I can't sing the praises of this food loud enough.  My cat is no longer straining to urinate, or going outside the box.  I have yet to find a variety either of my kitties don't like.  Just be cautious, if you are looking for a grain free food (which all felines should eat), Weruva does have a couple varieties that contain rice.

review/summary: Getting away from Weruva may have saved my cat's life.
review/text: I started feeding my 17-year-old cat Weruva a little over a year ago when she got bored with her old food. She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling "Give it to me NOW" like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet.<br /><br />Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order.  At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem.<br /><br />A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy).  When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet.<br /><br />Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet. But given the whole timeline, I simply cannot believe Weruva wasn't the biggest factor.<br /><br />Weruva because weluvya? Don't think so!

On opening I was surprised  how much like human  food it looked and smelled and was sure she would love it. Well, one sniff and she looked at me as if I were  nuts. My other more finky cat likewise.  I tried  again a few weeks later with the same results.<br />I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste.  His cat had the same results.  No deal.  He  then put some out for  four ferral cats  he was feeding . NO takers.  It is hard to believe that not one  of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..<br />I would not try this food unless youi needed some cans to hold up a bookcase.<br />If looking for a premium chicken try Instinct. A bit pricy but my cats love it. I also learned not to fix a good thing.  Cats are not like  humans and don't seem to mind the same food everyday.

review/text: The food was rotten/old. Not sure if that's amazons fault but thank god they gave me a refund. It smelled absolutely horrible. I tried to give her a can, or let her 'sniff' it, that looked and smelled normal and she looked at me like I was crazy. I would say almost clawed my eyeball out. I would've never let her actually eat it but I heard cats can smell CRAP food. Maybe I was just unlucky but based on that I'm never purchasing this crap again.

review/text: The photo presented by a reviewer convinced me to buy this product. My cats are very picky and only like pure products: chicken, salmon, with nothing in it. I thought it would be a pure chicken product with lots of liquid, which my cats LOVE..... However,  although it is a moist product, I think the can adds a taste that makes my cats dislike it. It is less costly and more environmentally friendly product than the fancy feast Appetizers that are in individual plastic servings but not of the same quality.

review/summary: Beware of the variety you buy
review/text: Cats are obligate carnivores.  They should eat 97%+ meat.  A lot of Weruva varieties are packed with veggies.  Veggies aren't good for cats.  Grains aren't good for your cat.  Knowledgeable cat nutrition friends think the Paw licking chicken is fine and their cats love it.  My cats and I hate the veggie-containing varieties they tried.  Look closely at the label before you buy.

review/summary: Best Canned Cat Food!!!
review/text: My cat is EXTREMELY picky... Late last year, I decided to switch both her canned food and kibble. I spent tons of money on "samples" of canned foods for her and I ended up wasting so much money. She didn't like anything I put in front of her. I was online one night and happened to stumble upon Weruva. I did my research and not only was I blown away at how awesome the quality of the food is but also the story behind the company. All of the meats are cruelty free as well which is a big plus for myself and my husband! Amazon has the best price anywhere and I love the free shipping! :-) I have also been feeding her Orijen kibble. Considering the quality of both of these products, you can't beat the price!

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This is the third flavor of this brand we tried and it, like the other two, have been a huge hit with our cat. We follow a primarily raw food diet for him and sometimes get cans as a treat (or if we get a little lazy). This brand is high quality and really does seem safe for human consumption. Amazon offers an amazing deal so we're back to stock up before the cost goes up. Delivery was a dream, as usual. For less than twenty cents more per can than some horrible by-product laden generic cat food, our little beast (and we) are satisfied. Marbella Paella was a huge hit!

review/summary: Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat)
review/text: When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: "feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.  I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie.

review/summary: The BEST food my cat has ever eaten
review/text: I cannot stress enough what a picky eater my cat is. Just to get her to eat more than a quarter of a 5.5 oz can of food at a time is quite the ordeal. For some time, I had to mix Nutri-cal with her food, because she is tiny for her age and isn't gaining weight at the rate she should be (she is a kitten). I was just about to settle with Earthborn Holistic canned chicken, as she seemed to like it more than any other food I had tried feeding her. It also appeared and smelled far less disgusting to me than the mush that comes in most cans; the consistency of the Earthborn is chicken shreds in gravy, which my cat seems to prefer. But as I was browsing in the cat food section today, I noticed Weruva Paw-lickin Chicken and picked it up to try because according to the description, it seemed that it would have the same consistency as Earthborn. It's also Grain-free and has no veggies (only this flavor is veggie free though) like Earthborn. And it costs the same, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult financially to switch over to Weruva, if she happens to like it.<br /><br />When I opened the can of Weruva today, I immediately noticed that the quality of this food is even better than Earthborn. The formula is almost soupy, with thinner shreds, which are easier for my kitten to chew and swallow. The smell is VERY tolerable and it actually looks like food a human would eat. The BEST part however is that she ate almost ALL of the 3 oz can. I was so shocked to see that once she was done eating what I spooned into her bowl, she went over the open can and began eating.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned initially when I noticed that even though the food is not described as adult food, in the back in small print it says it is for adult nutrition. However, according to Weruva's website, it is fine to feed it to kittens. The only difference between adult food and kitten food apparently, is that kitten food is supposed to contain more protein, because they need more for their growing bodies. But if fed a sufficient amount, this food, especially because it is very protein rich to begin with, provides complete nutrition for kittens as well. Seeing how much she ate confirms that.<br /><br />My only concern with this food, which is any person's concern with any premium quality food is the price. These foods ARE pricey and it can be difficult to justify spending so much on cat food, but if you can afford it, the benefits of premium quality foods (those that are byproduct and grain free, and preferably veggie free) are:<br /><br />-Their poop becomes significantly less stinky. The difference is very noticeable.<br />-The food itself doesn't smell so bad. And this really depends on what type of meat and consistency you buy as well. If you buy a chicken or turkey flavor food, it will be less smelly than a fish food. I don't see the point in feeding your cat fish other than as an occassional treat if she likes it, because it contains some levels of mercury and is not as nutritious to begin with. I've noticed that the mushy formula food smells considerably worse than the gravy foods. Also, I understand that cat foods are smelly because cats will only eat food that has a very strong smell, but that being said, there's a difference between a stench that permeates your room and a smell that remains concentrated in the general area where the food itself is.<br />-You end up saving money on vet bills, because these foods provide superior nutrition and a healthy animal is less likely to be a sickly animal.

review/summary: Very high quality cat food
review/text: We have a cat that develops urinary stones easily, and must also be on a low purine diet.  The Science Diet food suggested by the vet resulted in dull, dry coats, vomiting, and lethargic behavior, even after a lenghty adjustment period.<br /><br />Weruva foods to the rescue!  Their Paw Lickin' Chicken, Grandma's Chicken Soup, and Peking Duck flavors meet our dietary needs perfectly, with much healthier, higher quality ingredients than the SD food.<br /><br />These are very "soupy" foods, with lots of liquid in the can, ideal for cats who may not stay well hydrated otherwise.  I was afraid that our cats would not eat the vegetable chunks, but they surprised me by not only eating them, but picking them out to eat first!<br /><br />The shredded chicken seems to be very high quality but the texture seems a little hard for them to manage sometimes.  At first, they sometimes left chicken on the plate.  Now, they seem more used to it and eat it more easily.<br /><br />After trying a number of different high end canned products, these are our cats' favorites, paws down! After several months on the food, they seem very healthy, with shiny coats, healthy-looking eyes, and lots of energy.

review/text: I should have known better than to take a chance on a new cat food bought over the internet. Sophie (my cat)just gobbles up every bit of sauce and leaves all the chicken in the bowl. When I tried to cut up or mash the chicken I realized just how dry and tough it is and don't much blame her for not wanting to deal with it. You just never know if a cat is going to like something or not.

review/summary: Green Eggs & Chicken, 3 Paws Up (includes a 17 yo and 7 yo picky Debutantes). Great Human Grade Cat Food Experience
review/text: During the cat food recalls of 2007, I became aware that the dry food I always fed my cats was not a good diet. In fact - at the time - I prided myself on feeding cats @ $8.00 a month.  Luckily, this Generic was not using the Gluten that was the cause of the Recalls.  After trying various tastes, my budget and cats decided on Holistic (use to be Eagle Pack Holistic) Chicken dry and Wellness Chicken Grain Free.<br /><br />Then, we had a problem with the Wellness Canned Cat Food Recently (it was pulled from Amazon - and now my Canned Chicken food doesn't show up in a review).  I then went to the Wellpet site, and noticed mostly dry food was offered from many online retailers.  THIS told me something was afoot - and I went back to the forum which helped me with cat food research.  Unfortunately, many folks had gone back to fish as a main part of their cats food.  However, they did bring up the rotation aspect - this means never feeding the same type of cat food concurrently, and also picking up some locally first, to make sure your cats will eat the darn thing.<br /><br />Locally, Chicken was the least affected of the Wellness foods, and the store I get it from, Wellness is manufactured at ANI (code begins MW).  This means I could also get a food that was produced at Menu/Simmons.  However, Weruva was raved about in the forums, so without knowing where it was manufactured - I gave a few cans a shot (Green Eggs & Chicken was the first flavor I read - so that is what I tried).  All cats slopped that food right up with no ill effects (Siberia is a 13 yo with sensi tummy issues, and there were none with this food - even after he gulped it up).<br /><br />I then looked up Weruva on the Internet, and found out it was manufactured in Thailand.  This first gave me pause, but they do guarantee Human Grade Food, and the food in the cans look quite edible (and no, I'm not eating it - but in an emergency ;-).<br /><br />Amazon has a better deal on this food than my local retailer. So my order for the cans went in (I had read some negative reviews here about the quality of the food, but with the Amazon Guarantee - how can you go wrong?)  I am pleased to announce that the food received from Amazon looked and tasted (according to the cats), as good as that purchased locally.  So for Weruva, Amazon has my business.<br /><br />With rotation, you can circumvent the cost of Weruva in a multi-cat household, AND being on a fixed income, through rotating.  I've settled on four canned food varieties, and one dry food (I may also be inclined to try some Weruva Paw Licken' Chicken, but for now - I have plenty of food).  The cost for multi-cat households is also offset by buying the larger canned varieties - 12.5oz to 13oz, and learning how to store them in the Refrigerator.<br /><br />On Amazon, I recommend the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />A side note, many supplement with Friskies canned in order to cut costs.  I personally have yet to get over the meat by-product thing.  However, if it would help your budget - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is THE best one to use for this purpose (no glutens).<br /><br />3 paws up for Weruva.

review/summary: Best Kitty Food Money Can Buy!
review/text: Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule. Anyway, the only flavor she goes absolutely nuts over is the Polynesian BBQ! She will go on hunger strikes if I don't have that flavor around. I don't know what they put in this flavor (crack? =)) to make Layla go nuts, but it's all she wants and now I'm forced to keep buying it.<br /><br />If you have a cat that has problems eating or is malnourished/anorexic (like Layla was), you would be hard-pressed to find food as high quality and apparently tasty as Weruva. My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I'm not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?<br /><br />Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother's chicken soup. They are similar in price to other "luxury" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior. You aren't losing anything, and you may end up with a very happy cat =).<br /><br />EDIT: Layla had to stop taking her methimazole due to side effects, and while we were working with her vet for other options, her stooling and over-urination (polyuria) have normalized. ! I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities. AND on a side note,  when I received Layla, her hair was like matted wire that fell out with just petting; now it is getting silky, and without those pesky oily parts (you know, behind the front legs?). She is really becoming quite beautiful.

My female cat wouldn't even eat wellness, so I thought this might be right up their alley. The second I opened the can they were intrigued. I've never seen them eat their food so fast! Even my female (who I usually have to go get and put in front of her food) was sitting there crying for her dinner that day. I've never seen her eat so fast and be so happy about it. This is also considerably cheaper than wellness (about ten dollars less) which is awesome.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cat food!<br />I was especially impressed by the fact that the cans are BPA free and contain no chemicals. That isn't even the case for many organic human food brands, so I'm impressed.

review/text: I recently changed over from dry to wet food for my cats.  Trying to find a grain, veggie and fruit free food is not easy, cats are obligate carnivores remember and don't need that stuff (do the research).  I thought I found it in this chicken product.  However, when I opened the can I noticed lots of fluid and potato starch. After spilling out the liquid and rinsing off the potato starch (why is that there anyway? A filler?) The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same. I just want the company to know if they say its 5.5 oz. then don't pump it up with junk to save a few pennies.  Consumers are not stupid.

review/text: I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small "made in Thailand" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)

review/text: My cat LOVES this food and immediately begins eating as soon as I put it down.  The Nine Liver is her favorite flavor.  The liver chunks are not as large as pictured, and they seem to sink to the bottom of the can - just make sure to stir.  She likes many of the other Weruva flavors, including Green Eggs & Chicken, Paw Lickin Chicken, Funky Chunky, and Mediterranean Harvest.  These varieties have lots of gravy, while most of the other flavors are a bit less juicy.<br /><br />The order from Amazon arrived on time and there were no problems with the packaging.  The exterior Amazon box held another sealed box containing the case of food.  All the cans were in perfect condition.<br /><br />My cat only eats grain-free, wet food, and I'm glad I found Weruva to add to her rotation. Great food, highly recommended.  I'll be buying more!

review/summary: Weruva Paw-Lickin' Chicken
review/text: A 5 star must have canned act food for the discerning cat lover!! A proper feline diet should be void of dry cat food and most important is a quality ingredient wet cat food(if you cannot feed a raw diet) and I believe there is no better product than this!! Cats seem to absolutely love it, and it smells and looks just like freshly cooked chicken - which it is!! It is great for their urinary tract, and there are many interesting choices of Weruva to satisfy your cat's culinary diversity.  I cannot say enough about this product. My 3 month old kitten was not gaining weight, and  my veterinarian and I were very concerned. He had simply lost his appetite and was not gaining an ounce over 3lbs although I purchased so many different premium foods to entice him! When I was told about Weruva and first gave it a try, my kitten regained his zest for eating and immediately gained weight and is the most beautiful cat you would ever see!! He is 6 months old now and close to ten pounds!! He comes running the minute I open the Weruva stocked cabinet. It was a godsend & you can see the quality in every single can that you open!!

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken 5.5 Oz. Can (24 Pack)
review/text: We purchased the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken after adding a new kitten to our family. After shelter and vet food recommendations, we had upgraded to the shelter's all-natural healthy brand but the cats much preferred the junk from the grocery store and the senior cat rejected the natural food. After reading many reviews, We tried this brand and flavor. My partner was concerned our picky senior cat would not eat it either, but all three love it. We have also tried the Weruva Middle East Feast, which all will eat, but Paw Lickin' Chicken is the favorite so far.<br /><br />We will be trying other flavors and are also trying some Best Feline Friend varieties. BFF is a bit cheaper than these Weruva standard brand foos, and while they seem to like the one we tried so far (Tuna and Bonito Be Mine), the chicken is still tops. All of these look and smell so good, I could certainly see eating this in an emergency - it is certainly as good or better than the canned chicken at the grocer. My partner no longer turns up his nose when feeding the cats wet food.<br /><br />The 5.5 ounce can size is great for us, with two cats sharing a can twice a day on top of two small dry food feedings per day.

review/summary: Finally might wean my cat off Fancy Feast
review/text: The first morning I set this down for my cat she gobbled up nearly two of the three ounce cans.  With subsequent feedings  her zeal has waned but she does manage to eat one can every morning, in do-able doses.  Then she gets her beloved Fancy Feast in the evening.  I want very much to get Fancy Feast out of the cycle because even though the classic recipes contain no grains, it does contain by-products and also fish and my cat has a fish allergy.  This Weruva chicken is wonderful stuff.  All white meat with vitamins and minerals in a bit of sauce.  Even comes in a BPA-free can.  There is zero stench, something I certainly can not say about Fancy Feast.  I am hoping she will continue to eat this product each morning for now because at least I'm cutting the amount of Fancy Feast down by half.  I plan to use up the Fancy Feast on hand in this way and ease her over to all Weruva.  Now an update - several weeks into the new feeding regime and my cat is happily eating up a three ounce can of this food every morning.  Without hesitation too!  I am so happy to have found a quality canned cat food that my sweetie loves.  Something I am enjoying is not having to break apart and chop up a semi-solid mass of pate style cat food.  This Weruva recipe comes out of the can ready to eat, I just remove the lid and pour the contents into a bowl.  I hope Amazon will add this product to their Subscribe and Save program.

review/text: Excellent cat food that is recognizable as a food. (I find that it looks and smells a lot better than some of the canned stuff that *I* eat.) I highly recommend it.<br />If you have a cat with a grain allergy like I do, a number of the Weruva flavors are completely grain free. The ones that aren't only use rice.

review/text: I love that this is grain free and such high quality.  I also love that my cats get excited when they see the can (this did not happen for the prior food) and that they eat every single bit.  As you can tell from the picture this has much more texture than a pate food but is not huge chunks so it is still easy to eat.

review/summary: Weruva Polynesian BBQ Cat Food - Rosie Likes It
review/text: Although rather expensive, this is a quality cat food. It looks like the fish that it is made from, and our cat Rosie loves it. It appears that they put a little bit of the outside of the fish in each can as a treat. This cat food seems to be made at a higher standard than most - the food in the can could be for human consumption. Anyway, I can highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality cat food.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: The Monster just loves it, he literally licks the bowl clean.  It's real meat, no "parts" or junk nor does it have any grain.  So I'm very happy with switching over to this food.  I was feeding him Natures Variety but was adjectivally looking for a replacement since a lot of their food comes from China.  I'm so glad I found this food, very healthy and not made in China by the slave labor in the Laogai or chemicalsantifreeze, etc. that finds its way into the food.<br /><br />I knocked it down 1 star due to the amount of liquid, which is actually good since Cats get their water from food in the wild.  I just think it's a bit too much, but I'm sticking with it because it's real meat, very healthy and the Monster just loves it.

review/summary: not the best for my cat
review/text: I got this for my cat, thinking it was 'human grade', grain free, hence good for my cat. I realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food.<br />It may be great for some cats, but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and I was feeding her much less than suggested. She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it.

review/text: I got this product about a month ago to try it for the first time.  My cat and I were pleased so I got 24 more... what a mistake.. where is the meat???  There is more liquid than meat.  At least 2/3 liquid and a few slivers of chicken.  My cat is seriously crying right now and tapping me on the leg begging for food which usually she just curls up and goes to sleep for awhile after eating. I had to get another brand that I have for emergencies in case food does not arrive on time. I need to have a serious talk with Amazon over this.

review/summary: Mideast Feast is a life saver for my siamese with kidney trouble
review/text: Recently switched from feeding friskies for the past 15 years because one of my siamese was having kidney problems. Tried a lot of different higher end brand cat foods, Wellness, Evo, Nutro. He was picky about almost all of them except for the Weruva Mideast feast. He loves human tuna out of a can and comes running for it so I thought he might like it. Turns out even my other finicky siamese who has refused to eat anything but dry food his entire life will eat this! All four of my cats eat this like it's the best food ever. The only problem with that is I go through it so fast! The best thing though is that it has greatly improved my cat's kidney function and because of that is worth every penny to me. I will never go back to friskies and their corn and grain again. It was killing my cat.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that amazon has the best price on this food from everywhere else I've searched which is wonderful! Everywhere else charges 5 or 6 dollars more plus 10 dollars shipping. With amazon I get free 2 day shipping and a much better price. Thank you amazon.

review/summary: My Cats say, "We-Ruv-Ya!"
review/text: We have older cats with one having hyperthyroidism. Even on meds, cats with this condition tend to throw up more than normal so they need more protein and liquid. I didn't feel like she was retaining the nutrients she needed as she kept throwing up much of her food.<br /><br />I did alot of research before trying this food. The Vet recommended some type of prescription diet for her to help her put some pounds on, but it's got grain and fillers in it (yuk). Plus we tried it once and she hates it so there ya go.<br /><br />So, I cut down on the dry food and have been giving them the Weruva pouches w/Chicken & Pumpkin and the Paw Lickin' Chicken. It's been 2 1/2 weeks and our hyperthyroid cat has only had one incident which was an extremely small hairball so no biggie. Now, I'm not saying that this food is a miracle cure or anything like that. But our cats are getting more real food, gravy, and no by-products, and the hyperthyroid cat's fur looks TONS better and she's even filled out a little. I've even stopped giving her the Fortiflora this past week...no throw up so just haven't needed it. All of us couldn't be happier!<br /><br />The chicken is both of our babies favorites, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I could just wipe off their empty bowls with a paper towel. There's just nothing there when they walk away!<br /><br />Yes, it's more expensive. But I can't wait until we go to the Vet in 6 months and he asks me what we've been giving her to help her gain a little weight and keep her looking so good.<br /><br />Oh you know I'll be shouting it out, "We-ROOO-VAH!"

review/summary: cat goes crazy for this
review/text: my cat is almost 10 years old now and I started thinking more about what I feed her.  Admittedly I should have paid more attention to this years ago but believe it or not, until recently, I just thought pet food was pet food.  Gizmo had a bladder infection a year or so ago and after learning that kidney disease is a common and deadly disease for cats, I wanted to see if switching foods would help her ward that off so she can live another happy 10 years or more.  I did research and read all about how dry food and grains is unhealthy for cats and mainly filled with undigestible ingredients.  Grains in the food cause crystals to form in the urine as the cats body tries to process them.  Higher protein foods, grain free and with a higher moisture content are what is best.  I read all the reviews here and decided to try this paw licking chicken flavor.  For starters it doesn't have that gross smell most canned cat foods do.  It seems close to human grade to me.  From the first try of this Gizmo was hooked.  Now she cries for it, rubs around me, sometimes even gets wild if I am ignoring her and jumps up onto the counter to get my attention that she wants to be fed.  After buying 2 cases on here, I decided to try some regular store bought canned food.  I just thought this may be a bit pricey to maintain and she was going through it like crazy.  I tried several different brands from Petco and several from the supermarket.  I tried to get as close to this flavor as possible with shredded chicken flavors and none of that pate stuff.  Nothing!  She will not eat a single other brand now.  She cries and cries and if I set down something different she will sniff it and walk away.  I tried being stubborn and said, well if you are hungry enough you will eat eventually.  Well she won because she actually started to lose weight.  It was incredible.  This 6lb cat won by starving herself.  So I ordered more and she is eating and happy again.  If it makes her happy and it's healthier than all the dried grain filled junk I fed her for years then I will continue to buy it

review/text: My cat inhales this food, he absolutely loves it.  In addition, because he licks the bowl clean there is never any bits of food left that has to be scraped off the plate.  Also, since it smells like canned chicken it does not give him funky cat food breath and mi gato is a face licker so this is a plus.  Only downfall is cost, at his weight he would need four cans a day which is quite expensive so I feed him a mix of no grain dried food and the Weruva canned.

review/summary: My Cat, Puppy, is a very happy customer!
review/text: I decided to re-write my review in order to let you guys in on how my cat's been doing on the Waruva cat food.<br /><br />We decided to try pretty much every flavor on here because I couldn't find any really good specific reviews for anything other than one or two flavors, here's how my cats liked the following:<br /><br />Paw Lickin Chicken- This is one of the favorites with both cats, although my male cat, Puppy, has a harder time eating it unless I put it on a flat plate, he can't seem to get it all while in the bowl. However, my female cat, Akira, has NO issues with it at all.<br /><br />Grandma's Chicken Soup- An epic fail for Puppy. He hates it, and refuses to eat it. I don't know if it's because of how liquidy it is, or if there's a smell he isn't so into... but he hates it.  Akira loves it and can't get enough... not sure how helpful this is, but I can say that if your cat prefers to lick their food instead of biting at it, you probably won't have a lot of success with this one, because Puppy licks his food and Akira bites hers.<br /><br />Polynesian BBQ - my least favorite of all the waruva products. It smells really strongly of fish (yuck) and is congealed... it's like jello. I have to fork it out of the can and mash it up in order to get Puppy to eat this.<br /><br />Peking Duckin was an overall success with both cats<br /><br />The Eggs and Chicken - Puppy would not eat the peas but Akira would (although she had some diarrhea after this.. but I think the eggs may be the culprit).<br /><br />Steak Frites- was hands down the favorite for both cats. It also contains pumpkin so I prefer to give it to Akira since she seems to have more issues with getting the runs.<br /><br />Those were the notable of the flavors our cats have tried. I hope this is somewhat helpful to you. Overall I recommend going with paw lickin chicken and steak frites.

review/summary: High quality, and the picky kitty eats it
review/text: Mideast Feast has been a boon to my elderly cat with chronic kidney failure.  He is not on a special kidney diet, and your vet's recommendations may vary, but our goal is to keep him from getting any skinnier.  He's sampled all the special kidney foods and won't eat them, so he gets any regular food he will eat.<br /><br />There are some days when he gets cranky and picky and won't eat much... this is our go-to food for those days as we can almost always count on him to eat this.  The other non-ill cats like it too.  The first ingredient is tuna with tilapia close behind so these must have compelling flavors.<br /><br />All the cats initially liked it, but over time slowed down.  It seems like it's about the chunky texture.  If I whirr this thru my little handy chopper for a few seconds, they finish it off pronto.<br /><br />The only negative is one in my own head... I get irritated with cat foods trumpeting "grain free" and then tossing in tapioca starch or potato starch... yeah, those aren't grains, but if a cat owner is looking to limit carbs to some extent, the "grain free" tag can be a little misinterpreted as "low starch".  Beyond that though, the skinny old cat is eating it gladly, so I won't complain further.  This flavor appeals to all my cats (it's a rarity to reach a group agreement) so odds are decent your cat will enjoy it too!

review/summary: Good for cats with bowel/stomach issues
review/text: My 9 year old cat has had chronic colitis and now inflammatory bowel disease. He has been on steroids, Rx diets, anti-nausea, antacids, etc, etc, etc.  After much research I decided to put him on a wet diet - dry kibble no matter how high quality just doesn't seem to cut it for IBD kitties.  In fact, it just aggrevates the situation. After much trial and error of different higher quality cat foods, Weruva seems to be the answer.  His formerly slushy *nasty* poo is now normal looking cat poop!  Who knew I could think his poo is now just so beautiful... I digress.  He is OFF all meds.  He was picky about what he would eat but we've found that he loves the Weruva brands - He gets Paw Lickin Chicken every night.  The only thing I add to his food is a good probiotic.  I am so pleased with this product.  Not only does he love it but it by far looks the best - you can see the quality of this food, it is not unidentifiable mush.  As a side note to this review, he loves the Steak Frites as well made by Weruva.

review/text: Just introduced to the Weruva line by a friend, and am very impressed by the high-quality ingredients.  My nine kitties approve as well - four paws up!  When opening the paw-lickin' chicken cans, it smells and looks good enough to eat myself, really.  The gang loves the broth and eats all the meat until it's gone.  Sure it's a little pricier than other brands, but you get what you pay for.  Highly recommended.

We've tried other canned foods just to mix it up for them, but nothing makes them happier than this chicken.

review/summary: Human-grade ingredients - Awesome!
review/text: This is amazing cat food and it's incredibly affordable. The company says that the ingredients are human-grade, which I think is wonderful. I don't like that there are so many ingredients (and some are questionable to me, as I don't know what they are without a bit of research - ex. dicalcium phosphate) but I think it's far superior to most cat food on the market. The ideal diet would be a cat's natural food or the raw food cat diet, but if you don't feed your cat that, this is a good cat food to choose. I think it's healthier than other brands and there are no grains!

review/text: I cannot find this product in Maine (in my area) and when I discovered that I could get it at Amazon with Free Super Saver Shipping, I pounced on the deal! Great prices on quality food and now both I and my family of cats are very well pleased! I searched for grain free due to my diabetic cat's dietary needs but he turned his nose up at any other brand I brought home.<br /><br />My cats prefer the Fish Flavors in Gravy, and rarely do they leave any on the plate like they used to with Fancy Feast. I'm sure the other flavors are great too but my cats just don't like them.

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken wet cat food
review/text: I have two diabetic senior cats in my brood and I try to make sure I feel them all the best quality food I can fit into my budget.  The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality.  The ingredients read like human-food, there are virtually no preservatives and it doesn't have that "cat food" smell.  The cats always lick off all of the "broth" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.<br /><br />My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have "grazing priviledges" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.

review/summary: Almost impossible to stop eating these! And yes, they are now 11 oz.
review/text: These are by far the best tasting macadamia nuts out of all the flavors Mauna Loa produces. Everyone I've given these to loves them. The dusting of garlic and onion is just right and so so tasty. Crunchy and delicious, they're really hard to resist. I've been popping them into my mouth by the handfuls. The only thing that makes me stop is realizing how much fat I'm taking in. Mac nuts, like all nuts, are high in fats and oil. There are 11 servings in here. Each serving is 220 calories (190 from fat). All the pieces are halves like the picture I uploaded to the product gallery. The bag reseals at the top and stands up vertically on its own.<br /><br />A note on the size of the bag: yes, it is now 11 oz, not 12. I bought a bag of it at Whaler's on Maui for $9.50, but I had to travel to Hawaii for that. There's another seller offering 2 bags for just a little more than this listing: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RSYXX0">Lowest price on Amazon for TWO bags----only $12.99 per bag....Mauna Loa Maui Onion and Garlic Hawaiian Macadamia Nuts 2-bag Purchase (2 Resealable 11 oz.

I decided to "splurge" on a bag of regular pretzels and gagged on them because of the amount of salt.  I had to throw away the bag.  I am sticking to these unsalted pretzels for as long as the company makes them.  I started having trouble finding them in local stores, so I was so excited to find them on Amazon and at a better price, too!!<br /><br />5/15 -- I was going to reorder again.  Wow -- the price has really gone up since I first ordered them and since my last order.  They are now about the price of getting them at the grocery store.  Hope the price goes back down soon.

review/summary: Perfect afternoon snack to help avoid a feeding frenzy
review/text: I love the fact that these pretzels come in 100 calorie packs. It is just the right amount for an afternoon snack. We have a bunch of pretzels, peanuts, almonds, etc. on a snack table at work. Around 2:30 every afternoon my resolve to stay away from the salty, filling (and fattening) yummy goodness on the table would start to wane. By 2:32 I would be coming up with reasons to hover around the snack table. By 2:40 I'd be covered in peanut shells, done with my feeding frenzy and figuring out how I was going to avert a repeat performance tomorrow. Then I found Snyder's of Hanover 100 Calorie packs. Seriously, folks, they are my saving grace. And they have just the right amount of salt. I thought 60 bags would be a ridiculous amount if pretzels to purchase, but it worked out great, they lasted a couple of months and I've already purchased another box.
