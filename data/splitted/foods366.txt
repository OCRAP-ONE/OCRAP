review/summary: Fabulous marmalade
review/text: For those of us who love bitter, strongly flavored jams and marmalade, this is the standard by which all others are judged. Incredible on toast or an English muffin in cold weather, it also is robust enough to be satisfying for a breakfast in the hot summer. I like the added flavor of the peel; those who don't will like the fine cut or the version without peel. This is not a marmalade for wimps.

review/summary: Takes me back to London
review/text: It's been a while since I visited England, but this taste brings it all back: the clipped speech, the full-bodied tea and the bitter, bitter marmalade. If you're looking for a mild, laid-back marmalade, this is not it. The color is seriously dark, and the flavor of the coarse-cut Seville oranges is intense.<br /><br />I wouldn't use this marmalade for baking sweet muffins, but it will grace a piece of toast with majesty and reward every bite. The label says this marmalade is for the mature palate of the connoisseur. That's probably so.

We love everything about Tillamook products, and have visited their creamery/factory in Oregon a few times.  It's worth the trip from Minnesota, just to get their ice cream cones.  We haven't found any Tillamook jerky in retail stores out here, so we will be ordering more.

review/text: Found these at a local 7-11 and fell in love with them immediately. Not quite to consistency of your standard jerky but there is just something about these that make them absolutely delicious. They came very fresh and easy to eat, not dry and chewy. They are just peppered enough and somewhat with a sweet taste as well. I am so glad I was able to find these at Amazon instead of having to go and take a trip to 7-11. I think once you get used to the consistency and not compare it to other jerkys you'll find these to be a tasty treat as well.

I started out with this jerky and the best thing about it was the large plastic cylindar it comes in...I can use it to store other beef jerky from jack links!<br /><br />The guys in the office (and myself) said the jerky has the feel of a big flat piece of plastic and is overly sweet. You do get a lot but its not exactly a good value given you are choking it down.<br /><br />I got Jack Link's beef jerky for the crew and they all gobbled it down (they ate the stuff starting at 10 AM...animals).  Their feedback was that jack links actually was a piece of meat versus whatever the heck Tillamook was made of.

I've tried many different brands and variates over the past few years and was never pleased until now. Finally a dark roast coffee at an affordable price! With Subscribe and Save, this coffee is the best deal around. It has a nice rich flavor and is strong. I have found that I use less grounds with this coffee than I have with other brands. Yuban dark roast has made this coffee snob very pleased. Both of my cans expire in August 2011 so freshness is not an issue.<br /><br />Second:<br /><br />Wow! Just went to order more and the price has really gone up! The last time I purchased it through subscribe and save it was close to $12 now it is almost $24! I'll be shopping around for a better price on coffee and  probably will get a different brand.

review/summary: Good coffee at a reasonable price
review/text: I like a rich dark roast coffee without bitterness. Before discovering Yuban Dark Roast, I was ordering expensive coffee from Gevalia and Peets, as I was unable to find coffee to my liking locally, even in our natural foods coop.  I tried Yuban Dark Roast on a whim when I noticed it on the supermarket shelf.  Even my husband commented on how good this coffee is.  I was glad to find the larger cans on Amazon, as purchasing this way makes it even more economical.

review/text: Ever since I learned that Yuban treats its Central and South American workers reasonably well I have bought this brand of coffee exclusively...just a small way to counter the horror I experienced in viewing a documentary on the topic of COFFEE.

review/text: We have been devoted Yuban drinkers for many years.  Recognizing that taste in coffee is an individual matter, we feel this is simply the best coffee you can buy.  It is a rich, flavorful coffee without the burned taste that often accompanies a dark roast.  It is even superior to most coffee shop beans.  The only other coffee that we have tried that comes close is Jamaican Blue Mountain at $20/pound.

review/text: I have been drinking the Maxwell House dark roast since it became available locally, here in Orlando.  Unfortunately Amazon doesn't sell the 33oz canisters of Maxwell House.  I decided to try the Yuban, and it's just as good.  I like my coffee brewed strong, and the Yuban is never bitter. Also it's a little cheaper to buy coffee on line and it's certainly more convienient.  As an after thought, the Yuban cans seem to seal tighter than the Maxwell house canisters.

review/text: We lived in Alaska for many years and all we drank was Yuban, we then moved back to the east coast and could not find it anywhere....yuck, had to drink other brands... Years later moved out to AZ, my husband is in the aviation field and we move a lot,we were so happy to have our beloved Yuban back in our cups once more. Most recently had to move back to the east coast for his job and we were so unhappy knowing we would not be able to find Yuban, but here it is on Amazon.... Awesome, we got it quickly and now we never have to be with out it ever again no matter where we live....thanks Amazon.

I like my coffee strong and rich tasting with a roasted flavor and McDonald's coffee was the best That I could find . But McDonalds only sells it by the cup and they will not sell it otherwise so I started trying different brands and Yuban is the only coffee that comes close to McDonalds coffee.

review/summary: Really strong stuff...
review/text: This coffee has a really strong roasted/burnt flavor to it. If you like typical non-gourmet morning coffee then you will like this; however, I have traveled down south, to countries like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, etc. and have tasted fresh roasted REAL coffee direct from the trees at the farm the very next day after a harvest. I prefer my coffee black, as-is, in other words I like to drink and taste my coffee rather than pour in a bunch of other crazy flavors.<br /><br />Real coffee roasted properly is fairly smooth anyway, with a strong taste of coffee bean and a hint of smoke, it is very pleasing. This coffee is more like bitter burnt charcoal, but here in the USA we tend to drink coffee to stay awake so this coffee does have it's purpose, the burnt bitter taste slapped my eyes wide-open from the very first sip so I stay lively at work with a spring in my step all day, but not to any extreme, for example, 4 cups in 10 minutes didn't give me the caffeine jitters. I'll have to look for something a little smoother to drink at home though or I'll never want to sleep at night.<br /><br />If you like green bean fresh roasted, gourmet, or exotic coffees stay away, this is not for you. If you like to fill your glass with milk and sugar, then give this a try, you'll have to pour in twice as much flavor filled fat and sugar to cover up the powerful taste of this stuff. If you sip coffee at work to stay awake this is a excellent choice because it is at least 2 times stronger than Folder's or Maxwell's dark roasts.

review/text: Yuban Dark Roast coffee is our family favorite.  It has a bolder but smooth taste.  I see less oil floating on my coffee with the Yuban.  This is another product I can't buy here in this area so Amazon.com came through for me on this one too.  The price is livable and it is delivered right to my door each month.  I've not run out of coffee since signing on with Amazon.com.  I'd read reviews that their coffee was old.  Not so for what we've been getting and we've been getting it for several months now maybe close to a year.  We love the Yuban Dark Roast and Amazon.com for price, ease of ordering and having it delivered right to my door each month.

review/text: We've been buying Yuban for the last 15 years. It was easy to get in Las Vegas, but moving to Pittsburgh has made it impossible to find. We must order from Amazon to keep our cupboards stocked. The price is fantastic when you find it on sale. Even at the Super Saver mailing we get it within a week. This rich, flavorful coffee is always a hit when we serve it. People around here have never heard about it - and they are really missing the boat. There's no better coffee around, including the $3.00 a cup on the corner. We will always enjoy it and hope others will too.

review/text: I wish they hadn't changed the formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their "original" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more.

review/summary: NOT a worthy Starbucks replacement! But OK.
review/text: STARBUCKS LOVERS - READ THE WHOLE THING!!<br />NOT EVERYONE WILL AGREE WITH MY REVIEW. There are a lot of 5 star reviews for this coffee. Hence - most of you will love this coffee.<br /><br />I'll start by saying that this coffee is OK. It will not please people like me who never had coffee before Starbucks came along. I am a Starbucks coffee snob. But it will please people who just want decent coffee. If you like Folger's, McDonalds, Bob Evans (I actually like Bob E's coffee a lot!), etc., you'll be fine with Yuban Dark Roast. If that sounds like you, BUY IT! It's a steal. No need to read any more of this review.<br /><br />IF YOU are a Starbucks addict and ARE LOOKING TO REPLACE HIGH END COFFEE - KEEP READING!<br /><br />I was hoping to find a good tasting canned coffee to save a few dollars and replace my Starbucks habit. This isn't it. I ordered it based on the many good reviews on Amazon, but the actual coffee does not reflect the ratings it has received on this site, at least for my taste. It tastes almost exactly like the Folgers we brew at the office everyday. I say "almost" because I would rate it one or two notches above the office coffee. I have to put cream and sugar in the office coffee to drink it, and this Yuban is no different for me. I may donate the rest of this to the office and see what everyone there says about it. I almost gave it 3 stars, but subjectively it's better than that... so I gave it 4 stars. My mother-in-law hates Starbucks, Caribou, etc.. I am going to brew some Yuban for her... I am confident she'll love it. She'll probably run out and buy some for her house. She's currenty a Folger's drinker. It's better than OK for most, but not for me. It has a bright, vinegary citrus like peak that borders on acidic. I was left with a lemon-like aftertaste, much like Folgers. The freshly opened can had a promising scent like Starbucks House Blend at first, but had a slight vinegar odor that came through. My wife said the same thing.<br /><br />Good for the price HOWEVER - IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HIGH END REPLACEMENT, KEEP LOOKING!<br /><br />Pros: A lot of coffee for the price. A smidgen better than Folgers.<br />CONS: 4 pounds of coffee for $20.00 is not going to taste like a 12 oz bag of Stabucks for $12.00... so don't expect too much.

review/text: The Decaf Dark Sumatra whole bean coffee is a medium dark roast (not a lot of oil present on the beans), very flavorful, smooth and low in acid.  We mix it with regular caffeinated coffee at home.  We drink a lot of coffee and the half and half blending helps us avoid the jitters.  Occasionally we also will do a pot of fully decaffeinated in the evenings to go with a dessert.  Since this is low in acid, it goes well with desserts without causing that occasional indigestion you get with rich food and a highly acidic coffee.  Some may prefer more bite in their morning cup.<br /><br />At this price, it's a bargain.

review/summary: GREAT TASTE EVEN MY DAUGHTER LOVES
review/text: Great for me and my young daughter.  When my daughter was just beginning to eat solid food, she reached for these that I was eating, and then kept asking for more.  And so she has eaten them almost daily all her life. Now at 6 yrs old, she could easily refuse to eat them but likes the taste!  About a year ago when my local health food store could not order enough product from the distributor and had to drop carrying them, I found them on Amazon. and voila! my daughter continues to eat this excellent food regularly.  I tried another flavored common brand but she did not like it. Since these are sold on Amazon only in packs of 6, you may want to try to buy one pack through a health food store first to try them for your taste.  But even if they are not your favorite, they are not a waste and well worth eating anyway.  I love them and my daughter loves them, and I love that.

review/summary: tasty, not too spicy
review/text: when you are in the mood for a snack but not really hungry, these nori strips almost melt on your tongue.  they are spicy but NOT too hot and you can make nori rolls with them, but they will be small.  very tasty alternative to chips without all the starch or the calories. I eat them all the time, oh, NO MSG, means no headaches.

review/text: With the price of coffee (as well as everything else) going up, this offer from Amazon at a lower price was great! This was not three jars, but rather was three packages of the product. I have been using Maxwell House instant coffee in jars for some time and I found the packaged product tasted the same as in the jar. For convenience, I just poured each package into one of my Maxwell House jars, which was a matching quantity, so it worked out very well.

review/summary: Miraculous
review/text: Two of my middle-aged cats have shown signs of stiffness in one of their hind legs. I decided to give them Cosequin, a highly recommended supplement for joint health in cats and dogs.<br /><br />One of my cats is a pig and will eat anything that's not nailed down, so I knew giving him the supplement would be a fairly easy process; however, the other cat is very picky and will only eat dry food (he's not even interested in cat treats), so I was concerned that giving him the Cosequin would be an impossible task.<br /><br />Enter Greenies Pill Pockets (chicken flavored). Skittles (the finicky cat) went nuts the second I introduced them. I stuck a capsule inside a Pill Pocket and he snarfed it down at top speed, then started looking for more. And it's been that way ever since. For the first time ever, my cats actually look forward to getting their medication every day! (In fact, the other two cats who aren't receiving medication try to sneak a Pill Pocket every now and then.)<br /><br />The only thing I would caution is that the pockets are fairly small. Cosequin capsules, for example, can be opened and sprinkled on food or into a pocket -- but it took about three pockets to hold one capsule's worth of powder. Thus, I've had to keep the capsule intact, pushing it through the pocket so that it sticks out on both ends. That said, my cats still inhale it like it's the best thing they've ever tasted.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all cat families. This product works miracles.

review/text: I recieved the product VERY quickly and felt I got a good deal, which was great, but the pill pockets inside the bags are very dry and difficult to work with. A little disappointing, since I know that the texture should be akin to Play-Dough, which makes it conducive to hiding pills in. Also, the packaging is actually different than what is pictured, which I expected.

review/summary: Pill Pockets make an unpleasant task much easier
review/text: Pill Pockets make the unpleasant task of having to think about your pet's illness much easier by taking the frustration out of giving medication.  Instead of having to use a piller to force a pill down their throat, they think they are getting a treat.  It works very well.  After having to use a piller on my cat for about a month, I woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream about a treat that could hold the pill in it.  I was ready to make at least a hundred thousand bucks.  Then I did a google search and it turns it already exists -- so I'm sending them my money instead.  Oh well...it's an excellent product.

review/summary: Pill Pockets - You'll Like Them
review/text: Designed to insert a pet's pill in the pocket. Squeeze or pinch the top of the pocket over and the pill is concealed from a pet in a treat. In fact, the treat is so soft and supple, you don't even have to put the pill in the pocket. You can just push the treat onto the pill and squeeze the rest of the treat material around the pill to hide it. Works well when hiding multiple pills that might not fit in the pocket. I buy the cat size for my small dog (4.5 lb), and she just loves them. Never has refused a pill hidden in one. I even use them empty as a treat!

review/text: I am allergic to corn, so eating marshmallows, candy, pecan pie etc. without being able to have corn syrup is a real problem.<p>The Lyle's Golden Syrup, which is made from cane sugar syrup, can be used as a substitute for corn syrup.  It doesn't taste quite the same, though very good.  So I think, if one calls the pecan pie made from Lyle's Golden Syrup sugar pecan pie, for instance, it will be very satisfying as its own thing instead of a substitute for pecan pie.<p>To me, it seems a little sweeter than corn syrup.

I'm sure this is not just an issue for Mariana but after opening 3 different bags, I couldn't get past the horrible smell and somehow when all the dried fruit is in one bag each fruit item almost taste the same.

review/summary: Convenient and Fruity
review/text: The piece of dried peach was overly dry, chewy, and unappetizing. Not wanting to waste a piece of fruit, I put it in an empty birdbath outside for the squirrels or birds. Serendipitously it rained that night, and the next morning I discovered a rehydrated peach with a totally different appearance and appeal. I've since learned that dehydrated fruit can be rehydrated by soaking it in hot water for a few minutes. It can even be hydrated with fruit juice for even more flavor.<br /><br />The Mariani mixed fruit is convenient for those who like having fruit on hand, but want to avoid the waste of fresh fruit going over-ripe before one gets around to eating it. It's a nice mix of fruit that all ends up having similar taste since the eclectic mix has been together in the close quarters of a bag for so long. My favorites in the mix are the dried apples and dried pears. Dried plums predominate in this Mariani product, but they are pretty good too.<br /><br />For best taste, put the opened bag in your refrigerator. Refrigeration ensures freshness and cuts down on the icky, sticky factor of the dried fruits.

I didn't like the apricots at all, they were huge and had some sort of grit on them that crunched my teeth when I bit in.<br /><br />A positive though is that everything was nice and soft - even though it's called dried fruit for a reason that doesn't mean I want petrified. Also all the pieces of fruit were larger than what I usually get, at least two bites per piece.

The price quoted $10.23 for shipping but when I got the email confirmation I was charged $26.49 to have it sent to an APO for a grand total of $47.00 for 4 bags of chips. 12.00 per bag of chips?????? Rediculous. I haven't even got them yet and unless every chip is unbroken this was a total waste of money. I'll go back to bugging the ex and get a suprise gift of candy for alot less. I know this is to rate an item but until they come up with rate a seller this will have to do.
