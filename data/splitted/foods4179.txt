review/summary: Wonderful Snack
review/text: Cracker Nuts are just Wonderful! I live on Guam right now, & these are produced in the Philippines. I'm moving back stateside soon & have been trying to figure out what I should bring back with me that I know won't be sold in the states. I'm so glad to see that Amazon has cracker nuts, because they are wonderful! The outside is like the texture of a cracker and there is a peanut inside. It sounds weird, but they are amazing! :)

review/summary: Nagaraya is the best crackers nuts
review/text: I had these during my childhood, yet they are very addicting until you try the Garlic Flavored ones.<br /><br />First time I tried was the Original flavor which has a subtle flavor of Butter. It is not like you tasted movei theatre butter popcorn which is similar to Orville Redenbacher's butter flavoring.<br /><br />Then a few years, I tried the Adobo and the Garlic flavors. The garlic flavor is one of the best flavors of these addicting cracker nuts. The shells is not too hard to crack with your teeth, and the crunchiness is intense too.  The cracker shell has garlic powder coated, and it somehow little sweet.  You can also feel the peanut once you crack open the cracker shell while eating it.<br /><br />Although it is hard to find these at the Midwest or East Coast. It is usually popular in any oriental grocery store. If you want to huge amount of Nagaraya cracker nuts, you can buy them at Amazon. Then you need to include shipping and handling. Delivery is prompt and fast when Amazon delivers with its affiliates.<br /><br />I wish they produced a bigger bag and portions of the cracker nuts. Keep them in stock while you can.

review/text: I've been getting these from an ethnic grocery for years now (I've never seen them anywhere else until now) and they are FANTASTIC! You normally would not put a candy coated peanut together with a salty garlic flavor, but it really, truly works. They taste amazing and become very addicting. I've never really encountered anything similar to compare them with. Do yourself a favor and give them a try, it's worth it!

review/text: A friend had some of these snacks and I tried one. Then two. I was eating them by the handfulls! I could not get enough!<br /><br />I purchased my own, and soon found that my breath was too overwhelming for anyone to be near me! The way I get around this, is to make sure I offer some to everyone in the room, and make sure everyone eats at least one. Then, nobody notices me, and I can eat them all I want!. Works even at the workplace! When there is someone near me that I don't particularly want to speak to, I just pop a few into my mouth and talk up a storm. Works every time!

At a teabar we learned about tea washing as a first step for Oolong teas ... and once we applied this as a first step to brewing a pot of Stash English Breakfast tea ... our morning tea has been smooth and rich.  So try a quick splash of hot water over the tea filter and immediately pour that water out, next fill the pot and brew for 3:30-4:00 minutes, remove the filter from the pot, and enjoy a cup of great tea.

review/text: I'm a big fan of both green and mint teas, so moroccan mint (a blend of mint and green) is a natural favorite of mine.<br /><br />I've tried moroccan mint from other places, and have not been impressed. The moroccan mint from teavana was just plain gross. This though, I can say is the best tea I've ever had.<br /><br />A great price too. Something like a dollar per ounce. Tea stores usually charge $8 for every 2 ounces.<br /><br />I steeped a spoonful with about 12oz in an IngenuiTEA. Very pleased. ;)

review/summary: "The espresso of teas"
review/text: Guess what. Stash really means it when they call this "the espresso of teas"! "Robust" in their description is code for "This sucker will rouse you after a night of throwing back pints of ale and carousing at the local pub." It is a dark, rich, and strong brew, but to say it has only one note is plain wrong. I am sitting here drinking a cup as I write (I buy mine on Amazon in the 3.5 oz pouches, so I might not show as a verified purchaser.), and I taste a range of flavors in the lower register. There are toasty warm notes, licorice, tars, and, yes, bitter notes, as befits its dark nature.<br /><br /> If a light-hearted tea is more to your palate, you must look elsewhere, but if you are seeking a strong, rich, flavorful, cup of tea, with a bit of an edge, this is it.

review/summary: waste of money
review/text: i gave up my wonderful cup of morning coffee because i like it with cream [i need neither the calories nor the estrogen] and switched to a pot of tea in the morning. with skim milk, its ok.  did you know they put powdered milk in skim milk? sorry. i digress.<br /><br />your basic standard big-name tea bags are all mediocre so being half-scot i decided to just go for the floor-sweepings in rite-aid's brand. on sale, they are 100 bags for $2.50! and no worse [or better] than the standard types like lipton - even fairly close to the twinings types.<br /><br />well, i have grown a little weary of vaguely-richer-bodied-than-hot-milk-in-the-morning taste so decided to GO FOR THE REAL THING . Leaf tea rather than dust tea. so. what to buy?<br /><br />i purchased some loose breakfast tea at my neighborhood co-op [GOOD! very GOOD!] -shoulda stopped right there, but decided on a private order as the co-op tea is in a common bulk jar, where you scoop and fill a little bag. thought to myself, if i buy some thru amazon my tea will be a lot fresher.<br /><br />so which brand? i've purchased 'stash' semi herbal tea bags in little boxes at the market in the past, so when i decided to go for GOOD tea, thought. yes, 'stash' will be a nice tea.<br /><br />wrong wrong wrong. its flavor lacks all subtlety. no, actually, it lacks all flavor. no, actually, its bitter. and not in a nice way. and costs a lot more than the co-op's.<br /><br />now, i happen to like a lot of bitter things. heck, i like to nibble on baking chocolate [it has NO sugar] and boy is that bitter. i suck lemons for fun. well, that's sour, not bitter, but you get the idea. so i am not being picky. its downright rough.<br /><br />my advise is to check out your local food co-ops and health food stores. if you don't have one in convenient distance from your home, i suggest moving.  ;-).<br /><br />leave the 'stash' people's bulk tea to those who don't read these opinions before buying something on-line.

review/summary: for the shortbread  & lemon/lime lovers
review/text: Shortbreads are some of my favorite cookies.  I also love lemon meringue and key lime pies.  This flavor cookie is a good marriage of the flavors without too much tart to the cookie.<br /><br />This cookie is crisper about the edges (first bite) than in the center where the texture is more of a true shortbread type.  I did not find dissatisfaction with the crisper edges.  I quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />The cookies seemed to me more lemon than a true key lime flavorng - but were still excellent for that.<br /><br />People who enjoy a good shortbread will like these and those liking lemon /lime will be pleasantly surprised at the way this combo meshes flavorwise.  I was hesitant to try at first - but will definitely get again.<br /><br />I got mine at a local shop and they were less costly (by a dollar per box) than the ones offered on Amazon, but, I don't find the cost here too terrible and they are not easy to find around here.  I would definitely look for them here if supply runs out nearby.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Christine

review/text: I wanted some chocolate soymilk boxes to keep in my dorm room as a healthy snack alternative to the cows milk, snickers bars, and potato chips in the vending machine down the hall. These worked out nicely for me. They came in a nicely fitting cardboard box so they're very easy to keep organized and you can just slip them under the bed or leave in a drawer for those times when you want a healthy and tasty little snack. Each individual box does not appear to require refrigeration either until they are opened, making them the perfect healthy snack to keep in your dorm room, especially for college students who don't have a minifridge.<br /><br />I was initially afraid to try ZENSOY brand chocolate soymilk since I'm used to drinking either Silk brand or Organic Valley brand, and had a few negative experiences with lesser-known brands of soymilk in the past.<br /><br />However, I noticed that these were cheaper at the time of my purchase, and so I decided to give them a try anyways. I don't regret deciding to buy these one bit. I'm glad I gave them a try. They taste wonderful and the price was right. I love drinking these after I go to the gym to help my muscles recover and grow since they are a good source of complete protein. They also have Omega 3 DHA in them to help my brain work better. They're creamy, somewhat sweet, and have a deliciously smooth chocolatey flavor.<br /><br />The product is vegan, so it should be great for kids with either animal product allergies or lactose intolerance like me. This is also nice since more and more information seems to be becoming available revealing how dairy products do not provide complete proteins, and actually have a broad range of negative health effects, contrary to widespread public perception.<br /><br />All in all, the product was great, the taste was great, and the price was right. Five stars for an excellent and healthy product!

review/summary: Great way to obtain get protein
review/text: I discovered Soy on the go at my local grocer, yet it always seemed to be either limited available or sold out. I was quite pleased to find it via amazon. But then...amazon is well on its way to have "everything". This soy milk, unless most doesn't not have a chalky texture,but rather a smooth light mousse flavor.

review/summary: Chocolaty goodness!
review/text: I love this soymilk.  It is smooth, very chocolaty and somewhat thick.  I like to mix it with lowfat white milk to have the perfect chocolate milk - can also be heated up for fantastic hot chocolate.  I like these "on-the-go" packages for convenience.  The extendable straw works great and I like the peel-up foil lid for times when I pour it out and might not finish it all at once.  I keep a couple of these soymilks in my desk at work for times when I need a healthy snack or when I want to make chocolate chai tea.  The ZenSoy holds its own with the other brand of chocolate soymilk I recommend (Soy Dream Enriched).

review/summary: Beware - Once you introduce this to your house, your kids will insist on ordering more, more, more
review/text: My daughter had a milk allergy, so we looked for alternative milk-like drinks.  We just about gave up on soy milk when we discovered ZenSoy.  My daughter lost her milk allergy about a year ago, but didn't lose her love for ZenSoy.  To be clear -- she prefers ZenSoy over any other drink, regular chocolate milk included.  The only downside is that is tastes good enough to tempt the adults.  I don't need the extra calories of any sweetened drink, and it is a big temptation to have around.  My 1 year old, who has never had a milk allergy, is also ZenSoy fan.

review/summary: Pinnacle - Limited Ingredient
review/text: I received the recommendation as a more natural healthy alternative to the more commercialized brands of avoderm, royal canine , and others.That have either reduced the quality of there food over time or bought out by larger pet food companies and drastically change the formuls. I was very pleased to have changed considering my english bulldog started to get allegies from those other foods. Her allergies eased dramatically once i started her on the Pinnacle. I find the food to be substantially better in quality and ingredient structure and heriarchy of the elements contained within. i find it equally comparable to Halo and Lonovo. The only negative is that if your dog has yeast problems inside and out then this product delivers its fair share of sugars(Carbs) from the potatoes which help fuel the yeast. i used for several months and would recommend to other dogs without yeast problems. good luck but, trying many types and finding the one that works is the best strategy.

My small dog, a havanese , is also doing well on it, but he has a strong stomach anyway.  And they both seem to love the taste.  As an added bonus, the pieces are small.  So that is helpful for my little dog.

This is more of a lemon cake or lemon candy level of taste instead of a bitter lemon or fresh lemon. It makes a tasty drink with seltzer or a nice italian ice flavoring, but I find we most often cut it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXU99E">TORANI LIME 750 ML</a> flavor.

review/summary: Be wary of these ingredients for your pet
review/text: I have studied canine nutrition for the last 5 years and one of the biggest negatives I see in many commercial dog food companies is putting profit over care.<br /><br />In looking at ingredients in treats and food, many companies are fabulous. However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought.<br /><br />Ah, but don't take my word for it.<br /><br />First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar.<br /><br />Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from "dried meat by product".  In other words, meat waste.<br /><br />But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years.<br /><br />But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper.<br /><br />So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol.<br /><br />Then powdered cellulose<br /><br />Then sodium caseinate<br /><br />but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good.<br /><br />BAD.<br /><br />Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide:<br />"Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week"<br />and "not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs." Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat.<br /><br />Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper.<br /><br />I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype "big meaty center"<br /><br />If by "meaty" they mean 'sugar and cellulse" then I agree...<br /><br />I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals.<br /><br />Why did I give it 2 stars? If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it.<br /><br />I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems.<br /><br />Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.)<br /><br />And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing.<br /><br />Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat.<br /><br />Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand.<br /><br />I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly...

review/text: I think they over emphasize "health" in the description of these peach slices. They are soft, chewy, very sweet, and tasted a little 'date' like to me. They were tasty, but much too sweet to be considered healthy. I like that they're packaged for single servings and last a while; their expiration date is months away from the purchase date. You can easily take them with you for an anytime snack. These Think Fruit Peach Slices are probably better for you than snacking on your average candy bar but grab a fresh peach more often than a packet of these if you can.

review/text: I thought they would be dried fruit..similar to "Crisps" or "Snaps", but it is actually chewy.  I liked them and they offered a nice taste for when fresh fruit is not an option.  I would purchase them again if they were around $1/bag...Crisps are $.78/bag at a local box store.

review/summary: Black salt is phenomenal!
review/text: Due to my studies in yoga and Ayurveda I'd heard about the benefits of black salt.  I'm so glad I decided to try it.  It's made a wonderful and interesting addition to my food preparation.  I would recommend that anyone buying it read up on it first because it does have a very unusual odor and flavor (very much like hard boiled eggs, as it is volcanic and contains a lot of sulphur) and the fact that like Himalayan salt you use it as a finishing salt and don't cook it.  Like Himalayan salt, from what I understand, black salt doesn't hold water so it's said it doesn't raise the sodium content in the body.  It's very finely ground so a little goes a long way, and it comes in a really neat little glass jar.  I would definitely purchase again!

review/summary: Great for gelling
review/text: I do freezer jams using agar to set them instead of pectin because it costs a lot less, and we go through a lot of jam in our household. Using agar to set the jellies means that I can use a lot less sugar and get something like a fruit spread.<br />This is a reliable product, just be careful not to get any water in the jar, measure out what you need, then seal it back up. If you're making a recipe you usually use gelatin with, use less agar, start with half the amount called for, then increase as necessary. Agar gels up very firmly if you're not working with high acidic fruits and it's pretty stable once it's gelled even at room temperature.<br />Recipes for kanten call for agar frequently, and agar makes a good vegan substitute for gelatin, but it's not as nutritious as gelatin. It is a decent source of dietary fiber though.<br />I still use gelatin for some recipes, and agar for others. Agar doesn't have the faint smell that gelatin has so for a lot of desserts, it is preferable. For a good dessert book that uses agar as an ingredient, I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4915831922">Q&E Chilled Desserts from the Japanese Kitchen (Quick and Easy Series)</a>.

However, since Id only ever bought this specific candy in Germany, I assumed that they were shipping from overseas which is why I was willing to pay the rediculous shipping cost. I was surprised to see that that was not at all the case. The item shipped from within the continental US. Ive purchased a lot of stuff online and I think this was the highest Ive ever had to pay for shipping. Maybe the seller incurs a lot of import fees and that could raise the price that they charge for shipping but I still think that almost three times the price of the actual item is again, rediculous.

review/summary: A good Irish Tea from a wellknown company
review/text: Twinings loose leaf teas are a brand you can find in most good grocery stores and are a good tea, probably the best of the major tea companies.  This is a strong fullbodied tea but a little more mild than most Irish teas.  Some may like that.  Its very drinkable, with or without milk or sugar.  All Twinings loose leaf teas are actually coarsely ground rather than full leafs.  The tea will brew quicker but bits of leaf particles can get into your cup.  I use a tea strainer and still some small amount will go into the cup.  There isnt a lot but something to be aware of.<br /><br />It comes in an attractive green-and-gold tin cannister, as the picture shows.  Very attractive but something that is not really needed if you have, or can buy, your own tea container.  The tea is sealed with tin foil to keep freshness and brewing instructions are printed in several languages on the tin foil.  It can be difficult to read the instruction if you need to do that.  THe packaging makes a nice presentation for gift-giving.<br /><br />I recently bought a package of Davidson's Organic Irish Tea, also from Amazon.  I like it better. Cheaper, full leafs, fuller richer and a bit stronger taste.  But Twinings Irish Tea can be good also.  Its a decent tea and one of the most famous names in tea companies.

review/summary: The Stout Of Teas
review/text: Wonderful bold flavor. This is a morning wake up tea or an alternative to coffee after a large meal or with guests.  Slightly malty flavor will stand up to being enjoyed straight or with a little sweetener.<br /><br />Test your amounts. You will be surprised at how little makes a full strong pot. As the saying goes, strong enough for the church mouse to walk over. Overbrewing is not an issue, so it can make a rather good iced tea (hot, let cool to room temp, decant, refrigerate), but you can make it a bit too strong with too much tea.<br /><br />Side note; this is a cut & tear leaf tea, meaning a coffee grounds like texture.  You will need a mesh filter like the bodum press pot, which is great for tea.  You -can- use a standard filter coffee maker. Clean the 'roof' by the water outlet and the filter cup throughly, removing all the coffee oils. Something to do regularly anyway.  Then put a measure of this tea in a paper or mesh filter per normal.  You'll need to adjust amounts for taste. Enjoy!

review/text: Irish Breakfast is a traditional black tea blend known for its assertiveness and malty flavor.  It's a wonderful tea - i prefer it with a touch of milk, but it's not overpowering when drunk black.  The Twinnings loose leaf is FAR superior to the bags.  Those are made with "tea dust" and end up bitter and unbalanced.  Do yourself a favor and always order the loose variety of Twinnings teas.  There's an amazing difference.  Great deal on amazon - i can't find the Irish Breakfast in my town and other Twinnings varities average about $6 retail.  At around $3.50/tin, you get a great tea at a good price.

review/summary: The best tasting strong tea
review/text: This is my favorite black tea.  Personal taste in food and beverage is so subjective that it is hard to recommend it to everyone but I believe this tea is the ultimate in full-bodied flavor.  I like the loose tea because I can make it stronger or weaker as needed.  I also use the teabags when I don't have time to make a pot and they are good also but there is just something special about making a pot of tea the old-fashioned way.  They recommend using 1 tsp of tea per person and 1 tsp for the pot.  This comes out a bit weak for my taste so I use a rounded teaspoon per person and 1 for the pot and let it diffuse for five minutes and it is perfect for my taste.  I always preheat the teakettle and mugs with a little hot water.

No wonder, then, that there is a breakfast blend named for them; although Irish Breakfast is actually strong enough to be a great pick-me-up throughout the day. Traditionally, it consists primarily of teas from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the state of Assam in northeastern India. Irish Breakfast has an intricately full-bodied, malty, floral aroma and goes particularly well with milk (or cream, but real milk is preferable). Enjoy!

I was brought up by a British mother and so we always had loose black tea in the house while growing up.  I have used the Irish Breakfast tea bags for years in the microwave but when my husband got a Keurig coffee maker; I saw that I could make my tea using loose tea in the reusable filter basket which is much faster and easier than in a tea pot like my mom did.  I only have one cup a day and one tin lasted for 36 days.  I signed up with amazon for the automatic shipments of this tea. It has a great flavor!!!!

review/summary: What Are They Thinking?
review/text: This is a very good, high quality mainstream Irish Breakfast Tea, something that will kick you in the butt to get you out of bed.  It's been described here as like "stout," or "Coffee" and even "strong enough for a mouse to trot upon.  I just describe it as kick your butt strong, and one heck of an astringent flavor.<br /><br />Amazon did so many things right when they offered this tea:  loose tea instead of bagged, which in my opinion, is the easiest way to prepare your tea and make it go from average to delicious.  It's a simple matter to take a teaspoon of tea and let it swim in the boiling water in your teapot. All the good stuff in the tea leaves comes out and you're drinking tea the way it has been drunk for thousands of years. If all you've ever had was tea in a tea bag, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Back to to the tea:  I always found that Irish Breakfast was harsh and astringent, and not at all pleasant. I always drink my tea black, and never thought to drink tea any other way.  You can't do with with Irish Breakfast Tea.  When drunk black, it's very unpleasant.  However, when cream is added, the tea undergoes a metamorphosis.  Besides the obvious color change and dairy tastes, the tea itself seems to change.  The harshness I detected when I drank the tea straight had disappeared, replaced by a rich, deep tea taste with a strength that gets you out the door in the morning with a smile on your face.<br /><br />Okay, you say.  Then what the heck do you mean by the title to this review?  It's because Twining's is selling their loose tea in far too large a quantity.  Six tins could last a family a year, and that's much too long to have tea kicking around.  Black tea is meant to be drunk right away, not stored in a kitchen cabinet for months on end, perhaps being opened, and certainly being exposed to heat and air.  The tea tins they sell are great for preserving a small quantity for the time it takes to drink the tea.  But tea kept for many months becomes stale and flavorless.<br /><br />If you do purchase this package of tea, keep two tins for yourself and give the other four to friends, making sure that they know this tea is meant to be prepared with cream and sugar.  The sugar might be optional, but the cream [milk] certainly isn't.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Steeps not so Great
review/text: This is my favorite tea (in bagged tea) and I wanted to try it out loose since that makes better tea.  I just finished up a tin of Fortnum and Mason's English Breakfast loose tea and thought Twining's Irish Breakfast would be just as good, hopefully better.<br /><br />Well, it tastes better than F&M's and the bagged version (yay!), but the tea is not really loose leaf--the leaves are coarsely chopped--so tea dust penetrates the metal strainer system I use--a system that has worked very well for the every other loose leaf tea variety I've ever tried.  I suppose I can brew it with a paper straining method, but the cut up look to the tea makes it look like someone just cut open a hundred tea bags and dumped them into my tin...disappointing...tasty, but could it be better?
