review/text: This was a great tasting olive oil and worth every penny.  I loved the fact that it used a cork instead of a screw top which kept the flavor in the bottle better.

review/summary: My Little Boy Loves Goldfish Colors.
review/text: My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good for YOU and Good for Children and FUN to EAT plus some NEAT-O TRICKS & TIPS!
review/text: Once again Pepperidge Farms has created a wholesome snack that is not only good for you but also good for children too; and a whole lotta fun to eat! Forget junk food when there's better food that's not only fun but wholesome and satisfying  but be careful; there are other "fisherpeople" out there who will raid your snack!<br /><br />Here's a bonus for those who were unaware - they are not "salty" like others are, plus for more specific info; you can always visit the Pepperidge Farms for they have various other products that are diabetic to heart healthy. Additional bonus is people who wear dentures won't die of embarrassment and enjoy the pleasure of munching on these beloved crackers. And those who have dental medical conditions by reason of medications or some type of genetic or health issues will also find these easy to eat as well - making them easier for Parents to Caretakers to monitor their loved ones or the ones they are overseeing.<br /><br />I also use these as Salad Toppers instead of hard croutons for a "Spring / Summer" fun - it adds spark and interest as well as contrast to your salad; even when entertaining ... who would have ever thought of tossing these precious yummies into salads? And plus, if you can't get your child to eat salad, they will when they see Pepperidge Goldfish in there swimming in cheese, lettuc, tomatoes - or even a Taco Salad to make Food interesting and introduction to healthy-eating to a child.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater (child) that just won't eat his/her veggies or just only specific types; try tossing a few Goldfish and sprinkle with cheese after cooking or steaming veggies and then at last minute toss in the fresh grated favorite cheese and some goldfish and toss; serve dinner immediately and observe after remarking that we're eating goldfish tonight that is swimming in our food.  (Leave it at that...) That is how I got my step-grandson to begin to eat other vegetables besides green beans, potatoes and corn. He was having too much fun playing and eating the veggies and "swimming" while eating at the same time that he forgot the rest of his dinner! *laughing*<br /><br />Thought I would toss an old trick I had done to my son when he was young, it still works... those Pepperidge Farm Goldfish are magical!

review/text: This stuff is really good, full of flavor.  I'm eating spagetti with this marinara sauce while typing this.  As per the instructions on the box all you have to do is heat it with a teaspoon of olive oil.  I like it with some heat so I add a good amount of black pepper (maybe 1/2 teaspoon or more).  Also it's a little too watery for my liking so I boil it and let some of the liquid evaporate.  Just my personal preference.  Otherwise this is absolutely perfect.

review/summary: Save U.S. Organic Beekeepers
review/text: Really Raw Honey is the best honey I have ever tasted.  It is produced by one of the last apiaries left in the United States using organic beekeeping methods.<br /><br />Really Raw Honey is not labelled as an organic product, so I contacted the company through their website and they told me that they do not use pesticides, miticides, or antibiotics on their bees and they do not feed the bees corn syrup or sugar and do not truck their bees all over the country to pollinate crops.<br /><br />The 5lb jar is pretty large but it is more economical than the 1lb jar and it taste so good, I will probably go through the 5 lb jar in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />$50 might see like a lot for 5lbs of honey but you get what you pay for.  Really Raw Honey is a high quality ethical product.  Do yourself a favor and try it.

review/text: Our Shitzu is very picky when it comes to treats, which is good I guess.  Only puppy sized Milkbones and Dried Liver Treats.  We used a different brand in the past, but tried PureBites and he loves them, just as much.  The other brand sells them in a hard plastic (reusable)container and the PureBites are in a bag/pouch.  Not sure if that contributes to more breakage of pieces or if it's just they way they are processed.  Since our pooch is a small dog, he doesn't need "big bites", so these are just fine for him.  Price per ounce seems better on the PureBites too.

My dog is also kind of a picky eater and he doesn't really like his dog food, but since he's allergic to potatoes he doesn't have very many options to what kind of dog food he eats. To coax him to eat his food, sometimes I'll get a piece of these treats, crush it up and sprinkle it over his food. He seriously is the best eater after the liver treats are all over his kibbles. I also gave these treats to my cousins chihuahua whos also a really picky eater. She a little worse than my dog, she doesn't like any kind of treats, but she'll eat these! Yes, these are kind of expensive especially since I'm still in college, but it's so worth seeing my doggie happy :)

review/text: These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100% beef liver and nothing else.  This also means that they're grain free, which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems.  Switching from other (high-quality) treats to PureBites liver reduced the frequency and potency of my dog's rear-end emissions by about 90 percent.  Both my dogs love these treats.  The only, minor drawback is that the bottom of the bag tends to have a little pile of tiny bits and pieces of treats -- at that point, I'll pour out a little pile for each of my dogs and they lick them up like candy.

review/text: My two finicky dogs just love, love this snack! They don't just eat any snack that comes their way, in fact, they usually turn their noses up when I try to give them other pretty darn good natural dog snacks, but this one is a winner! The bite-sized pieces are just the right size for them (they are slightly under medium-sized dogs, peke mixes) and although they have been eating this snack for years, they never grow tired of it. The 16 oz bag lasts us for about two months (two dogs), which is pretty darn good considering the price. I have tried the other flavors, but we stay away from chicken and cheese because of the allergy equation. The fish is also excellent, but the price is a bit steeper, so we pretty much stick to the liver. YUM YUM WOOF WOOF!

review/text: I love Green Mountain's Mocha Nut Fudge k-cups. The chocolate and nut flavors are nice and strong, and it's fabulous with just a little sweetener and creamer (with most coffees I find myself using a ton of both). So I was really excited when I received the alert saying it was now available through Amazon. I've been purchasing this elsewhere online for months, and looked forward to ditching the shipping costs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even with shipping, the price of two 24-count boxes on the other site is a good $10 cheaper than the $38.99 offered here. Definitely try this coffee, but shop around and I guarantee you'll find it for less.

review/text: This is my fifth chocolate flavored Kcup that I have purchased and tasted. The others being Gloria Jeans Swiss Chocolate Almond (so so flavor) and Mudslide (again it was OK), Van Houtte Chocolate Almond (excellent flavor), Donut House Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut ( smell the brew Kcup and it still smells of chocolate)and now this one.<br /><br />I brewed mine in my B40 @ the 7.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. What one first experiences is a rich chocolate like aroma that rises as it is being brewed. Thats tempting enough. When first sipped, a sweet yet not to sweet ( the D.H. Chocolate Glazed Donut is the strongest and sweetest) flavor with no bitter after taste prevalent in a lot of darker roasted Kcups I have sampled. A full bodied light roast thats is rich enough to be served as a dinner dessert<br /><br />This great coffee wins a spot in my top ten favorite Kcups

review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees, and Green Mountain Mocha Nut Fudge is one of my favorites.  The flavors aren't over-powering, and give just the right blend of mocha and roasted nuts.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a weak spot for mocha.  If you're looking for a strong, dark roast, this will not be the coffee for you.  It's just a very pleasing way to start the day.

review/summary: Just Okay
review/text: I purchased this flavor because I had read on another site that it was the closest available flavor to the now discontinued Gloria Jean's "Holiday Traditions." It doesn't really even come close.<br /><br />It is a light to medium strength coffee with a nutty aftertaste. It isn't sweet. The smell when brewing is a little artificial. I don't find the chocolate or caramel notes at all. That being said, I prefer any of the hazelnut k-cups available to the nut taste in "Mocha Nut Fudge." And if you are looking for a chocolate/nut combination in a light to medium blend, Gloria Jean's "Swiss Chocolate Almond" is much more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's okay and I will finish the box, but won't be ordering it again. If you are looking for a nut flavored coffee with more of a mixed nut taste, you might enjoy it.

review/summary: Mocha Nut Fudge? I'm a NUT  for wasting money on it. lol
review/text: This coffee is weak and a major disappointment. I gambled on this coffee because of the 3 positive reviews. I bought a 24 pack of the Mocha Nut Fudge and I'm seriously considering tossing the 22 remaining k-cups. Sad statement.<br />It's advisable when there are hardly any reviews to look elsewhere for MORE reviews. I found some other sites with dozens of reviews of this coffee and my thoughts on it were confirmed.. I'm not crazy :)<br /><br />How is it disappointing? Well, there is virtually NO flavour. It is a light roast coffee. I was expecting something chocolately, nutty,fudgy?lol.. with a definitive aftertaste.<br /><br />When I first bought my Keurig machine, I ran out and bought the usual coffee shop style coffees and an assortment of flavoured coffees, such as: "Butter Toffee", "Cinnamon Pastry", "Hazelnut", "Macadamia Nut Cookie" and... you guessed it.. Mocha Nut Fudge :(  Well, people, Butter Toffee rocks, Cinnamon Pastry is yummy , Hazelnut is very good, Macadamia Nut Cookie is more on the mellow side, but is still enjoyable. Mocha Nut Fudge is now sadly taking up space in my cupboard..ahaha.<br />Moral of the story is read other reviews on other sites. Loving my Keurig KUB40 though. :)

Maybe I should try sweetening my coffee with this.<br /><br />Only gripe -- the design of the bottle makes the honey drip all over the bottle and the counter, whenever I use it. So I poured everything into a clean, empty plastic "other brand of honey" dispenser-container that I had on hand. Made a mjor difference, no more cleanups every time I want to use this honey.<br /><br />This honey is SO GOOD, they should make it in an EXTRA LARGE size!!!

I had tried many different protein bars, and genisoy bars were the inky palatable option back then.  Today there are even more protein bar options out there, but genisoy products still top my list.  These bars taste great,  Genisoy bars do not taste like something from a chemical lab or something formed from swept up woodshop floor material, nor do they taste like bad candy.  They have a good mouthfeel and excellent flavor.  If you are looking for a nutrition/protein bar that dos not make you feel that you are being punished by eating it, these are for you.

Simple? Heat a couple TBSP Olive Oil in a big skillet, throw in the pasta (drained AND rinsed), saute a couple minutes, pour in the powder and stir until it's evenly mixed!

review/text: I purchased Jeanies jello after a street fair in NYC where our bar was serving jello shots for the occasion. But because I'm a vegetarian and do not eat gelatin, I was left out of the fun and realized a bunch of other people had<br />the same issue and they asked if there was any that were gelatin free. So that night I ordered Jeanies animal free jello and could not believe how amazing it was. Way better than traditional jello!! There is no difference with the texture and it honestly tastes more flavorful. I ordered all strawberry flavored and the nice people at Jeanies sent me a flavor sampler pack to try in addition to my order. Our restaurant now only serves animal free jello due to the tramendous customer response.

review/text: Chervil, the one spice I didn't realize was so darn hard to get. After searching up and down this infernal state in hopes of finding it somewhere in person I outstretched my arms to the infamous internet.  More specifically, Amazon!<br /><br />I typed in the letters and wallah, I found items.  I decided to try this, as I have limited experience with Chervil, I'll admit it, and I am happy to report that it was safely in my hands exactly when I wanted it.  I opened it up to sample the herb, and from what I could tell it was also exactly as described. I'd recommend this herb for at least a taste of something different and considering the speed at which I got the item, I am extremely happy.<br /><br />So till I experiment again, live long and eat well!

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Pasta On The Market
review/text: Short of making your own at home, I don't believe you'll find a better gluten free pasta. This pasta has great texture, great flavor, and I like that it's organic and made of brown rice instead of white rice and tapioca flour like most gluten free pastas. If you're going to eat pasta, at least this one allows you to get whole grains instead of filler. This pasta even stands up to a bit of overcooking, so if you put it in a mac & cheese or baked dish, it still comes out great and not mushy. I highly recommend this to any person who is gluten free.

review/summary: My favorite brand but new recipe could use some work.
review/text: I have been a long time fan of Blenheim Ginger Ale and very few places carry it anymore so I grabbed a case here. Let me go ahead and say this first, some time in the past five years Blenheim changed their recipe for the diet version and it is nowhere near as sweet as it was. It isn't bad, but it doesn't taste anything like the regular Blenheim at all, anymore. I think the previous reviewer hasn't had it in a while, because it tastes exactly like when I got it at the Deli last week. It is a little bland compared to before, and very bland compared to the sugared versions.

review/summary: Smooth flavor with a good morning 'kick'
review/text: After trying a variety of the different 'Extra Bold' (=20% more coffee) and regular K-Cups to fill my 10oz mug (that fits my car's holder), I have found the Newman's to have the smoothest flavor and a nice caffeine kick to it, whereas many others are weak, a bit bitter, or too acidic.  I purchase a huge box of  96 K-cups every month or two from Amazon due to their quantity discount, fearful to waking up and finding I am out of coffee!  Price of around 50-60 cents each is about the same or less than buying  loose coffee in the bag, and MUCH cheaper and convenient than stopping by Peet's or Starbuck's.  Now every day starts out great.<br /><br />After coffee-drinking being considered a 'vice' for the past 20 years, they now say that drinking 2 cups of coffee a day increases one's health and life 15%  and decreases the chance of getting Type 2 Diabetes, amongst other benefits.  With all those anti-oxidants and micronutrients in fresh coffee (plus a low-carb diet...), we will probably live to 102!<br /><br />Actually, almost every Newman's product I have tried I have liked, so if you like the 'Newman's Own' salad dressings, sauces, and so on, you'll like this one, too.  Also must say that the  Cuisinart K-Cup coffee maker is fun to use, at least compared to the boring old  drip coffeemaker, with drinking the stale lukewarm leftovers from earlier or tossing away a half-pot  of coffee.  The caffeine and flavor of a freshly brewed cup is a 1000% better!

review/summary: New Formula A Huge Disappointment
review/text: This has been my favorite cold cereal for several years now, and it was by far the best oat flake cereal that I was able to find. It contains no wheat, an ingredient that is difficult to avoid in cereal. The old formula had a fresh, clean taste, with a sweetness that was not overpowering. About a week ago, I found that my local Whole Foods was stocking the cereal in a newly decorated box. (More of a white color, rather than the previous yellowish box) The altered product is so disappointing that I will not be purchasing the cereal on a regular basis any longer. There is now a taste of cardboard in the flavor, and the sweetness is cloying and artificial. The new composition is also more soggy with milk. It is disappointing in just about every way. I can't imagine what the manufacturer was thinking, and I wish they hadn't messed with a good thing.

review/summary: STUNNING CREAMY SWEETNESS
review/text: I've seen this product for decades but didn't feel like finding out it had an aftertaste like so many syrups on the market including Monins.  I don't like molasses and I don't like maple.  I finally took the leap and MAN IS IT GOOD.  There is really no sweetener I stand in coffee except pure sugar until now.  This is even good there.  Didn't alter the coffee the way honey would.  Pancakes  Waffles  on your Tongue  on Ice Cream  on Sausage, in baking,  its like adding almost-caramel to anything.  Butter just brings it forward.  Alaga no longer is like it was decades ago so this is the syrup I'm switching to.  Looking to try their other goodies.

review/summary: Delicious and no Corn!
review/text: Most all corn products(except white corn I believe)in America are now genetically engineered...did you know that?  No labeling is required as in other countries!<br />I have been looking for a non-corn sweetener to use for my Christmas candies since organic corn syrup is so very expensive (as wonderful as it is, so much better that Karo!)  So far, I have used Rice syrup and this product.  The rice syrup works well for cooking and baking, but has a bit of a bitter aftertaste when eaten alone, whereas Lyle's Golden is just yummy no matter how you eat it!  I have been using it in oatmeal, on rice pudding, in coffee and tea, it is so very yummy.<br />In baking, I was only able to make one batch of caramel corn with Lyle's Golden....popping corn is not yet GE they say, I buy organic anyways it is much more tender and flavorful, especially the Newman's brand.<br />The caramel corn turned out as it should, I'll be trying it in all of my goodies as 2011 rolls to it's end and I get to make all of those sugary, buttery treats again!

review/text: I have recently been diagnosed with arthritis and started researching holistic ways to decrease the pain and frequency of flare ups. In my research I found out that drinking green tea has been found effective in a small clinical study of inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis. Research indicates that green tea may benefit arthritis by reducing inflammation and slowing cartilage breakdown. We all know about the healthful benefits of anti-oxidants called polyphenols. Antioxidants are substances that scavenge free radicals -- damaging compounds in the body that alter cells, tamper with DNA (genetic material), and even cause cell death. Free radicals occur naturally in the body, but environmental toxins (including ultraviolet rays from the sun, radiation, cigarette smoke, and air pollution) also give rise to these damaging particles. Many scientists believe that free radicals contribute to the aging process as well as the development of a number of health problems, including cancer and heart disease. Antioxidants such as polyphenols in green tea can neutralize free radicals and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage they cause. and this is an appealing way of getting them. I have tried other green teas and did not care for them particularly. But his one has orange and spice added to it which makes it great. Add a little bit of sweetener and the flavors are enhanced.

review/summary: Great tasting green tea!
review/text: I am not a fan of plain green tea; as a matter of fact, it usually makes me want to gag. I wanted the health benefits that green tea brings so I thought I'd give Bigelow Constant Comment Green Tea a try & was glad I did.  This tea is wonderful!  Tastes almost like Bigelow Constant Comment (black tea) which I think has a slightly stronger flavor. I usually drink ice tea and this is no exception.  I love it iced. I steep 7-8 bags in a couple cups of  boiling water for 8-10 minutes, add enough cold water to make 1/2 gallon, ice & sugar to taste. It makes great tasting ice tea with a slightly spicy flavor & aroma. I have some green tea that needs to be used up so once in a while I'll substitute a couple of bags of green tea for the Constant Comment green tea.  It's a great way to use up the green tea (the green tea flavor is masked by the spicy flavor of the Constant Comment green tea).<br /><br />Trying to find this on the grocery shelves is hit or miss.  One day I decided to check Amazon & was surprised to find it.  Not only does Amazon.com sell it...but the price is great too! Much lower than the grocery store.<br /><br />YUM! I'm enjoying a glass right now!<br />5 stars
