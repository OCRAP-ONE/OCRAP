review/summary: Best hot chocolate I've ever tasted!
review/text: Love the chili flavor, combined with the rich chocolate taste. Each 2.7 oz pack contains two disks. Fill a cup 2/3 full with screaming hot boiling water then break a disk into quarters and drop it into the cup. Stir it well. Use a small wire whip to get it nice and smooth then add a little cream. Best cup of hot chocolate you've ever tasted! Any flavor is good!

review/summary: My favorite when compared to the chipotle chili or any other chocolate
review/text: I'm not a chocolate connoisseur by any means but I have tried many chocolates, and this is my favorite. My kids don't like the grainy texture of this chocolate, but I love it! It's the only chocolate I buy for myself. I like the guajilio variety better than the chipotle because the chipotle has more of a biting bitter heat, while the guajilio is smoother and gives just enough heat to excite the taste buds without diminishing the flavor. As for price, my local Whole Foods Market has a better price than the $8 per package that I'm seeing here today.

review/summary: Anticipation!
review/text: This product was wonderful as described.  My problem was the packaging and delivery. There was no where marked on the package that this was chocolate and should be kept cool.  It was delivered to my home mailbox on the hottest day and sat in the mailbox for around 4 hours. It was completely melted but I put it in the refrigerator to solidify.  I am able to eat it but instead of 2 disk there is just a solid piece of chocolate that is very hard to cut or break.  I manage though and it is as good as the other reviews have stated.  I was just so disappointed in how I received it.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Out of all the varieties, all of which are amazing, of Taza chocolate, this is my favorite.  The disc is scored which makes it easy to break off bite-sized pieces.  That is the most common way that I use this chocolate but I have used this and other "flavors" of it to make chocolate chip cookies which were amazing and even hot chocolate, also amazing.  I often get this with the intention of trying yet another recipe but inevitably the discs get eaten by myelf or a family member before we ever get around to the experiment.

review/summary: Spectacular
review/text: So sorry I have not found or tried this sooner. I'm all for smooth style european chocolates, but this is nothing less than spectacular. Immediately you notice the somewhat gritty texture, and the intense chocolate flavor. (Yes it's a good thing.) The sugar then melts to mingle w/ the chocolate, making it sweet yet not fully combining with the chocolate. (Again a good thing, as the sugar has a great taste all it's own.) The heat then comes slowly and is warm with no bite, almost velvety - if there can be such a thing.<br /><br />The second bite was just as intense and wonderful as the first - I strongly recommend.

review/text: I am trying a low carb, sugar free diet.  I can handle most of it, but living without chocolate really kills me.  I have been searching for a lowcarb, sugarfree chocolate but they all seem to taste like rubber.  That is, until I found this WONDERFUL product.  I didn't buy it for the Hoodia, to be honest...I just wanted chocolate treats without the carbs and the sugar.  I was truly impressed with the flavor (almost too good to be true)but my greatest joy came when I read I HAD TO EAT THREE OF THEM A DAY!!!!  And guess what?  It has cut down my cravings and my overall apetite.  I bought another 4 jars and planning to always have them home!!!!!

review/summary: so tasty
review/text: Well, I have got to say that these did nothing to curb my appetite.  The reason for the four stars is that they are a delicious low calorie treat.  I absolutely love them.  It's like eating a little candy bar and even if you eat two, you are only eating 60 calories.  They are really so good.  I carry a couple in my purse so that when I get a craving for chocolate, I can just pop one in my mouth.  The caramel is chewy and it's not a bite that you eat in two seconds so even though they didn't really curb the appetite, they helped me stay away from the Snickers!!

review/summary: Great snack
review/text: I was a little leery having to buy a box with 12 bags of popcorn.  LOL!  But I wasn't disappointed.  I have to watch the salt intake and this has just enough salt (for me) to taste good and not enough to drive my blood pressure up.  So health wise for me it is great.  It won't compare to movie theater popcorn; but IF you love popcorn this is far better than my "hot air" popped corn that I try to "add" a little salt to and the salt falls off in the bottom of the bowl.  I will definitely keep this on hand.  Makes a great filling snack for the calories.<br /><br />September 20, 2012...I am towards the end of my 12 pack box of Bearito's Popcorn.  I wanted to add that each bag is a very nice size and provides quite a few snacks for me.  I am still very pleased with my purchase.  It is almost time to order some more. :-))) So in the long run of things this has been economical for me. Personally...I am a happy camper!

review/text: Good enough for pre-popped I guess. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I miss that "fresh popped" taste. The "lite" moniker should not scare away those that like buttery flavor, though-- this popcorn is actually rather buttered/salted by my standards. Nice that it's organic (must for us), but as mentioned, nothing beats popping your own, though it's nice to not have to deal with the unpopped kernels (I have yet to find any kernels in the 3 bags we've eaten thus far).

It doesn't taste like Grape Nuts (which is fine with me since I don't really like Grape Nuts) and it's not break-your-teeth hard, either.  It looks (and tastes) like toasted TVP.  I wonder if I could just buy TVP and toast it myself?  I'll have to try that sometime.<br /><br />I like to mix it half and half with Kashi Go Lean original flavor with my Greek yoghurt and berries.<br /><br />Update:<br />Now I don't bother with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and just do the nutlettes with Greek yoghurt and fruit.

review/summary: Excellent!!!!!!!
review/text: I am in the process of losing a large amount of weight (110 so far) and was looking for high protein products.  This one is a total find!  140 calories, 25 grams protein, 28% of your daily iron, and only 6 net carbs  (15 carbs, 9 from fiber).  The soy product offers a huge nutritional bang for the buck!  They are dry, and indeed absorb a lot of milk when added.  My first serving was 1/2 cup cereal with 1/2 cup milk, and by the end of the bowl all of the milk was absorbed.  It was super filling and stayed with me- no sugar crash either!  I will be adding fruit to the next serving, as it will be  lovely balance.  I think this would also work great in yogurt also.  It is pricey, but worth it.  Off to check a whole foods now to see if I can find a better price on it now!<br /><br />Update:  I found this product on Netrition.com for $4.09 for a pound.  They also have flat rate shipping at $4.95- cheaper than here.  Their other products were very competitive, so ended up having many items shipped that I cannot find locally.

"Oh look your subscribe and save stuff is ready to ship, and oh by the way its now this much higher".  After all the "SUBSCRIBE and SAVE" option is to save money, not have the prices increased on us so we pay almost as much as those who dont use this option. I don't subscribe to too many things for that reason.

review/summary: All the rage
review/text: The claim to fame is low glycemic. Yet I wonder if the product did not get its start due to over production of the agave plant. There has been a bit of glut of Tequila - made from the agave plant. It is sort of like (to my thinking) molasses. I bought a 23.5 ounce container at HEB for six bucks. The price here is certainly quite good. Now for the product: the Amber (the only type I have tried of this brand) tastes a bit "burned" - more than toasted. Not smokey, but a burned sugar type flavor. I suppose one could cultivate a taste for this rendition. I prefer a neutral flavor - one that is not strong, especially burned. Have not cooked with it. Have used on plain yogurt and in tea. First taste was direct from container. Next time I buy agave syrup I will try another brand so that I can make a comparison. Who knows, I may learn to like it.

review/summary: A Mango Tea LoverI
review/text: While living in Chicago I first tried the Mango Tea by Lipton and loved it.  I relocated to the DC area and couldn't find any.  I tried Amazon and behold they carried it!  Now I am smiling once again.  The tea is excellent either hot or cold. I'll be waiting at the front door (with a cup of hot water) the day it arrives. My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter just loves it as well.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Thanks Lipton and of course Amazon.com :>

review/summary: Best Sweetened Iced Tea
review/text: This is the best flavor in the sweetened iced tea arena.  I love this Mango Iced Tea, so much so that I have to control myself from not drinking a gallon a day (that would obviously be too much sugar).  This is #1 favorite of the sweetened iced tea mixes.  Too bad there's no Diet sugar-free version of this, but it would likely not taste the same which is why they haven't started selling a Diet version of the Mango.  I can't find this Mango iced tea in any store, so Amazon is pretty much my only source for this excellent iced tea.

review/summary: Yummy....Mango Tea
review/text: I was introduced to this tea during Christmas when I visited Utah in 2006 I believe and liked it so much, I looked for it in SC and could not find it.  I moved to Florida and I was talking to a friend about how great it is and decided to order it after I had found out that Amazon carried the product.  I gave the friend a tub and she thought it tasted as good...and the same as Applebees Mango Tea.  If you do not mind the sugar and 80 calories a glass, this is really good tea!!!!  I really like it a lot!!!!! I also found it at Walmart in Florida and found it to be cheaper.  Walmart does not sell it in a case of 6, but individually, and individually each tub is still cheaper at Walmart than what you will pay here at Amazon.  If Walmart ever discontinues selling it, then I will definately go through Amazon again!!!

review/summary: The Treat That Lasts at Amazon
review/text: Reviewing an established candy treat such as Peanut Chews Originals seems unnecessary, but I purchased 12 5-ounce bags recently and Amazon wants a review. Now this candy has been around for decades and so have I, but since I first tasted it as a kid in the 1950s, it's been a favorite. And I've always consumed it slowly -- I'd pop one of those chocolate covered sections into my mouth and make it last. First the chocolate melts away, then the caramel slowly dissolves away to reveal chunks of peanuts to be chewed right at the end. They are meant to be savored slowly. If you've only chewed and swallowed these candies, you've missed a lot.

review/text: I first bought a small bottle of syrup at a coffee shop in Germany that made an awesome mocha.  I have an espresso machine at home and was looking for a way to make my own mocha latte.  This syrup is great!  It doesn't have that artificial flavor I find so unappealing in most flavorings I've found in the stores.  It's not sickenly sweet either.  Less than a teaspoonful will flavor a double shot latte.  My friends think my Mocha latte's are better than Starbucks!  You've got to try it!

review/summary: YUMMY - GOOD!  Happy Birthday, Richard Hornbaker!
review/text: I use two cans of the blueberries with one packet of the muffin mix for 6 jumbo muffins. Later, I add 1 tsp cinnamon to the extra mix packet to make apple cinnamon muffins. All the directions are the same, except add 2 peeled, cored, and finely chopped apples at the end (instead of the blueberries.) I make 6 jumbo muffins and bake them for 25 minutes at 350. As the oven heats, I heat the pan, then spray it well with food release spray, this makes for an easy release, because (I was told by a pro) the pores of the pan are open and really seal to the spray.)<br />Whatever you do, don't heat the oven over 375. They burn. (Each of these muffins (whether apple or cinnamon) count as one fruit serving, since they each contain enough fruit.)<br /><br />OR: Even better, you can substitute Bobs Red Mill Golden Flax Seed meal for ALL, or half, (start with half) of the fat! Try this! The muffins are actually MOISTER and stay FRESH longer, PLUS they pack a WOLLOP of GOOD fats and FIBER, and many other nutrients - without ANYONE noticing! Golden Flax is the sweet, tastiest flax, so dont hesitate to try it! Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4). PS These muffins can be stickier on the pan, so HEAT the muffin tin while the oven preheats, then SPRAY thoroughly inside, even letting the pan release spray pool a little in the bottom. Instant Release! (You also get a nicer "crust" by preheating the pan.) These disappear FAST at our house, but of course I dont tell anyone (all males) that they are HEALTHY! Enjoy!

review/text: I like these because they are very very different from prunes or prune plums. They have a nicer flavor than the typical prune. They have retained good flavor and have good texture. They are pretty small, which is fine. Truly a dried plumb vs. a prune. They are soft in texture and a little bit chewy but not very chewy.

A bit spicy but just the right spicy, not too much, more on the conservative side and then the sweet aftertaste.  I always add salt to most things or sometimes garlic but this one I do not do anything to it except for adding toasty french bread to it.<br />I can't get enough of this soup thus I am here writing about it.

I'd be curious to see how they ship in warmer times, but they needed no thermal insulation during winter. They were delicious, though the nature of the miniatures meant that there was a lot of trash. The most important thing is, this is the best price per ounce that I've seen for Reese's of any sort.<br /><br />If you've not tried them yet, try Reese's Minis. They are a bit smaller, aren't individually wrapped, and they're just as good. Not as good in terms of price, though.

review/summary: Best Cheese Puffs
review/text: I love cheese and things made with cheese, so I've had many cheese puffs.  These have a little blue cheese added which gives them a sharper flavor than just cheddar.  I've noticed a bit of inconsistency in the flavor from bag to bag.  Sometimes there will be a great flavor with a good bite and sometimes a more mild flavor like normal cheese puffs.  If you want to be assured of a milder flavor try the white cheddar.  I don't like those - too mild.  Be aware that the oil tends to settle in the puffs on the bottom half of the bag - so the puffs on top of the bag are lighter than the ones on the bottom.  Personally, I think the bottom of the bag is a little better!

review/text: I do love the original Cheetos Cheese Puffs, but not the fact my fingers end up covered with the orange-colored coating on the puffs. I have eaten several bags of Barbara's Bakery Gaked White Cheddar Cheese Puffs and was disappointed at not being able to detect white cheddar but the puffs are very light with a pleasant flavor. They have a light crispy crunch to them and can be eaten without a beverage as they do not seem dry to my mouth. It would be difficult to eat just a small quantity of them, but I found them to be a delicious, non-filling snack as well as being healthier than the fried kind. I will certainly order them again in the future.

review/text: I am highly recommending you DO NOT give your dog Greenies.  My German Shepherd was given one by a friend.  He loved the taste and ate it wholeheartedly. However, within a 24 hours, he was vomiting blood and taken to the vet's emergency clinic.  Not only did the product tear up his throat, but he had an intestinal blockage because the Greenie did not digest easily.  He was at risk for emergency surgery, but my vet was able to help him pass it. He had to be on an IV for a week.  Folks, the packaging on Greenies even says it is fatal if not thoroughly chewed.  DO NOT RISK IT! I almost lost my best friend.

review/summary: English tea for snobs and wealthy
review/text: Williamson teas are strictly for English, the wealthy and snobs. If Lipton dirt in a bag are good enough for you don't waste everyone's time by purchasing their teas. To drink Williamson you need to know the difference between Assam and Kenyan. To drink Williamson you need to be tea intelligent to be able to explain how they combine varietals of tea to create each unique type of tea, English breakfast, Irish breakfast and on and on. If you don't know what temperature the water should be, how long to steep the tea and what three additions to a cup of tea are acceptable then just put your dollar in a machine for a bottle of Liptons or whomever, you would waste your money on tea that you won't understand.

review/summary: Simple Delicious Mix
review/text: Cookies from this mix are a staple at my house over the holidays. I typically add nothing extra to the mix other than the recommendations on the back. I like the drop cookies best, but mostly because they are the easiest. I find that chilling the cut-out recipe is helpful, but that's true of ALL cut-out cookie dough.<br /><br />This box is just 5 packs of sugar cookie mix. There is nothing else in this big box. But that said, the mix makes great cookies on their own (assuming you like sugar cookies), and it makes a lot of cookies per mix! (2-3 dozen, depends on how big your cookies are).

review/summary: Very easy and very good
review/text: I purchased this at a local warehouse club. I added to 1 pouch French Vanilla Blend extract (2 tsp.) and used a stick of room temperature butter. I did not melt the butter per instructions but I did add the 1 egg. Using a small sorbet scoop I rolled a small ball of dough and pressed it onto a plate of colored sugar, holly sprinkles and pareil multi-colored balls; all separately. I put 12 on a sheet of parchment on a baking pan and baked for 14 minutes at 350* F. They were very tasty. It was quick and easy. Now I know what to make when going over to a friend's house to hang out. The pouch made about 29 medium sized cookies. Almost 2 1/2 dozen. I won't give it a five bc I feel I shouldn't have to add French Vanilla Blend in order for them to taste yummy. That should already been in the mix. But then again, this mix is versatile. You could add peppermint extract and roll the balls in crushed peppermint candies. For another pouch I plan to add white chocolate chips and chopped macademia nuts, with a tiny dash of butterscotch extract. So maybe I should rate it a five. Nah,... the ingredients aren't organically-certified -that would rate a five star rating!!

review/summary: An all-time favorite.
review/text: I grew up in a family of tea drinkers; and although I now tend to have a lot of coffee while I'm at work, I still drink almost exclusively tea when I'm at home. I generally prefer loose leaf teas - that way I know I'll get "the real thing," whereas tea bags tend to contain merely the leftovers of a harvest; little crumbs too poor in aromatic and other content to otherwise pass quality control standards.<br /><br />The exception are Bigelow teas: and first and foremost among those their flagship, Ruth Bigelow's original "Constant Comment" with its recipe of black tea, orange grind and holiday spices (primarily cinnamon). Created by Mrs. Bigelow on the basis of an old colonial recipe over half a century ago, the blend soon became so popular among her friends that their "constant comments" of approval prompted Ruth and husband David Bigelow to found their own tea company. Since then, "Constant Comment" has long become a true classic ... and if you love tea, it is indeed the perfect refreshment; whether or not it's Christmas time. (E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.)<br /><br />If you're making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company's measuring directions - based on the the "one bag per cup" ratio, you'll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two. That said, though ... wanna come over for a cuppa?

review/summary: Good alternative when snacking
review/text: I really like these. I actually had them on the automatic delivery at my old place to help save a little more money. Younger people, or people who are not used to the flavorings of healthier foods, may be initially turned off by these. The cheddar powder helps, but they are still obviously not your typical cracker.<br />I would recommend these with a nice complementary hummus spread. This will help with that initial taste. Just make sure that the hummus you choose matches the topping already on the cracker! Some people might not like cheddar flavor mixed with an exotic-flavored hummus.<br />If you are not going to finish the whole package at once (like you might at a party), be sure to rebag these little treats. They will get stale pretty fast in their original packaging (it is not too sturdy, as other reviewers have mentioned, and the plastic packaging is not resealable), and they are not that good stale or too moistened from the air. Unlike some other cracker and cracker-like foods, these drop really fast in the flavor department once they are opened. Just keep them air-sealed, however, and they will be fine for a long time.<br />I also like to make nachos out of this flavor. Melt a nice little cheese concoction on the side, and these are great! Make it a cheese melt with some nicer cheeses, though, to keep the "high class" feel of them. :)<br />I agree that many of these will arrive broken. If you make a traditional nacho plate that is drizzled with cheese, the melted cheese will help hold together all of the little pieces. This way, you maximize your money per package.<br />Hope this helps your purchasing process.

review/summary: Powerfull chewers choice
review/text: I have 2 pitbulls who are VERY strong chewers. The adult male is an 85lbs "red nose" and has proven to chew through ANYTHING (metal and plastic crates, kongs, tires ect.)  and these antlers definitly last more than anything else he has tried, to include the "Jumbo Kong" which lasted a literal 30min before it was in pieces. The same goes for my 9month old puppy, a 55lbs female "blue nose". I have not noticed any smell from the antlers after chewing and the dogs seem to go crazy for these things. I have yet to find any other type of toy that satisfies and lasts against my dogs. Like most chew toys, I take them away from time to time to keep them lasting as long as possible and so my dogs dont get bored. Although I have tested out how long the antlers would last through daily chewing and most, depending on size, have lasted about 3 weeks. Still longer than most so called "indestructible" and more expensive toys I have bought. All in all, I am just as pleased with this purchase as my dogs are. I recommend to any owner of a strong chewing dog. Even just to try. What do you have to lose? Cant be no more than that last "Kong" you bought and was destroyed the first day. This review is for antlers as a whole and not specific to any particular brand, they all are close to the same. I hope this review helps.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE giving my two Labrador Retrievers elk antlers... They are the only chew that I have found that actually works and is not destroyed within a day or two! I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw that these two antlers were for $28! I bought them immediately. They arrived early this week, and upon opening the box - there was only one of them. The picture has has been shown, is showing two of them (same size but different color/shape). I am confused as to how many I should have gotten. I kind of feel led on, even though $28 isn't bad for an "X-Large Elk Antler".  My husband also measured this antler to be approximately the tip of the middle finger to the bottom on the hand. Maybe I have just been spoiled, but to me that does not constitute as an "X-Large Antler." Regardless - I am very happy at how excited my puppies get, will continue to buy antlers, but may have to do a little more research.

The packaging clearly states on the conatiner net 4oz but when I weighed the product WITH the packaging it was only around 3.1-3.5. Net means what is inside the package (the actual food) so I believe they are falsely advertising. I contacted the company and I got an "I'm sorry you feel this way" response. I ordered 2 different kinds thinking maybe it was just that one box. . . nope the other box was exactly the same. I would go with Jack's Havest brand. They truely are 1oz or 3oz cubes of food, less watery and do not waste plastic containers. They also throw in a free bag of foos sometimes. I will not be ordering from this company again:(

review/text: I found Yummy Spoonfuls through a great review on the today show online bites, I was wondering how shipping would work from Amazon for this frozen baby food. When it arrived, it was still completely frozen, although it had been in transit for 2 days. The packaging was perfect. More importantly, the food thaws quickly (when unpackaged), and tastes so incredibly fresh! My son (6.5 months) LOVES it! We had difficulties getting him to eat his veggies prior. It's a far cry from jarred/pouch baby food. Even the organic jarred'pouch baby food is nothing next to this stuff! I also used the broccoli for soups adding veggie broth, cream and spices. I know that by eating really fresh veggies and fruits now, my son will love to eat healthy, fresh vegetables as he get older. It's no wonder kids tend to dislike vegetables when they start out eating only the pouch/jarred variety that have no taste. The fresh contrast of the Yummy Spoonfuls food is strikingly delicious. We love this brand and recommend it, this is perfect if you don't have time to cook for your baby at home

review/summary: Pam -- Who Wants to Live Without It?
review/text: We use Pam every day. Who would like to cook without it? I know it saves us hundreds of calories, and it keeps our food from sticking.  It does not add anything objectionable to the taste of food. I spray it on the tops of food and place it under the broiler to brown food quickly and evenly.  My mother's life would have been easier if she had had Pam when she was cooking for her big family!<br /><br />When I developed the recipes for Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I used Pam cooking spray constantly.<br /><br />When we developed The Collard Patch, we used it to cook cornbread.  Here is one of our recipes people have raved about.<br /><br />MINCEMEAT CHEESE MUFFINS<br />Ingredients<br />Non-stick cooking spray (We use Pam <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HNAVU">PAM-Original No Stick Cooking Spray, 3/8oz Cans</a>).<br />1 (5�-ounce) Bisquick package All-Purpose Baking Mix (or 1' cup)<br />1 jar (11 ounces) Tiptree Mincemeat<br />2 eggs<br />� cup (2% fat) milk<br />1 tablespoon lemon juice<br />4 ounces (1 cup) extra sharp grated Cheddar<br />1 (8�-ounce) Jiffy package corn muffin mix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMTB8">Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix 24ct</a>)<br /><br />Preparation<br />--Preheat the oven to 350�.<br />--Spray the muffin tins.<br />--Mix the Bisquick and the mincemeat.<br />--Whisk the liquid ingredients in a large mixing bowl, and add the remaining ingredients.<br />--Spoon the muffin mix into the cups of the muffin tins.  (Caution:  Do not overfill the muffin cups.  These muffins will not rise high, and you don't want them to spread too much across the tops.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.
