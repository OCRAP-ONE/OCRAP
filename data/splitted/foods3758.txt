review/summary: A Handy Fig Newton Snack!
review/text: These are Fig Newtons, what can you say?  Everyone likes them (or not).  They are a nice-sized snack in a nearly indestructible foil wrapper.  You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!

review/text: When you have a family that loves fig newtons as much as mine, it is best to buy them by the case than depend<br />on grocery store sales which don't happen often on these cookies.  They are still the best quality with the most<br />filling and crunch of any fig cookies on the market so they are worth the extra expense over cheap no-name<br />brands.

review/summary: Nice Fresh Newtons
review/text: If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a "Newton" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the "best by" date.

review/text: This tea is naturally sweet without any sweetener.  It puts all other spice teas I have purchased to shame.  It's good hot or cold, but I mostly use it for iced tea that I keep handy in my refer at all times.  Who needs to buy soft drinks or green tea drinks when you can make this up for cheap.  When I make iced tea, I let it seep for a few hours so it's nice and spicy when cold.  Plus, one pound lasts for months.  You can't go wrong with this tea.

review/text: I discovered this tea on a trip to Pike's Market. I almost did not buy it because it indicated it had orange flavoring which I am not usually fond of. I noticed they had samples sitting out so I tried it. I did not really notice the orange flavor - mostly cinnamon and other similar flavors. There is no sugar or artifical sweetners in this which makes it even better!

review/summary: Great for dog purpose or a small amount of dirtied cat litter
review/text: Since these Bags on Board Cat Scoop Refills were offered at a ridiculously low price, I decided to take a chance that they would fit my doggie bag holders and they do fit both models I currently use!  I planned to tie a roll onto the leash with a rope if they didn't fit, but no need.  The bags are less stiff, thinner, are a prettier blue than the orange ones they've replaced, and I only wish I'd stocked up on more when the price was great.  Because the bags are thinner, they are easier to maneuver, weigh less and take less time to degrade in the landfill where they will spend some time.  I've never bought replacement rolls because it was too easy to use newspaper bags and deflated air pillows, but these are so much easier to carry and less distasteful for disposal.  They are the same size as the dog bags and for the life of me, I can't imagine how a lot of heavy litter can fit in this bag.  If you use it for a single scoop or two of just what needs to immediately be removed as I believe it is marketed, I can see how it would work well.  These are not for emptying an entire tray of litter.  Because these are really lightweight, they are perfect for the dog walking purpose.  Usually using two bags per day, these will go quickly and I hope Amazon soon reduces the price to entice more of us dog lovers to take advantage of a product that's marketed to cat owners but is imprinted with pictures of little doggies.

review/summary: Useless product
review/text: I bought the scoop and bags mostly for the bags being earth friendly.  The bags are too small, sure they fit the scoop, but my cat pees all in one corner so the clump can get huge.  Therefore won't fit in this narrow bag just wide enough for the scoop itself.<br />  The scoop itself is ok, but I still have my old scoop and I prefer it because the litter flows throw my old scoop better than this one.<br />  Bottom line: if you have a cat that makes just small to mediuim sized clumps, then this product might be ok.  I personally find no value in having the bags inside the hande of the scoop.  In fact I think the feel of the scoop is cumbresone.

review/text: I like that these litter bags are a green product and will break down in the landfill. My only dislike is the bags are narrow in size. I use a bag lined coffee can to collect the soiled litter in. With two cats I have to scoop at least once, sometimes twice, a day. When it's full, I pull the bag and dispose in the garbage. These bags aren't wide enough to secure over the container. Otherwise, they are great.

review/summary: Frontier Cinnamon delivers health as well as taste.
review/text: As a result of psychiatric problems, I regained 37 of the 60 pounds I had lost. I was desperate to avoid resuming my diabetes meds, which make me sick. I knew that cinnamon is known to lower blood sugar, and I eat a lot of fat-free, sugar-free  yogurt with frozen berries in it. I season the yogurt with cinnamon and Splenda. I actually eat about a quarter of a cup a day of cinnamon. My last A1C (a blood test that tells a person's average blood sugar over the last three months)was perfect! And this is such a good-tasting and smelling cinnamon; it's much better than the grocery store type, to say nothing of the dollar store type. I will definitely continue using this product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEICQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title

Just make sure you have someone to share the 'extra' with, or get some airtight containers,<br />as one pound worth is A LOT of cinnamon (and you are getting two!).

However, it's not in the best packaging. The resealable pouch has a scissor cutting line marked at the top. I cut along the line only to discover that the line was too low, so that there is now a gap between the seal and the edge of the pack, so the package is open to the air even when the seal was closed up. I just transferred it to another container.<br /><br />Note that this is Cinnamonium Burmannii (Indonesian / Kortinje mid-range cinnamon), not ceylon (true cinnamon) or cassia (the cheap stuff in the grocery store).

review/summary: Good Value and Fresh, Wonderful Smelling Spice!
review/text: This Cinnamon by Frontier is a very good value for the money, especially if you don't mind buying in bulk. The cinnamon has a fresh and wonderful taste and smell. Much better than any supermarket stuff. I keep the cinnamon fresh by putting it into freezer ziplock bags and freezing it. It's easy to take out of the freezer and use right from the bag, no thawing needed.<br /><br />As stated by a few other reviewers, this cinnamon is from Cassia and according to Wikipedia the "cinnamon" we get here isn't "true cinnamon" and it contains coumarin which is bad for your liver and kidneys at least. It's ok in small amounts and most people would never use a lot in their cooking that would do harm. According to the web site "spice page" you can eat up to one gram without getting the coumarin poisoning. PLEASE research this for yourself!<br /><br />So this cinnamon is not for people that take it for diabetes/sugar metabolism and other health benefits. USE THIS TYPE ONLY for use as a spice in your recipes or to sprinkle on food for added flavor.<br /><br />Frontier DOES sell the more expensive cinnamon that is good and beneficial to you. It's called Ceylon cinnamon, and it's the real deal. So if money is not an issue, or you are very concerned about your health and possible coumarin poisoning, please do not buy this type and go for the Ceylon Cinnamon.

review/text: I purchased this cinnamon to use in holiday baking and to replace my old outdated spices. I could care less about the raging health debate on which type of cinnamon is best eaten for health reasons. It has far exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend Frontier brand spices. Frontier brand spices in the pound size always arrive in sealed mylar bags which is an added value. Once I refilled my two Cinnamon spice containers I used my Foodsaver vacuum sealer and I resealed the mylar bag to keep the cinnamon fresh. Then I placed the mylar bags of Cinnamon in the back of my pantry out of the light to help the cinnamon stay fresh longer.<br /><br />Upon arrival I opened the bag of cinnamon and my kitchen was immediately filled with the delightful smell of cinnamon. The smell was like standing in the middle of a Cinnabon restaurant. Fresh, pungent, sweet wonderful cinnamon smell. It's good quality cinnamon and I held off reviewing this product until after I did my Thanksgiving baking. I love cinnamon and I have a tendency to have a heavy hand adding cinnamon in recipes. With this cinnamon you want to use level and accurate amounts or it will overpower the dish. I am hooked on all Frontier brand spices and I am replacing my old, outdated spices entirely with this Frontier brand.

review/summary: Great Cinnamon, great price
review/text: I am a big fan of Frontier products. You get a great product, a large amount, at a good price. A friend of mine and I split several orders (e.g. bay leaves as well cinnamon), because the quantity was so generous that it made it even a better deal when we shared one order between two of us.<br /><br />I love Cinnamon in just about everything. I add it to many of chicken and meat recipes (give them Moroccan flavor influence), I add it my brewing coffee, add it to apple pies, quick breads and cookies.<br /><br />I love the taste of it, but Cinnamon is pretty amazing in other aspects as well. Several studies shown that 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon per day can help lower LDL cholesterol. It is also known that cinnamon has regulatory effect on blood sugar, making it beneficial to people with typ2 diabetes. Cinnamon has shown ability to stop medication-resistant yeast infections. A study at Copenhagen University showed significant improvement in arthritis pain in patients who took 1/2 cinnamon powder and honey daily for a month. It is also a natural food preservative, and inhibits bacteria growth in food.<br /><br />Note that there is a difference between "Ceylon cinnamon" and herb "Cassia" which looks and tastes like cinnamon. Cassia contains higher amounts of coumarin and coumarin is responsible for some side effects listed below:<br /><br />1) Skin Irritation: the essential oil of cinnamon applied directly to the skin causes irritation. Small amounts of diluted oil are beneficial, but full strength oil is an irritant.<br />2) Stomach Irritation: people with stomach ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome can cause stomach lining irritation. They should use it in small amounts only and diluted with other ingredients.<br />3) Increased heat rate: Large amounts of cinnamon increase heart rate in some people with heart conditions.<br />4) Blood thinning: Some studies shown that cinnamon has anti-clotting properties, and people taking other blood thinners should be careful. Large doses of cinnamon should be avoided after surgery or during heavy menstruation.<br />5) Kidney and Liver problems: Large amounts of coumarin can be toxic to kidney and liver.<br />6) Blood Sugar: People taking medication to control blood sugar should be careful with taking cinnamon as cinnamon has effect on blood sugar. Consult with your doctor if taking both.<br />7) Antibiotics: Cinnamon has antibiotic effect. If you taking both prescription antibiotics and cinnamon in large doses, consult your doctor about possible interactions.<br /><br />Frontier Cinnamon is fragrant and good value. I recommend it.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Cassia helped me, however, will try Ceylon cinnamon
review/text: I have been reading that only Ceylon Cinnamon helps with diabetes, cholesterol and weight loss.  Up until now, I did not realize this and have been using the so-called cheap cinnamon.  I started at 170 pounds and a size 12, within 3 weeks I had dropped to a size 10, by  12 weeks I was into a size 8.  I am now a size 2, have lost 50 pounds, that occurred by 6-7 months.  My blood sugar was 289 fasting and a HgbA1c of 10.8, I never started any medications.  I have a 2 hour postprandial blood sugar in the 80's and my HgbA1c is 5.4. I had a high 300's cholesterol and my triglycerides were close to 500 and that was with medication.  My doctor has taken me off cholesterol pills and has cut my blood pressure pill in half. Even with BP medication, I always ran high, now sometimes I am actually very low in the 90/50's range first thing in the morning.  Okay, I did stop eating the bread and the potato chips, dip, however, I had done that in the past and without the cinnamon, well I would lose a few pounds and that was it.  With that being said, I will try the Ceylon Cinnamon, apparently it is healthier than the cheap stuff.

review/summary: False cinnamon
review/text: This is not cinnamon. This is cassia which has been implicated in liver and kidney disease. In fact, it is illegal to call this product "cinnamon" in most European countries. Only "Ceylon Cinnamon" is the real, healthy spice, good for heart, glucose and joints.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE BOTTLED WATER
review/text: I drink 5-6 bottles of Ozarka Water 365 days per year. In the summer if I am outside and active I may consume a few more. I found the best buy for these at Walmart and I usually go through a case every 5 days. Soda pop and caffeine products are unhealthy especially if you are over 50. Every bottled water product has it's own unique taste. I find Ozarka to be my favorite in The Ole South area of Greater Memphis which is where I live in Helena, Arkansas.

review/summary: High Quality and Perfectly Packaged Dry Soy Beans
review/text: Clearly a high-end product and exactly as advertised. Four individual fully sealed and labeled plastic bags within a outer cardboard carton with printed graphics and text. The beans are consistent in size and color, with no observable remnants or contaminants, and odorless. Labeled "Certified Organic by QAI", "Product of the USA" and "USDA Organic". Cooking instructions, various uses, website and other useful information is provided.<br />Our intended use is to make Japanese Natto, which is a fermented form, and not particularly appealing unless you know and love traditional Japanese food. We are in the food distribution business in Japan and here in Hawaii. Even though Soy Beans are grown on our island, we needed a very high quality ingredient to prepare Natto correctly which wasn't obtainable here. My wife, who is from Shizuoka Prefecture, thinks these beans are premium, and we spent all afternoon yesterday preparing a full 24oz/680g package for controlled fermentation overnight. While the finishing process outcome will be to our discretion, the staple product (the beans), are unquestionably high-end. And the price was excellent. The outer carton has "Sell By 04-16-2014" and is also perforated for use as a retail display.<br />I think we'll be buying LOTS more of this product.<br />Aloha,  John

review/text: I've been drinking jasmine tea for over 20 years. But it usually can't be found in a grocery store.

review/summary: is this green tea with jasmine essential oil?
review/text: I just bought this at the local chinese market - Great Wall - and I found the taste too "bright". It tasted too perfumey, as if all they did was get some green tea and added jasmine essential oil. The tea smells EXACTLY like Honeysuckle essential oil that I add to the bath - so I was feeling a little funny drinking this tea instead of soaking in it.<br /><br />After I got over the taste of the essential oil, I realized it is a nice perfumey taste, but I am used to the tin boxes you can get at the Chinese store and when you open up the canister - there is dried up tiny white jasmine flowers that add to the fragrance.  This tastes nothing like the chinese jasmine tea that I am used to.  It tastes like a pumped up essential oil of jasmine added to green tea. I am very disappointed in the taste. Well, I only spent $2.99 on it, so I am tossing it, and going back to see if I can get another brand. Disappointed because I can't find the loose leaf tea with the tiny flowers.<br /><br />By the way - there is nothing quite like the flavor sensation of real chinese jasmine tea while munching on crystalized chinese ginger.  However, this tea is so strident in its flavoring that I am not sure you would be able to taste the crystalized giner.<br /><br />I looked up another of their jasmine teas - and here they clearly talk about the real jasmine flowers in the tea.  That is not so with this product. This product is fine if you enjoy this taste - but for me, it is nothing like the ones with real flowers.

review/summary: Plum Matcha is Plum Good!
review/text: This plum Matcha is so deliciously good.  It evokes fond memories of my gramma's delicious plum jelly that she'd make every fall.  It's a little sweeter than a fresh plum, but, still so very true to the fruit.<br /><br />But what I like even more is how well the Plum flavor showcases the flavor of the Matcha here.  The Matcha shines through as a bittersweet, vegetative flavor.  Creamy and smooth.  No chalky taste whatsoever, and no chalky aftertaste either.<br /><br />The matcha also has interesting spice notes that appear with the flavor of the Plum... not super spicy or anything, but just enough to everything lively and delicious.  I love the way the matcha tastes with the plum flavor, it seems like combining the two profiles have brought out the very best flavors in both!<br /><br />Really good!

review/summary: Plum Awesome!
review/text: Oh Matcha my Matcha. I salute you.<br />This for me has been the easiest to drink straight!<br />Its so smooth.<br />Is it "natural" flavored? Well although I know Red Leaf Tea does use all natural flavoring in its matcha I can't really say if this tastes natural or not. I honestly have not had that many plum flavored things but its really very immensely good! Its not even that it tastes unnatural and it does not taste the least bit chemical but its just such a strong awesome flavor that it is so hard for me to imagine how they got all that into the little tiny flavor granuals! The aroma of this one was INTENSE when I opened the bag! It has a punch like flavor to it but yet there is this almost nutty after taste - probably the mixture of the wonderful base tea mixed with this particular fruit. Its really quite different! I enjoy seeing how different flavors play off the matcha base! I think this is one of the more complex matcha I have tried. Its not exactly what you might think it would be with the nutty flavor coming out at the end but it is most definitively plum in the beginning. I like how the nutty sneaks up on me!

This is truly a special blend that is very flavorful.  While visiting South Dakota, we stopped for coffee, but the flavor we ordered was not available.  The barista suggested Highlander Grogg and after one sip, we were very happy for the switch.  To this day, when we drink this coffee, it immediately takes us back to that vacation.  Ahhh ...  you'll really enjoy this coffee.  Rated a 4 only because it would be better if it were a little bit stronger.

review/summary: Awesome coffee!  If you like flavored coffees, don't pass this one up.
review/text: My wife's sister lives in St. Louis, and she sent us a pack of coffees from Kaldi's.  One was Cinnamon Hazelnut (good), but the best one was Kaldi's Highlander Grogg.  I like flavored coffees, but Highlander Grogg became my new all time favorite.  We soon ran out, and I turned to Amazon for more.  Unfortunately, Kaldi's Highlander Grogg is never in stock from them so I tried to find an alternative, and found Berres Brothers.  I found it just as good, and, you can't beat their price.<br /><br />If you want to really take it up a notch, I would encourage you to try the following recipe:<br />1.  Look on Amazon for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E170W">BonJour Primo Latte Frother with Stand, Black/Brushed Aluminum</a>.<br />2.  Buy International Delight creamer (we use the SUGAR FREE, made with Splenda version).  It won't work with CoffeeMate as that creamer doesn't froth for some reason.<br />3.  Pour the creamer in the cup first.<br />4.  Add any additional Splenda or other sweetener of your choice.<br />5.  Use the Primo Latte Frother to "froth" the creamer into a foam.<br />6.  Add coffee, and enjoy!  (of course, you can always sprinkle the froth with cinnamon, nutmeg, or pumpkin pie spice also).  You can also buy sugar free caramel and drizzle that over the top for both decoration and additional taste.<br /><br />The above is as good as any $5 latte bought at a coffee shop, and, you've saved a ton of money over the course of a year.<br /><br />We have been enjoying this for years now at our house, and we recently opened our new corporate headquarters office.  We now have the same setup at work, and our employees love it.

review/text: There is a very wise saying that has been in existence since the beginning of cultural societies, it goes something like this:  "Of Tastes and Colors, no authors have written".<br />Why? Because even though one always prefer to go with the majority (prevents discord and harsh rebuttals), sometimes you just can't say "Oh I really like this" even if you do not. Sometimes you have to walk on eggshells to avoid offending people's sensibilities!<br />I have found this to be the case when admiring art or good wine. If you happen to be in the midst of so called connoisseurs you are frown upon, as if your opinion by being in contradiction with theirs, is like rebellious as well as ignorant. Don't cast pearls into swines and all that good stuff...<br />Enter Berres Brothers Coffee Roasters Highlander Grogg Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3). Yes, I knew it was going to be flavored, and by definition flavored coffee has the same reputation as menthol cigarettes (the rumor was it that they use the left overs of all the other tobaccos and create the line), so it applies to coffee as well according to some savvy baristas.<br />Perfect 5 Star rating. Now, why would any one would want to rate it any lower? Just to contradict the rest, and shatter that perfect shinning 5 star record? After all, 15 reviewers is a bit more than a couple of die hard, loyal fans of the company (or family, etc). Because it is not all that great, is our answer. Tried it black and it had almost a distilled and bitter taste. Covered it with cream, powder and liquid, and lots of sugar and it did not rise to the stellar category in which it has been placed. Coffee with a strong after taste, with more than one flavor that in the end failed to impress.<br />I immediately went into damage control: had different beans of regular coffees (in bean form) and grind all the beans and mix them with the Highlander Grogg. With enough sugar and cream, even chicory becomes passable, but when a coffee is this good it should stand alone preferably black so as to taste the intricate nature of its excellence.<br />WoW, far out and right on. Hazelnut, caramel, vanilla, etc., is not easy to tell where the coffee begins and the flavors end. 2 Stars.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Let me start by saying, this is not "bad" coffee.  Infact, it's actually quite good.  But I would not call it Highlander Grogg.<br /><br />I used to buy Highlander Grogg from a little shop in San Diego's old town.  Amazing stuff.  They went out of buisness, so I started looking for the same coffee.  This is not it.<br /><br />Beeres Brothers "version" of grogg smells heavily of cherries for some reason, and after brewing, doesn't smell or taste much different than plain old forgers.  It's not bad, just not very good, and NOT what I was expecting.<br /><br />But then again, maybe I was just spoiled by the best coffee in the world.  Who knows.  Give it a try, maybe you'll like it better than me.  But I won't be buying it again anytime soon.

review/summary: Good-bye boring chicken
review/text: I first discovered the Teeny Tiny Spice products when I was visiting Vermont, and I am thrilled that Amazon is carrying their products. These are not your ordinary spices! The Penang Curry is not hot, and it is not like the jars of curry powder we are used to seeing. It is more of an herb blend (organic) with very complex flavors. The spices are fresh, and I don't believe there is any salt added to this blend. There are two recipes right on the can, and the website has many recipes using their spice mixtures. I highly recommend using this for the chicken satay recipe. A little spice mixture goes a long way. These mixtures make excellent gifts for the foodies in your life. So long to boring chicken and pork!

The second one I opened up seemed ok so I prepared the bucket according to the directions. When I tasted it after it was frozen however it had a funny taste to it and wasn't drinkable! Will probably just throw out the 3rd bucket as well! Really dissapointed with this.

review/text: I purchased the 6-pack deal on this tea, which was a great bargain.  I'm used to paying a lot for one box of it, so that was nice.  Target seems to carry all the other Bigelow tea types, but I have had trouble finding this one recently so I took advantage of the on-line "wholesale"deal.  Anyways, the tea itself is great.  It has a spice to it that I find Holiday-ish. (It reminds me of Thanksgiving). Just a nice chai flavor. I find it tasty and love that it's still green tea.  I've been drinking this each morning for several months now and really look forward to it.  I took off one star only because I remember having it last year and maybe it's just my memory, but I felt like it tasted a bit more flavorful then than now.  I will definitely keep buying this product, however, since I can't find anything that even comes close to it green tea-wise.

review/summary: By far my favorite ready to eat Indian dish from ANY brand!
review/text: I purchase and eat a ton of these. While I generally enjoy Indian food out, most of the home stuff is too oily or too bland or boring. Much of it lacks the punch you get from freshly cooked and properly spiced Indian food. This has been the ONE thing I have found that breaks that mold. It has very nice favor but isn't too spicy to scare away people. It makes an excellent meal alone or with a microwaved tub of white rice under it. It will fill you up without being a ton of calories too which makes it good choice if you are watching your calorie intake.<br /><br />While it is amazing you can take it camping or use it as an MRE, it is just as amazing for a very quick (90 seconds!) meal whenever you want it. My wife likes it so much she gave some to her father who came from the east indies and cooks very similar foods. Talk about an endorsement.

review/summary: If in doubt,buy! Won't be disappointed-Great gift,flavor&price!
review/text: My husband has raved about Slap Stix from his childhood (he's in his 40's.) He thought they had stopped making them because he hasn't been able to find them anywhere in over 10 years. For an early holiday gift and to try them myself, I decided to look online to see if they were still made, found & bought some. After tasting these, I see why he loved them. The flavor is really unmatched by any of the candies out there today. Although it says "lollipop" in some of the descriptions, its really more of a taffy and caramel blend on a stick that you can lick but will end up chewing.<br />  Its based in caramel with flavored taffy's swirled in-the yellow is banana, and is the flavor most tasted along with the caramel. The white gives hints of vanilla, while the pink I think just adds to the sweetness. These are not too sweet or overwhelming though, and while the combination sounds a little off, when it comes together in this candy, it tastes wonderful. It does have different textures while chewing-Soft caramel, taffy in the pink and yellow, and a fluffy nugget like consistency to the white swirl.<br />  Buying from another online site before, I'd recommend buying from Amazon instead simply because of some packages being Prime eligible and variety of options (Count of bulk, buying alone, or in gift baskets with other candies of the same era.) If you plan on buying candy gift baskets by era's, I would suggest getting a package of these as well and adding more to the basket or even adding them to gifts with the bows and ribbon. However, these aren't something I'd recommend for a person with dentures. These are hard to find locally, so online is the way to go. I'm definitely buying again, only this time I'll save on shipping and go with Amazon. Hope this helps those who haven't had them before but have a friend raving about them:)

All of bionaturae pastas are excellent as well.<br /><br />After a little research on pasta there are some helpful hints that work with all types of pasta but are especially important with gluten free spaghetti.<br />Use as much water as your pot can hold, want good spaghetti, buy a bigger pot or use two pots that are appropriate for 6 ounces of pasta instead of 12 ounces.<br />*** Lots of water is vital to prevent spaghetti from sticking together.****<br />Too little water, the pasta becomes sticky as well as mushy.<br />NEVER add oil, I know it seems like a great idea but not only does not prevent spaghetti from sticking together but actually makes it more likely to occur.<br /><br />Adding salt to water is helpful but not necessary.<br /><br />Try adding your spaghetti very quickly, not slowly a few pieces at a time.  Again, it seems like a good idea but it promotes sticky & mushy pasta.  Why you ask?  Because all pastas gluten free and non gluten free release  a starchy substance that coats the pasta with in the first 2-3 minutes of being placed in boiling water.  This is commonly called glutinous starch but of course it is not the wheat, rye or barley protein gluten.  So adding individual strands prolongs this process of starch releasing and coating the strands of pasta increasing the likelihood of spaghetti stuck together. **** This is why is very, very important to use lots of water, and stir the pasta in the boiling water for the first 2-3 minutes to disperse the coating of sticky starch.****<br /><br />Then proceed with package directions on timing of pasta.  Of course I occasionally am distracted and boil the spaghetti noodles too long and am reward with mush.<br /><br />Best of Luck.<br /><br />PS my gluten free friend, Glutenfrieda is now making ice cream sandwiches that excellent.

review/summary: The best Gluten Free Spaghetti
review/text: Bionaturae GF Spaghetti tastes better then any others that we tried. It's made from rice, potato and soy. It's very fast to cook - 6 min, and no need to drain. It's important to follow instructions and cook the exact time listed on the package, otherwise it will get too soft. It's a perfect texture, and I like it now even better then the glutenous spaghetti that I used to it. It's a great price here, and I can't wait till it comes back in stock.

review/summary: Best gluten free pasta by far!
review/text: I have tried every gluten-free pasta I could find, and this one comes the closest to the pasta I remember and loved, before celiac.  It cooks quickly and needs no rinsing, yet it does not turn to mush like so many of the rice pastas do.  It's made by a company in Italy that has been making pasta since forever, and they really know how to do it.  I just wish, fervently, that someone in the States would do it as well, so I don't have to feel global-warming guilty about shipping it all the way from Italy just to satisfy my pasta craving.

review/summary: Excellent gluten-free pasta!
review/text: This product is truly delicious!  Easy to fix and tastes like pasta!  Not like other brands in which you'll taste the corn or potato ingredients.  Only one negative...it keeps going up in price!  Then again, what isn't going up in price these days?!!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I needed gluten-free pasta, and this looked like it would fill the bill. The first time I used it, I followed the directions to the letter, and it was gummy. The next time I cooked it, I ignored the directions and rinsed it thoroughly -- it was better, but still too limp and gummy. If you must eat gluten-free food, this will give you an edible facsimle of spaghetti, but don't expect it to be like "the real thing." It IS gluten-free, and it wasn't inedible, but I probably will not purchase it again.
