review/summary: Decent granola
review/text: Addendum to my review...  I left my original review unedited below.  I edited my star rating at behest of my wife.  She really liked Dr. Flynn's granola, but did not think it was the "best ever."  However, considering she is a granola lover too, I cannot discount her powerful opinion.  We sat down and had a taste test with various granolas.  I concede that Dr. Flynn's can hold its own in any comparison, but it certainly does not distance itself either; it is within the peloton.  I also concede that my original scathing review was the result of inflated expectations based on the existing glowing reviews.  We are unsure if we would purchase this again.  Our overall favorite remains Nature's Path.<br /><br />Ok.  My wife got me addicted to Natures Path Hemp granola and their pumpkin seed granola about seven years ago.  Those cereals are so good I crave them, and I never liked granola before.  We had been buying the Natures Path granola at local grocers and kept getting stuck in the eye, so I was happy to see that I could get orders of six at a time through Amazon for a good price.  I was recently re-ordering the granola when I noticed that Dr. Flynn's Organic granola was actually rated higher, by reviewers, than the Natures Path that I love so dearly.  How could that be possible, I thought, so I ordered three bags of the stuff to try it out.<br />Wow, was I surprised!  There are things on this good Earth that are inherent truths that cannot be seen otherwise.  Baby hugs and kisses are wonderful things.  Murder is bad.  Natures Path granola is absolutely delicious.  These statements cannot be effectively argued against.  Dr. Flynn's granola, however, is no where near being a universal good.  I would rate it no better than what a reasonable home chef could prepare on the fly.  It is essentially just rolled oats, nuts, raisins, coconut, sugar, and some cinnamon.<br />I sincerely believe that there is no way that all of those glowing reviews are real, as I do not believe that such a high percentage of people could have mistaken Dr. Flynns granola for a 5 star product.  It tastes like granola.  Below average granola.<br />If you must find out for yourself, I strongly recommend you try one bag instead of my three.  I got burned.

review/text: I love this granola.  I met Dr. Flynn at an outdoor market in St. Petersburg, FL, and bought one bag.  I was hooked and was glad to find it available on Amazon.  I think this is a healthy granola.  My only complaint is that I think the price is high, but I understand that she is a small producer.

review/summary: Exceptional Granola!
review/text: While I do know granola (making my own on a semi-regualar basis), I've not had much stomach for commercial varieties.  Why?  They are generally geared to the over-sugared and undefinable flavor profiles you see in a lot of store-bought supermarket kid cereals -- not to my taste at all.  But Dr. Flynn's blew me away!  Not too sweet (but definitely sweet enough) with lively flavors and textures that dance in your mouth!  I shared this with my English husband who loves European meusli and can be quite the granola critic, and he loved it, too.<br /><br />Dr. Flynn, you've got some die-hard fans in Brooklyn!

review/text: The good:  Nice, full bodies vanilla.  It is wonderful for baking.  Dark bottle is great since it keeps the vanilla from being exposed to light.<br /><br />The bad:  The opening is kind of small and I think this is what causes a drop or two to go down the side every time I use it.  This means I am wasting vanilla, and that is why it loses a star for this.

review/summary: Fruity floral
review/text: ***** I stand corrected by a customer below my review that this vanilla does indeed contain alcohol *****<br /><br />Never thought I would order any kind of flavoring from the internet who does that, I do now.  The big spice company McCormick has been my choice for many spices and vanilla for years.  I have wondered about all of the more exotic choices but my hyper grocery store doesn't carry but their own brand or McCormick.  So gave the Totonac vanilla a try and was surprised at the difference.  First off their brand does not have contain alcohol..hmmm didn't know there was such a thing.  Also if you smell the one that does have the alcohol and then the Totonac the first one starts to take on a medisnell smell.  All this being said the taste is in the pudding as the saying goes.  I made various baked goodies and noticed a tangible difference.  The Totonac offers a much more floral/fruity vanilla taste.  Lastly the cost is significantly less than store bought also.  Give this a try and find yourself looking for excuses to make treats just because this is so good.

review/summary: Totonac vanillas are the best!
review/text: I have been baking since.. well.. middle school at least :)  And like most of you out there, I used whatever spices and extracts I could get at the grocery store.  Of course, McCormick was there, as well as whatever store brand, artificial vanilla, etc. I've used Watsons.  I've used them all.<br />And then one day, I started working with recipes that required vanilla beans, and I found a fabulous source in-state that imported fresh beans. And after some amazing quality beans arrived, I also bought the vanilla extract they carried, which was Totonac. And just like pliable, freshly imported vanilla beans are to those dried up sticks you pay a fortune for in the grocery store, this stuff is worlds ahead of your average vanilla find at the store.<br /><br />The first one I tried was Mexican, which is considered, historically, as close to "real" vanilla as we can get.  But, our modern pallates are actually suited towards Madagascar and Tahitian vanillas.  While the Mexican extract worked, the Madagascar vanilla by Totonac gives more of that "home baked" smell and taste we're all used to.  It doesn't taste like a vanilla flavored mouthwash like the stuff at the store.  No, this is much more natural flavor.<br />I will NEVER go back to store bought or artificial ever again.  I use this brand in my baking, and I buy from Amazon, since it's the cheapest you'll find this product anywhere (especially considering free shipping with the subscription!).  I go through one 3-pack once a year, sometimes twice a year if I'm selling a lot of baked goods or making tons of cookies and sweets for friends and family.  If you just occasionally bake, this 3 pack will last you just about forever.<br /><br />A little off topic, yet related:  For those looking at the winter/holiday baking season coming up, I'd also highly suggest looking into a good cinnamon.  Just like natural vanilla vs artificial, a good cinnamon will make your baked goods phenomenal.  I buy Frontier's Korintje cinnamon, which is the "cinnabon" cinnamon.  I have yet to reorder.. the stuff is strong, and they sent me 2 lbs last time I ordered!  LOL.  And dirt cheap to boot! I got 2 lbs here on Amazon for what my local grocer would charge for just 2 bottles of the good stuff.<br /><br />Good baking to you!

review/summary: Deliciously Amazing
review/text: You absolutely cannot beat this deal- you essentially get 12 ounces for the price of about 1 1/2 ounces. The aroma and taste is simply divine- so much better than the basic extract you can find in a supermarket. Yes, it drips a little, but it is because of the glass bottle, which I prefer to have rather than a plastic one. It helps to slightly and gently twist your wrist as you are almost finished pouring. If you are really concerned about the dripping and use it frequently, then purchase a plastic squeeze bottle (for food/liquids), cover it with a dark colored tape to keep the light out, transfer the extract, then squeeze away, drop-free.

review/summary: We love dried cherries but.....
review/text: We have been purchasing Traverse Bay cherries in the 14 oz packages for some time but moved to an area where they weren't readily available.  So we had this delivered several times through the Amazon subscription service (which is a terrific service, by the way).<br /><br />It would have been a convenient and decently priced solution, but the cherries arrived kind of sticky and gummed together.  We suspect it has to do with shipping?  They are okay to use in cooking, for example I eat them every morning in hot oatmeal, but they aren't good for use in snacking, salads, etc.  After the second delivery arrived in same condition we gave up and have found a source for the smaller bags at a decent price and they arrived in a much more palatable condition.

review/text: These are, the MOST delicious, dried sour cherries we've ever bought! They are sweetened just enough, don't stick together in a lump, are just slightly juicy, have no preservatives AND taste great refrigerated! For those who are wondering, 4# just fits in a 1-gallon zip lock bag. On the package, it says a serving size is 1/3 cup and there are 21 servings, in each bag. They are finally available for the subscribe and save. (I'm very glad!) I slightly prefer the cherries in the 4# box over the 2# bags, for some reason they seem just ever-so-slightly fresher.  But, I usually buy the version that is cheaper per pound.  I will buy these again!

review/summary: You don't have to be a health food fan to love these
review/text: A while back I decided to work toward adopting a healthier diet.  I try to avoid snacking bc, let's face it,  gaining weight might be effortless but losing weight is anything but. Initially I tried apples but they cause GI issues. Cherry is my favorite flavor anyway. The local supermarket sells small bags of dried cherries but they are too expensive to buy except for special occasions.<br /><br />When I found out I could buy dried cherries in bulk on amazon I was thrilled.  Initially I signed up to have them delivered every three months, but they only lasted 6 weeks. :)  This is the first healthy snack that does not take willpower to stick to - these cherries taste as good as candy. (If they come out of the bag stuck together running them under warm water will take care of that.)<br /><br />So far I have added them to yogurt and that is delicious...  but I enjoy eating them straight out of the bag.

review/summary: better quality than some
review/text: If you happen to dote on dried very tart cherries I suppose this is better quality than some. It disappointed us after all the good reviews. The texture was like very large raisins. The taste was not just tart but really sour. The only sweetness was from the added sugar, not the cherry juice you might expect. I think you'd have to be a special sour cherry lover to enjoy snacking on this product, and I don't think most kids would go for it. I'm not sure we'll be able to finish our first order.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these as I am not too fond of sour cherries. However since they are reported to be good for arthritic inflammation I thought it would be worth a try. They are a bit tart but very tasty. Just don't eat something sweet before trying them, makes them taste very sour! Don't know yet if it works for the inflammation but will continue eating them and hope it helps.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: Traverse Bay dried cherries are great for baking or just eating by themselves. Excellent taste and texture. I used to be able to find a four pound box in the grocery store at the holidays, but now I can only locate smaller (around one cup) bags of cherries when I attempt to shop local, so I turned to Amazon.<br /><br />What I love about these cherries is that they arrive in two bags and that the bags are resealable. It makes it much easier to keep an extra bag on hand when I need it. Buying in the larger quantity also reduces the cost, especially compared to the small sizes in the grocery stores. I will purchase these again!

review/summary: The best dried cherries!
review/text: I've ordered a number of different kinds of dried fruits, but never cherries, and never from the Traverse Bay Fruit Co.  These are perfect - moist, sweet and tart, and a bit chewy.  I bought them to use in baking, but I'm not sure they will last that long.  My only (slight) issue is that I would love to find these unsweetened, or at least sweetened with fruit juice, but that won't stop me from re-ordering.

review/summary: Dried tart cherries from the Cherry Capital of the world!
review/text: My first experience with dried tart cherries was when I went to visit a friend from Traverse City, Michigan about ten years ago. As a teenager, she had worked in the cherry plant removing pits from the fruit, not uncommon for natives of the Cherry Capital. She took me down to Meijers to buy a box of dried tart cherries to carry home on the plane as a special treat.<br /><br />Then a few years ago, I began buying cherries at Trader Joe's and they became a pantry staple for me. Once I realized my friend could get them on sale at Meijers and ship them to me for a significant savings and slight quality advantage over the ones I had been buying, I asked her to do that several times. It never occurred to me to look for them on Amazon where the cost is about the same as having them shipped from Traverse City and I won't have to bother my friend.<br /><br />Normally I do not buy sweetened fruit of any kind but the slight amount of sugar is necessary due to the tartness of the cherries, much as lemonade or cranberry juice must be sweetened, and it is completely unnoticeable. A slight bit of oil is also required to keep them from turning into a solid mass of moist chewy goodness!<br /><br />A few of these are great in smoothies, but not too many, as the flavor is very intense. I also enjoy them in oatmeal and cold cereals, with milk chocolate, and out-of-hand as a snack. Once, after carelessly mistaking them for raisins and adding them to scones, I got a very pleasant surprise! They are great in rice pudding, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, ice cream, and chicken salad.<br /><br />A wonderful one-dish lunch or light summer supper is "Barley, Bacon and Avocado Salad with Roasted Chicken", but with these dried tart cherries added. The recipe is easy to find on the internet.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to go to Traverse City to see the cherry blossoms or the fall leaves up on the peninsula, please take advantage of the opportunity as you will surely enjoy it. Now if I could just get Honeybell tangelos from Amazon, I'd be set!

review/text: After enjoying Craisens for years on hikes and in our oatmeal, etc., it's a wonderful change to enjoy these cherries.  Full of succulent flavor, they make a healthy and delicious snack anytime.  I like the resealable plastic bag; just the right size that we don't need to refrigerate them once opened.  A wonderful way to get your fruit allotment out of season, too.  I haven't used them in cookies since they're great as-is; seems like they'd be too large for cookies, at least the small oatmeal cookies I bake.

They can be frozen if you buy in bulk and are well priced.  My family prefers them over dried cranberries or raisins as a snack.  They are wonderful tossed in a salad, cooked in oatmeal, baked in cookies or added to granola mix.  They have become a staple in my house.

review/summary: The Best Dried Cherries, Period!!!
review/text: I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried cherries and cranberries. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />Dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites and I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years. None of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried cherries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried cherries then look no further. By the way if you love cherries and have never been to the cherry fest in Traverse City then I highly recommend you check it out. Its a great time!!<br /><br />5 Stars!

Food is an item that could be adulterated by a evil-thinking customer, then returned.  We would not want a 'returned food item' to eat.<br /><br />I complained and got a curious letter of apology from a real person and the data that she had authorized a "apology payment" to me for some $60.  I sent her a very nice thank you, only to have it return with the notice that I had replied to a "no reply" address.<br /><br />I will never buy any food item from Amazon.<br /><br />I've bought many thousands of dollars of stuff from Amazon and like their sevices, but "buyer beware" because this is not you corner grocery store.

review/text: These olives are nothing special, just ok.  The brine they are in is especially rather weak-kneed, and when I first tasted them I ended up putting them in dill pickle juice to store them in the fridge.  Adds enough zip to them so they are more fun to eat (they don't really end up with much of the dill taste).  You do get a good amount of olives in the can.  It's not a case of a lot of brine and few olives.<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Most likely.  But it's definitely not a case of "Wow! Those are really good!"  It's more of a convenience factor of having a large can of olives open in the fridge which makes it simple to add a bunch to salads.

review/summary: Y U M M Y......S A R D I N E S !  : ),
review/text: I have recently read an article on salmon fishing, in "BEST LIFE" magazine.  It reports, sadly, that salmon, (and presumably other fish), taken from Norwegian seas has a very good chance of having a lot of pollutants, due to "fish-farming" in most of these waters.  The waters of Scotland come off much better than Norwegian waters -- even for wild-caught fish.  The Bristling Sardines from Crown Prince, here reviewed, are both from the waters of Scotland, AND are wild caught!  So, one can eat them without much of the fear of mercury or other poisoning, currently associated with eating fish!<br /><br />Soybean oil may not be as good for one as Olive oil...but one does save by buying fish in soybean instead of olive oil.  The fish are covered with the oil, of course, but if one is careful, and s.l.o..w...(especially in taking off the flip top lid), the oil will stay mainly in the container, and not go onto table or into the sink.  The sardines are semi-dry -- and extremely tasty! The heads have all been cut off, of course...but some of the tails do remain.  The sardines are, indeed, "packed like sardines"...very closely together.  One does get a full 3 3/4 ounces, as stated on the individual cardboard package in which each tin comes, and there is NOT an excessive amount of oil --just enough to keep the sardines covered and as moist as possible.  However, I do wish that Crown Prince -- and every other brand of sardines -- would list a "Net DRAINED Weight", so one could get an idea of how much fish, and how much, (usually uneaten) oil, is present.<br /><br />The taste is adequate -- though I've had better from other brands.  However, a little bit of sugar, and/or spices, help with the flavour of anything.  For the price, this is a good deal for anyone who likes to eat sardines!

review/summary: Great Price.  Free shipping!
review/text: My kids love the cooler version of Capri Sun.  What made my purchase a great experience was that it was cheap and included free shipping, which is a huge deal because 4 boxes of Capri Sun is heavy.  If I had to pay for shipping, I probably wouldn't have gotten it.  I ordered to sets and it was delivered seperately about 1 week apart; however, I didn't care because the price was unbeatable.  Thank you.

review/summary: Deceptive labeling, contains HFCS
review/text: Capri Sun Coolers, state that they contain NO "artificial colors, flavors or preservatives" on the packaging but yet they contain High Fructose Corn Syrup? HFCS is chemically altered and unnatural and therefore is an artificial flavor. I found this labeling misleading and untrue. I wish they would use real sugar instead of HFCS. I know it costs a little more, but I believe parents would be willing to pay the extra money especially when it comes to our kids health. I know I would...KRAFT, please change your packaging and consider making the switch to REAL sugar.

review/summary: My go-to seaoning for making Carne Guisada
review/text: This product, also available in a 5 oz container, is the perfect combination of flavors for making Carne Guisada tacos. Carne guisada is a Mexican form of beef stew, and works well in a crock pot. I cube the meat, brown it on all sides, then cook on low in a crock pot overnight. I get up at 5am, mix the spices in 1/2 cup of warm water, although I do not use as much as they recommend, and add the spices <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087DTQ5C">Bolner's Fiesta Carne Guisada Seasoning 20oz</a> to the crock pot, stirring well, then leave it on for 1 more hour. Heat the tortillas, then serve the carne guisada in a taco format.

review/text: Although other reviewers note that they find this cup of coffee "weak", my husband finds this t-disc his favorite, both because it gives a full cup of coffee (unlike other T-discs), and because it is NOT too strong.<br />That's what is great about the T-discs; I can have my espresso drinks (cappuccinos, lattes) and use 2 discs per cup (very strong) because I like coffee strong; he chooses the morning blend collection because he does NOT like strong coffee. Different strokes for different folks !

review/text: I really like this coffee for both the taste and the size of the cup. I can brew one cup and get a full size cup, unlike so many of the other selections that only give a small cup of coffee. In the mornings, I want a full cup of coffee to go. I don't want to full around with a small sample. Besides that, the taste suits me. We have tried lots of the others, but I have since settled on this one for my taste. Try it! I think you will agree with me.

review/summary: A very good Morning Coffee
review/text: The Morning Blend (Maxwell House) from Tassimo is a great morning drink.  It is not strong yet the taste of coffee is very good.  If you like a STRONG coffee taste like Starbucks this is not it.  This also provides a good mug size portion rather than a little cup portion with each disk.  It is so hard to find it in the local groceries because  they do not order large quantities and it goes quickly.<br /><br />Amazon is a great source and now I can get it as a standing order and have it shipped on a frequency cycle of my choosing for automatic delivery.  This is a wonderful service by Amazon.

Now there is no pause, just a continuous cycle. There seems to be a change in the flavor. It was better before. Maybe I received a defective batch of T-Discs.<br /><br />I know this isn't a forum but a lot of folks read these reviews. I sent an email to Tassimo and I'll follow up if I receive a satisfactory reply.

review/summary: A good cup of coffee... usually.
review/text: It's hard to find the large size of Tassimo T-pods online.  These are offered by Maxwell House and Gevalia.  Both are of equal quality to my taste so go with the less expensive Maxwell House.  One warning, occasionally this brews a very weak cup.  If you want a consistently great cup of coffee, go with Starbucks!  Their house blend is a good cup of medium richness and if you have the patience to brew the the extra 3 ounces manually by holding the + button you'll still end up with a better cup of coffee.

review/text: I was so excited to find Tassimo offerings in the grocery store and thought I'd try this variety as a substitute for the Starbucks stash I've depleted. It exploded and left little coffee granules everywhere, plus it tasted very burnt and sour. No amount of milk could mask the awful taste. My mom and husband concurred. It's just bad.<br />If this is the best Tassimo can come up with, I'm definitely retiring this system and going back to an old school brew...

review/text: Seriously, everything this company makes is fantastic.  I had a bottle of this sitting at my place for months.  I got it out of curiousity along with my favorite, the Habanero hot sauce (which is incredible) and I was stunned at how well this tasted.  I thought that maybe a sweet and habanero sauce would be to far apart extremes to have great taste but Marie Sharps pulls it off.  Its just sweet enough, and just hot enough, and has a great texture and consistency.  A bottle will probably last a long time.  Great for a dipping sauce with chicken, pork, or Chinese food.  Also, even though it has plenty of sweetness to it (think a premium duck sauce), it has almost no carbs (0.4 per serving).  Which is nice.

review/summary: For those who like sweet and spicy!
review/text: I just purchased this on sale at a local store and came to Amazon to see if I could get a good price here. I noticed the lack of reviews and wanted to post a comment. If you eat spicy food and don't mind a very slight burn this is perfect for you. I eat a lot of spicy food and this is nothing to me, but I can't decide if it would be too much for someone else since what seems slight to me may be an inferno for others. At first bite you really taste ripe mango and then towards the end a very slight burn in the back of the mouth and a little towards the ears. For those of us that love chili we love the burn as well and I wish they would make it hotter. I would advise someone who doesn't care for chili to buy another product and not leave a bad review because they don't know what to expect with chili. I dont mean to knock the previous review, but I got exactly what I anticipated because I knew it had chili and chili is usually warm or hot. Also, the taste of mango was spot on and strong enough to be noticed right away.

review/summary: Decent product, packaging leaves something to be desired
review/text: It's expensive to eat healthy these days, so it's great when a deal like this comes along.  At this price point, Hodgson Mill beats most other organic brands by a noticeable margin.<br /><br />Now about the pasta itself:<br /><br />What can one really say about taste and texture that is not entirely subjective?  It all depends on personal tastes.  I love whole-grain products and am therefore accustomed to the taste but who knows, some people who are not used to it might liken it to cardboard. Texture-wise, if you're cooking it al dente, it is as expected.  I don't care what any pretentious 'foodie' says, at the end of the day, there are only so many (useful) ways of describing pasta.  And I love pasta.<br /><br />The penne cooks quickly enough and I was rather surprised, having recently developed a habit of obsessively checking the stove every thirty seconds due to what I call the gluten-free mushtastrophe.<br /><br />I like that the pasta contains flaxseed what with the added nutritional benefits and all.  That having been said, heat/ radiation -and by association, overcooking- destroys most of said nutrients so keep that in mind when preparing any dish.<br /><br />The only aspect of this product that I can genuinely take issue with is the container.  No matter how you open it, large remnants of the adjoining cardboard remains stuck to the inner flap and closing the box remains an inelegant venture to say the least.  Still, that's why rubber bands were invented and it's hardly a reason to hold it against the pasta.<br /><br />Happy masticating!
