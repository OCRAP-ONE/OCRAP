review/summary: USED ITEM SENT FOR NEW ITEM - - - Buyer Beware!
review/text: We just received this Vinturi Delux Wine Aerator, just in time for a birthday party. My wife opened the box and said that this was used. Now we have to send the set back and go buy one locally that is new.<br /><br />Seller has very poor quality control to be sending out used sets to Amazon buyers. I will follow up on how quickly they handled this problem. Sure is a hassle, and should not have happened in the first place.<br /><br />What is up Amazon, I thought you protected us from this type of problem?<br /><br />Update. I just received my refund for the Vinturi that they sent. After further analysis of the one sent, it appears to be a product that was returned by another buyer. Both the outside of the package was damaged, so to was the inside. It looked beat up, and obviously could not be given as a gift, as we had planned. At first, my wife said it looked used.  it was likely a product that was sold, then sent back to the seller, not packaged correctly. It was probably sent back to the seller just as is, not in a box with packing material. This was likely the case. Was it used by the first buyer? We don't know.<br /><br />The seller refunded our $35, and told us to discard the unit. The hassle was having to go out to find another gift for our friend, which we had to pay full retail plus in Tahoe for. But they at least refunded the price and I did not have to go through the hassle of sending it back. So I have increased my rating to three stars from one star. Although I would buy this again from this seller, you may get a returned item as a new item. Anticipate this when you order.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it! It works and makes the wine a much better quality.<br /><br />But its a bit messy if you pour the wine into it slightly "off" so a dish or paper towel needs to be present to help soak up the splashes.

review/summary: wine tastes better, but it's messy
review/text: The wine definately tastes better.  I've had over 10 different blind tests with friends with red and white wines and the vituri wine won every single time!!!<br /><br />the problem is, that the pouring the wine without spilling is a major concern.  and after each pour you would want to rinse it out to make sure the wine doesn't dry in the device.<br /><br />also once you take your wine glass away, the vinturi keeps dripping<br /><br />in Summary you have great tasting wine, but leaves a mess!

review/text: The aerator really helps cheaper wine taste better.  With the tower it is easy to poor and clean up is simple.  Only thing is if I were to buy another, I would probably buy an aerator that fits directly in the wine bottle.  It does not look as nice, but it is more convienent.

Overall, great product, and always a conversation starter for those who have never seen it. Buy it and enjoy!

review/text: I first had the Vinturi demonstrated to me at a wine conference. The demonstrator poured two glasses of wine - one through the Vinturi, the other directly into a glass. You could definitely taste the taste improvement in the wine poured through the Vinturi. The stand makes the Vinturi easier to use and looks great on the counter. I am also glad to see that they have added a filter to catch any sediment in the bottle.

review/text: I bought this product after attending a wine tasting that used one and I have never been dissapointed. I even bought one for several people on my holiday list!<br />It's simple to use. You can use it with the stand or without which makes it easy for packing up and taking on vacation, or tailgating, or a picnic, or, well . . . anywhere. It really improves the taste of wine, especially reds (though I will say that some of the more fruity varieties don't benefit all that much) And it even works for rum, Scotch, and my all time favorite - Bourbon.

But in the end it wasn't very good, it wasn't spicy (i mean really it's tabasco brand and called "spicy pepper...", you'd expect spicy) and had High fructose corn syrup as one of the ingredients.  Wouldn't order it again and not even sure i'd take it if it were free.

review/summary: Quite Good, But Could Be A Bit More Spicy.
review/text: When I have eggs for breakfast, I enjoy having ketchup or hot sauce, or both for that matter, with them. Often in restaurants, they'll have a little bottle of Tabasco along with the salt and pepper to satisfy people with tastes such as mine, so I guess it's rather common. Well, in my local grocery store I discovered a new and unexpected item, Tabasco Pepper Jelly. No kidding! Well, I just had to try it on my toast for breakfast. It's good, but rather strange to have something that is hot  and sweet at the same time. I enjoyed it. However, strangely enough, I don't think the jelly is hot enough. It's strange to say, but I think it would be a better product with a little more bite. Otherwise, it's very much like any other jelly except that it has little red flecks and pepper seeds within it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: too expensive but reliable
review/text: Because of Jacks high prices Ive shopped around.  Ive tried the cheaper brands and though I have found some that I like pretty good I dont enjoy them like I do Jack Daniels.  I cut out beer for a while and switched to just drinking whiskey and thats a pricey thing to do with Jack. I buy it by the pint and I pay 10.60 a pint for it.  The cheaper brands you can sometimes get 2 bottles for that but they aren't anywhere near as good.  I also tried bourbon (no thanks).  Despite its high price Id even take this over Bulliet.  I love that smokey taste.

review/text: Nuttzo is amazing!!! My only complaint is that I can't stop eating it!  I am used to skipping breakfasts, which I know is not a good habit... I started eating Nuttzo on my favorite health bread and it is so satisfying and energizing.  My kids also love it which is so rare to find a food we all can eat!  This is unlike any nut butter I've ever had and there are so many different ways to encorporate it into your day to  give you a healthy energy boost.  It is one of those things you want at home, at work, on the go because you know that you are getting quality, healthy food so if its right there you'll be so happy you ate that instead of whatever else may be tempting!  I will definitely keep this as a regular item in my house.

review/summary: Good but very small
review/text: The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.<br />So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts "dancing".<br />I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again.

review/summary: Helped me get her weight down
review/text: These chew sticks keep my dog's teeth pretty clean between cleanings.  That's what they're supposed to do.  But when my dog developed a weight problem, and the vet vetoed "doggie treats", these little goodies kept ME out of the dog house.  When the treats stopped coming, my dog whined and put on a show of such pitiable neediness, that I had to do something to quiet her down.  I remembered that the ingredients in her Dental Stix were healthful and not likely to hurt her weight loss program a bit.  I went back to using these as directed, and my dog kept on losing weight, reached her goal, and has stayed there.  And we did it without her feeling deprived.  Not bad at all!

review/text: I have a Great Dane that is terified of storms.  I ordered these hoping that they would help her during this stressful time.  I could not beleive it!  I gave her one during a storm and she calm down enough for her to take a nap. She really liked the taste and they are good for her since they contain antioxidants.  The bag comes with 50 stixes which will last me a little while.  I will order more from Amazon again when I do run out. They are a very good value.  Thank you!

My dog hates people besides us and goes mad over delivery men, strangers, anyone else who has the nerve to interrupt her nap! I've been using this for years and this really calms my doggie. Give her one and soon she's out for a couple of hours. I don't know if it's the calming effect or the fact that she loves to sleep, but I really don't know what I'd do without it. She loves the taste and is much happier and tranquil after she's had a few. Highly recommended.

The 2nd batch was much better. Perhaps exposing the fruit to air gave it more flavor. This s a good ingredient given the price difference between this & my usual brand.

Subscribe and Save would make it about 75 cents cheaper per packet to get free delivery of this product rather than having to drive 45 mins to the store.<br />also, there are a lot of comments on the larger size packets available on Amazon that they contain HFCS, these ones I have been buying have blueberries,sugar and sunflower oil.<br />25g sugar in a 1/3 cup serving size. 2 servings per packet.<br />I have seen this with other dried fruit companies, they sometimes switch between sugar and HFCS from one year to the next.<br />they are tasty, not too sweet, not oily in your hand<br />My kids like them in trail mix for a change instead of raisins.

review/summary: Some things do change
review/text: I grew up making Appian Way pizza's.  For 50 years I enjoyed them. After moving to an area where they are not available in the local stores  and not being able to get them from Dial Corp anymore, I sorta gave up enjoying them again.  Then I FOUND them on Amazon.  With great anticipation I awaited the arrival of part of my childhood.  Ripping open the carton and seeing the the package brought back memories of Mom and I making pizza on a saturday night. Mixing, spreading adding cheese and toppings I could hardly wait.  Then "the moment" arrived, the pizza was golden brown and smelled oh so yummy.  I excitedly took my first bite only to be hugely disappointed. After a few more bites it was obvious,  someone messed with MY pizza. The sauce is not what it was just a few years ago, let alone what it was 50 years ago. Its nothing more than ketchup with some gook added... what a disappointment.  A good product and once again, someone, probably to save a few pennies, ruined a good product.<br /><br />The only thing similar to what Appian Way use to be is the box, and perhaps, the box is the better than whats inside.  One more disappointment from the corporate world.<br /><br />I must recommend NOT to purchase this product if you have ever eaten pizza before, you will be totally disappointed.

review/summary: Horrid! Gross!! Disgusting!!!
review/text: I USED to like Appian Way Pizza Mix when we were growing up, so I bought a box recently. Just last night, I craved pizza, so I was excited to build this pizza. My husband was with me and immediately told him the differences I saw in the crust. I remember having to let it rise, but not now, just add water and make the pizza. I was the type who loved to take the raw dough, dip it into the sauce and eat it as I was preparing. I knew the flavor was off just eating the dough plain. Next, I cut open the foil pack of sauce (was it not a can before?) and the smell and color were not what I remembered. I tasted the sauce and it reminded me of mexican food flavor (not knocking mexican food, I like it, but not when I want pizza) NOT pizza sauce. It had a orangish tone to it, not the red I remember. I knew in my brain that putting the pepperoni and chesse on it was going to be a waste, but proceeded anyway! Yep ... a total disappointment! One bite and in the garbage it went! I searched the net for someone to write to, but cannot find a customer complaint department!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Save yourself! Run for the hills! The dough is worse than Little Ceasars (cardboard flavor), the sauce is disqusting tasting. I HAD to choose one star, but I wish they would provide negative stars!!

review/summary: Family Tradition
review/text: Appian Way pizza is a family tradition in our house. My mother in law introduced us to it. The crust is not what sets this pizza mix apart it's the sauce! The sauce is amazing! In order to get the pizza to stretch out nicely and be much easier to work with use 2 boxes. It makes a heartier pizza that stretches to any cookie sheet! Another trick is to make the dough as directed using two boxes, then soak a dish towel in hot water. Wring the towel out until its damp. Set on top of the bowl and place in the oven for at least an hour. The dough will fit on a large cookie sheet and stretch nicely.

review/text: This was a great way to try out all the teas flavors without the worry of buying one flavor and not liking it-stuck with the cost of six boxes.  I loved most of them, but there were a couple that were not my favorites.  None of them tasted bad, and most of them seemed to enlighten me in some way.  I would not buy the variety pack again-in bulk.  The favorites that I liked will be purchased in bulk.  I would recommend if you buy this, give a box or two away to a friend or family member.  Then you can pick and choose or trade teas.  Next time you will know what you like out of the bunch and can order from there.

review/summary: From a tea-lover: MUST TRY
review/text: As a foodie, I'm also a bit of a snob about teas, generally preferring organic, muslin-bagged or loose teas. That said, this Stash Chanakara Tea sampler, on first try, immediately became my favourite tea purchase, and I promptly ordered this excellent bulk value offered by Amazon, soon after trying each of the seven teas included in the box. Each tea "chakra" consists of extremely aromatic and flavour-filled combinations of herbs, flowers, leaves of a colour corresponding to each chakra. While I cannot offer evidence of their efficacy in chakra work, I will say I did some best-guessing about where my particular energies were on a given day, and found that the chakra-tea I chose each time really did seem particularly soothing. New age-y ideas aside, the teas really are extremely flavourful without being overly sour (as I find many brands, like Celestial Seasonings, can be). The scents are noticeably lovely, and for me, I didn't find one flavour that I didn't truly love. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Excellent Chanakara Tea Sampler
review/text: Chankara teas are Stash tea's new line of Chakra (energy center) teas.  Like all Stash teas, they are excellent.  You may find you favor some flavours more than others, which is the perfect reason to try the sampler, so you can see which flavours you like best.  They are made with natural ingredients and flavorings and I have found the taste of Chanakra to be quite different than the other flavoured teas I have experienced.  Each bag is sealed in its own foil package, to seal in the delicate flavour.<br /><br />The Chanakara line has a flavor for each of the 7 major Chakras of the body and you will see individual reviews that I have written on the various flavours.<br /><br />Chakra 1 -- Root Chakra -- base of spine<br />Chakra 2 -- Sacral Chakra -- sexual area<br />Chakra 3 -- Solar Plexus -- belly area, around navel<br />Chakra 4 -- Heart Chakra -- heart area<br />Chakra 5 -- Throat Chakra -- throat<br />Chakra 6 -- Third Eye Chakra -- forehead, between eyebrows<br />Chakra 7 -- Crown Chakra -- top of head, center<br /><br />May I suggest natural sweeteners, if you need a sweetener: honey, agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of food store), or unbleached brown sugar (in sugar isle of food store).<br /><br />This is also something different to share with friends, and of course, something special to talk about if you have New Age friends.

review/summary: Tea for the 2nd Chakra
review/text: Interesting!  I really like it.  It has a different taste, hard to describe.  It is smooth, with a very light touch of zing (the ginger) and a light fruit taste.  It is blended and packaged by Stash, so, if you are a tea-lover, you know it's good.  Stash makes a great full-bodied tea.  This one is a caffeine-free herbal tea.<br /><br />The ingredient blend is: hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint, and natural dragonfruit flavor.<br /><br />This tea is labeled as "2nd Chakra," so it is intended for the Sacral Chakra (the one that has to do with sexuality).  According to the envelope, the damiana herb is said to enhance male and female sexuality, so there is the connection.<br /><br />For my metaphysical friends:  if this tea is also made with the "intention" of opening or stimulating the 2nd chakra (which I assume it is), that will be an added benefit.  The chakra teas are new and I have noticed they make one for each of the 7 major chakras.  I will be trying them all.<br /><br />(Note: I participated in a group meditation the other night and had combined a 2nd Chakra plus a 6th Chakra tea bag and drank the tea before and after. It was an excellent Violet Flame meditation session.  The combination of teas had a nice taste, too.

review/summary: Very Smooth
review/text: The Chanakara line is by Stash teas, an excellent tea company. Vanilla Honeybush is naturally sweetened with vanilla and orange peel with a scent of honey.  If you only use a light touch of sugar, you probably won't need any.  This is a caffeine free herbal tea.  You will probably want 2 tea bags to a 24 oz cup of hot water.<br /><br />100% natural ingredients in the order listed are: organic [African] honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor.  Each tea bags is sealed in a foil envelope to keep the delicate flavour in tact.<br /><br />This tea is designed for the 3rd chakra (energy center) which is the solar plexus.  It is deliciously smooth and vanilla-y.  I have found that each of the Chanakara flavour has a very distinctive taste--quite different than other flavoured teas I have experienced, and I am a big tea drinker.<br /><br />If you want to use a sweetener, may I suggest natural sweeteners: honey (to complement the honey vanilla taste), agave cactus nectar (liquid-found in natural food section of grocery store), or unbleached brown sugar (next to the white sugar in the food store).

review/summary: Excellent Rooibos Tea
review/text: I am a big tea drinker--been so since childhood.  I appreciate a good-tasting, full-bodied tea and Stash has never let me down.  Being into Reiki and the energy stuff, I decided to try the Chanakara (Chakra) teas.  I have already tried the ones for the 2nd and 6th chakras.  Today I needed grounding, so I tried the 1st chakra tea.  Regardless of whether you are into metaphysical energy or not, this is a very nice tea.  Besides having the health benefits of organic antioxidant-rich South African rooibos, it also has a smooth taste with a slight sweetness (as red tea does) and a light fruity taste--very pleasurable.  It is caffeine free.  I did not add sugar but if you do, I suggest a natural product like agave cactus nectar (natural foods isle of grocery stores) or the unbleached brown sugar (in the sugar isle of grocery stores).<br /><br />Other ingredients listed on the package are: Rosehips, Hibiscus, Raspberry Leaf, Uva Ursi (soothing), Citric Acid, and Natural Strawberry Flavor.  The strawberry adds such a nice flavor to the mix.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed foil wrap to protect the flavors.  (I can still smell the tea in the empty package from about 11 hours ago.)  It claims to be a 100 % natural herbal tea.<br /><br />Note that it is very difficult to find a store selling these special flavors.<br /><br />BTW--if you don't know it already, the first chakra (energy center) of the body is the "Root" chakra, found at the base of the spine.  It's color is red (bright red if it is healthy).  It connects you with the earth so that you may be grounded and centered in your physical body.  Many of us believe that keeping our energy centers balanced helps us to stay physically healthy and emotionally strong.

review/text: I bought this tea because I was looking for red tea (Rooibos) for its healthy properties and also because it is naturally caffeine free. This tea has a lot of antioxidants but does not taste healthy at all, it is more like a herbal tea when you want something sweet (I do not add any sugar to it). At the beggining I thought the taste was a little artificial, because in other flavored teas you cannot feel the fruit taste, but if you are looking for a flavored tea where you can really taste the other flavor, this is it. I love it and my 6 packages are almost gone.

review/text: This tea (number 3 only, not other numbers necessarily) is the best tea on earth for instant stress relief. You can actually feel the stress disappear as you sip the tea. I have tried the other numbers in this brand 1-7 and although some of them do as they claim (benefit for each chakra) this is the best one, by taste and results. I give my neighbor a box every time I order bulk from Amazon. She is an elderly lady and loves this one too but not the others. You will not find a cheaper price for this tea and I bet it will go quickly because you will enjoy it so much. You only need one per day to get the lasting effects. Have fun and feel great.

review/summary: Not for everyone!
review/text: I like this tea a little better now that I've learned to brew 2/3 of a mug instead of a full mug.  The first cup I brewed was washed out and tasted vaguely of dirty water.  Brewing less lets me get the full flavor of the tea from a single bag.<br /><br />Dragonfruit is an exotic, colorful fruit I've had in Hawaii.  It tastes like nothing, if nothing tastes little bit like melon rind and vanilla pudding.  The lack of strong fruit flavor in the tea, then, isn't too surprising.<br /><br />You can find the dragonfruit flavor if you look for it, but it's a subtle rounding influence that binds the herbs and spices of the tea together and is nearly lost under the stronger orange peel flavor.  The top notes are the ginger and other spices that make this tea almost an herbal "chai remix," sans black tea.  Although there is no clove in the tea, the chicory and damiana do a good impersonation of it, but with a cost:  they impart more bitterness to the beverage.<br /><br />If you like chai and believe you would still like it without the nutmeg and other "pumpkin pie spices," and if you like a bit of bitterness in your lightly and naturally sweet herbal tea, this could absolutely be your favorite tea.  It isn't mine, but there's no accounting for taste.

It's just not MY cup of tea, as the saying goes.<br /><br />I was surprised at how sweet it is, and had to check the ingredients several times in an effort to figure out where the sweetness comes from.  As other reviewers have commented, it tastes a little like artificial berry flavoring.  There are no artificial berry flavors listed, but that's what the tea tastes like!  "Natural strawberry flavor" must be some special kind of potent.<br /><br />I couldn't pick out the rooibos flavor, though I'm sure it's under the stronger berry flavor somewhere.

review/summary: Excellent Mild Ginger Tea
review/text: I love ginger from time to time, but many infusions can be a bit . . . punishing.  What can I say?  I'm a heat wimp when it comes to spices, but I still love ginger!<br /><br />This tea provides a delicious ginger flavor that can't be ignored without an overwhelming pepper note.  I agree with the other reviewer - the other ingredients in this brew can't be detected and identified individually by my untrained senses, but I think they work together to make a more mellow, rounded tea flavor with a sweeter scent.<br /><br />If you want to try a ginger tea that isn't too intense, this is absolutely the tea for you.

review/text: It is a very healthful tea, but the flavor is too woody for me.  If they had added more orange peel, that would have been better.  It just is quite odd tasting.  Woody almost like artichoke, maybe.  Hard to describe.  Not terrible, but just a bit weird.

review/summary: Real Ginger Root/Caffeine Free/Herbal
review/text: Blended and packaged by the Stash Tea Company, makers of high-quality teas, this is tea for the throat chakra, also known as the 5th chakra, which relates to the color blue.  It is called "Blue Ginger".  (A chakra is an energy center in the body.  We are generally said to have 7 major chakras.)<br /><br />This caffeine free herbal tea is made of 100% natural ingredients (per the wrapper), listed in order as ginger root, blue malva flowers, vegetable juice for color and natural (tropical) feijoa flavor.  As do all the flavors, each tea bag comes sealed in an individual foil package to preserve the freshness and delicate flavor.  (If you are a tea lover, this matters to you.)<br /><br />The color is yellow.  Even with 2 bags for 24 oz water, the taste is smooth but weak with the bite of ginger.  You do taste the ginger in sufficient quantity, but it doesn't have any special other taste that I notice.  Although not one of my favorites, it will probably be useful for settling an upset stomach. (Note-I am NOT a doctor.)  Don't we usually go looking for ginger-ale for an upset stomach?  Well, if you check the ingredients, it's hard to find ginger listed in ginger ale anymore.  This tea has ginger as its primary (most plentiful) ingredient.<br /><br />So, it has an acceptable taste and is probably useful for calming the stomach.

review/summary: Smooth and Flowery/Fruity
review/text: The blends on the Chanakara (Chakra) teas are flavorful and quite different in taste from other teas I have found.  They are full-bodied teas from Stash and Stash makes good teas.  I have been a drinker of high quality teas all my life.  I find this tea very smooth and flavorful, with a flowery taste, almost a fruity blend.  You can definitely taste the chamomile. The other flavors just blend in.  Chamomile is very soothing, especially to the throat.  Many people drink chamomile teas before bedtime, to calm them.<br /><br />This caffeine free herbal tea is said to balance, tune, and energize. (It must mean the chakras, because it is calming.)  It is called "White Lotus".  Made of 100 % natural ingredients, they are listed in the following order: chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus leaf, linden flowers, and natural lotus flavor.<br /><br />As with other Stash teas, each bag is individually sealed in a foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />This tea honors the 7th Chakra (energy center of the body), which is the Crown Chakra (top center of the head).<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, may I suggest natural sweeteners such as: Agave Cactus Nectar (in food stores--natural food isle) or natural brown sugar (in sugar isle).

review/summary: Great for a bagged tea, even better if the melon was stronger
review/text: I'm a total tea snob, drink mostly loose and hardly ever buy bagged teas (especially green) but I figured I'd give this one a shot: green tea is my favorite, melon is my favorite flavor/scent, and I love yerba mate's natural energizer properties.<br />I've also had a great experience with Stash products before (LOVE their green chai tea), so I figured why not.<br /><br />The tea is actually really good. The flavor and scent are very subtle. I know a lot of people prefer it that way, I just wish the melon came through more. There's no bitter aftertaste at all like some other yerba mate products tend to have. Overall, great tea.

review/summary: Select not for the taste...
review/text: My initial reaction, after trying a few flavors, was 'bleh!' and a solid 2-stars. After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br /><br />I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br /><br />These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br /><br />Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br /><br />Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br />The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br /><br />Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br />Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br />White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br />Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br />Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br />Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br /><br />So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92">Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler</a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.

review/summary: Better than PG Tips, But the Bags are Poorly Made. Variety Is a Must with Tea...
review/text: Best Tea I've had. I always look for variety packs. These have Decaff for late at night; and the white teas in them taste great IMO. However the Bags spew out tea leaves way too often. I could put a hammer to a PG Tip and the Bag won't likely break. I eat way to many tea leaves with these but if I have another PG Tip, I might have to blow chow.<br /><br />Tea these days is dirt cheap. Starbucks still charges a markup of over 90% on their teas. Tea is healthier than coffee and quicker to make if one uses a modern hot water dispenser. I am not sure why PG Tip are rated so high on Amazon reviews. I would give this a 4 star because of the quality/material of the tea bags. Everyone has their own opinion on tea. I am not a big fan of black tea. However, my 5 star rating tries specifically to even out those who rate their company's own product on Amazon.

The tea has a very sweet aroma when brewed, even before adding sweetner.  And the vanilla makes it more naturally sweet. I usually use 2 bags of splenda in a cup of tea, but this only needed one.  Also, the vanilla is very mild, not overpowering as I have found with other teas.  The pomegranate flavor is subtle, with just a hint of tartness. Overall, a very nice afternoon tea.  This one would be great for kids.<br /><br />According to the can, $1 from every can sold is donated to breast cancer research.

review/text: Luv this roobios. Perfect balance of the two flavors that mingle well together. It is light and sweet on the palate. You really don't need to add sugar if are in the habit of using very little sugar in other teas. I prefer this iced and when feeling indulgent I'll add a little agave nectar that adds a hint of smokiness and somehow brings out the flavors a little more. To me its magical and refreshing. To me, it just doesn't work hot. Guess I just prefer a more robust hot beverage. I picked this up a my local market for half the price and thought it was a little pricey considering it only produces so little. I usually buy good quality loose teas and the yield is WAY better; however, that being said I like this tea so much that I'll definitely be loading up on this at that price and if I can't find it at that price I would even go so far as to pay double, as a heavenly treat. Don't think you can go wrong buying this...go ahead take the plunge!

I get plenty of healthy energy with zero jitter and it lasts a long time.  Since I'm writing grad school papers 4+ days out of every week I need simple energy to keep me going.<br /><br />Highly recommend.  This is the only "energy" specific flavor I'm aware of, but I have not found a flavor I didn't like.

review/summary: Awesome baked, toasted, or microwaved.
review/text: Used straight out of the bag they are a little firm and dry. Heated in anyway, they become soft, and if baked or toasted, have a nice crunchy crust. First gluten free 'bread' that tastes, and feels like the real deal. A winner for making garlic bread, or using to dip in a cheese fondue.

review/text: These Gluten Free baguettes don't really need to be baked off if you like a softer crust.  We were using them for submarine sandwich rolls and slicing and toasting for bruchetta appetizers.  You will not be sorry about getting these if you need to live gluten free.

review/summary: Tastes great, less filling, no side effects
review/text: I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time.

review/summary: No Cal wonder
review/text: I am very pleased with the taste and flexibility of Splenda.  The taste to me is no different than regular sugar, much healthier product.  I was very skeptical at first to try something new like this product.  This is my second shipment so far and I plan to purchase other varieties of Splenda.<br />I use every day in my coffee and cereal.  I've altered my fudge recipes and my family can tell no difference, since the taste is so good.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great product for cutting calories
review/text: I use Splenda every day to help reduce my sugar intake and limit calories in order to keep the weight off. I actually prefer the taste of Splenda over normal sugar. It has a much sweeter taste than sugar. I use it things like Coffee, Tea and Kool Aid for the kids. This large package lasts us a long time.
