review/summary: Convenient ground flax seeds
review/text: Flax seeds are good for you but adding them to my diet (like anything) is really a matter of convenience.  These flax packs are so convenient and portion controlled in a really sturdy little packet.  I keep a packet in my purse and it really gets tossed around.  So far (watch I just jinxed myself) no premature openings in my bag.  The flax seeds are always fresh.  I add them when I am away from home to cold cereal and oatmeal for added nutrition.

review/summary: Flax Paks
review/text: This is a great product, very convenient and very healthful as well! The only other way to have fresh flax seed is to grind it in a coffee grinder and then store it in the frig.<br />It cost a little more to do it this way, but it gives you good portion control and is much more convenient. By the way the price is much cheaper through Amazon and even less if you use subscribe and save! I love it on steel cut oats and on soy yogurt! I'm sure there are lots of other uses I have yet to discover.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQRC3K">Carrington Farms Organic Ground Milled Flax Seed, 12-Count Easy Serve Packets (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: We really like this flax. It has a great nutty flavor and was really good in our shakes. We have stopped using it because it is too gritty - the pieces are a bit rough for smoothies. We have found another more fine-milled flax for our shakes. But this does taste really good, and is super convenient since it is in small packs. We will probably continue to use it for lunches etc.

review/text: I have a 70 lb pitbull puppy who love love loves to chew. However, rawhides do not agree with him whatsoever so my vet suggested trying hooves and real bones. I found these at a local pet store for 2.99--absolutely wonderful! Charlie really enjoys the filling and then chews on the hoof for about 3 days before I take it away for being too small. They also come in peanut butter filled to switch it up for him. He goes through about 2 a week and they don't upset his stomach. No complaints, but I definitely wouldn't buy them online for this price!

review/summary: Best Pre-Gym Smoothie Ingredient Ever
review/text: My doctor recommended the normal 5-hour energy several years ago when I was having mid day slumps and required naps. It worked great while I needed it. Now I have switched to this. I add it to a smoothies about half an hour before I hit the gym and my workouts are great, I have tremendous stamina and do interval treadmill training with no problem, even if it's been a long day.<br /><br />The great thing about it is that you don't really know it's working. After I finish at the gym I realize how much energy i had, but when I am actually doing the routines I don't really notice the energy, it simply happens.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone, particularly if you don't like, want and can't ingest caffeine.<br /><br />One caution, it has a citrus flavor that, even in a smoothie with mixed berry yogurt, cranberry juice, banana and mixed frozen berries comes through. It's a good taste, unless you don't like citrus.

We drink tea at least once a day especially during the cooler months and when given the choice of several types of tea, this is often the tea of choice even when everyone is feeling well.

WAY better than having to give the kids medicine like Pepto when something as simple and enjoyable as a tea can fix it.  We have been using the product for years, and my wife has used it through all of her pregnancies.

review/text: One of my two cats, Vladimir, recently got incredibly sick from Nutro food. It wasn't listed in the pet food recall, but several pet parents have had sick dogs and cats from this "premium" food. I spent $3,200 in vet's bills and had many anguished nights. The vet put him on a perscription food, but that one has also been recalled recently...arg! Fearful for their health, I fed them tuna (I know, not the best option), and though Vladi maintained his health, my house REEKED of fish. Praise the lord for Evolution! They love the taste of this, it smells good (and tastes good too...I tried a bit, and I'd totally eat it) and I'm not grossed out by touching it. I feel great that my cats are eating food that I like, both for it's nutrition and for its ethics. I'm going to be an Evolution costomer for life!

review/text: I was looking for a blueberry breakfast bar.  I bought these to compare against Kellogg's Nutragrain blueberry bars.  These are definitely better.  These are a bit sweeter and the grain portion is a bit drier, but I actually find that to be a positive (you'd think drier would be worse, but the texture actually works well with the flavor).  The Nutragrain bars are a little softer, but the flavor isn't as good.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, the blueberry filling isn't quite as proportionally large as shown on the box cover, but I found it to be fine.  Smaller than shown, but not stingy.  And it actually tastes strongly of blueberry, too, which really is what counts.  Good buy.

review/summary: GREAT for fat free
review/text: I was surprised at how good these muffins were since they are fat free.  They were a little more moist (cakey) than I like muffins but still delicous.  I would definetly recommend adding some walnuts.  I tried to bake it in a bunt pan and it came out a bit small, use 2 boxes for a full size bunt cake.  For special occation, you could make a simple orange glaze to drizzle on top. :)

review/summary: tasty little treat...
review/text: and so easy to make! All you need is a cup of water, the box contains the dry muffin mix and a can of cranberries with orange peel (just drain and add to the mix). The baking directions says one box makes one loaf (8.5x4.5x2.5), 24 mini muffins, or 11 regular size, but I make the 12th one and they are just a smidge smaller. I spray the muffin tins rather than use baking cups (the box says you can do either) because with the papers too much of the muffin sticks and it just got wasted. Now I can savor every little crumb. They are a delicious breakfast or even a mid-afternoon snack to hold you until dinner. They make the kitchen smell really good too!

review/summary: Just Add Water for Great-Tasting, Surprisingly-Filling Muffins
review/text: All of the Krusteaz muffin mixes are good, but the KRUSTEAZ CRANBERRY ORANGE MUFFIN MIX may be the best of all.  Why?  Because the muffins taste great, even though the only thing you need to add is one cup of water.  The muffins take just 16-18 minutes to bake, at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  For nonfat muffins, they are surprisingly filling.<br /><br />If you want something fancier, the box has a recipe for "Sweet Apricot Coffee Cake" that adds apricot preserves, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  However, I think that the basic cranberry-orange muffins don't require anything extra.<br /><br />Another Krusteaz muffin mix that I really like is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BU7AK">Krusteaz Banana Nut Muffin Mix, 17.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.  But the Banana Nut muffins require three eggs, in addition to the mix; and of course they aren't nonfat muffins.  I purchased my Krusteaz Cranberry Orange Muffin Mix (in a single-batch box) at a local chain grocery store.

review/summary: Finally something fat free that tastes good!
review/text: I have recently had to go on an extremely low fat diet for health reasons. I love veges so no problem there. I was an avid carnivore, so let's not even talk about me having to give up meat. I may get so emotional I might not make it through this review. I have been trying so many fat free/low fat foods. Everything I have tried so far has tasted like crap! Most fat free foods have no flavor and they are just bland and gross. So I continue to search for recipes and packaged goods to enable me to have a diet full of fat free/low fat foods that I can really enjoy and are healthy for me.<br /><br />One food that I am having trouble finding is flavorful baked goods. I tried baking from scratch some fat free cookies and muffins and they were just ok still dry, bland and flavorless. I will keep experimenting with baking and trying new fat free packaged foods until I find things I can live with. The search for a flavorful fat free breakfast led me to this muffin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BU7GO">Krusteaz Cranberry Orange Supreme Muffin Mix, Fat Free, 17.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I saw these fat free muffins and thought I would give them a try. Man was I surprised! These tasted like real food, really good food. If someone had made these for me I would never have guessed that they were fat free. I am so glad I found something that actually tastes great. I have put these on the subscribe and save list and they will become my main breakfast food.<br /><br />These muffins are also super easy to make. One cup of water is all you need to add. The box comes with a small can of cranberries that you fold into the batter. The cranberries are really good and tart. I made them using a muffin pan that was sprayed with cooking spray and another pan lined with muffin baking cups. The muffins stuck to the baking cups and wasted a lot of the muffin so I will just use the spray from now on. Easy to make, delicious and fat free. I would recommend these to anyone.

review/text: Very proud to have a chance to try this, a product of more insomnia and late night browsing lol.<br /><br />Got the chance to try the other flavor which is licorice only and so I was looking for it on amazon since I couldn't find it at the other places I usually get tea and juices. It was perplexing me why and so I picked this one up which I haven't seen at Walmart before, it has added mint flavor as well as that yummy addicting licorice. When I want a pick me up that isn't coffee this works, at least the licorice flavor did the one with mint is brand new to me I never heard of it.<br /><br />When I tried the Perfect Energy vanilla spice and ginseng, those two flavors really offered a nice pick me up. They are so very healthy and very warming, a real nice alternative to have to always having coffee or pop. This is also a gift that is very special to me.<br /><br />Right now I would expect to be able to find fluffer nutter sandwiches on amazon after finding this. I am really amazed and highly recommend it.<br /><br />Aryan Somers

review/summary: light pleasing flavor, good price
review/text: :: Stash White Christmas White Tea ::<br /><br />Having read that white tea is even more healthful than green, more antioxidants, and also that its flavor tends towards the light and mellow, which would be good for my ice tea mixes ... I went on a hunt in AMZN's aisle for white teas. This type seemed to be generally a bump up in price compared to the general pop, like mostlly in the $18+ range. Then found this Stash blend at only $13, so for the savings, I figured that I could overlook the part about Christmas on the packaging.<br /><br />I was also happy about the choice of blend on this. White tea, ginger root, peppermint. Ginger is absolutely my favorite flavor for ice tea already. And a little peppermint in there sounded good, too.  Now that I have it, comment on the taste of the blend. The ginger in there is only very subtle. Which is fine, as I can add extra ginger tea bags to my ice tea batches -- and probably better as is for drinking just a cup of hot, straight tea.  The peppermint is distinctive. Overall, the taste of the blend is quite crisp and light, with an easy-going flavorful tinge from the peppermint and ginger.<br /><br />When I tried this tea, I was instantly pleased, and made a note to buy Stash brand again. (AMZN is running a promo on the brand this month, so that works well...)<br /><br />I am glad to have discovered Stash, and am eager to try a few more varieties. My previous experience in brands of teas what limited by what has been available at my grocery stores. Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Yogi, Triple Leaf. Recently via AMZN shopping I've bought and tried three brands new to me.<br /><br />  o Bentley's. High quality green tea.<br /><br />  o Stash. White tea blend - very nice!<br /><br />  o Clipper. Blend of white tea + ginger. Tastes dry and messy and old.<br /><br />Glad that Clipper wasn't my only intro to white tea, since it was such a loser. The Stash got here the same week, and it, in contrast, was a very satisfying acquisition. I'm hoping for equally good results when this month I try out Stash in another variety, like probably a Green + ginseng. Or possibly a black, or even one of the chais ...

review/text: My sister decided to make her own peppermint patties. They came out great. Then she came up with the idea to try wintergreen flavor. Well not so easy to find wintergreen extract, but I found it for her here on Amazon. She made the wintergreen flavored patties & they were super wintergreen , the first batch was quite strong wintergreen flavor. The flavoring is potent a little goes a long way. You don't need much to get the flavor & the smell is delightful. A little change in the amount & the next batch was perfect.I would guess it depends on how strong you want them to taste of wintergreen.  Great quality extract definetly worth the price. I would recommend this product to any cook who's looking for a good wintergreen extract. Great Extract !! Buy again if needed.

review/text: My 6yo daughter has Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac so it is difficult to find tasty treats that she can enjoy with the family.  I have made both a pumpkin and double crust apple pie using the Perfect Pie Crust for a holiday get together.  I didn't tell anyone the pies were gluten free and sugar free (I cook with Splenda) and everyone loved them.  The only downside is that the dough can be difficult to roll and put in a pie pan.  I have found it works best with extra GF flour for rolling and if that fails I just place the dough into the pan and mold it by hand.  The crust comes out light and flakey and is delicious.  I recommend giving it a try.

review/summary: Hard to Describe How Much Better These Are
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of Vienna Sausages, but my mother is, so I found these on sale the other day and bought a couple of cases. I decided to try them and was blown away by how much better they are than regular Vienna Sausages. First the texture of the smoked sausages is quite different. They are firmer and the smoking process creates and almost "crust" like effect on the exterior of the individual pieces giving them a little desperately needed "bite". The smoke flavor is just what the normally bland sausages needed. It takes something that had very little flavor and adds just the note necessary to really perk them up. If you like Vienna Sausages give these a try. If you normally don't care for them, find a single can in the store and see what you think. These are great camping food, a lite lunch with a few crackers in the briefcase or a quick snack at home.

review/summary: Great Idea, Uneven Flavor
review/text: I asked my wife when I started eating this variation of Vienna Sausage. She thought that it might have been in the 1960s, but I think it was some after that, maybe sometime in the 70s. At any rate, if someone told me that I had eaten 5000 cans of this stuff, I would not be surprised. Oh, yes, that might be an exaggeration, but not by much.<br /><br />Earlier on, these were made with pork and beef and that was much better than the current formula. The chicken meat adds a sort of rubbery texture to the little sausages and does nothing to improve the flavor. The smoke flavor improves Vienna Sausages a lot and the smoky liquor in which they are packed is drinkable on most lots, too.<br /><br />My only real beef with this product is what seems to be uneven flavor. Some lots are very smoky and some are not. Some lots are exceedingly salty and some are not. I have had an occasional can that was too salty to eat the sausage and the liquid was too salty to drink. On some lots, they have seemed to have a harsh texture and flavor, without very much richness, while others are rich and well integrated. Still, I keep coming back because when they are right, they are a very good canned meat product.<br /><br />I am very sure that if a reader would buy a couple of cans, he or she would like the product, especially if smoked meat is an otherwise favorite. Try them.

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/summary: Salmon Roe Caviar
review/text: Few months ago, I bout salmon roe caviar in three different variety ( American salmon caviar, Canadian salmon caviar, and Russian salmon caviar) for try from GourmetFoodStore . They are delivered via express mail in cold pack. The products are all fresh and good condition. They are all taste as it should be, how ever the American product was better than Canadian product in my taste buds but the Russian product were even better for my taste buds.<br />In view of these, I recommend all of the product equally, but Russian is my choice for my taste buds.

It does not come even close to resembling what a fresh, properly handled caviar should taste like. If I am still alive in 2 hours I guess you can call it "edible".

Again, prepare as directed and this will make a hearty, fairly quick meal. And this would be great for using up leftover turkey, chicken, pork or roast beef.

review/text: I have a sweet/sour tooth, and this is by far, my favorite candy. The size of the bags is nice and getting a pack of 12 is bonus! The size of the bites is perfect-- they are thicker than the regular strings you can get in a drugstore. I thought the price was a little higher than I would have liked, but you can't really find these anywhere else so that makes sense. I will definitely be purchasing these again to treat myself in the future!

review/summary: Excellent Cocoa
review/text: I do not know why the person said this cocoa taste artificial.... maybe they added too much water you have to experiment a bit to see what is best for you. I use a lower setting to make it richer. This is one of the best kcup cocoa's I have found and am ecstatic that it is at this low price I will stock up. Truthfully the worst hot cocoa I have ever had was the green mountain, I just open the kcup and pour it into hot water because most of it does not drain out it lays in the cup hence making it taste weak. Anyway give this one a try you will like it especially since it has 3 different kinds in it..... peppermint, dark chocolate and the milk chocolate. And one more thing I find if you shake up the kcup it loosens up the cocoa to allow the water to completely dissolve it.

review/summary: Good Hot Chocolate - See Below for a Few Keurig Brewing Tips for Cocoa
review/text: This is a pretty good cocoa for your Kuerig brewer, and has a nice and rich taste at the "small" setting of my Keurig: if you want a less-rich experience, just try the medium or the large setting as there will be more water vs. the flavoring than the small.  My son and I like it at the small setting, while my wife and daughter prefer the medium setting (none of us cared for the large setting).  Don't forget to add the marshmellows!<br /><br />One trick to getting a better experience for the hot chocolate in your Keurig is before you put the pod in the Keurig, make sure you shake the pod real well in order to break up the clumps of the cocoa powder: you need to do this as it tends to clump (no matter what brand of K-cup hot cocoa) and breaking the clumps up allows you to draw out more of the flavor vs. more of the hot water.  After all, you paid a lot for the cocoa!<br /><br />One thing I do after brewing each cup of cocoa is to run a medium setting of hot water in order to clean the Keurig by just raising and lowering the pod holder and closing it without a pod into it and then running a medium cup cycle: make sure you put an empty cup under the unit, and you will see what I mean as some of the cocoa powder gets in to the Keurig's lines.  Once you flush it out, just discard this dirty water (you'll be surprised). I highly recommend this as, for example, if the next thing you brew is coffee you don't want to have a hint of cocoa in your coffee.

review/summary: Very good cocoa.
review/text: The current price is very very good, not sure how long that will last of course.<br /><br />I was pleased by this cocoa.  All 3 varieties were good and compare favorably to other cocoas I have tried.  They use coconut oil to add some extra body and flavor.<br /><br />If you do not like artificial sweeteners then yes, you may not like this.  If you look at a swiss miss or cocoa packet you will see they are quite large, primarily because of the amount of sugar needed to sweeten it.  There is no way to condense this into a K Cup.<br />Therefore they ALL have to use a mix of artificial sweeteners (which are much stronger than sugar volume wise), in order to get it to fit.<br />ALL K-CUP sweetened beverages will have this! NO EXCEPTIONS.  This is just the way KCups work and while some mixes may be more palatable than others, they all use concentrated sweeteners.  Stevia is natural but still not allowed as an additive to food as far as I know.  So no kcups will use it.

review/summary: Artifical Sweeted Hot Cocoa
review/text: If you love the taste of sucralose then this is the hot cocoa for you. It is lower calorie as it does not have near the sugar of normal hot cocoa, but you can taste the difference big time. I will not purchase this item again as I dislike the fake taste. If you are addicted to hot cocoa, but want to cut out the calories then this might be a good product for you. Consider it like going from coke/pepsi to diet coke/diet pepsi. It's a doable product (hence the two stars instead of one) but it isn't doable for me. I have hot cocoa not so often and I want it to taste good. Just for your information I thought Dark Chocolate was the best, but that not fair since I will almost always favor that. Next would be the milk chocolate and then the peppermint. The peppermint could be better, but I think it tasted the most off with the sugalose.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Less calories<br />+Variety of flavors<br />+Great Amazon price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Artificial sweetener taste

review/text: I normally use the make your own type of "My K-cups" for coffee because I prefer that to the premade ones. However, for hot cocoa, these Grove Square ones are excellent. All the varieties taste good, they are convenient, and the price is very low. The Dark chocolate is sweet like the milk chocolate, just darker. So "kids" will like them too.<br /><br />The unit price I paid is about half what the coffee K-cups cost. You have to play around with the quantity and type to get a good deal. When I got it, the 3 pack of 12 count variety (36 total) was the cheapest option even though it was not the largest option available. They also have subscribe and save discounts on some of the listings (10%) if you buy regularly anyway.
