review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: From reading the product description and the majority of previous reviews, I was expecting very blue lavender flowers with amazing fragrance to show up in the mail.  I was not disappointed at all.  As soon as I opened my post office box, a waft of lavender hit me in the face.  This product is of high quality, and I would definately purchase it again.  My cake turned out wonderful.  The color is lovely, and if you don't want to use it strictly for cooking/baking, it's more than fragrant enough to put around the house, in the sock drawer, etc.  P.S. Lavender is known for its calming effects.  Feel free to Google its benefits.

review/text: I bought this to make lavender vanilla lemonade.  The order came prompt, well packaged, and you can smell the lavender even before you open it.  I didn't really know how much 4 oz would give me --it was A LOT! For the price and shipping --it was well worth it.  The gourmet market near me sells this stuff but you only get less than 1 oz for the same price.  Thanks JR Mushrooms & Specialties!

review/text: These look and probably are definitely healthy, but being a spicy person, the taste was bland for me. Maybe a tinge of hotness will make it more tasty. Some of the other sensible food brands are better for me. E.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYRBTK">Sensible Foods Organic Crunch Dried Snacks, Sweet Corn, 0.75-Ounce,  (pack of 12)</a>. Anyway as they say, if it is tasty it is not healthy and if it is healthy it is not tasty. If someone is devouring chips on a regular basis, I will highly recommend this instead of that, otherwise once in a while this is fine.

review/summary: Works well, makes a nice bubbly drink
review/text: Basically it does just want it says.  Get a juice, any 100% juice with more than the required amount of sugar per serving, drop in the powder, place the supplied air seal on the bottle, and wait two days.  In return, you'll get a nice bubbly drink that tastes similar to mixing whatever juice you used with a hard cider.  I used white grape, and probably should have picked a hardier variant.  It would be a great drink for a party punch bowl (since it's relatively inexpensive per serving), or a hot summer day.<br /><br />One thing to note, when you've reached the desired fermentation, remove the yeast from the bottom.  If not, it will continue fermenting, even if you put it in the fridge.  I did this by pouring the juice on the top into a pitcher, and leaving the sludge in the bottom of the juice bottle.  Just wash it out, and put the juice back in, and you're set.<br /><br />Also, be sure to keep the airlock on the bottle once it's in the fridge.  Don't use the bottle cap!  Since the yeast is still doing its job, if you use the bottle cap, pressure will cause an explosion.

review/summary: Simple as it gets
review/text: EDIT:  I found an even better way to work this stuff.  Read on for good tips.<br /><br />Buy TWO (or more) bottles of the same juice.  Apple or peach grape are good options.  Let one ferment out dry...takes about a week.<br /><br />Then, pour about 75% out into a pitcher.  Refill the original container with fresh juice.  Put the vapor lock back on...you've created Batch #2.<br /><br />Pour the pitcher of dry alcoholic juice into the new container (with 25% juice).  Squeeze the bottle to remove the rest of the air.  Re-install the lid.  Wait 24-48 hours until the bottle is stiff again and then refrigerate.  Drink and enjoy perfectly sweet/dry/carbonated spiked juice.<br /><br />The advantages?<br /><br />1.  No worrying about how long it'll take to ferment.  You can run your first bottle dry and then add the fresh juice right before the weekend to prime the carbonation.  You can leave the first bottle with vapor lock in a finished fermentation state for days/weeks without issue.<br />2.  You control the sweetness/dryness.  Vary the mix ratio to suit your taste.<br />3.  You control the carbonation.  Adjust the refrigeration and/or vent carbonation to avoid overpressure.  (Squeezing out all the air helps prevent oxidation).<br />4.  You get cleaner drink.  The yeast drops out of suspension and is left in the next batch.<br />5.  YOU REUSE THE YEAST AND SAVE MONEY!  Do this just once per batch and you cut your cost by 50%.  Plus the next batch starts up quicker than if you'd pitched new yeast.<br /><br />As a side note, this yeast is particularly well-suited for this task.  I tried some white wine yeast once and it turned my apple juice into a STINKY ROTTEN EGG SULFUR BOMB!  No kidding....the yeast got all stressed out and burped sulfur.  Yuck.  This yeast has never let me down in 10-20 batches.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Wow, this stuff is fun.  Thankfully, it comes in double kits so you can experiment faster ( or make twice as much) without waiting.<br /><br />Go grab a variety of 64oz 100% juice bottles from Trader Joes.  I've tried pear cider and blackberry so far...and both worked great.  Or save some money and get apple juice or peach grape from Walmart.  Choose your poison.<br /><br />Check it after 2 days.  You'll probably want to go 3 or 4 days to get rid of a good amount of sugar and get enough alcohol.  But check it daily after that, as the fermentation will be geometrically faster as the yeast multiply.  After 4 days, you'll probably have a much drier taste...too dry for some.<br /><br />I use a strainer to filter out the largest chunks of dead yeast, but they won't hurt you.<br /><br />And I left the cap on in the fridge to have the residual yeast carbonate the drink.  Yes, I was risking explosion, but it tastes MUCH better. And the cold temperature slows the fermentation...just check the bottle rigidity twice a day.  If it's too stiff, HAVE A DRINK!  The nice thing is, it'll repressurize itself a bit, unlike soda that goes flat after you open it.<br /><br />Give it a try....you can't go wrong.

review/text: As long as you follow the instructions, you will have a great tasting, slightly alcoholic drink in a few days.  The longer you let it ferment, the drier the taste gets (less sugar).  Since I can't drink conventional wine due to health issues (allergic to grapes, histimines, tannins), I was able to use my favorite blueberry juice and make an easy blueberry wine.  I even cook with it.  Great stuff!

review/text: I got this product as a gift. It sounded like a cute idea and looked very easy. So I got some inexpensive Walgreen's grape juice and I started it up. It frothed a bit at first and I changed the trap water because it was kinda pink but I could have probably just let it alone. It fermented steadily in my kitchen. (I think it probably was around 76 degrees.) I tasted it after 48 hours and it tasted a lot like grape juice yet but definitely had a "winey" component and was a little cloudy. By day three it was still going strong producing CO2. I tasted it again. It was delicious. It reminded me of a wine cooler. Nice and fizzy like a sparkling wine. It was so easy and required no babysitting. I just put it on the counter and let it do it's thing. No mess at all. I'm excited to experiment with different juices. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to have some fun and create an inexpensive party drink.

review/summary: Quick, fun, easy and cheap.
review/text: Where was this before I turned 21? Oh, popular in Europe. You buy your juice (64 oz. juice with 20+ grams of sugar, filtered, no artificial sweeteners), add a packet (you get 6 packs), attach the included airlock (I used vodka instead of water to prevent insects) and wait at least two days. I waited longer to try to get to the 14% alcohol limit it says it can get. It tastes like a lightly carbonated juice, think champagne. They recommend using grape, cranberry and/or pomegranate. I don't if it would or would not work with orange juice, but it would taste like a mimosa if it did. I would and have recommended this, for the novelty of it alone. It was nice that it came with an airlock, if you want more Amazon sells them, or you can make your own like I did. It really tastes pretty good and it was so easy you couldn't over complicate this/screw up if you tried.

review/summary: Works as promised
review/text: This stuff works great- and you can control the alcohol content and dryness.<br /><br />The longer you brew the higher the alcohol content will get, and at the same time your juice will get dryer from the lack of sugars. So if you want a higher alcohol content but want it to stay sweeter then just add about 1/2 cup of sugar to the juice beforehand, shake it up real good, then add the mix and brew it for a day or two longer than the initial 24 hours. The taste of your brew can change pretty dramatically from day to day so taste test it as you go along.<br /><br />Also make sure to remove about 1/2 cup of the juice from the bottle before you brew- this will prevent spillover and problems when you push the rubber cap onto the bottle.

review/summary: Really Good Product
review/text: This stuff really works. Being a college kids I was looking for a cheap way to make some good alcohol to serve to my friends at dinners or social situations and man did I find it. You can use a lot of different types of juice and consequently have a lot of options for the type of drink you want. I also found that after about 6 days the fermentation levels off and the drink can not become any more alcoholic, I assume because of the lack of available sugar for the yeast to convert. Anyway, at this point it doesnt exactly taste the best. Its not too bad but if you are going for taste only leave it go for maybe 4 days.<br /><br />Not only would I recommend this to a friends, I actually have, and because it came in a two pack I was able to let them try it while I made my own.

review/summary: on time and it delivers
review/text: Product arrived on time. have it going for Superbowl. Batch # 1 is Paul Newman Concord grape and Apple cider. Perfect to give as a gift to any College student, renaissance man wanna-be, Hobo, aspiring home brewer, middle school science fair project, and/or BBQ. easy to setup. no maintenance. I am keeping mine warm- research home brewing for further tips to maximize results. I wanna try my own concoction from local fruit to see the versatility of the product. comes with vapor locks- can reuse them for later brewing projects. check U tube for reviews from others. everyone seems happy with this buy. I mean... just look at the value of making 6 gallons of wine for 24 bucks plus whatever juice you can find at Costco for 7 bucks or so for two gallons!!! I am not that good at math but I know that that is ALOT less than ANY boxed wine deal, and you can re-up on ingredients from your local brew supply store to keep on experimenting with a variety of recipes.

review/summary: Great quality for the price
review/text: Alright, a 5 star review for some dried herbs. For the price, this is a great deal for Marjoram and I can't complain. I use quite a bit depending on what I'm cooking and decided, on a whim, to see if Amazon had it since I had just run out. They come in nice, sealed glass jars, exactly as picture.<br /><br />So, are these the best herbs ever, as my rating implies? NO, of course not, it's absurd to even entertain the idea. There are plenty of dried herbs that are better (usually you have to get them from a health-food store for naturally dried), fresh is always better, and home dried is usually superior (if done properly). However, these are very pleasantly aromatic and are an excellent quality for what you're paying for. If you're on a frugal budget, this is a fantastic deal. Spice Hunter usually produces a product of good quality, and they did not disappoint here.

review/summary: Dog-gone Good
review/text: I used to feed my Shelly Pro Plan's Chicken and Rice formula, however, Purina changed it by making  a shredded blend which consists of regular nuggets with shredded, beige pieces.  Shelly does not like the new blend and I had a hard time getting her to eat it.  Consequently, I tried to find another Pro Plan product that would be more appetizing for her.  I tried the All Life Stages Small Bites Lamb and Rice product and Shelly finds it much more palatable.  For one thing, all the nuggets are same size and they are solid unlike the shredded formula where the nuggets are mixed with beige, rubbery pieces.  I'm not kidding, the beige pieces look like rubber and when I tried to pull one apart, it was like pulling rubber.  No wonder Shelly doesn't like it. I don't blame her.  Shelly also likes the "all life stages" smaller nuggets although being an Australian Shepherd, she can easily chew bigger nuggets.<br /><br />I buy Purina's Pro Plan because they state it is made in America.  I read the label on the package and it does indicate that the product is manufactured in St. Louis, MO.  I do not want any dog food that is made in foreign countries, especially China.  I heard that Purina is now making some of their products in China so I will call Purina (the parent company is Nestle, Inc.) to be sure that this particular product is, in fact, made in the USA.  In these times, you can't be too careful.  If it is not made here, I will write an addendum to my review.<br /><br />Shelly really likes this product and it seems easier on her stomach.  If you choose to purchase it, just be careful to incorporate some of your pet's regular brand with this new formula until your pet's digestive track can get used to the change in diet. I did that with Shelly's food and it worked out well.<br /><br />I like the texture and look of this product but more important, Shelly likes it.  I also like the fact that it is nutritious for all life stages in a dog's life.  Shelly and I are recommending Purina's Pro Plan All Life Stages Small Bites Dry Dog Food without reservation.<br /><br />Finally, if anyone from Purina is reading this review, get rid of the shredded blend or improve on its appearance and texture.  Those beige, rubbery pieces are awful and should be eliminated.  Yuck!

It's a bit finer than what I can get back home but at least it's dried. It's proved impossible to find in the local shops around MA that are near me.

review/summary: Hits the Energy Drink Trifecta
review/text: I work graveyard shifts, so I often need a boost of energy, but many energy drinks taste to me like a spoonful of sugar and the can they came in. Not this one, which actually tastes like a cherry soda. Its pleasing flavor goes down smoothly when I need quick power, and it doesn't leave an aftertaste like Full Throttle or Red Bull do. I could almost drink this like an ordinary beverage.<br /><br />The power lasts long enough to get me through nearly my entire shift. Since it's carb-based, the power does run out, but late enough that I can coast on momentum. This stuff lasts way longer than those energy shots, which peter out before my lunch break. It's also fairly inexpensive for an energy drink. Too many such beverages cost a small fortune, and I'd practically have to take out a second mortgage to power through my shift.<br /><br />So we have the trifecta: pleasing, powerful, and affordable. Consume with caution, since these things can have long-term depleting effects if overused. But if you need an occasional boost of power that doesn't taste harsh or acidic, and you want it at a modest price, this is your stuff right here.

review/summary: Tastes Better Than Some Theaters
review/text: Cooked in a Whirly Pop this is a lot like, and sometimes even better than, movie theater popcorn. There's nothing evil on the ingredients list (i.e. no trans fats). For the review complaining it's still too salty, I've found that depends on if you put the salt in before popping or add it afterwards. And, in any case, the salt and solid (flavored coconut) "oil" are in their own compartments on the package so you're free to use as much or as little as you'd like. You can also get close to this taste using coconut oil and a good butter popcorn salt but it's not quite the same.

review/summary: Less salt not the same as lower salt
review/text: I purposed a 40 pack kit directly from the seller for family movie night after finding this brand's regular popcorn kits to be way too salty for us. The popcorn tastes lighter in flavor/oil but just as salty as the regular kit.  Also, there seems to be less popcorn contained in the packages than in the original kits that came with the popper. Certainly not 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels as there is noticeable room when you lift the lid, and the unpopped kernels do not account for this difference.<br />I like the convenience of having everything in one package but expected a discernable difference in the saltiness.  As a workaround, I have to reserve the salt packet content.

review/summary: Superb morning tea!  Excellent value!
review/text: I am a tea connoisseur, and I drink tea every morning.  This Dilmah Ceylon Supreme Tea is my favorite morning tea (although I also recommend Dilmah English Breakfast Tea.)  It is a superb value.  It has the delightful ethereal finish of a much more costly brew, but also has the warm supportive strength necessary in the morning.  My local grocery stores made the mistake of ceasing to offer my Dilmah Teas, and so I am ordering them from Amazon now.  I have tried Dilmah's organic named-growth teas, and they are also excellent.  But for a regular morning tea, and considering the cost, this Ceylon Supreme and also the English Breakfast Tea made by Dilmah, can't be improved upon.  Dilmah teas are produced by a visionary family in Sri Lanka who pays their workers a fair amount of money for their labor, which is also important to me.  This Sri Lankan product has lured me away from a lifetime of drinking Darjeeling Tea, grown on the Indian subcontinent.  I really recommend Dilmah Teas!

review/text: I am a tea fiend. I was born in Poland and have been drinking tea EVERY day since I can remember. There are no good teas on a common grocery store shelf. This tea is something commonly available in Poland and it is my preference to this day. One way to tell you have a fantastic tea is that you can truly make 4 cups from one bag. I STRONGLY discourage you from steeping over about 45 seconds. Unless you really enjoy very strong teas(Or are British, and are having it with milk), Steep until the color is where you want it and take it out for the next one. Enjoy.

review/summary: Pretty good basic tea, not as good as the organics
review/text: Got this hoping it would be as good as the Dilmah I bought in Colombo in 2005; that version was labeled "organic," though I'm not sure it was certified. That tea was very tasty with complexity; this tea is not nearly as good but it is still pretty decent, modestly flavorful but I usually use two teabags; lacking in any depth or complexity, it will probably demonstrate the predictability required of mass-produced teas. The smaller specialty teas, though often good, can be unpredictable and therefore have difficulty attracting a loyal following. This tea is packaged well, and has a decent shelf life, but it's nothing to rave about.<br /><br />I would warn readers that make it down this far in the list of reviews that several of the other reviews appear to be from customers with single reviews only (thus of questionable authenticity / objectivity), and the down-voting of this review (I assume by the same writers) takes it off the main page. Oh well. Not unexpected from Sri Lanka given its current sociopolitical climate.

review/summary: Healthy lotion...
review/text: I had been looking for a lotion (which is liquid) not a cream (which is solid) for external use, for hands during winter, face after shaving, feet for white dry skin, and for the entire body after mountain biking and surfing in burning sun for years. After shaving regardless wherever on your body, you are not suppose to use cream since it is solid and blocks the skin from breathing. You are suppose to use a lotion. Almond oil and Castor oil are the best for my entire body since both are easily absorbed and won't clog pores. Both products are considered food grade which means you can cook with it just like olive oil but the difference is that you can use these without even knowing that you have applied any on your skin since it is virtually odourless. Any oil from any nut or whole grain like brown rice will go rancid in less than six months so purchasing huge amount of nut oil will have no nutritional value shortly after production so I refill my small container mixing castor+almond which I keep in my bathroom drawer next to my shaving blade which is dark, away from any light and the rest wrapped in a black plastic bag in the freezer. Just like olive oil, it should never be exposed to any light. The mix is excellent for removal of black spots on skin, burned skin, massage, headache and much more and that is why I mix almond+castor. The almond oil, or any nut oil should be Expeller-Pressed with no added additives of any sort. Any nut oil should be good enough that you can consume it raw or use it in cooking and Spectrum is the better one since it really is sold all over right next to all other cooking oils instead of health section. I like Spectrum because of the glass container.

review/text: I love it! I ordered a 12 pack, which maybe didn't seem like a lot at first, but the package arrived at 4.8 pounds and there is a LOT of candy!<br /><br />The cute packaging is a definite plus. The pastel colors and the different flower for each individually wrapped candy is adorable. Don't be fooled by the photos of the candy itself. It's very large! It's as large as a quarter, so the flavour doesn't fade quickly at all.<br /><br />Lots of websites have claimed the taste is an 'apricot' or a 'condensed milk and plum' flavour. I'd have to disagree with that. These taste very similiar to peach ring candy. They have a very peachy flavour with a somewhat flowery scent.<br />Every adult friend I've given them to have told me they taste like Peach Schnapps. (-:<br /><br />If you order a lot of it, this candy will last a very long time. It makes a cute gift and a fun conversational piece (if you can make them last!) I'd recommend it to anybody.

In fact this is the first time I've seen PG Tips sold in the USA in quantities of more than 80 bags per box.<br /><br />Regarding N. Pierre's negative comment regarding the lack of a string: While it is fine to brew a single cup of tea with these tea bags, they are really intended to go in a tea pot.  If you are looking for "one cup tea bags", try the PG Tips "Envelope-Tagged Tea Bags".  Not only do these come with a string, but they are smaller than the pyramids, making them more appropriate for a single cup.<br /><br />PG Tips tea come highly recommended.  Buy with confidence.

review/summary: THIS is tea. Survival Tea, Comfort Tea, Honestly TEA....
review/text: I struggle to survive without my PG Tips. I got hooked and forever have been paying exhorbitant prices to have it shipped to me. I had friends in the UK buying it at the reasonable prices there and then shipping it to me, but at the parcel rates it took forever, and now with Homeland Security, it seems to take even longer (maybe they think it is not really tea?) I was shouting with happiness when a local grocer finally started carrying it, but only in the tiny 40 bag boxes (which lasts barely a week for a true tea drinker). Here I sit in the home of Starbucks, and while TAZO is okay, but's not the same. THIS is tea!<br /><br />I do drink my tea in the English/Irish/Scots manner, which is to say, with milk, 95% of the time. A strong cuppa in the morning, and continally through the day, in my insulated STARBUCKS 16 oz mug! LOL. PG Tips is the only tea to stand up to the pace. Most of the so-called TEA in the US is what folks from the true tea-drinking countries call "floor sweepings", which is to say, the "tea" that is left, after the real tea is made into packets and bags... it's little crumbs and dust, which is why we get it in thick tea bags, nothing else would hold these little dregs.<br /><br />I am so happy to see it here! The nearest British importer charges $22 plus shipping for the same size box. I am happy! BUY this tea! You will love it. If you want weak tea, one bag will make you nearly a pot. Please use fresh, cold water, bring to a boil, and then make your tea. It does make a difference!

review/text: I liked this tea. I average a cup a day, and I always use teabags instead of the loose stuff for the convenience factor. Speaking of which, that is my sole complaint about this tea. The bag didn't have a string, which is what I use to drain the last few drops of water from the teabag.<br /><br />This is minor, I realize. But my tea-drinking is a ritual event. The boiling of the water, the whistling of the kettle, the dunking of the teabag, and finally the squeezing and disposal of the teabag.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, the tea was yummy.

I am a big tea drinker but have yet to discover any strong black tea that can compete with PG Tips.<br /><br />Definately best served with a bit of milk, please don't tarnish it with cream or half-n-half which should be used for coffee alone.
