I love how soft and chewy this oatmeal cookie was. The raisins were nice and juicy as well. I can't wait to grab a bigger size box or bag or whatever they may come in. It is well worth it.

review/text: I was able to try this product through Influenster in my Mom Voxbox.  I had to share it with my 2 year old daughter since you can't eat cookies in front of kids lol!  It was delicious and soft baked, just like home made cookies.  My only complaint is that my cookie didn't have a good amount of raisins in it.  Maybe I just got a batch that missed a few extra raisins but I definitely felt that it could've used more.  Other than that, it was a great snack, especially to serve to kids!!  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)

review/text: I was choosen as one of @Influensters Mom VoxBox recipients. I was excited about that, but I was even more excited when I opened it to see that there was a Quaker Oatmeal soft baked cookie inside. I immediately opened it. It's one of the softest and most delicious cookies I have had in a long time. I immediately had two of my kids try a piece of it also. They loved it also! These cookies are rich in flavor, not dry, and all around a great cookie. I went out yesterday and bought two more boxes of them. These are a great product to keep handy for snack time! Absolutely love them!

review/summary: Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies Make my Daughter's Day!
review/text: I was selected by Influenster to get a mom Voxbox.  Inside with other products I got a full size sample of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies.  My daughter was so happy with it.  I was able to steal a small amount from her...It was so yummy and soft.  It was a nice size too. It was not small at all and you will get your moneys worth.  The fact that it has oatmeal is a plus, meaning my kids are putting something healthy in them when they are snacking.  I will definetely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone.  If you want a yummy soft cookie with lots of flavor with none of the work and clean up after baking...go get a box of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies...you won't be sorry. :-) I know my kids are happy that I tryed it....Thanks again Influenster and Quaker.

review/summary: TASTE SO GOOD!
review/text: Influenster sent me a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test out and review in the Mom voxbox! WOW!! SO GOOD! And it really is so soft, if feels and tastes fresh baked. I only have one question, what took them so long to make these?? =) Really they are so good you wonder why they haven't thought of this years ago!<br />Here are a few of the details! They are individually packaged, so they are great for on the go! They are made with yummy whole grain Quaker oats! They are a good source of fiber and only have 6 grams of total fat per serving! I know you are dying to know where you can get these now! You can buy them at pretty much any major retailers and have a suggested retail of $2.69 for 6 cookies, That's less than $0.50 a cookie! Great deal! Give them a try and let me know how you like tem!

review/text: I love all of Quaker's products and so I didn't expect anything less from these cookies. I was not disappointed. The cookies are soft, chewy, and filling. They have the right amount of cinnamon and rasins in them. My kids even like them which is hard when it comes to oatmeal. I would definitely recommend these cookies if you love oatmeal rasin cookies.

review/text: As Soon as I received my sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox from influenster.com my 2 yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why. They taste very fresh and everyone loves them!<br />I got to try this product for free in my MomVoxBox from Influenster.com<br />I'm an Influenster and Influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!

review/summary: OK Taste, But Too Many Questionable Ingredients
review/text: Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies.

review/summary: Not For  Weight Watchers
review/text: I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with.

review/text: I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range.

review/summary: Great Classic Cookies
review/text: When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from Quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: Not Your Grandma's Cookies, But They Get The Job Done
review/text: I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings.

review/summary: Average Taste, Bad Calories, Insanely long list of ingredients
review/text: The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?

review/text: Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.

review/summary: Very Good, Very Natural Tasting, Great Texture
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:14 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.

review/text: I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!

review/summary: Chewy Yummies Without Work
review/text: I received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box. These are super soft cookies that are individually wrapped for convenience. The individually wrapped cookie is a huge feature here as the cookies stay fresh and soft in a easily tote-able package. You get the great taste of Quaker oat cookies without the work of baking them! Toss in the kids lunch bag, spouse lunch box, pack for a picnic, use in birthday party favor bags for a healthy alternative! Great tasting, great portability, great texture. love them!!

review/text: I have fallen in love with Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie! I tried them in my mom voxbox from Influenster and it was so good. It tasted like a homemade cookie to me. I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the Quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend Quaker.

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies
review/text: ~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take "on-the-go" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains 6 grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain Quaker Oats! You can't beat that! Try them out, I'm sure you'll love them as much as I did! =D

review/text: The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins
review/text: If I could give it zero stars I would......horrible taste and not much of that either. Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives Quaker a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment....

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others.

review/summary: Very nice cookie
review/text: I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again.

review/summary: An OK Cookie
review/text: These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one.
