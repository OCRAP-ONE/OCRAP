review/summary: Super Sweet
review/text: This product is extremely sweet to the taste. The berry flavor is overwhelming to the senses.<br /><br />Once you get used to the berry flavor (1/2 way through the can). It becomes more calm to the taste buds and is less striking.<br /><br />If you want a very sweet rare treat this will fit the bill. I could not drink this every day though.

review/summary: Fruity...generally refreshing!
review/text: A lovely pink drink...the packaging is very cute and inviting, so I was already enticed into wanting to enjoy the drink. And it's actually quite good! Always best when chilled...the mix of kiwis and strawberries is a unique combination, slightly sour then sweet.<br /><br />I like the carbonation, if it didn't have that it would just be a strange juice. I like that this is 100% juice and all natural, the fruit flavor is good without additional sugar or corn syrup...I would recommend giving it a try!

review/text: This drink was pretty good to me. It has a light not too sweet taste to it and makes you want to drink more than one at a time. What was really good to me is it is light on the carbonation also. All these factors put together means i would try the drink again and recommend it to others.

review/summary: I would not buy it
review/text: I suppose the flavor of this carbonated juice could be satisfying to someone, just not me.  If I were thirsty and no other drink was available, I would drink it, but even if I were to like the taste, when I want a drink, I almost always want more than the 8.3 ounces contained in the can.  (Why 8.3 ounces?)  I wonder if the market for this drink is for those who must religiously consume liquids in extreme moderation.  It must be quite hard to come up with a successful new drink product. The Switch Kiwi Berry may be a perfect demonstration of how hard it is.  Better luck next time.

review/summary: Tastes like Carbonated Plastic....
review/text: The first "Switch" carbonated drink I tried from the amazon vine program is the watermelon-strawberry and now, here I am trying the "kiwi-berry" flavor. I've said before that I am not a fan of carbonated drinks and this flavor just reminded me why.<br /><br />There's no taste of berry nor kiwi in it, and the thing just flat out tastes like carbonated plastic. For a drink claiming to be "all natural", no sugar, or preservatives...it sure tastes quite like the opposite. Now I don't know if I just received a defective can, but it isn't it sure didn't quench my thirst and I needed to eat a "hot pocket" just to get rid of the odd after taste. Cool packaging, less than good taste.<br /><br />I didn't like it! [2 Stars]

review/summary: Left Me Thirsty, But Not For This...
review/text: This drink left me thirsty, which isn't good when said drink is supposed to quench your thirst.  It's bottle is appetizing, though I found the drink took very little time to finish.  When it comes to taste, it was lacking.  Either the mixture of the Kiwi and Berry was off or something because it reminded me far more of an energy drink than a juice drink.  To its benefit, there was no icky after taste.<br /><br />I will not be 'switch'ing anytime soon to this drink, but recommend giving it a try, as all our taste buds are different.  Maybe you'll like it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.

review/summary: Carbonated "Premium" Juice?
review/text: There are a number of different Switch juice flavors.  I tried Kiwi Berry, and I did like it.  There's a whole lot more than Kiwi in this can though, and while they are all natural products (meaning, not man made, I guess) I counted 5 other things besides Kiwi in there, which some of the other reviewers also pointed out.  It is carbonated - which brings out the flavor a bit more, in my opinion. It was sweet, yet they say no sugars are "added" (however, the natural products in the concoction already have 33g of sugar in them, in the 8.3 fluid ounce aluminum pop-top can).  There is 135 calories and 34g of carbs in that can too.<br /><br />So, while the flavor is good and I liked the sensation as I drank it, the marketing of the can (tall and narrow, a pretty pink, labeled as 100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't), the can makes me feel like this product is calling out to me saying, "buy me because I'm a "premium" product."  Well, I'm sorry, that's not why I buy a juice product.  I think the term for this would be "preppy" but still, I did taste good.

review/summary: Mediocre beverage
review/text: I had previously imbibed a couple other flavors of Switch beverages, and I liked them a good bit.  This one was not bad, but certainly unremarkable.  The kiwi flavor was not very prominent, and I had to really try to distinguish that there was any kiwi flavor at all.  The berry is more what I tasted.  Since I'd like the other flavors so well, I was expecting I'd like this one as well, but I didn't even bother finishing the drink.  Other people might like it better, but I found it to be too sweet and not all that worthy of drinking.

review/summary: No thank you.
review/text: My husband thought this was alright, but I just couldn't get myself to drink more than a few sips. Let me also add that I am not a soda drinker so this may be a great alternative for someone who is(hence the two stars), but this is an opinion from a non-soda drinker.<br />I had a hard time tasting anything close to Kiwi or berry. It was more cherry or ?? to me. I would've liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me.<br />It kind of bothers me to see 'natural flavors' listed in the ingredients too...like what type of 'natural flavors'??? I would've hoped all the mixed fruit juices would've been enough...

review/summary: Pretty good berry soda
review/text: Switch Kiwi Berry Soda:<br /><br />First thing you notice is the light pink color of the soda. It is very lightly carbonated as there are almost no bubbles, yet it is carbonated. It has a pleasant aroma, light yet fruity.  Its taste is also light but sweet. Fruity with definite berry overtones.  There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but I notice it. The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans. I on the other  hand find myself often spilling out a few ounces of soda so there may be less waste overall, for me.  As in the other flavor I sampled (Watermelon Strawberry) Kiwi , Raspberry and Strawberry are mighty low in the list of juices in the soda. Still I find this flavor far more palatable than the other. I give it 4 stars and find it an acceptable fruit soda.

To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right.

review/summary: Make the "Switch" for breakfast.
review/text: I really like the Switch drinks so far, 100 percent juice with a carbonation too, it is a nice combo for us soda loving consumers.  I think too that the carbonation prevents me from sucking down a can this size in one gulp. I like it so much I ordered, and I am halfway through a case of the black cherry flavor.  With free shipping in a combo order, the price of these drinks is pretty good.<br /><br />Kiwi Strawberry, it sounded like a weird combination mixing fruits I don't normally expect in a cocktail together.  Still it works, strawberry and kiwi seem to be very complimentary fruits, and I may eventually have to try a case of these, (the one can sample from the vine program is just not enough when the item is sold in cases).

review/summary: This variation of Switch carbonated juice doesn't work for me ...
review/text: As part of the line of Switch products, Switch Kiwi Berry offers a (slightly) healthier alternative to carbonated soda.  The product is 100% juice, though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or "berry":<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me.  The added kiwi flavor, in particular, imparts a odd sour aftertaste that I just could not get used to.  My children each tried a sip, and for them as well the opinion was mixed.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the Switch Black Cherry (even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak), but I can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor.

review/summary: Tasty Natural Soda - But a Little Strong
review/text: The drink flavor is Kiwi Berry but I tasted a lot of flavors in it besides Kiwi and Berry. There are six fruit juice concentrates included. Note that Kiwi, although listed first on the can label before Berry, is the third fruit listed on the ingredient panel after Apple and Grape. Acerola (Barbados cherry or wild crapemyrtle per Wikipedia), Raspberry and Strawberry are listed as numbers 4, 5 and 6.<br /><br />I tried the beverage cold without ice then with ice.  Even drinking it a little later after it got watered down with the ice it was still a strong flavor and still tasted carbonated.  I noted that there was no aftertaste from Kiwi that I find in other drinks like Hansen.<br /><br />I don't believe the smaller size (8.3 oz.) was created for children, I think it is small to compete with the energy drinks out there that seem to appear in a similar size can.  HOWEVER, there is no caffeine, no added sugar, no guarana, or other "energy" added ingredients in this drink so it is safe for children and adults who do not wish to drink stimulant type drinks.  But, another HOWEVER is that this drink is 135 calories just for 8.3 ounces, 34 carbs including 33g of sugar (natural from the fruit juice concentrates).  There is 15mg of sodium and 100% of an adults daily requirement of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I am not sure if I would buy this drink again but it does taste nice.  I would like to try some other flavors from The Switch, however.  This one might make a good base for a punchbowl drink (with ice cream?)<br /><br />I think I should have given this drink fewer stars, now that I think about it.

review/summary: Not a huge enough difference over regular juice or soda
review/text: While the taste of this "carbonated juice", as the manufacturer puts it, is good, there isn't much else to say for this beverage.  One can has 8.3 ounces, which is a bit less than most Americans are used to for a canned drink, but would be a good serving size for kids.  It does have 135 calories, which is a lot, when I could just drink a diet cola for either no calories or one calorie.  Sure, there would be a lot more unnatural additives, but this drink isn't even organic, which many others on the market are.  If I were to spend more money on a healthy and tasty beverage, this would not be my choice.

review/summary: Fruity and Tasty
review/text: While I didn't like this flavor as well as the black cherry, it was still quite good.  Had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet, probably because there is no added sugar.  You won't miss the sugar and neither will your kids.  This is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesn't have all the additives that soda does.  It's basically carbonated fruit juice.  It's 100% juice, so you get a nice dose of Vitamin C (100% daily allowance according to the can).  Adults will enjoy it too.  The can is 8.3 oz., which is smaller than a 12-oz soft drink, but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving, without filling you or your kids up too much.  Sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added, so these are not health drinks, but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas.

review/summary: nice soda alternative, but lacks a little something
review/text: I'm not a huge soft drink consumer, but I thought I would give this a try since it's being touted as a "healthy soda alternative."<br /><br />The Switch is a low-sugar carbonated drink that tastes fairly well, but is not as sweet as regular soft drinks or juices.  It felt a lot like a soft drink (that kind of weird filled-up feeling) but lacked pizazz when it came to taste - there wasn't a lot to the strawberry or the kiwi side and just made the drink feel a little flat.  I don't like super sweet foods, but I do like tons of flavor, so the drink didn't impress me too much.  This drink might be more of an acquired taste.<br /><br />I'd say sample this at your local grocery store or at a friend's house before buying.

review/summary: It was pleasure to try.
review/text: Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Kiwi Berry flavor of Switch 100% fruit juice. It is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you. The Kiwi Berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying. The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring. So Switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at  the same time while also giving up caffeine which I really don't want during the day. If Switch comes out with additional flavors I will certainly try those as well.

review/text: I love these Switch "sodas" they are very tasty and do not contain any bad ingredients. I love to drink soda and when I go to the store I can never find any without high fructose corn syrup. These switch sodas are very easy drinking but contain NO HFCS! For that reason alone I give this a 5 star. The can size is kind of small compared to what we Americans are used to drinking 16 oz soda is the standard size here in the US. These are 1/2 that size and a quick swig can knock it out.<br /><br />The kiwi-strawberry flavor is very yummy. I highly recommend this to everyone looking for an alternative to other sodas.<br /><br />Calories: 120;<br />Fat: 0;<br />Sodium 15mg;<br />Total Carbohydrates 31g;<br />Sugar 24g;<br />Protein 0g;<br />Vitamin C 100%

There is no added sugar, or, worse, high fructose corn syrup.  There are no artificial preservatives or colors or anything else that's typically added to a soda (or even a juice drink).  The 8.3-ounce can is a good size, too.

review/summary: Refreshing & High Calorie
review/text: These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes great! I liked their blend of kiwi and berry because you can actually taste the kiwi in this drink. The carbonation is just right as well, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories.

review/summary: Still too much carbonation
review/text: This product label says that it is "the perfect balance between juice and carbonation", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi/berry, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called "Kiwi Berry", but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid, we are drinking 135 empty calories;however, this is a high level of vitamin C. Also, children will probably like these really sweet flavors, so this could be an alternative to offer the little ones.

However, I did not like this flavor as much as the Switch watermelon strawberry flavor which I found extremely refreshing.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry is also 100% juice. Although the drink is good, it has a strong syrupy berry flavor which reminded me a little bit of the Robitussin cough syrup I dislike. I also didn't taste any kiwi.<br /><br />At 135 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly.

review/summary: Switch is a Refreshing Alternative to Soda
review/text: Switch is fruit juice that looks and drinks like a cola. From the packaging and branding to the carbonation, it looks to sub in for your favorite soda or energy drink and - let's face it - that's not a bad thing!<br /><br />The drink itself is pretty good. A fairly concentrated blend of fruit juices plays well on the palate by refreshing carbonation.  It doesn't feel thick or sticky like other beverages in 8 oz cans, but it does have a hint of that cough syrup flavor that is so common these days. Fortunately that bit isn't overwhelming and doesn't hang around long.<br /><br />After the swallow Switch is sweet, bubbly, and light - a perfect substitute for most sodas. At about a dollar a can, Switch is a great choice for anyone looking to cut back on cola or make their kids lunch a little healthier without making them look uncool. Even if it does still seem wrong to pay more for straight juice than heavily processed artificial flavors.

review/text: The flavor combination of kiwi, and strawberry is quite tasty.  With no sugar added, this gourmet soda keeps just the right amount of sweetness about itself.  Each can is only 8.5 Fl Oz (245 mL) - so in my mind it is rather pricey.

review/summary: Decent fruit juice
review/text: I could definitely taste the berries, harder to find the kiwi though.<br />I like that there's no heavily processed sweeteners (no HFCS) but still the funny thing about all these fruit juices in a can is that they almost always contain apple and grape juices and then the rest. I wonder actually how much kiwi juice is in there.<br />It's sparkly and I tried it when it was not cold enough so it was a bit too sweet for me.

review/summary: Technically drinkable.
review/text: This is the second flavor of Switch I've had and it was... not terribly pleasant. First off, it seemed rather syrupy, but then I realized that's just because the sweetness factor is, apparently, set to eleven. It wasn't actually a struggle to finish it, but it was so cloyingly sweet it makes the average episode of "Full House" look like sour, cynical crap. It made me want to reach for insulin, though I don't take any.<br /><br />I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who don't have well-developed palettes, but if you're past the age of, say, nine, this probably isn't the drink for you.

review/summary: Tasty drink!
review/text: This is a tasty drink that is a nice alternative to soda since it's 100% all juice.  Other reviewers have mentioned that it has a tart taste to it, but to both me and my husband (who is the primary soda drinker in our family), it tasted sweet, with no aftertaste.  As my husband put it, it's sweet with a little tanginess, so that it's not overly sweet.<br /><br />Although this purports to be primarily kiwi and berry, the main juices it is composed of are apple and grape.  It is also high in calories:  a small 8.3-ounce can has 135 calories.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a nice change of pace, and it's worth a try if you're looking for a healthier alternative to soda.

review/summary: Not bad, but nothing special
review/text: This is not a bad product, just an average one. It's carbonated fruit juice so it's certainly a better choice than soda, and contains 100% of your vitamin C for the day. But, the taste is nothing special -- strong on the strawberry flavor and sweeter than you would expect from juice.<br /><br />The price is rather steep once you figure in the per-ounce cost. I would rather have regular juice, skip the carbonation, and skip the high price. But, if you're trying to wean the kids off sugary soda, this is something worth considering -- they get the carbonation and sweetness of soda, but not the corn syrup and other junk.

review/summary: Sweet and syrupy.
review/text: Switch kiwi berry is very sweet, heavily flavored (almost overpoweringly so), and is lightly carbonated.  My husband said it was good, he'd drink it if it was free, but he wouldn't go out to buy it.  I'd say the same.  It was okay.<br /><br />I could taste a lot of grape flavoring that lingers along with a touch of apple.  I might even taste a tiny bit of kiwi, but I wouldn't describe the flavor as kiwi berry -- more like grape apple.<br /><br />Switch is too syrupy for me.  I'd prefer something more light and crisp.

review/text: The benefit of this drink is that it is "no sugar added, 100% juice," which tastes basically like fruit soda.  I can see it as a good alternative to traditional soda, especially for kids and teens.  However, for adults I think the drink still tastes really sugary, despite the fact that sugar has not been added.  I ran for my toothbrush as soon as I was finished.  However, the taste is good and the kiwi berry was a nice flavor.  For young people with a sweet tooth I would recommend it, but I think grown ups will have a more difficult time jumping on board.

review/summary: Overly sweet and tastes like poprocks.
review/text: I love the idea of carbonated juice - I really do. I love carbonation. I love juice. Put them together and you should have a sweeter version of what you can make with club soda and juice. So one star earned for the idea. One star for the convenience of me not having to mix my own club soda with juice and one star for convenience that it is in a can. As for taste - I didn't like it much at all. It was just too sweet. I like soda, but this was just over the top. This particular version my wife and I both agreed that it tasted really close to strawberry poprocks, which in and of itself is a good thing. I just didn't care for it as a carbonated fruit juice.  I'm going to give this a partial fail. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: It actually tastes like kiwi-berry
review/text: Switch is the "all natural" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C.  The flavor in question is kiwi berry.  I must admit this is the third beverage by Switch that I have tried and I believe it tastes the best.  The other flavors I have tried didn't taste bad, but really didn't taste like the flavors they were promoting.  This soda tastes both like kiwi and berry.  A very crisp and light flavored drink and it is only 135 calories a can.  This isn't a bad alternative to a basic can of soda, but the calories in a can of Switch aren't too far from a can of Coke/Pepsi.

review/text: The taste of The Switch Kiwi-Berry, reminds me of Jell-O fruit flavored pops.  I happen to like this flavor, but I wouldn't call it Kiwi-Berry.  The name "Kiwi-Berry" seems little more than a gimmick since the main fruit ingredient in this soda is apple.<br /><br />The Switch is high in calories, but at least it doesn't include high fructose corn syrup.  The ingredients listed seem to be natural and I do not feel sick after drinking it (as I normally feel after drinking corn filled sodas).<br /><br />I recommend The Switch Kiwi-Berry for people who like fruit flavored sodas without high fructose corn syrup.  Those on a diet may want to avoid this drink since it contains more than 100 calories per serving.

review/summary: Much too sweet
review/text: This drink would have gotten 4.5 stars from my kids but as an adult, this drink was much too sweet for my husband and myself.  We would never drink anything this cloyingly sweet.  It's made with fruit juice concentrates and flavorings reconstituted with filtered sparkling water.  What I'd rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, I'm afraid has none of this, it's just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.  We tried the Kiwi Berry and it tasted like overpowering strawberry fake-flavoring, like strawberry flavored candies.  Sorry, Switch, but you could make this simpler and better very easily.

review/summary: why hasn't anyone thought of this before?
review/text: We've all loved our carbonated drinks. Some of us have gone through (or are in the midst of) real addictions to coke and diet coke. Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So, why not take a reasonably healthy drink like 100% fruit juice and make it carbonated? Brilliant! You get the sugar rush (but healthy sugars!) and the carbonation, without the crazy ingredients of most soda drinks.<br />You'll never need a mystery-fruit-flavored high fructose corn syrup, Yellow Dye # 9 concoction again!<br />I just wish the cans were a little bigger. This is one drink that can afford to be super-sized.

review/summary: I like the can
review/text: The can is pretty, a vibrant carnation pink. But although the can purports to contain 100% juice, a quick inspection reveals that apple and grape, not kiwi and berry (strawberry, raspberry) get top billing on the ingredients list.  Unsurprisingly, the flavor seems a little muddled, a little tangy, awfully sweet.  One family member described it as bubble gummy, another noted that it tasted metallic but "maybe in a glass bottle it would taste okay."<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is heavy on fruit sugars, though I appreciate the absence of that cloying corn syrup sweetener that contaminates so many popular soft drinks.  There is nothing particularly nutritious about Switch, but maybe some parents (presumably the target market) won't be able to figure that out.<br /><br />It's not the worst carbonated beverage I've ever tried, but it's nowhere near the best, nor does it have the fresh wholesome flavor that we spoiled consumers expect from our fruit juices.  I'll stick with water.

I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't.

review/text: This product is absolutely not to my taste.  It is advertised as a carbonated juice drink, so I kinda expected something along the lines of Welch's Sparkling Grape Juice; I was wrong. The first thing I noticed after opening the can was the aroma; it was unpleasant.  The drink is not very strongly carbonated and there isn't much bite to it.  The strawberry/kiwi flavor is very muted and is masked by something terrible.  The taste was bad going down but worse after a minute or so, as the aftertaste is strong and unpleasant.<br /><br />On top of the bad taste and unpleasant aroma, the drink has a considerable amount of calories for a small can at 135 calories per 8.3 ounces.  Perhaps there are vitamins and things in the drink that make it worthwhile for people who... well, I am not sure who might like this stuff.<br /><br />1/5 - not recommended<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I just don't like it.

review/summary: Can You Say YUCK?!!!
review/text: I am a  big fan of carbonated soft drinks and juice drinks. So while I strongly disliked the Switch Black Cherry flavor, I wanted to keep an open mind to Switch Kiwi Berry. While I started off with an open mind, after drinking most of the can I wished I kept a closed mouth. I found the carbonation level to be satisfactory, but I felt the so-called Kiwi Berry flavor could be summed up in one very technical term -- Yuck! Not only was the flavor bad going down, it left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (34g), sugar (33g) and calories (135). My overall opinion of this product is the same as it was for the Black Cherry variety -- i.e., it is not worth drinking even for free (as I did thanks to the Vine program). If these observations don't turn you off, drink up and enjoy!

review/summary: Sweet/Tart nice carbonation - you won't realize it's not traditional soda
review/text: I found this soda simultaneously sweet and tart, which is interesting, with no bitter aftertaste or the acidic feeling of regular dark soda. It was a bit too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the kiwi nor was I wowed over by the taste of fresh strawberries. In fact, it was not that much different than Hanson's (although I like their taste better). It's 100% juice and carbonated - I figured it would either taste like sparkling cider or something similar orange soda, but neither is correct. It seems a bit heavier than cider and not as bubbly as orange soda. It does not really have a fresh fruit taste to it, and it is a bit heavy on the taste (e.g. not a subtle, light taste).<br /><br />Being 100% juice this could be a better choice than soda for kids. But with 135 calories and 11% of your RDA of sugar in a small 8 oz can, you are only improving over the dyes and additives. If the sugars concern you, compare this to Soda Club's drinks and you will be much happier there. However, it does sport 100% of RDA of Vitamin C - so it might have a slight cold-fighting benefit as well. For an adult, I would pass. The soda is sized for kids and that also means more waste generated. It would be too easy to chug 4 of these, and while being fat free, it is not easy on the calories.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like it but don't love it; however it was too small, had too many calories, and is too pricey for everyday consumption.

I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice. And the cost is ~50% more per ounce for Switch vs. Juicy Juice for my region.<br /><br />I would say that for everyone who is interested in this product... let your taste buds be your guide.

review/summary: Sweet enough for a 7-year-old!
review/text: I gave this product the ultimate test, I gave half to my son, who loves sodas and sweet stuff. We both found this a satisfying drink, and one with just the right amount of berry flavor. It is not oversweet, nor does it have that funky aftertaste many "non-soda" soda type drinks do. My son gave it his thumbs up and said he would drink it. I liked the flavor combination as well, kiwi and berry, and would buy this product.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I was a little disappointed with this soda.  True, it's all natural and only fruit juice sweetened, but it's too sweet for my taste.  I diluted it with cold water, and enjoyed it.  I don't drink fruit "drinks" that are not 100% juice, so I thought this would be good.  I prefer the fresh, clean taste of the Knudsen spritzers.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a more natural fruit soda, this might be what you're looking for.  If you want a refreshing juice with some fizz, try the Knudsen spritzers.

review/summary: Switch Kiwi Berry
review/text: This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas, but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But, the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others, like the cherry which I also got.

review/summary: A nice alternative to pop (as we call it here)
review/text: I wanted to try this b/c it's made with sugar (or possibly natural fruit sugars) instead of corn syrup. The result was a drink that's a little sweet for my taste but one that most people will probably like. It's 33 grams of sugar per serving; I generally find fruit juices and pop to run about 28 grams of sugar. Then again, that's corn syrup, not "sugar" per se.<br /><br />The flavor reminded me a bit of raspberry ginger ale (possibly influenced by its similar color). The smell of the drink is amazing and the consensus in our little at-home taste test was that it smelled better than it tasted.<br /><br />I would definitely try this in a party punch or similar. As for drinking it straight, it was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I would try other flavors and buy this if I saw it in the store.

review/summary: Good balance of fizziness and 100% fruity goodness
review/text: I didn't expect this to be this fizzy. Sure it's not like a Pepsi, but if you want some carbonation from a beverage in a healthier manner, this is a great alternative. However, you might be disappointed if you intend on replacing your favorite soda because you'd definitely miss the extra sugary flavor, thus leaving it to taste like a fizzy fruity tea.<br /><br />Still, I don't normally drink soda, and there are times that I definitely crave it. So these would be a good-enough substitute, especially if you're not used to extremely sugared beverages. I'd also feel very safe about giving this to children.

My husband thought this was better than the cherry flavor, as did the kids (ages 11 & 9).<br /><br />We all found this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.

review/text: This product does not claim to be any kind of energy drink, despite the slim can and flashy design.  Instead, it says that it is carbonated fruit juice, and that is exactly what you are going to get!  It is labeled as containing 100% fruit juice by volume, which coincides with the ingredient list.  It is refreshing, new, and something I would consider drinking again.  I leave off the final fifth star, as it was not the most flavorful beverage of the group, but I believe that owes to the fact that there are multiple flavors competing for a spot on your palatte.  Sometimes, one does lose the parts in the whole that way.  Still, I liked it and will definitely drink it again!

review/summary: A nice treat, but no substitute
review/text: I am a moderate drinker of both sodas and juices, so I was intrigued by the promise of The Switch.  I would receive the vitamin benefits of my juices with the fizzy fun of a soda.  The can is slim, so it fits nicely in my lunch bag but would rattle around in my car cup holder if I decided to take it as a to-go breakfast drink.  Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I really liked the light kiwi/berry taste more than the black cherry.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me.

review/text: I don't like artificial sweeteners because they're too sweet, so while sipping Switch's Kiwi Berry drink, I kept rechecking the can for a sign of any sort of diet ingredient. None were listed.  Switch says there's nothing but sparkling juice in the can, no sugar or artificial sweeteners, so that's that.<br /><br />I like the amount of sparkle in the juice, but as a thirst quencher, it was too cloyingly sweet, at least for me. This certainly doesn't mean you might not love it -- I just prefer my sweet with a good dose of tart.<br /><br />Verdict: I'll stick to a good old-fashioned kiwi-strawberry beverage from Snapple or Trader Joe's or Costco. They all have good ones.<br /><br />By the way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was also sweet, but far more to my liking.

This one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Of the three flavors by favorite, by far, is the Black Cherry. It had a much more mild taste and didn't seem nearly as sweet as this one. If you like a lot of kick in your juice, and an almost over powering flavor this one may be for you. However, that is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />I much prefer the Black Cherry over the other two.

The berry flavor is not too strong and the carbonation is just the right amount.<br /><br />The only downside is the size of the can.  For some reason this comes in Red Bull-sized cans, which leave you wanting more.  A regular 12 oz soda can would have served this excellent drink better.

review/summary: Good, but a little too sweet for my taste
review/text: I enjoy sodas and carbonated drinks, but don't drink too many of them because I'm trying to consume healthier things.  I was sent a can of The Switch through the Amazon's vine program to review.<br /><br />The smell is very strong, medicine-like, and somewhat unapproachable.  The taste on the other hand is very sweet, and it does have hints of the kiwi and strawberry flavors.  It's a little too sweet for my liking, but I am the type of person who drinks juice watered down.<br /><br />As far as being a "healthy alternative to soda", they do a pretty good job.  There's no HFCS (a big plus), and no artificial colors.  On the other hand, all of the juice in it is "reconstituted from concentrates".  The can says it has "natural flavors" which I always consider a dubious term to hide behind on items claiming to be "healthy".  Also, and 8.3 oz can of "The Switch" has 135 calories, while a 8.3 oz of Coke has roughly 109 calories, so this thing is a sugar bomb (even though it says there is "no sugar added".  No kidding!  It doesn't need it!).<br /><br />If you like really sweet things, then this might be a good buy for you.  As for myself, I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this again.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting and refreshing
review/text: I don't generally drink anything but water, coffee and tea, do not like soda, and only use juice in smoothies, so was surprised that I like the Switch juice drink as much as I do. I've only tried two flavors, the Kiwi Berry and the Black Cherry (Note: I did this review on that flavor also). They are pretty similar but I slightly prefer the Black Cherry. The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.<br /><br />The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor. There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days. Because it is juice only and a slight amount of carbonation, there is no after taste.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find these drinks to be too sweet at all, and I fully expected to considering all juice usually tastes pretty darn sweet to me. I think the carbonation may tone down the sweetness of the juice?<br /><br />For me this is a "special" once-in-awhile treat so I don't mind the price.  I like the 8.3oz amount; it is just the right amount -- forgot to mention in my other review on the Black Cherry flavor that this amount fits perfectly into a wine glass which really adds to the ambiance!

review/summary: lightly carbonated and very sweet
review/text: This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.<br /><br />I tasted this flavor as well as the "black cherry" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.  If the concept of carbonated fruit juice appeals to you, then<br />this is a good flavor to start with.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional information:  8.5fl oz., 135 calories, 0g fat, 15 mg sodium, 34 g total carbs, 33 g sugar, 0g protein, 100% vitamin C.<br /><br />ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (vitamin C)

review/summary: It's like Pop Rocks, in liquid form.
review/text: When I drank the strawberry kiwi, the flavor reminded me very much of the strawberry Pop Rocks candy. It was very sweet, but not so much that I felt like I needed to drink water after it. The carbonation was apparent, but not strong. Kinda like the carbonation in a Pellegrino, as opposed to a Coke. The can was a little on the small side, so I could see myself drinking 2 at once. I'd drink it again sometime, but it's not an everyday buy.

review/summary: Not bad, but it should be called "The Switch Apple, Grape, Kiwi & Berry"
review/text: This was a pretty good idea -- it's basically juice from concentrate that's been reconstituted with sparkling instead of plain water. As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product. And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case it's really noticeable.  However, it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor -- the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice, that could be enough to ruin this drink for you.

review/summary: Tastes more like Carbonated apple juice
review/text: The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the "base" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and/or grape fades to the background.<br /><br />Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the "Apfelschorle" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another "regular" soda.<br /><br />It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest "health" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price.

review/summary: Small yet tasty
review/text: Upon first glance, one would think this is your regular energy drink. The size of the product does seem to convey this. At 8.3 oz, this is something a lot of people could finish in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The flavor is nice and tasty. You can taste both the berry and kiwi.  No funny aftertaste and it goes down easily.  It is not tart nor is it too sweet. The carbonation isn't too overpowering. It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.  My only suggestion is to make the can a little bigger as there's just not enough juice to completely quench your thirst for the price that you are paying.

review/text: As I said in my first review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, the good in The Switch outweighs the bad. The drink is tasty, and I prefer the carbonation over a straight juice product. I feel the carbonation imparts a slightly bitter finish, but that it adds to the drinkability of what is essentially a sweet but unimposing fruit flavor. So while there is nothing particularly wrong with the drink, I can't really get enthusiastic about it and I think there are better, tastier, and more economical selections available. It's a great change of pace but is not a threat to become a regular in my drink routine.

review/summary: Sweetness Overload
review/text: My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar, even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant, overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all, it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse -- it had a kind of chemical-y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy, go ahead and try Switch.  But if not -- avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix.

review/summary: This is What Soda Should Be!
review/text: When I ordered this drink, I hoped that it would provide a sweet, somewhat more healthy alternative to my usual soda fix.  I wanted to be optimistic, but after the nasty aftertaste from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, I didn't hold out too much hope.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how refreshing and tasty this drink is.  I tastes mostly like strawberry, with a slight hint of grape.  The carbonation is very mild and makes the whole thing keep from being too syrupy or tasting too sweet.<br /><br />This is now my favorite way to get 100% of my daily Vitamin C, which is a lot more than I get from Coke.

review/summary: Looking for a replacement for soda?
review/text: Are you looking for a relatively healthy option for soda?  well, look no further!  This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of the things I like, and the things that I did not like as much:<br /><br />First, the positive:<br /><br />The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor, that means Kiwi and Berry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable, which is very nice!<br /><br />The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.<br /><br />The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you, but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes, I know you can always pour out what is more than want, but how often does that happen?<br /><br />The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch, brief case, computer case, etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty, the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people.<br /><br />The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 135 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison, Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson, a serving size of Coca-cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So, do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!<br /><br />I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line, but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses, 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.<br /><br />Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.<br /><br />Ok, so overall, this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink, just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!<br /><br />The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count, the price, the volume you need to order, and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that, no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives).

review/summary: My fav
review/text: Of the four flavors this product comes in, this is my fav. It is light, fruity, and refreshing. There is no weird taste, no bitterness. I'm willing to give up the 100 plus calories this has per serving to get 100% of the RDA of vitamin C and feel really refreshed. I think this product is so good because there is no sticky sweetness, no heaviness like regular juice has. The carbonation and the proportion of the various juices fits my palate perfectly. I would love a larger serving, but the calories would get out of hand. I may never go back to straight juice again.

It tastes just about as sweet as soda but without the corn syrup/sugar.  It is less carbonated than soda but I like that.  It also has a "lighter", crisper taste.  The Kiwi Berry flavor is good but my favorite is the Black Cherry flavor.  I recommend both but keep in mind that the can is only 8.3 ounces and costs more than soda.  I think it is worth it!

review/text: Flavor is light, mostly strawberry, as is the can. Switch is all-natural fruit juice, and the ingredients are a shortlist of -- well, carbonated fruit juice. Big thumbs up, when you compare the list on every other soft-drink can. The portion size is 8.3 oz., which probably less than you're used to in a canned drink. The Switch seems to me to be a wonderful flavor, satisfying. It was a pleasant experience without guilt. Try it and see for yourself.

review/summary: Crisp taste, but high in carbs/sugars
review/text: I really enjoyed the taste of this product. It neither seemed too "berry" or too "kiwi" -- it was a nice balance. I would compare this to a strongly-flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.<br /><br />The product provides 100% of vitamin C -- a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3-ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.<br /><br />It's an all-natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving.

review/summary: Better Than Soda
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice refreshing alternative to the typical carbonated soft-drinks on the market.<br /><br />The taste although unusual at first is rather pleasant once you get used to it. I'd describe it as a cross between those Dole Blended juices and soda water. Strange as it sounds it actually tastes good.<br /><br />Although I suppose it's slightly better for you than soda - The Switch doesn't use High-Fructose Corn Syrup - it's still full of calories and carbs.<br /><br />Still for people who generally don't drink soda such as myself but find themselves occasionally craving a carbonated beverage this is a nice alternative.<br /><br />The can is only 8.3 oz. which does make it considerably smaller than a can of soda. As long as you can stick to only drinking one you'll be slightly better off than drinking a typical non-diet soda.

review/summary: Soda Juice II
review/text: In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The difference? The Izze products are fortified with vitamins: B6 and Niacin in addition to C and have roughly three fifths the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of The Switch products.

The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.<br /><br />The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.<br /><br />That being said the black cherry was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks.

I think that this is a great drink and would recommend it to people my only real major complaint is that the cans are too small and I really feel that I need a second can to quench my thirst.  However if they were much bigger then I think the sugar content would be bigger than a regular can of soda.

Another plus is that one serving (the whole can) has 100% RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />We also give them bonus points for encouraging recycling of this can and putting that notice in a rather visible spot using the same font as the rest of their text - instead of fine-printing it.

review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: Please excuse the beginning of this review being the same as my review for Black Cherry, but the facts are the same.<br /><br /> What is "Switch," a new refreshing drink  that will dazzle you.<br /><br /> The can is colorful, 8.3 oz, not a large drink, and has a catchy saying - "100% of what you want 0% of what you don't."  What does that mean?  According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated.<br />Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink. especially for our children. But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, and our children definitely will not drink it, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH<br /><br />Now, here is a flavor that I could get use to in a hurry.  This taste was bubbling with flavor and actually brought pleasure to my taste-buds.  It was rich and smooth, yet bursting with excitement at the same time.  It did not leave an after taste that was unpleasant, but left you wanting more.<br />The blending of the flavors in this Switch was excellent and definitely made this taster happy.I had my grandchild take a drink and she absolutely loved it and asked me to go purchase some.  I recommend this flavor. Truly a treat for the taste buds.  Very good.

review/text: It tastes light and fizzy.  I liked the taste but would not 'switch' and buy this instead of my favorite juices/pop.  If someone handed it to me, I wouldn't refuse it.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Let me start out by saying that one can of Switch just wasn't enough...at least not when you're sharing it!! In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.<br /><br />I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi-strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.<br /><br />This is good stuff...get some.

review/summary: Hits the spot
review/text: Kiwi and strawberry are a good combination, and combined with a bit of carbonation, this drink "hits the spot".  It is made from real fruit juice (concentrate), but it still has 33g of sugar.  As a "snack" or "treat," it would be good, but I don't think I would drink it if I was just thirsty.  8.3oz isn't much.  Nice concept similar to an "energy" drink, but not just sugar and caffeine.
