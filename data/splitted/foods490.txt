review/summary: A Must For bergamot Lovers
review/text: If, like me, you find a lot of Earl Grey teas a bit weak in that most delicious and enticing bergamot aroma, this is definitely the one for you. It is not over powerful, just right. The tea itself is not strong so if you like very strong tea by all means add a bag of regular black tea to brew along with the Stash. Absolutely delicious..It will bring you to an exotic and distant land of pure enchantment.

review/text: This tea has an excellent flavor that I never get sick of.  I usually have one every morning at work.  Its earl grey, which is strong, so make sure you like that type of tea.  Before finding this here on Amazon, I used to purchase this exact brand/flavor at Jewel for around $6 each 20ct box... much better deal here.

review/summary: Over all, fairly good
review/text: I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.

review/text: I love hot teas, and had never tried any chai before someone suggested this one to me.<br /><br />It's perfect any time, with a bit of sugar and a little milk added. Has a wonderful flavor, not overpoweringly spicy, but just right. It's also fine without milk, but milk does 'smooth' the spices a bit.<br /><br />Buy it a couple of six pack of boxes at a time. I'm pretty sure having a couple of cups (or more) every night constitutes addiction. =)

review/summary: most flavorful chai i've found
review/text: Being a fan of the creamy, spicy chai teas one can get in the coffeeshops, I've tried to recreate them at home with disappointing results -- until now.  I've probably purchased ten or twelve different brands of Chai looking for the right one.  I finally found it with this Stash Premium Double Spice.  It is exceptionally flavorful, and really able to hold the strong flavor.  The aroma is incredible.  Although it has cinnamon, it doesn't strike me as particularly cinnamony -- I think the cardamom flavor may come through a little more strongly.  Nor is it particularly spicy -- I can't handle spicy foods and I don't have a problem with this.  This tea is a little heartier than most -- I have taken to drinking it instead of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />I haven't been quite as impressed with the other Stash teas I've tried (they're okay, but nothing special) and generally prefer Mighty Leaf or Tazo -- but this tea quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list -- I'll be ordering much more.

review/summary: So Tasty in the Winter!
review/text: I usually drink green tea, straight up.  But I wound up in a Starbucks one day and ordered a Chai Latte.  It didn't taste like tea to me at all!  It was more like hot chocolate, only with spices instead of chocolate.  I thought I'd gone to heaven.  I regretted not bringing some of the Tazo tea home later.  I just started craving the stuff.  I found Tazo Chai Spice at the supermarket, but wasn't happy with the price.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try Stash.  I already buy some of their green teas.  It's even better than Tazo!  The Spice Chai or Double Spice Chai, they're both delicious.  The Double just has more spices and works better with milk.  Or cream :)  Makes the house smell good, too.  Not knocking Tazo, either, after all, I did rave about their tea.  I just think this is even better.<br /><br />If you want to give tea as a gift, spice probably won't go to waste, no matter what the tea drinker usually drinks.  Every tea drinker I know can go for a spice every now and then.

review/text: I never liked Earl Grey til I had Bentley's.  It was a gift, far too expensive for my daily tea.  This Stash DOUBLE BERGAMOT is just as good and so much cheaper.  I ordered 200 bags because I drink it every day.  It's all about the Bergamot; otherwise it's just black tea.  This product gives you that pronounced Bergamot flavot that makes it special.  Don't be afraid to buy a large quantity.  You won't be disappointed.but beware:  you may become addicted.

If you're in the US and you've been looking for a substitute for Harrods, this is it.

Very distinctive flavor.  Unique!  Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out.  Priced better than the local stores.

review/text: I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.

review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

I have in the past had a difficult time finding it in any of the grocercy stores I shop at, and when I do the price is at least a dollar a box more than here.<br /><br />If you like a flavorful tea, you should like this one.  In my hom you can't go wrong with this one.

review/summary: it's got double the spice, but. . .
review/text: the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)

review/summary: Very good orange spice tea.
review/text: I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?

review/summary: Steeping - the longer the better
review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: My mom gave me a box of this a few years ago and I had just recently gotten around to trying it. It was excellent. I bought another box and the second I opened the first packet I could smell that they had changed the recipe. Checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it. Cinnamon is about all I taste when I drink it, although the aftertaste has a hint of clove. Pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child.

review/summary: Tasty and unique
review/text: After trying Artisana's Cacao Bliss, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer's other products.  I really enjoy macademia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try.  This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />Unlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container.  There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar.  When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture.  This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer.  I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product.  There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is "made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's."<br /><br />This is my second good experience with Artisana products.  For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets.  They are tasty, natural and unique.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States

review/summary: Corn tastes very delicious, even without any salt added
review/text: Like beans, peas, and other antioxidant-rich starches, corn is somewhat too high in calories.  However, eating corn without salt will help us to live longer.  Also, yellow corn, but not white corn, contains generous amounts of the 2 carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which will help to prevent age-related eye diseases in humans.  The use of lead has been banned in the canning process in the U.S. so we can safely drink the fluid inside of each no-salt-added can.  At least 20% of the nutrients (vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) are in the fluid, not the solids.  Think of it as a healthy tea drink.  Farmers try to give humans their best corn and send the corn infected with high levels of 2 different Fusarium fungi, which contaminate the corn with the hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic mycotoxins, fumonisin B1 and fumonisin B2, to feed livestock or to make gasohol.

review/summary: Lindt has ruined their 70% bar -- let's hope they leave this one alone!
review/text: I've been eating Lindt EXCELLENCE 70% chocolate bars for years, but in the fall of 2010 they began adding emulsifiers to the chocolate which ruined the taste, texture, and overall quality of the product.  Now that I can no longer scrounge up the older versions of the 70% bars (the ones without the red banner reading "NEW RECIPE"), I tried the 85%.<br /><br />This is a very rich, dark chocolate, which is not as sweet as the 70%.  It did take me a little getting used to, but now I really do love it.  The aroma alone is a major chocolate turn-on!  It has a delightfully firm texture that melts beautifully in your mouth.<br /><br />If Lindt ever goes back to their original recipe for the 70% bar, I'm sure I'll buy them again.  But I doubt I'll ever give up on the 85% bars completely.  Well, as long as I never see that dreaded red "NEW RECIPE" banner on an 85% bar!<br /><br />If you loved the old 70% bars, give the 85% bars a chance.  They'll remind you why  you loved Lindt chocolate in the first place.

review/text: This is my favorite chocolate by far. I do warn that it is extremely extremely dark and quite bitter. I started off with the 70% which is quite a bit sweeter and then, when I had gotten used to the 70, I upgraded to the 85 and wow, it's intense and incredible. So rich and dark. They have a 99% as well but I don't think I'm that bold yet!<br /><br />Now, when I eat 60% chocolate it tastes so sweet! Not only is the 85% better because it has more antioxidants but it also has much much less sugar than 35% milk chocolate!<br /><br />If you're not ready for the 85%, start slow. Hershey's has a 45% and 60%!<br /><br />I eat one little square a day whenever I have it in the pantry! Yum!

review/text: Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!

I agree, it is important to be aware of various ingredients, but IMHO not necessary to obsess over them.

It holds well and you can squirrel it away for when you want to give yourself a treat. It's quick/easy to make and the broth is really flavorful. Noodles are soft and there are little naruto in there (if you're into that sort of thing).

review/summary: Light broth and tasty thick Udon noodles
review/text: After a long day of work, add water, 5 minutes later, dinner is done. How easy is that! Compare to other soft noodles (e.g. ramen) and its usual flavored content, this totally worth the price. The broth is light and tasty. I especially like thick and chewy udon noodles. I believe JFC Udon Bowl also has a Curry flavor Udon variety, that one is very salty, not great tasting as this one.

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: I got these because I like the Myojo curry flavored ramen and thought I'd give these a try. Something about the texture is off. The udon are too dense. Even with soaking them in hot water, draining, then adding water for the soup, they're still too dense. The curry flavor is okay, pretty mild, but there seems to be some weird after taste, like maybe these have been in the plastic packaging too long. Either way, I'm going to stick with more expensive Japanese udon or the Nong Shim udon which has the right texture and no weird after taste.

review/text: On the label, it says "FRESH UDON," and whoa... was I surprised how good the udon tasted for an instant package that you could prepare in 3 min.  The udon noodles itself had that solid, chewy texture that was just right.  This soup has really good flavor and I would say it's the best instant udon that I've eaten so far.

review/summary: Contains sugars AND artificial sweeteners!!!
review/text: I know instant noodles aren't considered to be a health food, but I can't see any reason for some of the ingredients in this soup, unless it's to hide other poor quality ingredients.  Most of the ingredients are chemical sounding names that I had never heard of, so I looked them up.  Among them, propylene Glycol is a colourless viscous hydroscopic sweet-tasting compound used as an antifreeze and brake fluid (WTF!!!), and most of the others I couldn't find (even using Google).  Then there are the 8 -- that's not a misprint; I said eight -- times sugar in its various forms are mentioned in the ingredient list: Sorbitol, Sucrose Fatty Acid Esters, High Fructose Syrup, Glucose, sugar (listed THREE times), sweet cooking wine.  Then after adding all that sugar, they added an artificial sweetener (Sucralose).<br /><br />I don't care how easy this is to make -- or how good it tastes!  With all the sugar it contains, anybody who is the least bit sensitive to sugar (for instance, diabetics or hypoglycemics) would really experience major sugar overload from eating it!

review/text: I bought Galil Almond TD and Hazer Baba Pistachio TD to compare.  The boxes are similar, but the Galil is more expensive.  I like both, but prefer the Galil brand.  The Hazer Baba was softer and mushier and the aliquot of nuts is skimpier, certainly than the picture on the front.  The Galil was chewier and firmer and had relatively more nuts.  It's very good and will be gone far too soon if I don't hide it or give it as gifts.

None produces the same effects as this one does. My suggestion: buy and try it yourself. Enjoy!

review/text: First, search around on Amazon... there are a few sellers selling the same thing, in this case coffee, so the price can vary.<br /><br />For this being an 'intense' coffee, it delivers in flavor but not in boldness.<br /><br />It feels like a semi-dark or medium dark coffee that just has a finer grind than other DE coffees.<br /><br />To truly make it 'intense' I usually add a scoop or two!<br /><br />The flavor is good and it is a very smooth coffee.<br /><br />However, it is not the 'best' coffee I have ever had, though it is up there.  I do like their "Aroma Rood" coffee (available here on Amazon.com) as well;  both are worth a shot.  pun intended.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: Larabars in general have my love & devotion. I love that they're all natural - really natural - and not jacked up with uberprocessed ingredients like soy protein isolate. Just fruit, nuts, and the occasional spice or extract. No MSG (natural or otherwise), no gluten, no soy, no dairy, but mighty delicious.<br /><br />That said, Peanut Butter & Jelly is the best thing since (PB&J on) sliced bread.  It tastes so much like a PB&J sandwich, your taste buds may be fooled. Only it's better, because the "jelly" is actual cherries, not a cherry-flavored sugary substance.  Plus, you can't stick a PB&J in your bag & enjoy it a week later.<br /><br />It's a yummy treat; it's a protein-rich energy booster; it's a quick bite on the road to save you from craving fast food when the munchies hit... and your taste buds will never know it's health food.

review/summary: The Triumverate really outdid themselves this time.
review/text: In the past, I've had to wake up with a monkey on my back every morning. The knowledge that I would have to go throughout the day, constantly having my jimmies rustled. I've tried to tell my boss about my jimmies, and how he can help them not be rustled, but all he does is laugh it off, rustling me and my jimmies even further. That monkey made my life unbearable.<br /><br />Now, Gorilla Munch has given me a monkey I want on my back. When I first saw this cereal, I knew, I knew that this cereal could keep my jimmies unrustled, and keep me happy. Ever since my first bite, my jimmies feel like they could fly away to a place without rustling. My jimmies have not been rustled since last Thursday.<br /><br />On a more serious note, rustled jimmies have become a worldwide issue. When I had my jimmies rustled, I was not the only one. Across the world, thousands and thousands of people, gorillas, koalas, pandas, penguins, lemurs and coatis have their jimmies rustled by people they thought were their friends.<br /><br />Jimmie rustling needs to be taken to the supreme court. Jimmie rustling needs to have a law, restricting jimmie rustlers from rustling these victims. If you want to help those with rustled jimmies, please buy a box of this cereal.<br /><br />If your wallet has had its jimmies rustled, then please call 1-800-JIM-MIES. Rustlers will be hung up on and reported to the triumverate.

He's a really nice dude who was just struggling with a drug problem and got clean, but the AIDS didn't go away... that is, not until I told him about this fantastic cereal. The pure, wholesome organic (or should I say ORANGUTANIC?) grains of this gluten-free Guerrilla Munch cereal seemed to miraculously clear up his nasty case of AIDS and he's on his way to a speedy recovery. Before this he was drinking Essiac tea and using crystals and orgonite, but nothing seemed to work. Now he's not only cured of AIDS but it also stopped chemtrails, psychic vampirism/black magick attempts by the government, and cured him of homosexuality. Thank you, Triumvirate.

review/summary: Tasty & Filling -- A Rarity for Gluten-Free!
review/text: Gorilla Munch has been a real life-saver for me.  Having celiac disease, I have gotten used to cereals that taste and feel like soggy cardboard.  Gorilla Munch is extra crunchy, which in and of itself is like a treat, and it keeps its flavor even when milk is added, which almost never happens with gluten-free cereals.  It's more affordably priced than the other gluten-free cereals on the market and is very filling, at least for me.  I usually mix in a teaspoon of FiberSure to help make it a little more nutritional, and sometimes I add fresh fruit, which goes very well with it.  For those who do not like the crunchiness of Gorilla Munch, I've found that using unsweetened almond milk rather than cow's milk seems to soften it up almost instantly, for some reason.<br /><br />I take issue with the idea that Gorilla Munch is nothing but junk being targeted at children.  This cereal is marketed to children who cannot eat gluten, meaning they're mostly children who are used to food tasting terrible (those with celiac disease or wheat allergies) and children who are /positively/ stimulated by bright colors and designs (those with autism).  They are already on strict diets which require that they watch their nutrient intake, so having one mostly fluff product is not going to hurt them.  Children on gluten-free diets aren't exactly the ones you worry about eating doughnuts and cookies every day, and with all of the bland, soggy food we're stuck with, they deserve a treat once in a while.  And with almost no other brand making fun-looking gluten-free items geared at children, it's good to have at least /something/ to look at, especially something that's educational.<br /><br />Additionally, EnviroKidz is a great company to support.  They spread awareness about important environmental and animal rights issues through their products, they use only environment-friendly organic products, and they give 1% of their proceeds to related causes.  When I have called their customer service line in the past, they have been exceptionally helpful, once even giving me a full refund for a product that was only slightly damaged.  I would much rather give them my money than some of the other lines out there.<br /><br />In brief, Gorilla Munch is a great cereal that helps put some life back into a gluten-free diet.  It's nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal again and not have to be reminded of my special diet and how restrictive it can be.  Thank you, Gorilla Munch!

review/summary: Organic, Moderate Sodium Product
review/text: If you are skipping sodium in order to keep your sodium intake below the RDA of 500 mg, then this product has too much sodium for you despite its "low sodium" claim: Serving size: 3/4 cup (30g); 9 servings per box; 100 mg of sodium; 1 gram of total fat (0 g saturated or trans fat); 0 mg cholesterol; 26 g total  carbohydrate (9 g sugars); and 2 g of dietary fiber.<br /><br />That said, this is quite a yummy breakfast cereal, especially for a puffed corn cereal.  The ingredients are organic  corn meal, organic evaporated cane juice, and sea salt.  It must be the cane juice that makes it taste so much better than its mainstream nonorganic competitors.  My daughter and I finished off the box in one morning!<br /><br />The box design is unusually informative and my daughter took it apart at the seam in order to spread it out like a poster.  On the back of the box is "The Story of Kureba", a gorilla born on October 3, 1999 in the war-torn country of Rwanda.  Readers are encouraged to help Kureba, his mother, and his family by contributing to an Adopt-A-Gorilla program.  On the inside of the box are 4 stories: What Does The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International Do?, Saving Gorillas, Isaro and Uncle Rano, and the Adopt-A-Gorilla program.

For us cereal, bread, and pizza are missed the most on our gluten free diet.  Now that envirokidz has so many options for the days we crave carbs and sweetness all is well in the cereal department.  This is similar to peanut butter panda puffs without the peanut butter taste.  Reminds me of captain crunch in its flavor.

review/summary: Replace your Cap'n Crunch!
review/text: Gorilla Munch tastes a lot like Cap'n Crunch, just not as sugary sweet and no chemical aftertaste. It's a good alternative to the unhealthy store brands if your kids are not into granola and only want the sweet cereals. Not our favorite of the Envirokids - we love the Panda Puffs - but if you are looking to replace Captain Crunch, Kix or similar cereal, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This tastes so much better than traditional cereal- none of that nasty chemical aftertaste, stays crunchy for a long time, and is sweet without being overpowering.  A bigger box would be nicer, but the price considering the organic ingredients and the sales donated to charity is really not that bad.

review/summary: Gorilla Munch and Ener-G Crackers
review/text: I can get the Gorilla Munch cereal in the stores here but buying from Amazon actually saved me money...even with the shipping charge!  I also ordered Ener-g crackers that are impossible to find in the store and buying through Amazon saved me about $1.00 per box from what I would have paid on the Ener-G website.  Gluten Free products are expensive enough as it is. I love these two products! Thank goodness for Amazon!
