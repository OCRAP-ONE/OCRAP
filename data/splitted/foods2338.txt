review/summary: Least favorite K-cup to date
review/text: These K-cups arrived in a timely fashion but when I've tried using them at all 3 size settings none of them are strong enough. It seems there is not enough coffee in them. I wrote a complaint to Van Houtte and they did not respond...So I've got nearly 50 cups that when brewed smell like chocolate raspberry but taste like water. Not happy.

review/text: As a relatively new Keurig user (former Senseo user), I have been trying various flavored coffees along with regular pods.  This coffee was not bad, just not my favorite flavor combination.  I'm not sure why because how can you beat chocolate and raspberry.  This is just a personal preference issue.  The product was received in a timely manner and arrived in good shape.  So far my favorite flavored coffee is Timothy's Sugar Bush maple. This flavor may work well for you.  Enjoy

review/summary: Incredibly disappointing
review/text: The idea of creme brulee coffee sounded so delicious.  It took a week and a half to get here so we were REALLY looking forward to trying it for the first time.  How disappointed we were.  There's absolutely nothing that indicates a creme brulee flavor or even anything with a slightly sweet (or sweet smell).  This is a smokey coffee and I think that makes a difference.  There's a somewhat nice aftertaste but it's nothing like we'd expected.  Now I'm pouring sugar and cream, or flavored cream, in it just so it's not wasted.  We have the vanilla flavored coffee in this brand so we really thought this would be amazing.  What's not amazing is that I'll never see my $33 again.  I can't wait until we drink it all up just so we can forget it ever happened.

review/text: Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.  It has a very strong artificial flavor that doesn't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly doesn't taste like coffee.  Like one other reviewer said, I'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I don't know anybody who would enjoy it.  YUK!

review/summary: One of the best k cups we've tried so far!
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/text: I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great-tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly, I am giving up on Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and will purchase another flavor from now on.

review/text: After seeing all the reviews for this, I had to try it and now need to order another box of them. The smell of it brewing alone is probably enough reason to want to get more, but it tastes just as good as it smells. I've come to expect the same aromatic results from other kcup flavors and every other kind I have tried hasn't come anywhere near how this one brews. I find myself sniffing other flavors while they're brewing to see if there is any smell at all and I'm generally disappointed. This is my favorite flavor thus far!

review/summary: Decadence without the guilt!
review/text: I am happy to find that Amazon carries the Van Houtte k-cups, as the pricing is far better than other resources for k-cups.  This k-cup flavor strikes a nice balance between coffee and the chocolate and raspberry flavors, and you can feel like you're enjoying a nice truffle candy without the calories or guilt.<br /><br />The two box packaging is a plus if you're like me and have a Keurig at home and another at work.  This way, a box can go to work and the other stay home.  NOTE: these are the 24 count boxes, too, not the 12 or 14 that seem to fill the shelves of the local supermarkets, WalMart and department stores!<br /><br />If you're new to the K-cups and want a flavored coffee that delivers the flavor in the title, you can't go wrong with any of the Van Houtte varieties.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and French Vanilla are my favorites, followed by Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee and Mudslide.

review/summary: Meh....
review/text: I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very "meh" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/"legs", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz "cup" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee.

I mix this coffee with International Delight "White Chocolate Mocha" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrible waste of chocolate and raspberry flavors
review/text: I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a "tinny" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.

review/summary: Wonderful Coffee
review/text: As I am a decaf drinker, I was amazed that this regular coffee did not upset me.  Drinking this wonderful coffee is like eating chocolate covered raspberry candy.  It is not bitter as some coffees are, and it doesn't leave an aftertaste as some coffees do.<br /><br />My guests also enjoy it.<br /><br />All I can say is that I am very pleasantly pleased with this great tasting coffee.  A great pick me up.

review/summary: Best Flavored Coffee...
review/text: I generally do not drink the flavored coffee but our recent acquisition of the Keurig coffee maker I have been sampling many flavors.  Of all the 15 - 20 flavored coffees I have tried over the past 3 months the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee is BY FAR the BEST.  Fantastic blend of flavors and it actually has flavor...most others I tried seemed to have aroma but fell short in the flavor category.  I highly recommend trying this flavored coffee!

review/summary: nice rice crackers
review/text: We do not eat wheat and most brands of rice crackers are a lot more expensive than these were.  They are just a bit on the sweet side, rather than the salty flavor one expects from a "cracker".  But they are good, with soup or salad or alone...in which case topping them with a dab of peanut butter makes them even better.<br /><br />A pretty good crunch for the money.  Personally I still prefer Mary's Gone crackers, but my husband says those are too hard to chew, so now we have something crunchable for each of us!

review/summary: Be careful - shipped by courier as perishable in refrigerated box!
review/text: I'm feeling extremely foolish as I write this review.  I ordered this wasabi to be forwarded overseas without realizing that if it is "fresh," that means it is shipped refrigerated (with dry ice in a Styrofoam container within a box).  Of course my shipment was no longer cold by the time I received it in Oman - what a waste of good wasabi and a lot of money!  Although I can't rate the taste, I assume it would have been wonderful.  -sigh! -  So, I'm rating this item 4 stars because the description does not make the cold shipment clear for us dummies.

review/summary: Very dry and not very savory
review/text: These crackers/crisps are very dry and not very savory. They definitely bear the taste of the garbanzo beans that are baked into them (they kind of taste like hummus in solid form), but other than that, there isn't really any flavor, not even from the garlic or salt on the list of ingredients. These definitely need to be serveda s pictured on the package: with some kind of flavorful topping, like feta cheese -- and definitely also with a drink, at least a glass of water. The crisp alone will leave your mouth completely dry. I get that it's supposed to be healthy, but it definitely disappoints in the taste and texture department.

review/summary: Yummy!!
review/text: I first bought the white dental N Bone for my shiba inu puppy; however, he wasn't greatly interested in it and it took a while before he would chew on it.  So when I found the Bone A Mints at the pet shop, I decided to give these a try.  From the moment I opened the package and my puppy smelled them, his eyes lit up and you can tell he's in heaven from the way he eats these!  However, I make my puppy eat the Bone A Mint while I am holding it as when I allowed him to eat it on his own, he was probably trying to get it down too fast and vomitted everything up a little while later!  These are pretty expensive though so finding them on-line helped a lot.

review/summary: Wonderful treat for my pekingese
review/text: My Pekingese is remarkably picky about what she eats. If it's not up to her tastes, she'll just spit the food back out and walk away. My first week after adopting her was going back and forth between the pet stores trying to find the right food. Even harder, was finding the right treats for her. I wanted to stray away from the popular branded stuff that had "by-product" in the ingredient list, but she also doesn't have a strong bite so I could get the Greenies brand.<br /><br />This is the perfect breath freshener treat that my little dog can actually chew through. She's only 14 pounds, so I break each bone in half, which helps make the bag last alot longer. All in all, a great treat that picky dogs will love and tiny dogs can bite into (if you're dog can bite a carrot, they'll be fine with this.)

review/summary: Beats the others by a mile
review/text: I'd settled on this brand as my favorite quick polenta and was sad when I couldn't find it in my regular stores.  I gamely tried the other quick brands to find a replacement, but they just didn't compare.  The texture and taste of this brand is much superior and by far the most authentic.  The flavor is rich and clean, not 'doctored' tasting, so if you want to add your own enhancements nothing gets in the way.  The texture is not mushy as some of the others are.  One brand reminded me of baby cereal. It pleased me to find this favorite brand here on Amazon and I stocked up.  This is great stuff.<br /><br />While it is called 'quick' polenta, it's really pretty much instant and is ready almost as soon as you reach the consistency you like.  I boil some salted water and pour it in slowly while whisking (you have to do this lest it clump since it absorbs moisture so fast).  When I reach a slightly thickened loose consistency, I remove it from the burner and set it to rest after adding whatever suits me such as chopped herbs.  It will thicken further, so you don't want to get it too thick to begin with.  That's all there is to it.  A scoop of this polenta under a duck breast is pretty close to heaven.  If you want to save some to saut&eacute; later, spread it on a cookie sheet before it thickens too much.  It cuts nicely into rounds or squares for a later meal.

Nice price as well -- cheaper than what I've seen it in grocery stores. Each package is vacuumed packed, so if you don't open it, it will keep fresh for a very long time.  Good stuff!

I then tried the Berry and the Apple and liked those too. I went to two other stores but haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I was happy to find them at Amazon and ordered a dozen in each flavor including the Peach.  I do have to say that at least for me, the cooking directions need tweaking.  I add more water and increase the microwave time or it doesn't seem to be cooked enough and is too thick. Having said that, I think they taste great.  They're not mushy and have lots of texture, not to mention the convenience of having it all in it's own bowl.  Great to take to work since I'm always on the run. It's true that the price is a bit more from Amazon but at least I can find it when I run out so I'm okay with that.

Recently, there was a $4.00 clip this coupon. It's a shame you can't use the coupon multiple times for one big shipment. Finally, the expiration dates from Amazon are better than the grocery store. I have a month old shipment with an expiration of 01/13 from Amazon, while a local grocery store has the expiration dates mostly in late 2012.

The food here in Afghanistan is not up to par come breakfast time so I ordered these to help make better choices over sausage and donuts for a young woman trying to watch her health/weight.

review/summary: I love sweets but this is too sweet for breakfast
review/text: I saw the Quaker Real Medleys at my grocery store for about 2.50 a container.  I loved the thought of pistachio and cherry in an oatmeal.  When I made the product, I found it to be robust on sweetness, skimpy on cherries, and fairly generous with the almonds.  The overall sensation was that this product was really nothing to cry home about.  The flavor was fine but the brown sugar and sweetened cherries yield something that is a bit too sweet for me to turn to again as a breakfast option, especially at the current price point.  I hated that the manufacturer used a plastic 7 container.  Plastic 7 containers - unlike plastic 1 and plastic 2 - are not easily recycled.  I'll stick with Dr. McDougall oatmeal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFRU3U">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Peach, Raspberry, Oatmeal & Barley, 3-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTM8">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Cranberry Oatmeal, 3.1-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />Note: This product has milk derivatives and is therefore not vegan.

review/text: It is as close as cooking it from scratch. Everyone at work has asked me about. Once I add very hot water to it, it makes the room smell as if it was being cooked on the stove top. It almost smells like out of the oven apple pie. I would suggest that you fill it up with very hot  water all the way to the top. Being careful of course not to burn yourself. I usually place it first on a saucer, so I can carry it that way. If you fill it to the line, it is very thick. By filling it all the way to the top, it makes it taste like it was freshly made and just thick enough but not thick as glue, like it would be if you only fill it to the line. Also, I like to leave it covered with the lid that comes with it for about 5-7 minutes and then enjoy it. I would definitely buy again. I do recommend it.

review/summary: Would not buy again
review/text: I love oatmeal and I usually eat the Archer Farms organic brand from Target. Thought I'd give these a go, but it was nasty. I couldn't make myself choke down the whole carton. This was the second flavor I tried -- the first was the Cherry Pistachio, which was even worse and gave me a stomach ache for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I thought the ingredients sounded promising: WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, MULTI GRAIN BLEND (WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, ROLLED BARLEY, WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED RYE), DRIED SWEETENED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR), DRIED SWEETENED CRANBERRIES (CRANBERRIES, SUGAR), WALNUTS COATED WITH ROSEMARY EXTRACT, BROWN SUGAR, DEHYDRATED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR, FRUCTOSE, CINNAMON, MALIC ACID, SODIUM SULFITE FOR COLOR RETENTION), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED WHEAT, SALT, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />Part of the problem, for me, was that they're just too sweet. But part of the problem was also that they had a "weird" aftertaste. Kind of metallic and "off." I don't know how else to describe it. Something that doesn't taste like oatmeal or fruit or nuts. Maybe it's from the "natural flavors"?<br /><br />Of course, individual experiences will vary from mine. But I think I'll stick with the old-fashioned way. It's a lot cheaper and healthier to just make regular oatmeal and add your own "flavors" -- fruit, nuts, maple syrup, whatever -- and it won't leave a bunch of little cartons to recycle or go in the landfill.

Now I pay attention to labels, and I encourage you to read the nutrition label before making your purchase. If it still reads okay with you, then great.<br /><br />As to the actual taste, these are very sweet, especially if you add less water for a thicker consistency. They do keep you full for several hours, and hold you over.

review/summary: These are pretty great
review/text: They have sugar and probably artificial whatever, they're not organic, blah blah blah. They're tasty and super convenient (I have them delivered to my office via subscribe and save; doesn't get much more convenient than that). That is what I was looking for, and that is what these are. They have big fruit pieces and crunchy nuts and... oaty oats. I think the apple is the best flavor, though the peach was pretty good and the berry quite acceptable (if a bit tart). Haven't tried the cherry because I don't like cherries.<br /><br />I do recommend using more water than to-the-line; I fill it to a good centimeter or so (it's kinda imprecise) above the line, and let it sit awhile to absorb.

If I bought them and did not like, I was out a bunch of cash.<br />I went to the local Mart and found them for a buck fifty, bought one each of three flavors.I found them to be quite good, liked them and they are quick and easy.<br />I will buy them again but not from Amazon.<br />I am a prime member and after a year I found that, for the most part prime is a scam that needs to be looked into by the Gov.<br />The inflated prices on items more than pays for the cost of shipping and handling.The Prime membership fee then is pure profit.<br /><br />I will probably, buy from Amazon, one time items but not items bought on a regulsr basics.<br />Any one who has an over abundance of cash, please post here and I wll contasct you asI could sure ise it.

review/summary: Better than expected, generous amount of peach, and mostly whole oats
review/text: These are fast, convenient, easy, and tasty. Sized about right for a good breakfast, especially if you add an apple or other fruit, or some cheese. What I was not expecting was how good it would taste, the amount of peach, and the whole oats. There is enough peach for some in every bite, although not as much almonds. The downside as others have stated is how much sugar there is. But overall for getting me to eat my oatmeal and for being satisfying and tasty, this is a definite recommend.

We even ate it uncooked with milk...still yummy and quick as we are always running out the door to work, some class...whatever.  Great, quick breakfast item!

review/text: I just tried the peach almond this morning and love it.  I can't wait to try all the other flavors that I also purchased.  The convenience is great and you don't have to find a cup or bowl for microwaving.  Due to the cost, another reviewer mentioned to make your own.  I do not agree with this at all.  By the time you purchase the oatmeal, peaches, nuts, etc. that are in each of these, you would be spending a lot more than what these cost.  I will continue to purchase these for breakfast at work!

review/summary: Excellent, delicious, healthy, portable breakfast
review/text: I was skeptical at a "summer berry" oatmeal. It's difficult to reconstitute berries, but Quaker has managed to do it. It's slightly sweeter than I might like, but otherwise delicious.<br /><br />It's important to follow the microwave directions exactly, especially stirring before microwaving. Failure to do so will result in lumpiness and an inconsistent texture. It's ready in just 45 seconds, which is perfect when racing out the door to work.<br /><br />Also note that this is results in a thicker oatmeal than you might be used to. However, it's delicious and just right.<br /><br />It also contains 8 grams of protein, which is more than many breakfast cereals (excluding milk).<br /><br />I also keep a few at the office for those mornings I wasn't able to grab breakfast before I left.<br /><br />I've tried several other flavors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04BY6">Quaker Real Medleys Peach Almond Oatmeal</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04AF6">Quaker Real Medleys Apple Walnut Oatmeal</a>, and this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The Peaches in the Peach Almond are great, but the almonds don't work as well for the texture and flavor; I will not reorder this flavor. The Apple Walnut is what you'd expect for an Apple Walnut oatmeal. It's good, but not great. I will reorder it for variety.<br /><br />I'll definitely order the berry flavor again.

The box contained two servings and only 60 calories each.I consumed both servings. Plus, it had no fat and, of course, the sodium was low. It was a good tasting soup and, together with a couple other items, made a good nutritious lunch.<br /><br />I like to find items like this because I can store  them in my pantry and have a good meal prepared in no time at all. Plus, I worry about proper nutrition and so many of the things you can store are so high in salt, sugar and fat. Not here! This is a good item. I've also enjoyed their lentil soup and I'll probably test a few other kinds. You wouldn't think such good soups would come in a box.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I tried this food because one of our cats was sometimes going potty where he shouldn't.  I thought maybe he had crystals in his urine so it hurt to go potty and he was looking for a softer place to go potty other than the litter box.  I heard that some types of cat food may cause crystals and so I decided to try a urinary tract formula (it must be a fairly common problem if there is a special food for it).<br /><br />The problem seems to have gone away now that he is eating the Purina One Special Care Urinary Tract Health Formula.  He's been eating this as his main food for about a year and, so far, so good.

review/text: Deciding to cut down on wheat gluten,but loving pasta, I tried many different brands of bean thread noodles. Some add potato starch, some pea starch, but the Roland brand keeps it simple and the texture comes closest to angel hair pasta. Although I've used the noodles in Asian dishes, my favorite is to saute mushrooms, fresh spinach, asparagus and yellow squash in some olive oil and garlic and toss it in the cooked noodles along with a little marinara sauce. Fantastic!<br />One other two-thumbs-up feature is that the package is divided into five individual nests,each a perfect one person serving, so there's no struggling to separate out part of a package.
