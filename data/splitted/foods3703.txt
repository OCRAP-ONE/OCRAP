review/text: Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: The Best Cookies!
review/text: My husband and I have been buying these cookies locally for years because we love them so much; they are far better than the milk chocolate version (but then, we love DARK chocolate!). In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin "chocolate vehicle"--i.e., cookie.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

review/summary: Surprising way to season!
review/text: When I got this product and opened it at first I was a little thrown. Instead of what I was expecting, a pouch or some kind of container of a brownish spicy powder, what I got was this fancy case, a charger of some kind and a bracelet that says wisdom and courage on it! Well I followed the instructions, plugged the charger into my kabob meat, zipped it up in the case, put on the bracelet and waited for one hour. When I took the meat out it was incredibly well seasoned and smelled so good cooking that I burned my fingers on it because I could not wait to taste it. But thanks to the handy bracelet I found the courage (and wisdom) to get through the pain and take another bite!  Incredible! Best kabobs I've ever tasted and my neighbors all want to know my secret. (I'll never tell, tee hee!)<br /><br />Update: For some reasons the manufacturer has changed this product, now instead of the incredibly high tech version you used to get, you will recieve the inferior "tube of hurl" version you see pictured. If you want to season your kebabs with something that looks exactly like something you might find on the ground at the local dog park then by all means, enjoy your fecal kebabs. As a lover of finely spiced meat dishes I can say that seeking out the original version with the faux leather case, charger and courage/wisdom band is well worth the effort. Until then I will be enjoying my kebabs au natural, thank you very much.

Eventhough I cannot buy it locally, I make sure to buy it on line so my boy will remain healthy and happy!

review/summary: Not Tasty for my Dog
review/text: These days it is not easy to find US made dog natural treat with relatively low price, and having treated my 3 year old Westie long time with Healthy Partner beef/turkey strips, I gave Zuke's a try; yet as soon as I opened the bag, I knew that my dog would not like it; it dosen't look good or smell good and I don't even like to taste it, how my dog would like it ?

review/summary: My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!
review/text: When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the "chicken flavor" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended "Golden Aloe" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these "doggie crack", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!

review/summary: Natural treat our Bichon loves!  A plus for his joints!
review/text: We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!

They said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her leg.<br />I didn't have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain. So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.

review/summary: Thank God for Zuke's Dad!
review/text: Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have "that talk".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!

review/summary: Doggy Likes!
review/text: My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.

review/summary: Nearly Miraculous
review/text: I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his "golden years" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D

review/text: I really like these Zukes (made in the USA) treats.  I break off small pieces for my 8 lb and 9 lb dogs.  They like the peanut butter flavor.  However, I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten.  (I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful.)

review/text: Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!

Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: After a month, I am a believer
review/text: I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.

review/text: I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit, they smell good to me too, haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically, and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life - there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China, and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.

review/summary: Absolutly a Godsend
review/text: This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!

review/text: We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.

review/text: I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large breed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.

review/text: I have 2 large dogs who are getting older and a little slower now, so I got these for them.  They will do just about anything for them.  I also have a small dog who is young and she wants them, too.  I like that there is nothing harmful in them and that they are a USA product.  It is a much more healthful treat and supplement than many that are available.  I will be buying these again.

review/summary: Best Product for the Price!
review/text: I have tried a lot of different arthritis supplements for my small dogs, but this one is the best product I have found for the price.  My dogs love it and it is wonderful to see them running around where before they could hardly move for the pain.  Granted, they are old (one is 17 and one is 13) but I believe this product has given them a better quality of life, which, after all, is exactly what we want for our pets.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.

review/text: I have an elderly dog with hip and joint problems. She has been taking Zuke's Hip Action Dog treats for a little more than a month and there has been a HUGE difference in her. She loves the way the treats taste; and best of all she is walking with ease, has an easier time with stairs and yesterday broke into a full sprint for the first time in ages! We followed the guideline for her size as listed on the back of the package and have been so surprised by the results. We love Zuke's!

review/summary: Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog
review/text: I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.

review/summary: Fixed My Dogs Hip
review/text: I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.

I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on "Subscribe and Save" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie. No hip/lep problems there but maybe we can head em off at the pass!! They LOVE how they taste and both sit patiently waiting for their treat!!! Thank you Zuke's!!!!

review/text: Very happy to see a product that actually backed up what they said about the flavor.  Have purchased other products that stated they were "bacon" flavored and dogs love them.  Couldn't get my dogs to eat them (one of them usually eats anything).  I have no problem getting my dogs to eat the Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dogs Treats.  I've noticed a slight improvement in their movement.  Haven't been using the product that long so it will be good to see how their movement improves over time.

We started to give these once a day to the girls, and they couldn't LOVE it more. which makes me LOVE it because they take these easily and are getting great vitamins in the process. I wish I knew about these sooner, I would absolutely  give them to all future dogs I have as well. I was so sad when my local stores stopped selling them, and now solely get them through amazon. The service is so quick and easy. Overall I couldn't say enough great things about this product!

review/summary: Great product, dogs love them
review/text: My dogs love these treats.  I've been giving them these treats for several years now.  They go nuts when they know they are going to get one, and my vet recommends the supplements for them as they get older.  They are a bit pricey, but I think they are worth it.  Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and brittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!

review/summary: I like them. My dog doesn't like them so much.lol.
review/text: I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.

review/summary: Best way to give glucosamine that I've found
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far "over-medicating" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats.

I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win-win-win all around for us!<br /><br />Almost for got to mention....she loves them!

review/text: Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once - when she takes off at top speed.  So I now get her treats with glucosamine - so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best - she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints - vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good-for-her treat.

The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.

review/summary: Great for all dogs!
review/text: Our older dog has arthritis in his right hip.  These had good recommendations so I purchased for him.  He loves them!  Our retriever is younger but I've given them to him also just as a preventative.

review/text: My dogs love these treats!  They get one after they take their medicine, and there's no problem at all getting them to swallow their pills as long as I have the jar of Zuke's out when I call them over.

review/summary: Really helps mobility
review/text: I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I was first introduced to Zuke's at the Health Expo in Anaheim.  They were kind enough to give me samples to take home to my dog.  Firstly, she loves them and she's picky.  Secondly, it seems to help her Arthritis.

review/summary: Great value and great taste
review/text: My dog has a fairly sensitive stomach and is a VERY picky eater, so I'm usually quite careful with trying new treats. But he loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, so I thought I might as well give Hip Action a try. And he loved them!<br />They are also a great value - I actually took the time and counted the number of treats in a 1 lb bag - and I got 64, which means more than 2 months of hip protection for dogs under 46 lb (you only need to give one a day).

review/summary: Our favorite treat from Zuke's
review/text: I have been buying this product since sep 2010.  My dog loves this the most.  He sometimes refuses other treats but never this.  So it must be good.  It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training.  We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price.

review/summary: Our dog loved them
review/text: Got these to help perk-up our "Olden Golden."  She loved them.  Seemed to help a little.  But, I guess there's no cure for age.<br /><br />This is a far better way to get your dog to take glucosamine and chondroitin.  We had the hardest time getting her to take a pill.<br /><br />I will note that the treats get stale pretty quickly if you don't seal the bag well (it's ziplock.)

review/summary: My dogs love these
review/text: I have a finicky basenji and he loves these treats. My dogs are also getting up in years but their joints and bones remain strong. I don't know if these treats contribute to that, but I've been giving them to them for a long time, so maybe so.

review/summary: Zuke's Hip action treats
review/text: my dog loves them and I think they help her, even though we do have her on medicine for her hips. You can also break them in half if you don't want to give the full treat all the time.

review/summary: Yummy for my dog
review/text: My mom purchased a variety of treats for my dog to try.  He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.

review/text: I have been giving these treats to my dogs for the past 3 years or so. Never upset their stomachs and every time I say a word with "tion" on the end they get so excited.<br />Great products, great ingredients and above all a very trustworthy company!
