review/summary: Planters Crunchy Peanut Butter
review/text: Our family had always been a Skippy Peanut Butter (PNB) family, but we decided to give the Planters PNB a chance.  We found that we like it a lot more than Skippy.  For us, the JIF PNB was too sweet, and Peter Pan was just not acceptable quality.<br /><br />Since sometimes we have a hard time finding it in the store we had ordered from Amazon.  We only purchase the Crunchy so we cannot comment on the Creamy.

review/summary: Good Puppy Food
review/text: After getting my new Irish setter puppy I sat on the internet and did ALOT of research on puppy/dog food. And just like if you put processed crappy food in your body, your health declines. Giving dogs food that you can find in most super markets are made up of mostly corn gluten, by products and things that sounds horrible.<br /> I decided that my dogs would have a better life than that. I did have some issues finally getting a food I felt comfortable giving him and one that agreed with his stomach. At first I tried Wellness puppy food and it gave my little guy loose stool. So I slowly switched over to Organix and have not had a problem since. I will continue to use this until he gets to a year.<br /> Amazon sells this cheaper than anywhere I could find it and if you get the subscribe and save it makes it an even better deal. I have never had an issue with the shipping or packaging.

review/summary: Took a few tries to find the right one.
review/text: When we got our lab puppy I did a lot of comparing different brands of dog food including cost. This is a great deal. A lot of dog foods boast chicken or another meat as the first ingredient but the list is based on weights. If it says chicken followed by a grain of some sort, the grain is probably the most abundant ingredient because the chicken loses around 60% of its weight when cooked. This has chicken-meal as the first ingredient (after chicken) which is cooked and dried when weighed. It doesn't have any corn or wheat products. We used Blue Buffalo at first but it was more expensive and our puppy never had firm stools. We don't have that problem with this. We also tried Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix but she didn't like it. Organix is a great deal on subscribe and save on Amazon, our puppy loves it, and it is good for her. Now if only I fed myself as healthy as I feed her =)<br />As a side note: the Organix dog cookies were not a hit. For training I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, all 3 flavors are a big hit, and they're the perfect size.

review/summary: Quality dog food; puppy loves it
review/text: I've been feeding Castor & Pollux Organix puppy formula to my retriever puppy since he was 10 weeks old. He's now 6 months old and still doing well on this food: stool is healthy, coat silky & shiny, eyes bright. I too did a lot of research before trying this product and I'm glad I did. The information is out there, folks, just search the 'net for 'dog food reviews', 'holistic dog food', etc. and compare for yourselves; it's appalling what some dog food has in it. Knowing what I know now, I will never feed my pets less than the best.

review/summary: Highly Recommend but Did not Work for my Dog
review/text: I love Castor and Pollux Organix dog food as I have done much research and it seems to be the best of the best. It is expensive, but all of the top quality foods run around the same price and this one falls into that category. They have so many important factors such as organic chicken with no added growth hormones or antibiotics, the kibble is small and my dog found it to be tasty, and it is made in the USA (which is important because it contains chicken and there has been many dog food recalls that contain chicken made in China).<br /><br /> As much as I love this product, I am sad to report that it did not agree with my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. I gradually introduced Organix mixing it with his previous food (Halo)over the span of 2 weeks and his stools were consistently soft. Every once in awhile he would have a "normal" stool but for the most part either had soft stools and occasional liquid diarrhea. I kept him on the food for a month, after being on Halo 3 months (he had the same problem with soft stools on Halo), hoping that his system would get used to it but never did. I encourage anyone else who is trying new foods and their dog's stool does not become normal within a couple of weeks to change foods (and different types of meat in the food) instead of waiting to see if it will work out because the ongoing soft stools led to another issue for my dog.<br /><br />Because he had soft stools for a long time we went to the vet to get him tested for worms, other potential issues and the results came back normal except for his anal glands. Apparently a dog's individual scent comes from the glands on their butt (that is why dogs sniff each other there). The scent is in a brown liquid that comes out of the anal glands on their butt every time they defecate. However, if they have soft stool on a regular basis, that liquid is not pushed out by an otherwise normal stool and the glands can become backed up/clogged causing all kinds of other issues that if not taken care of could need surgery. A sign that your dog might be clogged is if they scooch their butt on the floor. Thankfully his was not to the point of needing surgery and the vet was easily able to get the liquid out (which some of it had dried up and formed hard chunks that caused pain and irritation). I only mention this in case this information could be potentially helpful to any of my fellow pet parents. :)<br /><br />After trying Organix,Halo, Wellness, boiled chicken and rice, plain ground beef and rice (all high quality foods), I decided to try him on a hypoallergenic food and he has finally been having consistently normal stools on a regular basis (the last month) for the first time since we have had him!!! We suspect that he may have had stomach irritation with the meats chicken and beef (more common than I realized after some research).<br /><br />The food that I currently have him on is Nature's Variety Instinct Duck & Turkey meal formula. He doesn't like the taste of the food as much as the others so we mix each meal with a small amount of natures variety instinct canned duck formula and he loves it. Although canned foods can be just as high quality as dry foods as far as quality ingredients go, they can cause tarter build-up on the teeth more quickly if you are not brushing the dogs teeth on a regular basis.<br /><br />Since Nature's Variety brand is considered hypoallergenic we introduced him to the salmon formula (mixing a very small amount in with his duck food) and it caused soft stool again so if your dog has a sensitive stomach...try duck! Otherwise, Organix is the best food you can buy for your dog as far as quality goes and it I highly recommend it!!! I also highly recommend looking at dog food reviews on the website: dogfoodadvisor.com so that you can know how to read dog food labels and what to look out for!

Then one day, they were out of the kind we needed.<br />So I had to find a good or better alternative fast....and found this.<br />So glad we found it! I've never seen our chihuahuas eat so eagerly as they do this food.<br />They used to be finicky and food would sit in the bowl for a long while...not with this.<br />Food size is small and perfect. Smaller than blue buffalo's.<br />All our puppies' stools are very healthy and firm now, which never were with blue buffalo.<br />So I think we are switching to this until further notice.

Haven't had any problems with the food, and the monthly autoship  is great! I never have to worry about running out.

review/summary: Not great
review/text: About six months ago I switched to drinking low-acid coffee because of some acid reflux problems I was having. Trader Joe's low acid French roast is probably the best tasting low-acid coffee I've tried, but unfortunately Trader Joe's doesn't make a decaf version and I'm trying to cut down on my caffeine. For decaf low-acid coffee I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P28DHY">HealthWise 100% Colombian Supremo, Decaffeinated, Swiss Water Process Low Acid Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a> and Puroast (both purchased off Amazon). Neither one is great, but HeathWise is better. HealthWise is bland, so you have to use more coffee to get a good-tasting cup (I usually mix a scoop of decaf with a scoop of the Trader Joe's, and that helps), but the Puroast decaf smells and tastes off. I can't describe what's off about it--it's just not pleasant. It certainly doesn't have that rich coffee aroma and flavor we coffee-lovers love. Perhaps the non-decaf version is better. If you need low-acid decaf and you're desperate, this will do--hence the three stars. But I would never serve this to a guest in my home, and I really can't recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW<br />After drinking this coffee on and off for a couple weeks, I've come to the conclusion that it's actually causing me intestinal distress. So not only is it unpleasant tasting, it's upsetting my stomach in a way that completely negates the only reason I bought it. I wish I could return my unopened bag, but unfortunately Amazon has a "no returns" policy on groceries. Disappointing all around.

review/text: I had wanted to try this -- not because of the low acid, but because Puroast was always in the health food section, pricey, and I drink mostly decaf.  I figured if it was by the Newman's Own, it might be pretty good, and as primarily a decaf drinker, finding brands that are decent is an ongoing thing.  It was on sale at the grocery store, and I also had a Kroger coupon, which priced it to a little over $5.  Wow, what a disappointment.  It smelled and tasted like cheap alcohol -- rank and chemically tasting.  I will e-mail the company to see if I can get a refund if I send my receipt in.  This stuff was awful and I'll never buy it again!

By far, IMHO.<br /><br />Since getting my Keurig brewer I have tested 30+ blends (keeping a spreadsheet with a ranking system of all things), and of all the K-cup varieties that I've tried this blend stands out as by far the best.<br /><br />The coffee is bold and strong, but not at all bitter or overpowering, and it stands up up well to cream and sugar.<br /><br />The flavor is woodsy but smooth and mellow, with a slight hint of citrus and a mild nuttiness.  The balance just works right.<br /><br />Every day I brew this K-cup first thing in the morning and although I love to experiment with new blends, this one consistently tops the charts and every other blend is simply a comparison.<br /><br />One more thing, if you are new to k-cups, please do a little research into the fair trade and organic origins of this coffee and that alone should be enough to make one a dedicated fan.

review/summary: Strong, but bright
review/text: This coffee is a wonderful coffee--I love strong coffee, and this fits the bill nicely. It is very strong, but not bitter--it has a nice, bright aftertaste. It is my regular morning brew. You might want to buy a less bold one, just for the changeup--this is probably not what you will want every time, but it is certainly well worth the purchase.<br /><br />Not to mention it is fair trade, which in and of itself makes the purchase a smart one.

review/summary: One of my favorite extra bold k-cups.  A winner!
review/text: Like my coffee strong but not bitter.  Have tried a lot of extra bold k-cups searching for that blend that says "yes, that's the one..."  The Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve and the Van Houtte Bold Eclipse are the winners so far.  Strong, rich, great-tasting coffee.  Wish Amazon was offering them at the same price as the cheaper more popular k-cups!

review/text: I've tried at least eight different kinds of k-cups not including all the horrible free ones you get in the box.  Normally the coffee is weak.

review/summary: This is an excellent bold roast with a nutty finish
review/text: I was very pleased with this order!  Finally a very bold blend but I was surprized by the definitely nutty finish.  This is a great departure from the other coffees that taste the same from start of sip to end.  With the Sumatran Reserve, you get an excellent strong coffee taste while sipping but a great nutmeg-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Another thing, this has to be the highest caffeine blend I've tried so far.  It really wakes me up in the morning!  But I move to a milder blend like Kona or Dietrich for the afternoons.<br /><br />A big thumbs up for a non-flavored coffee.

I enjoy it better than both the Sumatran offerings from Starbucks. I would say it is right on par with the caribou Sumatran product. only ones that I have enjoyed even a little more were products from  Cats Ass Coffee harvested from animal droppings (Kopi luwak)at over $150 a pound 0.o and the Sumatran offered by S&D...

review/summary: This is probably my favorite K cup
review/text: I'm a big fan of very bold, very dark coffee and have tried literally dozens of bold k cups.<br /><br />Timothy's Midnight Magic, Rainforest Espresso, Emeril's and Tully's French Roast are also dark coffees that I will buy as well but this one has the best flavor for me. It is not bitter and muddy looking, it's smooth. Most importantly, it gives a flavorful, not weak cup of java on the 9.5 ounce setting. Not many k cups do that. They become coffee flavored water at the 9.5 ounce size.

review/summary: Good to the last Drop
review/text: I purchase this coffee for my husband. He love to drink a good cup of coffee but too difficult to drive to buy Starbucks especially on the weekend. We love to stay home and I like to eat at home because I know my food at home is much better than anywhere else in the world (according to my husband). Actually I don't drink coffee or tea on a regular basis, I prefer to drink water or fresh juice. BUT I love the smell of coffee in the morning and having my husband enjoy a good cup of coffee. So... for mother's day as a gift to me from me I purchased the single serving coffee machine. It is easy to use, looks good in my kitchen and brew a perfect cup of coffee every time. We purchased the sampler first and try many different kind and he decided he like the Sumatran coffee the best.

review/summary: Worst Sumatran K-Cup of All
review/text: For reference, I have tried The Puck sumatran and the Diedrich. This Green Mountain sumatran was bitter and lifeless. It tasted stale and old, even though it was well within the sell-by date. For further reference, I also roast my own sumatran at home. I rate that a 10, starbucks would be a 9, the Puck k-cups would be an 8 as the best of the k-cups. I give this a flat 1. Very disappointing, will not purchase again. I wrote this about five minutes after finishing a cup, and I still have a terrible, bitter aftertaste. A true sumatran will have an earthy, almost tangy flavor, but with no bitterness. I would say they used coffee beans that had been sitting around for a while.

review/text: I like my coffee strong, bold, and dark. Of all the varieties I have tried, this is my hands-down favorite to fit the bill. Its consistently good with a robust, smokey, complex flavor. I have noticed that it also does not have the bitter tinge that many of the Dark Magic varieties have (which I like, by the way... but not if you're drinking more than one cup at a setting).<br /><br />A word of warning: many of my family members and friends who have tried it find it too strong and dark for their tastes. If you want a little dark and bold, you could go with something like the Coffee People Black Tiger (also a favorite of mine) which is similar in my opinion, but a little less intense. If you dig the big bold flavor, however, you won't be dissapointed with this one!

review/summary: My Choicest Black Tea
review/text: This is my favorite tea to drink. I am a big fan of Yunnan black teas, so this fits my palate nicely.<br /><br />I love the smell of this tea. It's earthy with notes of cocoa and malt. There is also a honey-like sweetness to the nose.<br /><br />The taste is excellent: the malty and cocoa notes are quite obvious, but they are present after that honey-sweet earthiness mentioned before. One of my favorite things about this tea is that there is little to no bitterness at all (Personally, I have found that 3-4 minutes at 195 degrees is a good temperature that brings out flavor without causing bitterness).<br /><br />The second cup is just like the first, except the honey and malt take a backseat to the cocoa and earthiness. This tea doesn't get noticeably weak to me until the 4th+ steeping. However, it is not a hugely apparent loss of flavor. In short, you'll get many infusions with this one.<br /><br />Don't let the price scare you away -- anyone who has tried many Yunnan teas knows the difference in quality with price. For this particular concoction, $15/2 oz. is a reasonable buy. I use three pearls per 8 oz. water, and I haven't used mine up in weeks! Go buy this stuff and enjoy.

review/summary: not bad
review/text: We got this for dog training rather than camping. The shipping was fast and the product was fine. They are a little brittle and one tube already broke but I'm not sure whether that is a function of the tube design or how we were using it. In all fairness, we were using it for dog training and keep it in the fridge while not being used so that might have had something to do with the cracking. Otherwise, these tubes are great for many different foods and uses. We'll probably get more for camping.

review/text: Nowhere on this site do they give you a size for these things. I was hoping to find  refillable tubes suitable for airline travel. These aren't it. It isn't worth my time to return them, but they are closer to 8 oz. than the 3 oz. TSA limit. Why that info is not part of the description beats the heck out of me!

review/summary: NOT THE ORIGINAL!!
review/text: WARNING!! These are no longer made by Jelly Belly!! When they first came out, Jelly Belly handled them and they were great, yes even the nasty flavors...well, at least they were authentically flavored anyway. Now, evidently the folks at Warner Bros. decided to go cheap after the license ran out for jelly Belly. These new ones by some candy company I've never heard of are HORRIBLE. Even the ones that are supposed to taste good. They don't taste much like what they're supposed to and we had trouble figuring out what flavor was what. These don't taste much better than the cheapo jelly beans you can find at Easter. I had assumed based on the similar packaging that they were the same. The odd shaped little uglies should have given me a clue...Jelly Belly NEVER puts those in with their regular beans.<br /><br />Unless you're just into torturing your palette, steer clear of these rip-offs. They're a poor substitute for the originals.

review/summary: Inauthentic
review/text: I was disappointed when I bought these beans at the Harry Potter Expo.  The flavors have nothing to do with Harry Potter.  I don't mind extras, but the manufacturer should include all of the flavors written in the book.  A devoted Harry Potter fan will be looking for: chocolate, peppermint, spinach, liver, tripe, bogie/booger, pepper, vomit, toffee and earwax.  Previously, I enjoyed the beans including these authentic flavors, as well as other interesting ones that fit the theme such as grass and dirt.  Where did they go?  This set includes only one flavor from the book (pepper) and the rest seem completely out of touch with the theme.  While others may find these fun, I find no point in buying something as a fan when the item has nothing to do with the thing that I love.  I hope they bring the real beans back!

review/summary: Sad Replacement For Originals
review/text: It's true - the old Jelly Belly version of this product was superb; the new version (by the Frankford  Candy Company) is pretty bad. In the old Jelly Belly version, the flavors were picked from the books/films, and the flavors were shocking but somehow still delicious. Apparently the Frankford company took over the license, and the new beans are terrible. The flavors don't match anything from the books, and even the ones that are supposed to taste good are waxy and gross. This is a real shame. I don't think I'll be buying the Bertie Botts Beans anymore. Jelly Belly has come up with "Bean Boozled" which is a similar-themed product, and although the flavors are up to the Jelly Belly standards, it's missing the old Harry Potter themed flavors, and of course the HP packaging etc. We're out of luck on this one!

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!

He did mention the hulls and said "So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good" and good it was. I only stove top so it was great to see the corn pop up so big, just a handful and it filled up a 24qt bowl (Cause you can't eat good popcorn in a small bowl). Lightly seasoned to taste with salted butter and seasoning salt, Perfect! So I only wrote cause of the knuckleheads that bad mouthed something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Buy a small sample and see for yourself and don't let others keep you from the good stuff...

review/summary: Just as described as long as you follow the instructions.
review/text: I bought a 3lb bag and had it sent to my parents.  They raved that it came out great so I bought a 5lb bag myself.  I have tried it once so far.  I popped 1/4 cup with 1 1/2 tbs of butter flavored canola oil in the 6 qt Lindy's popper.  I followed the instructions that states that you should only toss in a few kernels at the beginning while the oil heats up.  When those three pop, dump in the rest since the oil will be at optimum temperature.  I did so and started to crank away.  All the kernels popped in about 10 seconds since it was a small batch.  Came out fine, but a little chewier than expected because since the kernels were fuller than regular butterfly popcorn.  It did get a little crispier when more steam was allowed to escape.  Flavor was fine with a light bit of popcorn salt.

review/summary: Charnushka, Nigella Seed, Black Onion, it's all good
review/text: I love Charnushka seeds. Thats another name for Nigella Sativa, these little black seeds. Almost every bun or bread I bake has a few sprinkled on top, held in place with an egg wash prior to baking. These arrived fresh-smelling and tasty, but one star is gone because I'm a little concerned about quality control. The lid was askew, and there was no safety seal. Did some worker along the way open and taste? Still, i'm not worried enough to feel that any real tampering is an issue, just my paranoia, I guess!<br />My very favorite bun for these goes as follows: I take some wheat bread dough, and while it rises (or days before baking) chop and saute any combination of fresh veggies. Cauliflower, celery, garlic, onion, peppers, tomatoes, whatever. Using coconut oil is the best. After the sizzle is going, add curry, salt and pepper to taste and cover, turning off heat. Punch down the dough, let it rest under a cloth for 10 minutes, then take a small ball of dough, flatten and press, put some veggie mixture in and seal. Or make a loaf and fill it. let rise again, then brush carefully with beaten egg, then liberally sprinkle these seeds on top and bake. They give an exotic smokey onion flavor and look amazing.

review/summary: Made With Their Own Shipping Protection
review/text: I received these almonds yesterday, packed in a plastic bag inside of a mailing envelope. The package was like a bean bag. I was sure that they had been broken, having been mailed without protection, but they were all intact. (The plastic bag was completely plain--no brand name, no ingredients, no nothing.)<br /><br />Then I ate one, and knew why. The candy covering is very heavy and thick--kind of like protecting the almonds with concrete. It's also very sweet, making the almonds close to tasteless. It's necessary to suck the candy for quite a while before you dare to bite into it. My husband said that he would eat them if I ordered him a custom wood crab mallet.<br /><br />When I was young (50s and 60s) we got Jordan almonds from a vending machine at a movie theater, in a small box--The sugar coating was opaque, but almost like a glaze. You could bite right into them, and they had a delicate, sweet almond-like taste. Delicious.<br /><br />My sister tells me that the only Jordan almonds on Amazon that are good are the ones from France. I was trying to stick to my made-in-the-US resolution when I bought this variety.  I guess that I won't be eating any Jordan almonds until someone in the US learns how to ship them safely without covering them in concrete.<br /><br />By the way, you can sure tell that these didn't come from Amazon. They pack rolls of bubble-wrap in bubble wrap, and put the whole thing in a box.

review/summary: bayside candy Jordan Almonds you get what you pay for!
review/text: Do not know what everyone is raving about concerning these almonds but the ones I received today and just returned back were horrible. They arrived cracked chipped and totally broken. I tasted two of them and not only were they tasteless but they left a metallic after taste. Being born in Italy and having tasted many Jordan Almonds--these were not authentic. The real Jordan Almonds are truly sweet, with a sugary coating and they just melt in your mouth. These also smelled "plasticky" when they are supposed to have a hint of vanilla in the smell--which is heavenly. I rarely write reviews but I just had to with these almonds. So you may save $2-or-$4--the extra cost is worth it to get truly delicious and authentic Jordan Almonds. I gave this product Zero stars but it would not let me so that is why you see one star.

review/summary: Very happy
review/text: I'm not a jordan almond connoisseur (didn't even know what they were called until week ago when my fiance asked me to get them for our wedding), but shipping was fast and these are noticeably better quality than the ones from bed bath and beyond.

review/summary: Great Jordan Almonds
review/text: These are great Jordan almonds and are perfect for party or wedding favors! I ordered them for bridal shower favors, and they were exactly what I expected. The almonds arrived in good condition, with only a few broken (this is normal). I sampled the broken ones, and they tasted great! There were about 700 pieces in the 5 lbs, which is a good deal for the price. And they arrived in just one day, which is awesome customer service. I don't need to buy white Jordan almonds all that often, but next time I do, I will buy these ones for sure.

review/summary: Horrible packaging
review/text: Ordered these for a clients' wedding after reading some good reviews.  The almonds were shipped in a way too small bubble envelope mailer.  When they arrived, the envelope was ripped open and about half of the almonds were unusable because they were broken and crushed during shipping.  Terrible packaging job!  Suck it up and use a real box.  I know it costs more but it almost destroyed this order (ruined half actually).  I'm a small business owner and want to keep costs down too but this was just unacceptable.<br /><br />As for the quality of the almonds that survived: they were ok.  Not terrible, but I found the ones we ordered through nuts.com to be better (thinner candy coating, larger almonds, fresher taste).  Yes, they're more expensive but after not being able to use a good portion of this order, it may be worth it.  They at least ship their items in a padded box.

review/summary: Perfect for Weddings
review/text: Almonds arrived as promised and were all completely whole, no chips or broke pieces. Even over a week later when served the almonds were fresh and not too hard to chew like some Jordans can be. Also these were of good quality as there is actually a large almond inside; sometimes cheaper ones have a small nut and a large candy coating. I would recommend these to anyone seeking a good quality Jordan almond. Also if you sign up for auto shipment you can save a few more bucks, after receiving them you can decide if you want to stop auto shipment with no penalty.
