review/summary: Wonderful flavor!
review/text: I've tried several different varieties of Dolce Gusto coffee capsules and so far this is my favorite. It's the most versitile too. It makes a great expresso if you use a demitasse cup, cappuchinno if you add your own milk, or a 14 oz mug of American-style coffee. I'm so hooked I drink two big mugs a day - one truly delicious vice.<br /><br />This coffee is strong and dark but not harsh or bitter. Other strong or "full-bodied" coffees often have a burned taste - as if burning the beans is the only way to add flavor to an inferior bean.<br /><br />Nescafe, the largest selling brand of coffee in Europe, has developed a fantastic coffee. I also love the convenience of individual servings.

I like the coffee and plan to purchase more of it and some in other flavors.  I would like to see a mixed pack of three instead of having to order three of each.

review/text: I love how the price on these has come down! Although this can make 8 oz. I recommend not brewing more than 5-6 oz to preserve the quality of the flavor. This is such a convenient way to make espresso and I can easily train house guests on how to make their own coffee beverages now rather than using my complicated grinder and espresso machine. When I'm in a rush these definitely come to the rescue!

review/text: I first bought the dolce gusto circle maker for the one cup action so I don't have to brew a pot. I bought the American house blend and I could not get a good flavor for myself with the cream and sugar so I was kind of disappointed. I then tried the dark roast and after the third cup I had the right amount of cream and sugar and now I love it more than any coffee place. I go through a box per week which is probably not a good thing for my body but what are ya gonna do. Enjoy.

review/text: The coffee pods are convenient but the quality of the coffee is not good (you will find this especially if you are used to using a grinder, fresh beans etc). I'm not sure if this is due to the pod itself or the machine in terms of temperature, pressure. I suspect the problem lies with the pod technology and the coffee within. I'm going back to a grinder, fresh beans and a traditional machine.

review/text: I absolutely adore Cheezies and make it a point to pick up a few large bags every time I go back to Canada. I was so excited when Amazon started selling them. I bought 2 bags thinking I would get a decent size for the price. Sadly the bag is only 210g or 1/2 lb (smaller than a regular bag of chips). The bags I received would have cost about $3 in Canada. Not worth it for the $7 price offered on Amazon. This is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon and their prices. This is not worth the investment.

review/text: I don't make a habit of eating gelatinous fruit snacks, particularly in the shape of brain-dead cartoon characters, but despite the traces of beeswax, these chews are actually quite tasty. I am pleased that they offer the US FDA recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, which I suspect would make parents favor these over other snacks containing a higher number of "empty calories."<br /><br />I honestly didn't expect to like these very much, as I thought they would taste far too artificial. General Mills did an excellent job getting the flavors right. The orange flavor in the shape of Velma and the blueberry flavored Scooby are the most realistic flavors, though all are quite good. I wouldn't exactly call this health food, but these chews are great tasting and have essentially no fat, making them a good choice for a quick, light snack.

review/summary: Tasty goodness!
review/text: My boyfriend and I started buying these at the local grocery store, and finally realized that it's way cheaper to buy them here on Amazon with the Subscribe & Save program after buying numerous boxes on every grocery trip! A shipment of 10 boxes typically lasts a month between the two of us. While 10 boxes seems like a lot, each box has 10 packets, and each packet has maybe 8 gummy snacks in it, so it really isn't an overwhelming amount. These make for a quick snack when you're craving something sweet and fruity, but don't have time to deal with a real piece of fruit. I actually saw these at the local Dollar Store and they were more expensive than Amazon's price per bag! If you already enjoy these Scooby snacks, I encourage you to give the subscription thing a try - combine the convenience of having them shipped to your doorstep with the most inexpensive price around, and you're getting a real deal!

review/text: My little one loves froose! It's expensive at our grocery store, $4 for a 4 pack. We use it sparingly. If our little one wakes up too early and has already nursed, he'll have a froose and go back to sleep. When he was sick, it was the only liquid other than nursing that I could get in him. I buy the pear flavor because it has less sugar than the others by froose. I like that it is more nourishing and substantial than other juices. It is thicker and "syrupy", but that's not a problem unless you have a box squeezer. That could be solved by placing the juice box in a small cup. Someone taught me this trick. :)<br />Love pear froose!

review/text: I really like the Froose brand and am a huge fan of the gummy snacks, but the juice just leaves a little to be desired. I find it to be very thick and syrupy, which is probably due to the use of rice sugar and other wholesome organic ingredients. Perhaps younger children wouldn't mind this texture and they would be able to suck it down and reap the benefits of the fiber and nutrients without knowing any better. Overall I'm going to stick with the gummies, but I look forward to more products coming out from Froose as healthy alternatives to some really bad options in the supermarket.

There are also many other Thai recipe videos at this site also.

review/summary: Perfect Sticky Rice
review/text: My mother is Thai, so I grew up eating a lot of sticky rice. The last time I went to visit her (she lives 4 hours away), she forced me to take home the pot and basket to make it, and she also provided me some rice. Once that ran out, I looked up where the closest Thai market was from me, and found one 30 minutes away. Due to feeling a little lazy, I opted to order this instead. I just made some tonight and it's PERFECT! It turned out just like my mom's sticky rice. When it runs out, I might venture out to the Thai market to see if I can get it for cheaper. But I didn't mind paying more for the convenience.

review/text: This is my first experience making sticky rice so I have nothing to compare to.  But I'm happy with the quality and taste.  I found a recipe online on how to make sticky rice with mango (I always crave this dessert when we go to Thai restaurants) and it was easy peasy with this rice.  Just put a cup of rice in a bowl, add enough water to go 10% above the rice line, cover with a dish, stick in microwave for 3 minutes, remove & mix, microwave again for 3 minutes, remove & mix, continue to microwave for 3 minutes until the rice becomes translucent.  Voila!  Perfect sticky rice.  To make the coconut sauce, just boil coconut milk and add some sugar to taste (I use honey).  Pour over sticky rice and add mango.  I will never order sticky rice with mango at a restaurant again!

review/text: I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite foods.  My personal favorite way to eat it is to roll it into balls then place the balls into a shallow dish of freshly brewed green tea ('pi lo chun' in case you wondered).  Sometimes I use a flavored green tea as well and I also use other teas, black, herbals and even a couple of rooibos taste good this way.  That is about Thai Sticky Rice in general though, now let's talk this particular bag of the stuff.<br /><br />I got this with free two day shipping through my Prime membership so no worries there, the price per pound winds up quite reasonable at $2.34/lb. so that's great too.  It cooked up easily and nicely and I was able to roll it up as well as any I have had, that makes four good things and now the taste... I really liked this one a lot.  It is a nice and tasty rice and it sticks together well and soaks up the tea nicely without having the balled up rice disintegrate into a handful of soggy rice in my hand (yes, I do in fact use my hand to eat this, rather my fingers. 8-)<br /><br />I think I will lay in a supply of this one for sure... I'd hate to run out.

review/text: This is good sticky rice which is indeed very sticky, in fact it congeals together even to make nice sticky mush.  I have cooked it with just water in my Zojirushi rice cooker and it turns out all right.  It tastes even better with some artifical sweetener.  I'm sure sugar would taste better still but I'm trying to trim down.<br /><br />This with coconut milk and sugar or artifical sugar in a rice cooker should turn out very tasty sticky rice.  I recommend this item even thought it is a tad costly at this price point, but not so bad with free shipping by Amazon Prime.

review/summary: A Successful Experiment
review/text: When I ordered this product, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I kind of had in mind a "curry ketchup" (literally just ketchup with a curry aftertaste), but the description made me think that wasn't quite on the mark.  But since I've been happy with Maya Kaimal's other products, and as a lover of both Indian food and ketchup, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />My suspicion that this wouldn't just be "ketchup plus some curry flavor" was borne out.  Honestly, it's a little difficult to describe.  It's as though someone scrapped the idea of ketchup and decided to start over and build a new ketchup out of some new ingredients and some old ones.  That's a weird description, I know, so I'll go into a little more detail.  It's just that nearly every ketchup you buy is basically slight variations on a theme.  This is different, but still identifiably ketchup.<br /><br />The spicy ketchup isn't smooth like most ketchups; it has a definite texture to it.  It's very slightly thicker than most ketchups, but not so much that you use it any differently.  It's not as tart as ketchup tends to be, nor as sweet as some (particularly ones that use sugar instead of HFCS).  It has a pleasant tomato flavor with a hint of smokiness and a definite Indian flair.  But all of the flavors are very, very integrated.  Like I said before, this isn't "ketchup plus."  It has a very unified, if complex, flavor.  And for those who are worried about the "spicy" part of the name, this ketchup has a little bit of bite to it, about as much heat as a one-star curry.<br /><br />I've tried it on a variety of different foods that I normally eat with ketchup and I admit my success has been mixed.  I tried it first with some fast food french fries, which was decidedly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad; it's just that it was more novel than good.  I tried it later with tater tots, which was much better.  I've had it on an ordinary cheeseburger, which was good but it didn't wow me like it wowed one of my friends.  But the two biggest successes I've had with it have been the most surprising.<br /><br />One, this ketchup is excellent on a hot dog.  Yes, I know you aren't "supposed" to put ketchup on hot dogs, but I don't like mustard or relish and I don't always want a chili dog.  And for what it's worth, I think the spicy Indian ketchup actually "goes with" hot dogs better than ordinary ketchup (which isn't to say I like it more, per se, just that the flavors seem more complementary).<br /><br />And two, I just tried this ketchup tonight on some black pepper and bleu cheese hamburgers I picked up at the store.  Again, I didn't expect much but tried it on a whim.  Amazing.  The black pepper really brought out the spiciness of the ketchup.  And the pockets of bleu cheese in the burgers... I really did not expect bleu cheese to go well with Indian-themed ketchup, but the combination was just incredible.  A stronger bleu cheese might not work as well, but this was fairly mild.<br /><br />I've tried a few different variant ketchups in the past (did I mention I really like ketchup?), but I rarely find anything that's worth getting again.  Not only am I glad I bought this bottle of spicy Indian ketchup, but when it's gone I plan on buying another.  I still use my Heinz, mind you.  The two ketchups are not interchangeable.  But they do seem to be good on largely the same things, and the spicy Indian ketchup is great for adding just a bit of flair to your food.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not your ordinary ketchup
review/text: I was looking for a ketchup that had very low sugar content and thought a little spice would be an added bonus. So this product fit the bill perfectly. I agree with the very accurate description of the ketchup by the previous reviewer. Just that little bit of kick and the thicker texture make it amazingly versatile. I don't eat much beef, but I have tried it on a burger and it was great. But my absolute favorite use is on fish--particularly the meatier types of fish, like tuna, that can get a bit dry if grilled.It has also replaced barbecue sauce for me on pork chops. I love this stuff. What a find!

review/summary: Excellent grain-free treats!
review/text: These treats are the bee's knees. I've bought them in EVERY flavor they offer. Lamb liver is a great flavor, but my pups love all the flavors equally, it seems. Each treat is about 1" wide and 1" to 1-1/2" in length. Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess. They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients. The shelties love them! I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.  My parents' little pom-terrier mix has a special place in her heart for anything liver, so these were well received (*snarf snarf snarf*) by that pup too.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything. Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way. I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training. Each bag lasts me about a month, I think.

Truthfully,  this is the closest you can get to giving your dog jerky.  My vet is a holistic vet and I consequently don't give my dog just any treat.  Still, my tiny toy poodle is VERY particular, even to the point of knowing which flavor he wants when I hold up the bags!  I bought the lamb liver, chicken and venison and venison but he loves all of the flavors, even the fish.  I like the fact that they are all natural and I'd recommend them in a heartbeat.

review/text: I could not wait to get my tea in the mail!  My favorite type of tea is Oolong for it's fruity, sweet flavor.  And then add peach to this?!  AWESOME!  What a great blend!  I think the peach may be a little too over powering of the Oolong, but I still love this tea.  Not to mention, it's fresh.  You can always tell if tea is too old.  This tea was really really fresh.<br /><br />Loose leaf tea is usually pricey, and Oolong is even pricer.  I usually can only afford 2 or 4 oz at a time.  But this tea is a HUGE bargain!  I feel like I got a huge deal.  I opened the sealed bag (also comes with a resealable ziplock just inside) and was so surprised by how much tea is in here.  This is going to last me a long time - yay!  It says it's 8 ounces, but looking at it, it seems like it's more like 12 ounces.  Maybe it's my imagination?<br /><br />This is my first time buying Boston Tea, but I don't think it will be my last.  I'm excited to try more teas by them.

It is so good I'm signing up for auto delivery.<br /><br />If you like peaches and tea, this is the blend for you.<br /><br />As a side note I add about a 1 tablespoon of quality black tea to the 8 tablespoons of Peach Passion.  Also, I can brew this twice and still get full flavor (24 cups total).

review/summary: Good food, but marginal quality
review/text: If you are a farmer with lots of farm cats, this is the perfect food - and because it is primarily sold at most farm and fleet stores I think that it is meant for farm cats. The ingredient list is marginal quality though, which can be expected. Most of it is corn and grain products, with a few meat by-products here and there. Better than Iams but not by much.<br /><br />I've been feeding my cat on Diamond Maintenance for 2 years without a problem but I will be switching to something with more substance soon. If you're looking for a cheap option for lots of cats, this is a good product to buy in bulk; but if you have a domestic cat you wish to keep around for awhile, I'd suggest something else.<br /><br />And hey, if you're looking for a good alternative, get Chicken Soup For The Adult Cat formula. Great stuff, doesn't cost a lot, and is much better than the regular Diamond food.

review/summary: Thankful for finding this cat food!
review/text: We switched over to this cat food a couple of months ago and my cats are very happy and healthy.  We have 2 indoor cats, 1 indoor/outdoor cat and feed 2 outdoor neighborhood cats, and they are all getting this cat food.  We were spending twice this amount on our indoor cats and feeding the outdoor neighborhood cats meow mix (we also have racoons dipping into the supply) but at this price we can eliminate storing 2 separate large bags of cat food and feed them all the same.<br /><br />The indoor cats love this food, plus they have stopped vomiting on the floor.  The cat box does not have a foul smell, either.  Our cats range from 8 lbs. to 25 lbs., and they all seem to be thriving.  Our extra small, elderly female has no problem with the kibble size and neither does our 25 lb extra large, slightly handicapped male (he had trauma to his head as a kitten - causing him to loose an eye, partial sinus and has had some mouth repair.  We do not know what happened to him, he had been operated on prior to our adopting him from our local animal rescue.)<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this food covers the entire scope of kitties' and their needs.  We are very thankful for finding this food :)

review/summary: Good food, but...
review/text: I thought this is a pretty good food, and a great value for the money. As the previous review stated, it contains a bit too much grains and byproducts.<br />I was really surprised by the kibble size. It's too big! I thought first I received dog food by mistake; re-read the label - no, that's cat food. Wow, way too large for my cats' little mouths. They seem to have fun with it, though - crunching on the pieces (good teeth cleaner at the same time?).<br /><br />However, as two of my cats can be considered seniors, I will have to switch to a different food, something with smaller bits, to make it easier for them.

review/summary: Mid-Grade Cat Food Product for a Great Price
review/text: This product has better grade materials used to create it than other "general feed" brands such as Fri$kies, Me0w M!x, Pur1na, etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers, this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality. At a price of 30 for 40LB its less than a dollar pound, and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around 60 - 75 cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality. You can use this as a filler mixed in with better brands if your cats dont get snobby and refuse to eat the cheaper stuff when better food is in the bowl with it. Diamond makes another version, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OH73FO">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Cats, Active Cat Chicken and Rice Formula, 18 Pound Bag</a>  which is a premium type and much healthier. This mixes well 60/40 with it so i dont spend a fortune and they get very healthy meals. My cats like this just as much as the premium. I have a public wish list of other brands of healthy premium food here on amazon at good prices (around 1.50 - 2.00 lb)if anyone is interested. Hope this helps all your kitties!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I have 4 cats and was spending an amazing amount of money shopping for them at Petsmarts and Petcos locally. I wish I would have discovered this food earlier. This 40lb bag lasts us nearly 2 months! If you order it new from Amazon you don't even have to worry about the shipping, it's free (and for something that weighs 40lbs that's a good thing!)<br /><br />The ingredients aren't that great but at least it's not Corn or grains as the first ingredient..so it's passable. I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).<br /><br />The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually break it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT! I got so used to wet messes on the floor and now there are none! Add in the the wet food from time and time (not daily) and the kibble becomes easier to eat for them. It keeps their teeth very clean in it's pure form though.<br /><br />All in all I have ordered this bag 3 times now this year since I discovered it and it's saved me a lot of money and a lot of time and my cats are not overweight or lacking in any way. No allergies, shiny coats and full of energy..I simply can't find a reason to complain.
