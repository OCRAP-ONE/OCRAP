review/summary: Good Product Bad Shipping!!
review/text: My three cats love this food and I mean LOVE it. They tend to play with their other food but not this one, they won't even stop to take a breath until it's all gone! I have tried nearly ever single cat food with them and they have had terrible indigestion with nearly every brand except this one. It also made a huge improvement in their coat. Word of caution from experience... This food is high calorie and has much more nourishment than other foods so you can feed them less. Overall I love this food the shipping is the bad though....

review/text: FYI to anyone who loves their cat(s) and is feeding them this premium cat food thinking it is... Well it was just (very quietly) bought out by P&G. Either that means something to you or it doesn't. For me it was a deal breaker. Our cat loved this food, but I won't feed him a product owned by that company. They *say* they will keep it all the same, but you never know.<br /><br />We switched to Orijen.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: One of my cats has been throwing up her food for years no matter what I fed her (6 year old).  Had constant furballs.  Well obviously the fancy feast, royal canin, whiskies, meow meow etc wasn't working for her.  I just assumed like an idiot it was all part of her chronic condition (as per vet) since she was a baby, when she almost froze to death before she literally jumped into my house.  The other cat (12 year old) is simply fat and very picky about her food (too many years of fancy feast as that was her favorite by far out of everything I tried.)  Well something hit me over the head and I decided to start feeding them organic food only (when it came to dry food).  I bought EVO, Solid Gold, Blue Wilderness, Wellness, Orijen, Natural balance (all organic) and have been feeding my 2 cats (along with 6 kittens given away now) for the last 2 months.  The winner is EVO followed by Solid Gold as both cats love it (the older one jumps on EVO like she hasn't eaten in days).  The older one won't touch the other 4 listed period.  So basically I've been feeding them EVO mostly for the last month along with some Solid Gold (+ organic can food).  While they are still fat lol the one that supposedly has had a chronic condition since she was a baby HAS ALL OF A SUDDEN  pretty much stopped throwing up!!! and the furballs seem to have stopped too.  Her other chronic symptoms (coughing and sneezing) have almost dissapeared as well.  Don't know how the last two can really be affected by food but it is what it is.  Another thing...  The 12 year old was leaving hair all over the place and this has been cut in like 2/3 in just 2 months.  How do I know?  I can see the difference on my carpets.<br /><br />So basically cliffs:  Bought 6 different brands of organic dry food... EVO is the clear winner.  Fantastic food.

review/summary: Great balanced and wholesome diet
review/text: Innova EVO Cat and Kitten food is an incredible diet for cats and kittens of all ages.  I have two cats, one is a Tonkinese and she is a very finicky eater, however she loves the Innova EVO Cat and Kitten Food!  Basil is 14 years of age and looks as if he is five.  Both of their coats have improved with sheen, less shedding, and they run and play like they are kittens again!  I have had them on this diet for approximately one year and they are really doing great.  The mistake was made of running out and I actually bought an organic food at a local store, and they would nibble and started losing weight - especially my Tonkinese!  So, they are very happy cats at this time.  I will definitely NOT let them run out again.

review/text: Cat do not care for it. I'm having to mix it with California Natural Chicken and Brown rice in order to get rid of it. I'm not going to throw it away it's too bloody expensive. Will not buy again.<br /><br />Any food, dry or canned, that has PEAS in it they won't touch. And these are feral cats. Three live "in the wild". You'd think they'd eat anything right? Wrong.<br /><br />I have to say here that I've had cats for 27 yrs now and up until these past few years (say 5) have NEVER had food rejected. NOW that's all I have is food problems. WHAT IS IT?<br /><br />I think it's all the fruits and vegetables, herbs and all the other BS. Flaxseed, soybeans. You ever taste flaxseed  or soybeans EUCK!<br /><br />Even my piggy cat is turning his nose up to all the canned foods listed below. I currently have a new feral that refuses everything but Safeway's Mom-to-Mom Chicken baby food. Below is my running list for him. The wild ferals reject the Wellness grain-free chicken and EVO cat & kitten chicken, Calif. Nat.

For 10 yrs I fed my cats California Natural Chicken and Brown Rice CANNED and DRY.... no problem whatsoever.

review/summary: Very good cat food just makes for a lot of crumbs
review/text: I have three (3) cats that use to all eat Purina One brand cat food.  After reading up on the topic extensively I have found out that most cat foods use grain fillers as primary ingredients and that cats do not normally eat that type of product.  These grain fillers can have negative effects on cats such as obesity, diabetes, allergies (much like gluten allergies in humans) and other issues that can significantly shorten a cat's life or make for very often and expensive vet visits.  I decided to switch to EVO Turkey & Chicken after reviewing all the different brands of all-natural cat foods.  This diet is essentially like the Paleo-diet for humans in that the main ingredients are meat.<br />So far my cats have been on this diet for about three (3) months and I have noticed increased energy, brighter eyes and coats, and more playfulness.  I have even got away from giving traditional treats in favor of wet grain-free food.  My cats have loved it as a treat a few times a week and it gives them additional nutrients that some experts say dry food is lacking in.<br />The only bad thing about this food is that it is kinda crubly and does end up getting on the floor when the cats eat it.  Just make sure to clean this residue and crums up so you do not get ants or other bugs.

review/summary: Caused Food Allegies
review/text: I bought this food because it seemed like an excellent choice of food for my cats. I gradually switched from Eukanuba to Innova Evo about three months ago because I wanted to provide better nutrition for my cats. Three of the cats adjusted well to the new food, but the fourth cat, Gutterball, started developing what seemed like ulcers or sores on her chin and on the top of her head. I immediately took her to the vet, and she was diagnosed with Acne caused by an allergic reaction to the new food. After a course of antibiotics, some acne medication,and switching their food back to Eukanuba, Gutterball is back to normal again. I still think that Innova Evo is a great cat food choice, but beware that some cats might get a bad reaction to it.

review/text: My cats go CRAZY over this food! I buy it 2 pounds at a time, and it seems like a small bag lasts for 2 weeks at least (they also get canned and raw so that's probably why) but they act like I've filled their bowl with treats! They get so excited and I'm so glad they love to eat a really healthy, high-protein food. I also feed Acana and Blue Wilderness on rotation, but this is the one they do backflips for - I guess 50% protein will do that. :) They literally yell at me and try to smack the bowl out of my hands as I place it down on the floor for them, LOL! I highly recommend this food as part of any cat's diet.<br /><br />(Also, I am well aware of the P&G buyout, and I really don't care.)

review/summary: Good food, bad "retail price"
review/text: I'm not sure where Amazon got the retail price of $83.30 for a SIX POUND bag of this food, but that's *way* out of the normal range. Who in their right mind would spend over $80 for 6 pounds of food?? The listed price of $27.70 is much more in line with reality.<br /><br />This is an excellent food with excellent ingredients. For now, anyway. Proctor & Gamble has bought the company and we're all worried that they will destroy this pet food like they've destroyed others. Keep an eye on the color/shape of the food and if your pet stops eating it, pay attention. They've probably changed something.<br /><br />But for now, this is a very high-quality food that will make your cat (or ferret) happy and healthy with a sleek, shiny coat.

review/text: Evo is the first bag of grain free kibble I picked up once I had both my kittens in the house in the fall of 2010. Neither one would touch it and neither would eat it when I tried to integrate it into existing kibble. I took the bag back to the store and got my money back. I've found many better quality grain free kibbles since my experience with Evo. I don't think P & G is responsible for my cats not liking the food. I bought before P & G announced they acquired Natura Pet. My cats just did not like it - neither of them did.

He can't pinch the last bit off and it sticks to his butt and then he waltzes out into the living room and DRAGS HIS BUTT ON THE CARPET!!!!!!! Our healthy cat is a strictly indoor cat and he has all the access to water and is only fed this dry food by a Le Bistro automatic feeder. Don't tell me I have to supplement his dry food with wet food, that defeats the convenience of the automatic feeder.<br /><br />WHAT CAN I DO???? please email me, mikegunn98 at yahoo.com or leave a comment here.

It was sour, all right, but the wrong kind of sour, so much so that I threw the loaf in the trash can after the first bite.  Even so, knowing that many things can go wrong in breadmaking, I may try it again, but I would certainly not be willing to pay the price here just to check my first opinion. Fortunately, the local Von's carries this product, so I might try one more box of the stuff IF I CAN"T FIND ANYTHING BETTER. What could be fairer than that?

review/summary: this is not sour dough!
review/text: I have been making bread for 20 years both by machine and by conventional methods.  I saw this mix at Safeway in the baking section, near the whole wheat flour and thought it looked promising.  According to directions, I just needed a cup full of warm water.<br /><br />The bread rose slowly and sank as soon as I moved it, like a deflated air mattress.<br /><br />After the second rise, I placed the shaped dough into the oven which soon filled the entire house with that warm pleasant smell that only comes from baking bread.<br /><br />The loaf appeared fine, smelled fine and I served it with the clam chowder I had prepared for dinner.  It only took one bite...this stuff was horrid.  I tried to saturate the bread in my well seasoned, super hot soup.  It still tasted rotten.<br /><br />The previous poster is so correct when she describes the stuff as tasting rancid!  I don't know what chemical compounds they have hidden in their "natural flavors".  My head was spinning, I suddenly felt nauseated, and my ears were ringing moments after I had eaten just a bite!<br /><br />My companion, who eats everything, like airplane food, potluck leftovers and my occasional bothced experiments, wouldn't eat this stuff!<br /><br />Unless you want to poison someone, or torture them I would steer clear of this box of MSG, chemical waste mislabeled as a sourdough bread.<br /><br />It was hideous tasting beyond anything I have ever eaten in bread.  No man, child or beast would eat this stuff!

I was concerned it would have too much candy peel and candied cherries based on a prior review -- I prefer my fruit cake with lots of raisins rather than cherries -- but the mix of fruit was good and the cake was moist.

review/summary: Chock full of candied fruits
review/text: The icing is a little too thick for my liking and the cake has too much candied fruits that there's barely any cake. I prefer the Bronte brand as it's got slightly less fruit and just the right amount of icing. The cake texture of both brands are about similar (that is, if you can find the cake in the Walkers brand!). I am apt to think that the Bronte brand is just a little more moist although English fruit cakes are aged and not supposed to be that moist anyway.

review/summary: My new favorite snack
review/text: On a trip to the grocery store a few weeks ago I picked up a bag of these Pretzel Crisps in the original flavor to try out, while my mother grabbed a bag in the garlic parmesan flavor. A few days later we each brought our new pretzels to one of my daughters softball games to snack on. As I ate mine, my mother insisted I try hers. Oh wow are these garlic parmesan ones good! It's not even a flavor I would normally have thought I would like, as I tend to like simpler flavors. But these are just so good, even a picky eater like myself love them. So on my next trip to the store I picked up 3 bags for myself and I'm snacking on them now.<br /><br />If you can envision a pretzel that has been rolled out flat with a rolling pin, that's what these are like. You get more of the crispy outside and much less of the white flour center you usually have with pretzels. Because they have a flat design, they even work as crackers. So you can top them with cheese, meats etc and use them with dips, just like you would a cracker, only they taste even better. They are very crispy, but don't crumble or fall apart when trying to eat them. The bags are resealable, and the seal works extremely well. The best part is since they have so much flavor, you can eat just a few and it feels like you've eaten a lot more. Lots of flavor is a smaller package.<br /><br />The nutritional info is:<br />Serving size: 10 crackers/pretzels<br />Fat: 1.5g per serving<br />Calories: 110 per serving<br />Carbs: 22g per serving<br />Sodium: 410mg per serving<br />And there is a warning that these are made in a facility that processes milk and soy, for those with allergies to them.

review/summary: This is GRAT pasta sauce
review/text: For most of my life I'd eaten two types of pasta "sauce": 1) My mom opened a can of tomato sauce, added a spice or two, poured it on the pasta and said, "eat it - it's good," or 2) When I finally moved out I bought the cheap, store bought pasta sauce - Prego, Ragu, etc. I thought Prego was the best (far superior to the red tomato stuff I had at home), and that there wasn't anything else out there for me to try.<br /><br />Well, I guess that was like thinking that The Olive Garden is the best Italian food restaurant in the world, because one day in a Cost Plus I bought one of these Gia Russa Hot Sicilian pasta sauce jars on a whim while trying out new things. When I tasted it for the first time, it was like a set of revelations - "This is really, really good. I have to get more of this." Then... "Wait - what the hell have I been eating all this time? Prego SUCKS..." Then I started to read the ingredients on my old sauces and I could see why: tomato paste, corn syrup, etc. "No wonder"... Gia Russa is made with just raw food stuffs - actual tomatoes, no sugars/corn syrup, etc. - like you would think all spaghetti sauce should be.<br /><br />Now before I start to sound like a blind fanboy of this product, I'm not saying that this Gia Russa Hot Sicilian is the BEST in the world (I'll never assume that again about any food in a jar.) It may not even be the best Gia Russa sauce (the harder to find Spicy Alla Vodka - the white label with red font - is equally excellent), but this Hot Sicilian IS that far superior to all of the usual mass produced sauces. (Not all of Gia Russa's sauces are great, either.)<br /><br />Also, there's the price - it's 2x-3x the cost of the cheap stuff.<br /><br />With that all said, however, this stuff is worth every extra penny you pay because you get at least 2x-3x the flavor back. Instead of using cheap sauce, I have actually cut back on the amount of pasta I eat simply because I can't afford to eat it the right way - with a real sauce like this.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you've always gone cheap with your pasta "sauces", you HAVE to try this sauce once. Barring a life or death famine situation, I will never eat Prego, or Ragu, or any other cheap sauce ever again. Sauces of this caliber will be my staple from now on.<br /><br />(Notes:<br />* A Wal-Mart near us carries it, and it may well be the best quality product in that entire supercenter.<br />* What else have I been eating that I thought was real food but isn't?<br />)

review/summary: The only pasta sauce for me.
review/text: I discovered the Gia Russa Hot Sicilian sauce when I moved to Ohio and it is the only one I eat.  Any other "spicy" sauce is a wanna-be, imitation! It is perfectly spicy and the tomatoes and herbs make a great symphony of flavor. I have bought this sauce for friends as a gift and advise them to exercise their best judgment when preparing it. The longer it simmers the spicier it gets.  The sauce tastes like a long held family recipe. I have been a loyal customer for 6 years and have since moved out of Ohio. If the makers of this pasta ever read my Amazon.com review please send me a coupon as I empty out the grocer shelves whenever these babies go on sale as it is a pricey item.  Sadly, it's an addiction to deliciousness.

review/summary: Good saffron for an great price
review/text: There's really not much else to say about this - it's an incredible deal when compared to normal retail prices for saffron.  The saffron is good quality and noticeably fresh (the use-by date on mine was three years away) and it's a fraction of the usual cost.  One thing I particularly liked and that isn't made clear by the description is that this product is actually five one-gram boxes and not one five-gram box, so the saffron in the boxes you haven't opened yet will stay fresh longer.  Still, if you only use saffron every once in a while you'd be better off buying a smaller quantity even if you pay a little more by weight; this is a considerable amount of saffron.  I cook with it regularly so it's great for me, I'm very pleased with this purchase.

review/summary: My finicky felines were won over by Aristocats!
review/text: I tried to turn on my older cat, an 8-year-old Siamese, to wet food several years ago, because I believe a balanced wet-dry diet is best for cats. I gave him a couple flavors of Fancy Feast, which he tried a couple bites of, the first couple nights; then the novelty wore off and he rejected it outright. So I gave up on him... However, recently I got a new kitten, and decided to try wet food on him. So I bought a couple cans of the Aristocats brand, on sale for 39 cents each. At first, the kitten had no interest in it - but ironically, the older cat did! He loves the stuff and begs for it as a treat in the mornings and evenings. The kitten saw his "big brother" enjoying the Aristocats so much, he started eating it, too. So now both of my "boys" are getting some wet food in their diet, and loving it. I bought the 24-can pack, once their enjoyment of the Aristocats brand was established, and am now well set for a while with wet food for them. I am very happy with the product and recommend it highly for owners of finicky cats who might not have eaten other brands of canned cat food.

At age three weeks, we start with this food, continue bottle-feeding unti they self-wean,and add dry (Iams Kitten) around five or six weeks.<br />  The only drawback is feeding ten or eleven kittens each day, as I go through a case of 24 cans every other day. Sure wish they'd make it in larger doses!  Otherwise, our kittens fly out the door at Adoption Days, and are wonderful pets.  Thanks to Disney for this product!

review/summary: Yummy! Udi's
review/text: We have been gluten free for over 2 years.  It is difficult to find a bun that doesn't fall apart or that doesn't taste bad.  Udi's delivers on this product.  They taste great, hold up while eating, and are even better toasted.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is gluten free.

A considerate friend who knew that I was gluten-free bought these buns for her cookout yesterday and it was awesome to eat a burger on a bun like everyone else. Some gluten-free breads taste like cardboard but this one did not. I didn't even have to toast it.

review/summary: Carbonated apple beverage from Mexico!
review/text: Recently I made yet another stop at JIM'S APPLE FARM (just south of Jordan, MN), and this time I found this wonderful apple flavored soda made in Mexico.  In essence, it tastes like a very light apple juice that has been sweetened with cane sugar and carbonated.  Simply put, it's a good product!  According to information that I've read, this product was first introduced to U.S. markets in the late 1980's.  However, at least in this part of the country, it hasn't made much of an impact.  Now that I've been introduced to this beverage, I'll be keeping an eye out for it.  I highly recommend giving it a try.

review/text: The  night  I  went  to  see  Semi  Pro  in  the  theather  like  opening  weekend.  The  scean  where  the  NBA  Commensor  and  his  family  are  gathering  around  the  TV  set  to  watch  The  Tropic game,  and  they  go  to  commerical.  The  commerical  they  were  watching  was  for  Sidral  Mundet  apple  soda. But  after  waching that  movie  with  that  commerical. I  really  wanted  try  that  soda  to  see  if  it  was  any  good. None  of  the  groccery  store  near  by  where  I  live  don't  have  it  anymore. They  probly  had  in  stores  when  it  was  big  in  the  1970s. So  last  fall  I  did  look  that  up  at  Amazon,  and  they  had  it, so  I  order  it, poured  myself  a  glass  after  I  got  it  in  the  mail, Dranked  the  whole  glass  and  boy  was  it  sooooo  gooood. What  did  it  taste  like?  it  was  like  fresh  juicy  red apples  made  into  a  sparkly  shampain turned  into  a  sparlky  soda. So  if  you  love  apple  made  into  any  apple  product  like  pies  and  butter. Then  this  is  the  drink  for  you. Just  beware  that  this  product  is  brewed  in  Mexico. But  I  get  this  again  every  fall  to  stock  up  for  my  halloween  party

To me the only drawback is they are very small; about an inch, inch and a quarter tall so when I give these to my dogs, I have to give them two or three at a time.  I guess I am use to bigger treats for biggers dogs.  Either way, the price was reasonable and they do like them so I am pleased and I think so are the dogs.

A pack of 4 is almost necessary since Rahn seems to think they are absolutely delicious. You can also buy one pack at Target for about $3.99.

They are all great - although I offer advice for anyone considering trying it:<br /><br />Cook it longer than you think!  The grainy texture of whole wheat pasta is a huge adjustment when cooked al dente.  This is much better cooked longer.  It is starchier, but not greatly so.  We eat it heavily sauced and also lightly oiled with parmesan.  Try it - it's good for you and also good!

review/summary: Best Granola Ever!
review/text: This is the best granola I have ever tried... and I have tried many.<br /><br />This has the best flavor, and consistency.  Does not clump like many others.<br /><br />Great for yogurt, oatmeal, or just plain out of the bag!<br /><br />The Udi's Original is my favorite.  Just ordered another 3 pack.

review/summary: My new favorite breakfast
review/text: This is my favorite flavor so far. Good flavor and crunch without being too crunchy or too sweet. The only thing that would make it better would be substituting the yucky canola oil for coconut oil.

review/summary: Love this gluten free granola!
review/text: Around 6 months ago I purchased the Udi's sample pack of gluten free granola and I like the "Original" version the best.  The vanilla was too sweet, the cranberry was just OK, and the Au Natural too bland.  This is now the only one I order.  Thank you, Amazon, for periodically offering special deals on gluten free products.

review/summary: Crunchy gluten free goodness
review/text: Unlike other gluten free granola's, this granola is not all greasy! It is crunchy and flavorful. I love this granola, I've subscribed to this flavor on amazon as its cheaper than the grocery store. I love how it has a variety of nuts and fruits. It's great as yogurt topper or cereal.
