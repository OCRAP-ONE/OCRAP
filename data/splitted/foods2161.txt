review/text: The game was decent, but there are so many "strip" cards in the deck and on the board that we got all the way to naked before my boy even pulled a "draw this" card!  Neat idea, meh on the execution.  Make sure you don't mind messing up the sheets.

review/summary: Great Fun
review/text: Contrary to other's advice on doing this with a new fling, my wife and I had great fun with this game. It is true that you get down to your bare essentials rather quickly, but we kept playing with just the chocolate and dare cards -- our goal was to land on the "favor" square in which your partner performs your pre-determined favor on you. We laughed. We ate Chocolate. We had fun. Enjoy!

I figured for 4.95 for 24 K-cups, well, I could only do quite well with this purchase even if there was not a wide selection.  I ordered two of these.  They were delivered promptly with Prime and I did receive a nice selection, same as pictured.  They came in clean , brown bags.  I am very happy.  Thank you!

review/summary: I'm not sure what kind of judgment this tea sampler is making of me.
review/text: I ordered two of these, since for five dollars, how can I really go wrong, right?  Even if I had gotten 22 cups, as many other reviews had, five dollars would still be a steal.  However, I got each and every one of my 24 cups in each sack.<br /><br />Now, of my 48 cups, 7 contained caffeine (so about 4 caffeinated, 20 noncaffeinated in each of my bags).  The rest were herbal or decaf.  Each bag contained about six varieties of tea, and they were generally the same (basically, If you buy two bags, you're likely to get a lot of the same six teas, rather than a bunch of different ones in each bag).<br /><br />It wasn't a bad assortment, but I wonder if these sacks of assorted teas are saying something about me.  I mean, I didn't think I was getting too much caffeine, but now I'm wondering.  A lot of them are things like "Camomile" (great for knitting quilts), "Decaffeinated Earl Grey) (why decaf?  and why Earl Grey?), and "Sleepytime Herbal Tea" (why is Burley Brew trying to calm me down?)<br /><br />Also, these assortments are pretty much as pictured.  While writing this review I've been staring at the picture to the right of the box, and it pretty much pictures five of the seven breeds of tea I received, though it omits the one I received the most of.  That's right.  I nearly forgot.  One quarter of my tea is peppermint.  Who even likes Peppermint?<br /><br />For five bucks, I give it four stars.  For any price over ten, I'd advise you to pre-evaluate your tastes for peppermint and earl grey.

review/text: I thought is would be a great way to try a variety of teas.  The main disappoint I have is that the number one tea that I was wanting to try from this purchase was the Indian Spice Chai Tea, but there was none in the package I received.  The packaging was quite unexpected - a brown paper bag with a computer printed black and white label.  The individual k-cups are intact, so I do not question the contents of them; I just unprepared for a brown paper bag.  I think my husband and I will enjoy try the different tea varieties, none-the-less.

review/summary: I love kale chips... but hate these!!!
review/text: I'm an experienced kale chip eater, and usually love them.  And I usually like Indian food.  But I *hate* these Bombay Curry flavor kale chips.  First, I dislike the spicing.  A lot.  I also wasn't a huge fan of the kale itself: the leaves strike me as somewhat small, and there seemed to be a high proportion of spines (which are hard, and not tasty).<br /><br />On the plus side, it was organic kale.  Which is really nice.  I'd probably just look for a different flavor.  I think some of the others are cheaper too, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7OVXW">Rhythm Superfoods Mango Habanero Kale Chips, 2-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>, which is also available as subscribe & save.  (I've never tried that flavor, but it sure sounds good!!!)<br /><br />Or, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y2EKNW">Kale Krunch, Cheezy Chipotle, 2.2 Oz Organic</a>, which I find is a really good brand, and I find is the best Kale Krunch flavor.

review/text: Okay - I have to start out saying that I really love this company.  Having lived in Austin and loved Daily Juice, my heart wants them to win. However, this product is really terrible.  It is so caked on with goop that it is heavy and fatty and you might as well have a dorito instead!  I LOVED their original recipe..it was so light and yummy - it tasted good AND it was actually healthy - what a concept!  I now eat Lydia's - because those kale chips are at least a tad bit lighter.  Again, I wish them success - but they gotta get back on the health bandwagon with these puppies.

review/summary: Inconsistent Nutrition Information
review/text: I purchased a bag of these chips these a month ago and the nutrition label on the package matched that on the Web site--101 calories, 4 g fat for 1 ounce. Ordered these from Amazon--12 bags--and the nutrition label has more than twice the calories and fat--210 calories, 9 g fat for 1 ounce. Since protein and fiber have also doubled, I'd like to think that the nutrition info is now for 2 ounces (1 bag). However, the nutrition label says this is for 1 ounce, 2 servings per container.<br /><br />This happened previously with another flavor of these kale chips, and I submitted a query to Rhythm Superfoods, using the contact form at their Web site. Weeks later, have received no answer. Submitted another query about the current situation, but am not optimistic about receiving an explanation.<br /><br />This is marketed as a healthful snack--accurate nutrition information matters.

review/text: After my order the seller sent an email with tips on what I needed to prepare for my plant when it arrived. The shipping was fast and the plant was packaged with great care. The sundew I received was healthy and had LOTS of plantlets budding off it and a budding flower;I had a second flower stalk bud after it had settles in its new pot/home. I noticed another reviewer also scored on this as well!<br /><br />The moss it came with was BEAUTIFUL and high quality. I went to Lowe's to buy more moss for future Venus Fly traps that I will be buying from this seller but noticed it was not the same. He also sells this moss at an awesome price for customers as well.<br /><br />The instructions are simple and easy to follow regarding the plant care. The seller sends a follow up email and asks that you send him any questions that you have about your plant...and he answers the emails IMMEDIATELY. I sent two separate emails and both times he was prompt in response.<br /><br />I look forward to buying more plants from this seller in the future and I am a new loyal customer.

review/summary: Another GREAT BUY!
review/text: NOTE:  SORRY FOR AN SPELLING/GRAMMER ERRORS, THERE'S NO SPELL-CHECK ON AMAZON!!!<br /><br />This is my second buy from Joel, and I can officially say this is the BEST service I have seen on the internet in while.  I did a lot of research (as always...) before buying, and I found out somethings that I think you might want to know.  For starters, this is sundew that is almost impossible to kill, because once well established, it is just generally more difficult to kill than other sundews.  Another, it will arrive green in color, but it will turn a vibrant maroon when exposed to the correct amount of light.  You actually recive THREE plants, not one, but mine arrived in a clump, growing together.  DO NOT TRY TO PRY THEM APART!!! they are supposed to come like this.<br /><br />Also, if you want a pot FULL of these plants, you just have to let them flower and produce seeds, and they flower so often and produce so many seeds that some growers consider this species as a weed as the baby plants colinize any pot they can grow in, and like i said before, they are pretty hard to perminately kill by carnivourous plant standards.<br /><br />I will update when major events happen (i.e.: The sundew changes color, ect)<br /><br />12/29/2011---'Stickly' is getting a "tan"(green turning red), and new dew drops are forming on his little tenticles, and I fed each sundew (they are growing in a clump) a ant.

review/summary: So far so good!  Awesome seller!
review/text: Received the plants in great condition.  They were sealed in plastic bags and packed with peat moss (great idea, less waste and good cushioning).  Came with a comprehensive care sheet, which included clear instructions for potting, feeding, etc.  I've only had the plant for less than a week now, but it looks healthy and it seems to be very easy to take care of.  I think the only thing I have to worry about is making sure it has enough water (distilled).<br /><br />Seller was really quick to respond to my e-mails.  I ended up buying three more plants from him (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051S7P54?ie=UTF8&seller=A2LY3PY2K4G4LU&sn=JoelsCarnivorousPlants), and they all came in great condition as well.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about this item was that unpacking it was a little messy.  The peat moss is in the box like packing peanuts, so it can get on the floor while you're trying to put it in the pots.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this item and seller (JoelsCarnivorousPlants)!

review/text: The product arrived within three days, and was in perfect condition even after getting locked in the mailbox for a bit. The instructions were excellent and very informative, and even if you had questions, the seller did a follow-up to answer anything you might need to know.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful product well worth buying. I will definitely be making my purchases here in the future.

review/summary: Beyond expectations on all fronts
review/text: I was slightly hesitant at first, worried about how well the little guy would travel across the country, but it arrived safe and is thriving! The seller notified me when it was shipping, it was sent faster than I believe I even paid for (thanks!!!) arriving the next day. The detailed instructions are fool proof and the seller sends more than ample amounts of peat moss for planting (I had actually Purchased more so that I could plant two in a larger pot, but ended up not needing it at all). The price is extremely cheap and well worth it (take a look at california carnivores' website and you'll see what a good deal you are getting). My only problem is that now I am hoping more bugs get into my house so the little guy can feed. Will definitely be ordering more and more from this seller.

review/summary: Happy with little sundew
review/text: I got my sundew a couple days ago.  It was nicely packed with a little less than twice as much potting material as the plant needed (so now I  have some extra :D).  It was very bunched up and quite small, and still is, so I'll post pictures when it looks more exciting.  It is quite green with little red-tipped hairs; from what I can gather if you want it to be as red as the picture you have to put it under grow lights.  When it came it was not dewy at all, but it had a little stock with what appears to be little seed pods, so I imagine it is a fairly mature plant if it is trying to reproduce.  I have been moving it to different windows around the house so it gets the most sun, but it went a couple days without getting any dew at all.  Today I tried putting a clear bowl over it to increase humidity, and now little drops of dew (digestive goo) are visible on some of the hairs.  This plant seems to be progressing so far, and it is 78-79 degrees F in here with a humidity of probably 40-50%.  It may or may not need a little help from a bowl for humidity, but other than that it seems just fine in a normal house on a window sill.  The plant is small, maybe as wide as a thumb is long.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: Well this plant came in a ziplock bag and the roots was wrapped around a moist paper towel so don't worry abt ur plant dying or anything and alot of I guess sphagnum moss in the box , it also came with a little black with holes pot , small. The plant has alot of little I guess traps and the tentacles are very red and they look healthy . Mines came with two seperate ones but they were together. I'm not sure if they're supposed to stay together or what but either way I now have two potted sundew plants. This isnt the cape sundew plant thing , the one with tall traps with sticky traps. It's short and my stickiness isn't there but I guess it's due to mailing so it's ok it'll grow good but overall it's a good plant from a good buyer, the seller Joel is good because he's helping me right now with information I need with the plant and also they give u instructions on how to plant so don't worry . Get this plant it's cheap and cool

review/summary: Be careful of putting your plant in direct sunlight
review/text: The plant I received shipped very fast. It arrived in a little plastic bag to keep everything moist which was nice...I planted it in a large mason jar with a venus flytrap and a pitcher plant. The plant is growing fine and I am very satisfied with the speedy shipment. I would be careful with following the growing instructions from some other users. All carnivorous plants need some sort of humidity which would be sealing it in some sort of container with a few holes on the top and I would be careful of placing these plants in direct sunlight, the plants will barely produce or stop producing the sticky dew drops in both cases.

review/summary: Mmmmm. These Won't Last Long!
review/text: I've always liked beef jerky as a snack. Turkey Jerky too. And a friend of mine made Venison jerky after hunting season and it was delicious too. It's a good snack and it has a high protein content, which is hard to find in a snack product. About the only things I don't like is that some jerky can be slightly rancid and some is way too salty.<br /><br />On my latest trip to my local Costco Warehouse store, I found "Kirkland Signature Steak Strips." it's a jerky made of thick-cut top round steak and is 98% fat free. I can't recall ever finding a lower fat content in a jerky, and that means that the calorie content as well as the cholesterol is lower. These strips of beef are preserved with a delicious seasoning mix including brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and hicory smoke flavor. Real good! It says to refrigerate after opening and that's exactly what I'm doing to ensure the original freshness. Mmmmm. I have the feeling that these won't last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Paid $15.43, quite a premium extra; since return was 'not our fault', would have cost $5.63 shipping.. Needless to say, will not shop food again.

We left a bag of this opened in the office and everyone liked it so much and commented on it, the whole bag was gone in minutes.<br /><br />I really love popcorn and this brand and flavour is a winner for me !

review/text: This is a creamy, orange drink. Very refreshing. However, it was damaged in transit either because it was poorly packed or UPS threw it across the loading dock. I'm one bottle short and THERE IS NO ONE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SHORT OF RETURNING THE ENTIRE ORDER!!!!!!!! Where is the customer service??????

review/text: A very cough medicine, candy like raspberry flavor.  Not too good if you ask me.  I am drinking it, but more sugar, less sugar, doesn't really matter still doesn't taste all that good to me.  That being said, it is probably an individual taste bud thing.

review/text: Amy & Brian's Coconut Juice with Lime is pure cool. It takes a couple of swigs to acclimate to the taste, if you are used to the regular Amy & Brian's Coconut Juice (sans lime). But one can into my 12-pack and I was hooked on the tart bite of lime combined with the smooth coconut taste. A refreshing little kick that further tropical-ized my tropical drink. Yum.

They also seem to love the taste of them.  Sourced from the USA with low fat yet rich in protein.  The big tub is well worth it with free prime shipping.

review/summary: Lily loves it :)
review/text: I bought this for my 4 month old kitten Lily who was only eating hard food but she was loosing hair around her face and i read that cats get hydrated from wet food. So I thought Id give this a try! She loves it so much that when I open the can she stands at my feet and meows until i put it down for her! haha.She also seems to be picking up a little weight in a good way! Im glad she likes it and ill defenitly order her more. The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and when i received it some of the cans were just laying in the box not in the pack but they were all still there and closed.

review/summary: The kittens enjoy it.
review/text: I admit, one of the reasons i buy this kitten food is that it's relatively cheap. Not dirt cheap, which is good, because i don't entirely trust the people who can make kitten food so inexpensively. What're they putting in there?<br /><br />Anyway, it's pretty cheap as kitten food goes. It also doesn't smell awful, a problem i've had with some other wet pet foods, but it is a little stinkier than the chicken and liver food from the same company. The kittens devour it, which is also good.<br /><br />But best of all, it doesn't upset their tummies, so i don't have to clean up nasty messes.

review/summary: Great tuna for a snack!
review/text: I buy these in the grocery store for about $2 a can.  At the advertised $30-for-six price, plus shipping, the above cans are over $6 per can, making them more than triple the price in a grocery store.  I like these, and have a very hard time finding them locally, but I am not willing to pay over $6 for a can of tuna.  I can't imagine anyone being willing to pay so much.<br /><br />I do love this size of the Bumblebee tuna medleys.  It's easy to use this size can as a base for a small meal, or as the base for a snack, with cheese and crackers, or a piece of fruit.  My personal favorite (actually the only flavor I like) is the lemon pepper.  No fishy taste, which I did get with the other flavors.

review/text: Not too good. May be good if squeezed dry and added with mayo + crunchy veggies into tuna salad. I had this + crackers and the flavor was quite overwhelming. Very lemon pepper?!!?? Ha ha ha. I know, it is very lemon pepper but it is quite intense. I'll try as the base of a tuna salad, it may be better, but I think I'll sick with my plain ole' tuna. Worth a try if you are looking for something different, just not for me though. Texture was nice. Not to clumpy, but not overly processed and fine. Not terribly mushy.

review/text: These bunnies are my favorite cracker snack.  They taste like Goldfish but are less salty and not quite so cheesy in flavor, nor do they crumble as easily into orange crumbs.<br /><br />All ingredients seem to be organic, even the annatto extract used for natural color.  However, this product is made on equipment that also processes egg and soy products.<br /><br />A serving is 50 crackers (30g) and yields 150 calories, of which 60 are from fat.  Total fat is 11%; saturated fat is 5%.  Sodium yiels 250mg or 10% and total carbohydrate is 19g or 6%.<br /><br />This is made in the USA.

review/summary: Contains a Form of MSG
review/text: The product labeling in my mind is a little deceptive considering these crackers contain a forum of MSG. MSG's most active ingredient is free glutamate. Free glutamate is the active ingredient of mono-sodium glutamate, or MSG. Yeast Extract contains free glutamate. In my opinion, the only reason this company is using the term "Yeast Extract" is to conceal the fact that this products contains MSG.

review/summary: Contains a form of MSG!
review/text: My son enjoyed eating these bunnies until I realize that they contained "Yeast Extract", which contains free glutamic acid...another term for, or type of MSG!<br /><br />I checked the back of the box because I had begun reading a book called, "Excitotoxins" (great book for moms by the way), which lists the many forms of MSG and explains what they do to the body.  It is associated with reproductive disorders, damage to the brain, damage to the endocrine system, obesity and other disorders.  Companies use such additives to food to make them taste better and make them more addictive.  Yeast Extract is harmful to everyone, but particularly little children.  I was especially upset that this additive showed up in an "organic product" and one for children!  Many of the other companies out there that produce organic products do not use such additives.<br /><br />Here's an article about Yeast Extract:<br />[...]<br /><br />Here's another site with a listing of all the different forms of MSG:<br />[...]

review/text: If not these organic crackers are not for you. These taste so great in part because they contain yeast extract which acts a lot like MSG in the body. Please research yeast extract before feeding these to children and if you choose to use this product watch for behavior changes. We learned very painfully just how harmful this ingredient can be for some kids.
