review/text: I am so glad I can now get Oloves from amazon here in the US. The only reason I would buy the in flight snack was for the Oloves. When I flew with co-workers or family I would persuade them to buy the flight snack so they would then give me there Oloves. Never told them how good they were... guilty, I wanted them all for myself.<br /><br />Best Olives ever. 5 out of 5 just because I cannot give them more stars!

review/summary: My favorite olive!
review/text: I love oloves!! I have tried finding them in the US for a year and am so thankful that they are now available! They are tender delicate olives, just like the ones you get in Spain. They are conveniently packaged to be taken anywhere you go. Before I was able to purchase them on Amazon I would purchase the United box meal that included them just so I could get my Olove fix!

review/summary: By far the best chocolate
review/text: I first had these chocolates over 20 years ago and when my mom would bring them back when she would go home to Sweden to visit all of her family every 2 years.I know their Belgium chocolates but their readily available all over Europe and Scandinavia.She would actually get them at the duty free shop in the airport.Since she is older now she rarely travels anymore so I was very happy to find these on Amazon.I think this chocolate has to be in the top three chocolates I have ever had.I have eaten many good chocolates over the years considering my mom is from Sweden where they have some of the best chocolates in the world.I think I am somewhat of a connoisseur.If you are a chocolate lover you have to try these chocolate shells they are awesome.

review/summary: Very good hot sauce...!
review/text: We are a couple from the northwest side of Mexico and we do know about peppers, in fact i don't know any person who tolerate hot peppers like my lovely wife. She can eat fresh habanero without a blink or a sweat.<br />We opened the bottle and we ate about 1/3 of the content during one dinner, maybe that's says it all...! It's tasty and really hot if you use a generous amount. We tried it in carne asada tacos and it was a really good experience (My wife told me that she felt like Scooby Doo in the movie, throwing smoke from her ears... lol). Is it the hottest sauce in the world...? Maybe not but it is a hell of a good sauce.<br />I did some edition of my original review and upgrade to four stars because this sauce deserves a better rating.

review/text: I love hot spicy food and especially hot sauces. I have had quite a few and most of these are either so hot that they have no flavor or they are too wimpy. This is one of the few hot sauces that is actually incredibly spicy and very tasty. The flavor is really fresh and not too sour (Tabasco is way too sour), and the heat is amazing! You'll be sweating.

review/text: I bought this stuff about two weeks ago and it was really really hot. I like the fresh taste in it. I put just a little on a cracker straight and had to drink a whole lot of water. I also made salsa with it and only used about 10 percent of the bottle and it is still very hot. Believe me when i say this is some good stuff. Hotter than the ghost pepper, and i have bought plenty of ghost pepper sauce.

review/summary: This is IT!?
review/text: I was excited when I saw this hot sauce so I ordered it right away. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to its name sake. I wouldn't even call it hot. Reminds me more of a cocktail sauce. Blair's Ultra Death sauce is what I would call hot... but it also taste like sh*t lol. The Scorpion Sauce DOES taste good but doesn't have the heat you would expect or want. It WILL mess up your stomach though.<br /><br />There was another reviewer that stated hes had hotter sauces that didn't bother his stomach as much as this did and he is absolutely correct. You could easily fill up a large spoonful of this stuff, let it set in your mouth a while, then drink it with no burning or sense of heat.... but your stomach WILL quickly disagree. Actually, just small doses of this stuff really irritated my stomach. I can drink a dipping bowl full of habanero sauce with minimal stomach irritation.. but just a small amount of Trinidad Scorpion bothers my stomach quite a bit. I just wish I felt like I accomplished something when my stomach hurts this bad. It's literally like downing cocktail sauce then feeling like you were bashed in the stomach with a base ball bat repeatedly. I do like the taste but the messed up stomach isn't worth it when there's no heat to justify the irritation.

review/summary: Flavor Flavor Flavor!!
review/text: First of all - All hot sauces will have inconsistencies, its just how it goes. The only way around it is to get the super mass produced stuff(tabasco rings a bell).<br />This is a non-extract hot sauce with a limited ingredient list(less belly pain), if you need more heat just go the way of the extract sauces.<br /><br />This is a terrific sauce and I can see the bottle getting used pretty quickly. Pretty hot but if you want the full effect just do a tablespoon full. Its quickly becoming the go to sauce for flavor and burn, again its not an extract sauce so its not going to touch the heat of those. With all of that in mind I would rate this pretty high among my sauce collection.

review/text: This sauce has a nice flavor outside of the heat; kind of a vinegary/fruity taste. The problem with this sauce is that in the mouth, it isn't even as hot as the Naga Jolokia, or even Scoth Bonnet hot sauce I've had. But it did wreak havoc on my stomach and bowels, which was sort of to be expected, but I've had other sauces that were much hotter on the mouth that didn't wreck me in the bathroom. Be warned.

review/summary: Good candied orange peel, but not great.
review/text: Last weekend we candied the peel from about 28 pounds of oranges (a box from a Florida Grower that was a gift.)using a number of recipes for candied peel as guides. We made orange juice and ordered a citrus juicing attachment for our Kitchenaid because that many oranges was a lot of work! We were happy with our candied peel, but wanted to see how it compared to comerically available items so we ordered 4 ounces of orange peel from France -- the most expensive peel -- as well as the most recommended, less expensive peel<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KP6B98">Candied Orange Peel Slices 2 lbs (32 oz.)</a><br />This morning, we dipped samples of all peels in the same dipping chocolate<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NE44E0">Ghirardelli Chocolate Candy Making & Dipping Bar, Double Chocolate Flavor 2.5 Lbs</a><br />This peel, currently being reviewed was mediocre. It contains much more pith (the white layer under the zest) than ours did, as we were careful to follow Pepin's instructions given in "La Method". As a result of the higher percentage of pith, the candied peel was much more bland than our home candied peel, and less vibrant in color.<br />We concluded that candying peel at home makes much more sense that buying candied peel. It's easy -- the cost is really only the sugar as we either composed the peels or fed them to the cattle previously -- who love them by the way!<br />The packaging of this peel is fabulous, but the peel itself is mediocre.

That could be one of the most subjective opinions here. Call me easy to please, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55PE">Eight O'Clock Coffee, Original Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 4)</a> is what I call my "standard" everyday coffee. But what do I call a 5-star coffee? Try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031O4B16">Magnum Jamaican Blue Mountain Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 2 Lb Bag</a> or the more costly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00344R71Y">Wallenford Blue 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee 16oz Whole Beans</a> and break out your grinder.<br /><br />Another personal 4-star "standard" is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00351JWTQ">Starbucks Pike Place Roast Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>, which should be familiar to many. This "house blend" from Starbucks can be found across the world, and if you want a decent comparison to the Seattle's Best Level 4, this might be it.<br /><br />Again, choices in coffee can be very subjective, so explore and find a favorite. I personally like to keep the 5-star coffees for weekends or special occasions, and that's when I switch to beans and break out the grinder, but again that's a personal choice.<br /><br />Maybe after trying a few more bags this highly-subjective rating will go up, but this coffee dinker is calling the Seattle's Best Level 4 ground coffee a good, solid 4-star choice. And now for another cup...<br /><br />12/29/2011

review/text: I never ordered this product. I ordered Henry's Blend which was the description that was offered.<br />Not to be a pain, I tried one bag and I hate it. I wanted Henry's blend .<br />I was and am so upset that I paid all that money for 5 bags of what I thought was Henry's blend .<br />I would never buy coffee without first tasting it. I knew what Henry's blend tasted like.<br />I would have bought one bag of their new coffee and tried it out.<br />Henry's blend was so luscious and rich. I'm lost until I find another coffee brand.<br />I've been buying Henry's blend for years. I miss it and I want it back!!!!!!!!!<br />I want to send it back . He can just refund my money for the unopened bags.

review/summary: Supreme Chocolate Makes My Heart Sing!
review/text: Instead of creamer and sugar, I add a packet of this to my eight ounces of freshly ground coffee each morning! For a mere 140 calories, I enter bliss! Comparable, both in yummy-ness and nutritionally, to a whole milk Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino�, this Supreme Chocolate mix comes in at 3 grams of saturated fat (30 calories, 14% DV, from hydrogenated soybean oil and coconut oil), 0 trans fat, and 24 grams of sugars (sugar and corn syrup solids). As for price, since I live three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, the shipped price is actually a little better than I would pay locally, and it arrives practically overnight. The entire box of 72 packets is only 7"x7"x18", and consists of six smaller display type boxes of twelve packets each. These 6"x7"x3.5" display boxes will tuck neatly into the smallest kitchen upper cabinets, and will maintain the individually wrapped single serving packets in a neat upright position. All in all, this is a big luxury for a little price, which is something that makes my heart sing!

review/text: Being a hot cocoa lover as I am, it's hard to believe I've never tried Land O Lakes Supreme Hot Chocolate until I received it as part of a gift basket. I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I've had in a long time.<br />I've tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!

I can't believe that another reviewer actually suggested that it tastes like Miracle Whip. Miracle Whip is a disgusting, sweet, icky mayonnaise imposter and this mayo has absolutely nothing in common with it.  It is not sweet at all, and it actually has flavor.  Yes, it is a tangy flavor, but mayonnaise is supposed to be tangy.  If you don't want tangy mayonnaise, get something bland from Walmart and be done with it.  If you want mayonnaise that tastes like perfect, homemade mayo, then get this.  Added bonus--no horrible little soybeans are involved at all.

review/summary: Diff'rent Strokes
review/text: I often come across a product that repels me.  Then, occasionally, my taste buds change direction to the point of craving the aforementioned "repulsion."  The first time I can remember this phenomenon was with Kombucha.  I hated the vinegary bite, but kept drinking the beverage because of its health benefits.  Now, I have to ration the stuff to protect my wallet.  More recently, I fell into the same trap with this mayo.<br /><br />On first try, I felt like the product simply tasted "wrong."  I disliked it, but I'm thrifty; I didn't toss it in the trash.  By the 3rd or 4th try, my brain had accepted that this tasted different.  I began to appreciate the merits the flavor does have.  The texture is different, too.  Most mayonnaise seems more whipped (with air in it).  This is smoother and creamier.  Actually, more like the food prep mayo I used to use when I worked in a deli.<br /><br />I guess another comparison would be with orange drinks.  If you grew up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VTLPYM">SunnyD Sunny Delight , Orange, 48-Ounce Single Serve Bottles (Pack of 8)</a>, than fresh squeezed orange juice would seem completely off the mark.  You would, however, come around eventually.

review/summary: A Godsend
review/text: Thanks to a combination of Hi-Tor Neo Diet and Vita Gravy (and the sub-q fluids prescribed by the vet) my cat, who was given a diagnosis of advanced kidney failure and a certain impending death sentence two months ago, has amazed my vet and everyone in the vet's office. As a previous poster has already said, many renal failure cats are presribed the Hill's k/d or a/d diets and they absolutely hate it and won't eat it. My cat would not touch the stuff -- wouldn't even smell it -- I had to force feed him for weeks. I finally found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet, which is almost as low protein/phosphorous as the Hill's prescription diets. My cat loves it and is finally gaining back some weight. The vet had also prescribed some vitamin drops, which he also hates. Then I found "Vita-Gravy", which is also available at Pet Food Direct. He loves the taste of the Chicken Vita-Gravy mixed with the Hi-Tor Neo. Now he's getting the extra nutrition he needs to balance his blood levels, while really enjoying the taste! If your cat has renal failure and is refusing to eat, you might want to try this combo. Good luck! I hope your kitty fares as well as mine has so far.

review/text: My cat has renal disease and has been on Hill's k/d dry and canned food for over a year.  Recently she was getting picky about eating and not wanting the either type of the canned k/d.  Based on the Amazon reviews, I ordered the Hi-Tor Neo Diet hoping that she would love it.  At first she did love it (something new/different I think), but now she is very ambivalent towards it and lately has preferred the k/d.  Perhaps it is due simply to her personality or perhaps it is due to her stage of renal disease, but I have not seen any difference between k/d and the Hi-Tor Neo.  Other than the renal disease, she doesn't have any health issues and is still pretty frisky for being 16 years old.

review/text: My cat has had a poor appetite for months, which was explained recently by a diagnosis of chronic renal failure. I dreaded the prospect of trying to switch him to an even less appetizing food than what he was currently refusing to eat. Sure enough, like many other CRF cats before him, he wouldn't touch the Hill's canned k/d or Royal Canin pouch renal diet. I searched online for an alternative and found Neo Diet. On the advice of one "5 paw" customer review, I gave it a shot. He gobbled it up with such gusto that I could hear the chomping and lip smacking from across the room! I can't remember the last time he's eaten that enthusiastically. What the heck is in this stuff???

She's been through all the mainstream renal cat foods and sooner or later, tired of each of them. No going back, either.  Kitty with a memory - my luck. I read good reviews about Hi-Tor Neo Diet early this year, and ordered a case.  She SCARFED that food down!  Things went along swimmingly until my last order >> hmm, new label, new size, new consistency, doesn't smell the same.  For a week now, Sabrina has consistently taken a few bites, then turns her nose up at it.  She's eating maybe 1/8th of what she used to eat. I'm shipping the remainder back, and the new search begins.....sigh.  Anybody else having this experience?

There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet.  Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating.  One day at a time.<br /><br />So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans).  If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try.  If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!<br /><br />Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review.  Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then.  After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat.  Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable.  It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.<br /><br />More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal.  My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well.

review/summary: Magic  Food
review/text: I read the other reviews which lead me to try this product.  Our 17 year old cat (Angel) was diagnosed with renal failure and the vet put her on food that she would not eat.  That forced us to mix the vet food with other cat food and Angel still lost weight.  Angel is a very small cat and has weighed approximately 6-7 pounds her entire life.  When her weight dropped to 5 pounds we thought she was on her way out.  We purchased this food and she LOVES it!  Angel has been on it for about 6 months now and she is back to her normal weight. She begs for it. What an awesome product!

review/summary: A life saver for my kitty!
review/text: Finally! My cat had been eating k/d diet both wet and dry for years. Suddenly she lost interest in the canned and I was forced to add sardines to it. Sort of defeats the purpose of limiting the protein doesn't it? Well, I  was heartsick because already thin to begin with, she wasn't eating enough to gain weight. She would just sit and stare at her bowl. In desperation, I knew I had to find a better food, so I read the reviews here and ordered a case and voila! She eats it without sauce or sardines. She can't get enough of it. I had to order another case. So now she's eating one can a day which is good. Though I wish they would make this in a dry too, so she could nibble through the night. She won't even touch the dry anymore! And we all know what a wet diet can do to the teeth. I highly recommend a dental treat such as enzadent oral chews and a daily cleaning or adding a dental additive to the water. But I shouldn't complain, she's eating and that's what I wanted. Anyway, I don't know what they put in this food, but my cat sure likes it and thanks to it, she's going to be around for a long time still!

review/summary: Good food, finicky cat
review/text: I have no complaints about the food at all; it seems to be a high quality, low phosphorus food for cats with chronic renal failure (CRF).  My CRF cat is really finicky though, but he eats it pretty good.  The food is very moist, which most cats seem to like.  I do mix even more water into the food to make a gravy, just so he gets extra water.  The food was shipped in a timely manner, and overally, I have no complaints.

review/summary: My cat is addicted!
review/text: My cat has two issues, early CRF and IBD.  The IBD caused her to stop eating completely.  Prior to that, she was very picky and wouldn't eat any renal diet(and I tried them all).  I originally passed on Hi Tor because of the by products, but I was bent on getting her to eat a renal diet.  Fortunately, she loved Hi Tor.  She is always crying to be fed now, and eats 2 cans a day, and would eat more if I let her.  Cats are picky, so not every cat will like it, but if you have a CRF cat that isn't eating, it's worth a try.  If your cat won't eat it, donate it to a shelter or a rescue group.  I'm sure they have CRF cats that could use it.<br /><br />Update 2/20/10:  They have changed the formula for the food.  It's more dense, and the cans are 5.5oz rather than 6oz. It looks more like regular cat food and less like chopped bits o' parts. My cat doesn't like this as much, but that may be the fact that she can't lick it up like the previous version.  I have to try adding water to it to see if it helps.

review/text: Unfortunately my cat has been in cronic kidney failure for some time so he needs to have a low protien diet. We tried the one from the vet and he wouldn't touch it. I then tried this and he eats it really well. It's been hard to find at pet stores recently so finding it on line is a god send. My vet is very pleased with my cat's weight gain and one of the reasons is he likes this so well. I definately recommend this for anyone who's cat needs to be on a low protien diet. The price is much more economical than the KD diet from the vet and cats seem to find it much more palitable.

review/summary: My cat ate it!!
review/text: My 15 yr old cat was diagnosed with kidney disease a couple months ago and upon my vet's suggestion I began feeding kitty the Prescription Diet K/D wet and dry food.  My cat stopped eating the wet food all together after about a week (the dry food wasn't touched from the start) and started losing weight which was concerning.  I tried the Hi-Tor Neo Diet after reading the good reviews on Amazon.  I'm pleased to say my cat eats the Hi-Tor (my cat didn't care for the vita gravy stuff) so I didn't have to resort to force feeding (thank goodness!).  I'd definitely recommend the Hi-Tor as it's low protien and it's more palatable than the K/D.

review/summary: Your kitty's life is worth trying this
review/text: My cat is almost 8 years old. Being the runt, she has always been a small cat, weighing about 7 or 8 lbs on average. I notice she just wasnt her happy little self and to my horror was down to just 5 1/2 lbs. Like everyone else here, the prognosis was kidney failure. There was absolutely nothing I could do to get her to eat the prescription canned food. Mixing with the old to wean her to the new didnt work. Adding water, making it warm, trying every kind available from my vet, I was at my wits end. She was getting sicker by the day eating just the dry food. Then after much reading of blogs, kidney failure webpages, etc, everyone raved about the Hi-tor food. I was afraid to purchase 24 cans of something she wouldnt end up eating, and my vet did not carry it nor did the yever hear of it. I figured my cats life was worth $25.00 and gave it a try. WOW, is all I can say! She IMMEDIATELY ran to the bowl, gobbled it up and asked for more! I have now began to feed her the canned food as often as she asks for it. She looks better, has had less vomiting, and has gone back to playing with toys and pestering her sister kitty, so I KNOW she feels better. If this only helps prolong her life for a little while, I know it was well worth the money to special order it. I plan on taking a few cans to my vet so they can consider carrying it in the future. Thank you Hi-Tor! Now please make a dry kidney food!

review/summary: Good Supplement/Replacement for Rx Cat Food
review/text: My 17 yo cat with chronic renal failure was on the prescription foods by Hill's and Royal Canin for a year. She did fine on these, however they are expensive over time. The Hi-Tor Neo food is not quite as low in protein, etc, as the Rx foods, but still lower than regular cat foods. (The need for this is disputed, by the way.) I mix it half & half for my cat, she eats it all and after several months remains in stable health!  I've saved some expense and I think maybe a bit more protein is actually good for her. So I plan on purchasing more of the Hi-Tor Neo canned food.

review/text: My little 15 yo Siamese has one very small kidney and needs to be on a special low protein diet.  My vet recommended Hi-Tor Neo a couple years ago and he took right too it.  Granted, he's not all that picky but he gets very vocal when he's ready for his Neo (the Siamese yowl).  Obviously he loves it and he's very healthy and active.  Sometimes I add some water to it to make a "gravy" when he's a bit dehydrated and he thinks that's an extra special treat.  Highly recommend this product verses the prescribed brand that's more expensive and not so tasty to the felines.

review/summary: Excellent, I think
review/text: My cat was 20 years old and in severe CRF when I first bought this.<br /><br />She has always been a picky eater, and now was almost a non-eater.<br /><br />This product,combined with extra water and a little low sodium water-packed tuna mixed in, has gotten her to eat well enough that I have ordered it a second time, and would certainly try it with any cat in the early stages of CRF or beyond.<br /><br />Changing her food, combined with vet care that includes perscription thyroid meds, combined with epakitkin supplementation,  has all helped tremendously.  The thyroid meds alone were not enough.  Feeding her Neo Tor and epakitkin seems to really help (as much as anything can help at her age).  She refused all other supplements.  She has gone from severely anorexic to gaining 1 pound (in 2 months) and having more energy.  She never lost interest in life, even when she wouldn't eat, but she has more ability to pursue life now.<br /><br />Not a cure for old age by any means. But worth a try.<br /><br />Shipping was quicker than promised.

The fact that he'll eat it at all is amazing, because he wouldn't touch any of the vet diets. From can to can it's a little inconsistent in terms of moisture content - cats all definitely prefer the cans that are more moist, have a little extra juice. I'll buy it again.

review/summary: Hi-Thor Neo diet for senior CRF cat
review/text: My 18 yr old cat (Mr.Kit T) was diagnosed with CRF and heart problems nearly 5 months ago and was near death.<br /><br />The advise of 3 vets was to put him down.  Vet#4 prescribed antibiotics, Prednisone,and Enapril. The only food advise was have T eat whatever he would eat the most of. He had dropped to under 5 lbs from his usual 9.  For 2+ months human baby food, home made chicken broth, water and Pediasure were all he'd take. T was only eating the baby food if it was hand fed to him, licking one little dab at a time off the tip of my finger.  He refused most other foods after a taste test including the expensive prescription brands.<br /><br />Despite mixed reviews of the Neo diet I decided to try it.<br />T ate 1/3 of the first can all by himself with no prompting. In the past 2 1/2 months he will consistently eat this stuff and has gained a couple pounds. He likes it better when the can is freshly opened. If it has been refrigerated, bringing it up to room temp. & sprinkling 1/2 a crushed PetAg Taurine tablet and 1 Vetri-science Renal Essential tablet on top will get him going. (Note he will not touch it if it has been microwaved even for a second!).  On a good day he can finish 1 1/2 cans but mostly it's 1 can/day.  He now is back to batting paper balls around and the occasional catch-me-if-you-can chase around the house. He still has some problems with hard stools so I also add ~1 1/2 Tbsp cooked oatmeal, 2-3 Tbsp cooked, mashed sweet potato per Week and 1/4 tsp. Kefir live cheese/yogurt ~ every other day.<br /><br />Can't say for sure how much of the change is due to the Neo, drugs or other supplements but since Neo is 95% of his diet, I have to believe it is a major factor.  May not be the same for all cats but it has saved me a lot of time and expense in comparison to the first couple months of this final journey.

review/text: Like others, I found my cats initially interested, but they quickly (a couple of tries) decided that Hi-Tor Neo wasn't for them. For my two kitties with late-stage renal failure, I am working my way through some other commercial cat food options that don't advertise themselves as renal diets, but that have phosphorus and protein levels comparable to those of Neo-tor (which is a little higher than prescription renal diets). There is very valuable updated diet information available at [...] if you are looking for information on the protein and phosphorus content of cat foods (The site provides breakdowns for both canned and dry cat foods). I have found that they prefer the Organix flavors listed there, which have comparably low protein and even lower phosphorus. It is a little more expensive, but you can buy it by the can at local stores to try it-- I've never seen Hi-Tor Neo in a store.

I was so sad and discouraged. I was hoping this was the ticket! So I threw that can away after trying a couple more times. 2 weeks later I decided to give it another shot. She ate it! Now it's all she eats! Not sure what the hold up was but she eats it now! I have been on this streak for 2 weeks now and hope it stays! I gave 4 stars after coaxing, she now eats it and only "likes" it. There us no absolute love in it. I also did what others suggested which was the Vita Gravy. She simply licked all the gravy parts and not the food. Tricky cats. So I then mixed it all together and wouldn't touch. So good luck others!!! Just have to try a few times!!!

review/summary: Change in formula not well received
review/text: Let me start by saying that the seller did an excellent job of packaging the case with not one dented can and it arrived quickly. My cat refused to eat the Purina NF and Hills K/D sold at my vet's office and was willing to starve himself if that was all he was offered. I read many reviews on other sites prior to purchasing and located a site where you can order individual cans. Great as a trial in case my cat refused to eat it. However, that site sent me 6 cans of the old formula and 6 cans of the new formula.  Being new to this brand, I turned to the internet to figure out what had changed. Apparently, the ingredient listings have not been updated for the new formula, even on the manufacter's site.  The new formula lists beef as the primary meat ingredient.<br /><br />My two cats including one that does not have kidney problems were initially enjoying the food, licking their plates clean with a distinct preference towards what turned out to be the old formula. I thought finally I had found a kidney diet that wouldn't end up in the trash. By the time I received the shipment, the attraction had worn off. One of my cats vigorously claws at the floor in an attempt to cover the food dish and the other (diagnosed with kidney disease) runs from the bowl after a few bites. They have gone back to eating regular food for now.  However, I am going to try and mix the more enticing food into the Hi-Tor before I completely give up on it and request a refund, and continue my search.  My local humane society does not retain "special needs" cats or dogs so donating it is out.  On the bright side, this seller has a 30 day return policy.

review/summary: my picky cat ate it.
review/text: my 17 year old cat was put on Hills prescription diet k/d.  she ate it for a month and got sick of it.  now i alternate the two brands and one month later it seems to be going well. I'd recommend getting two brands to alternate since the options are so limited.

review/summary: Not sure if this food is the best option.
review/text: I'm not convinced on this brand yet but we are trying it. A crf cat needs low protein and low phosphorous. The data on this from Tanya's guide for Crf cats shows this has pretty high phosphorous for a renal food.  .72% vs .38% on the K/D. Also has 36% protein vs. 28% with the K/D. Its more equal to senior formula foods than the prescription foods. It might not be the best choice. It does have high fat though vs other brands which is my hope for keeping some weight on my 18 year old crf cat.

review/summary: It's a BIG THUMBS UP!!
review/text: My 12 yr old cat is starting to show signs of kidney involvment; he is also has a thyroid condition common to cats.  And of course, he ranks at the 99th percentile for FINICKY eaters.  Other prescription brands have been a 'no-no' with him.  Imagine my utter surprise when he gobbled up Hi-Tor Neo cat food like it was gourmet wild halibut caught fresh just for him!!  So glad I found a product that is palatible as well as beneficial.

review/summary: Renal kitties are picky
review/text: My kitty with CRF won't eat many of the brands carried by our vet, but this one he'll actually eat ON OCCASION.  So it's really hit or miss. But I'll try anything to keep my boy eating!

review/summary: A food that my kidney failing cat will eat on her own!
review/text: My cat has kidney failure, I couldn't get her to eat on her own so I was force feeding her with wet food mixed with some water to thin it out in a baby medicine syringe.  She HATED it, I cant say I blame her. This is the first food she has willingly eaten on her own in weeks. I have been experimenting with different foods to entice her and nothing has done the trick. All of the research I did made me change how all of my cats are fed now,  they all get Wellness canned food mixed with some dry. My Mama's was having none of it though. As soon as I opened the can of this food she seemed mildly interested - better than her running from because she knows what's coming! Thank you!

review/summary: The cats seem to like it
review/text: I can't say I'm impressed with the look or the texture of the food, but it seems to satisfy my cats. Hills k/d is way too expensive and with some eyebrow raising ingredients (corn), however, my CRF cat needs a low protien/phosphorous diet. When it arrived it seemed to have bits of jelly stuck to the sides of the can which was rather...gross. As far as ingredients go, not the best, but definitely not the worst. Not grain free if you are concerned about giving grains to your cat. At the very least no corn.<br /><br />All in all, it's serving the purpose of feeding my cats until I can find a CRF friendly grain free alternative.

review/summary: CRF Diet
review/text: More palatable than any other CRF food on the market - plus does not require a prescription.  My cat enjoyed it better than any other low phos. catfood, but being a Fancy Feast junky, has not been a cureall all to feeding him. Recommend buying Epakitin to block phoshorus levels in regular food if your CRF pet won't eat in addition to Hi-Tor.

review/summary: Our cat doesn't like this food, and the ingredients are very iffy
review/text: I'm not really sure what I was thinking when I bought this food, except that I was freaking out about my cat being diagnosed with chronic renal failure. The ingredients in this food are really not something I would normally even consider feeding to our cats, but like I said, I was freaking out! Usually cats like crappy canned food, so I figured, what the hell and opened a can. Not only did our chronic renal failure cat turn his nose up, but so did the other 3 cats. Oh, well! I'm sure it's better than any of Hill's Science Diet products, Purina anything, or Royal Canin's prescription diet, but not by very much.

review/summary: She likes it - MIKEY likes it!
review/text: Remember the old cereal commercial about MIKEY?  Well, my CRF cat isn't named Mikey, but it's still as shocking that she likes it!  At first, neither of my cats, the CRF cat nor the healthy one - cared for this food.  However, now that she's feeling a bit better with a holistic vet, she and healthy brother LOVE this food.  Little miss picky is eating it with gusto.  I am one that believes that the low protein diet for cats is never a good thing (dogs yes, cats no).  So most times I mix this with something like another high protein cat food, or human canned tuna - to bump up the protein count.  The controversy with the protein levels for CRF animals is basically in a nutshell, dogs are NOT carnivores as are cats, thus low protein is good for them with CRF - but cats ARE carnivores and require protein (and fairly high amounts at that) to live healthy.  So, this is a great mixer food for her, and as long as she'll eat it, I'll give it to them both.  Thanks NEO for a nice juicy food that tickles her fancy!

review/summary: You bought what???
review/text: That's what wifey said when I told her that I had ordered "gourmet" squirrel brand peanut butter from amazon.<br /> I put the two jars in the refer and today I made a couple of your basic PB and J sandwiches to give it a go. This stuff is top shelf amazing. How so? It sat in the refrigerator for two days and came out of the jar smooth as silk. You know what usually happens to p'butter when it chills. It turns into the consistency of concrete that hasnt quite set yet. Try to spread it out on bread or something and it tears the surface up and turns your snack into something that you eventually toss to the dog. The flavor was intense but not "earthy" tasting. Went down like a fine wine. Ok, thats overkill, but you get the idea. I never thought I would do a review on Peanut butter but this version was deserved. Damn good, a fair price and certainly up for a re-buy when I burn through the two jars I have. It wont take long either. I go through a lot of the stuff..

review/summary: *CRACK*-er jack
review/text: I should be embarrassed to admit this but I had to stop ordering this because I ate four bags in one day; this is NOT normal behavior for me. Now I know how crack addicts feel.<br /><br />I *would* like to recommend 479* because this is the BEST caramel corn EVER, but alas I cannot because of the inherent possibility of winding up a co-conspirator in anyone else's resulting addiction
