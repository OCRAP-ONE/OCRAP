review/summary: Good, not great.
review/text: If you're looking for what they serve you at most Thai restaurants, this tastes like it.  The instructions on the back of the package seem off so I took matters into my own hands. I used 1 tablespoon of the tea to 2 cups boiling water. Once the water was boiling I let it steep for about 5 minutes before I poured it into a fine mesh strainer lined with a coffee filter. It is a rather dusty tea so that's why I used the coffee filter.  As for the sugar, I find that's a rather subjective thing.  I put two tablespoons in with the two cups of water.  With a bit of sweetened condensed milk and that got the sweetness right for me.<br /><br />However as other reviewers have mentioned, this does have a slight artificial flavor. Not enough to keep me from enjoying this bag but when this bag is done I think I'll be trying a different brand.  I'd like to try something a bit more fuller flavored and natural tasting.

review/summary: Almost there
review/text: This was my first attempt at making Thai Iced Tea, so some fault may lie with the maker and not this tea itself.  I boiled the tea in a pot, adding sugar, and strained out the leaves, following directions I found on many Thai websites and youtube videos.  While this tea itself is a lighter color than others, it tasted far darker than I expected.  Thai Iced Tea from restaurants often tastes earthy, but my wife simply said that this tea tastes like coffee. It is good enough, but at least the way we prepared it didn't give us the full effect of a restaurant style tea.

review/summary: It is what it is
review/text: If you like thai iced tea from your local thai joint this is most likely what your getting.  Its easily available, relatively cheap and mild so it appeals to more people.  The difference may be in what they add to it or how strong they brew it.  Some places may add all or some of these spices cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom or star anise to the brewing.  Tamarind was originally what made thai tea orange.  Traditional Thai tea is actually a black tea(also called red tea in most asian countries but in the US its called black think Earl grey or most breakfast teas are black)<br /><br />If your brewing for a 2 quart pitcher heres my preferences- I used 6tbsp of tea.  Brought my water to a boil dumped the 6T directly into the water off heat and gave it a good stir.  Steep 5 min or so while I set up my filter.  I used a standard coffee filter in a strainer over my pitcher.  Try not to pour the tea grounds into the filter to reduce sediment in the final product.  I add 1/2 cup sugar to the pitcher of hot tea(this is because I also use sweetened milk use 1c if using evap milk or half and half).  Be sure to stir well then chill thoroughly.  Pouring over ice while hot dilutes the tea too much and makes it weak, youll be disappointed as thai tea is supposed to be strong and concentrated.  I use a 16oz cup filled to top with ice.  fill to 1" from top with cold tea then add about 1tablespoon of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPB9A">La Lechera Sweetened Condensed Milk, 15.8-Ounce Squeeze Containers (Pack of 4)</a> then add more if needed for personal preference.  I suggest experimenting with the spices I mentioned above.  Use whole spice pods not powder give them a whack to help release the flavors but dont pulverize them.<br /><br />Using filtered water is also a must!!!  If you use funky chlorinated tasting tap water your tea will also taste chlorinated and just not as good as it could be.<br /><br />4 stars just because Im sure the amount of food coloring isnt the best for you.  Id prefer to buy this without it if it existed but given that this is a treat and not an everyday thing I'll live with it.

review/text: I knew it has food coloring before I purchased it but I didn't think it has that much of it.<br /><br />I had several drops of tea on my hand and it made my hand so orange and it is difficult to get rid of.<br /><br />The taste is not too bad but I feel like drinking chemicals after that.<br /><br />Also it has a lot of fine dust of tea that go thru the drainer.( The drainer is pretty fine.) So I can see the dark deposit at the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />I will buy another brand next time.

review/text: The tea tastes great! It has a flavor just like at the Thai restaurant I went to in college. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the leaves are so tiny that they go right through my mesh tea strainer. If you buy this tea I recommend using a paper filter to keep your tea free of tiny leaf debris.

review/summary: This is the STUFF!!!
review/text: I have searched high and low and this is the stuff! Just steep with boiling water, strain and add a little sugar. Chill and then add milk and voila! Iced tea!<br /><br />I use half the sugar called for on the package - using all of it resulted in an almost syrupy texture to the chilled tea, which was too sweet for me. I suspect pouring hot sweetened tea on ice and then adding milk would probably solve the problem, but I chose to adjust on the steeping end and not have to add ice.

review/summary: Tastes just like the stuff at restaurants..
review/text: I discovered Thai tea at a renaissance festival 7 years ago.  I've been hooked ever since.  I take my 8 year old out once a week  to get this stuff.  Needless to say,  these $4.50 glasses of tea every week start to burn a hole in your pocket so I wanted to try and make this at home.  It came yesterday and my daughter wouldn't leave me alone till I made it.  So we brewed some in a coffee press.  The instructions say 4 Tbsp for 8 oz water but I used 4 Tbsp for 16 oz water.  Added plain coffee creamer (just like my favorite Thai restaurant uses) and some sugar.  Tasted just like the stuff we get at the restaurant.  I will definitely be buying this again, very pleased!

review/text: I was really hesitant to purchase this at first because I thought it would be a lot of work; however, this has become a staple in my home. Really easy to make and tastes like the Thai iced tea I order at my favorite Thai restaurant but for a lot less money. You basically put the tea in a an infuser and let it steep. If you don't have an infuser like I didn't at first, pour the tea directly into a pot of boiling water and then pour it over a coffee filter into a pitcher. Add condensed milk to taste and place in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Voila...done! Pretty easy, right?

review/summary: Tastes artificial!
review/text: I was willing to give this a chance even after reading that scathing review by another poster, but I wish I had just listened in the first place.<br /><br />Without adding cardamom or cloves, I made the tea as per the instructions and steeped it for 15 minutes. After cooling it down some, I made my first glass and sipped. Hmm... weird. I sipped again. Yep, this definitely tastes artificial. That distinct thai tea flavor was there, but I felt like I had drank something that my body didn't like. This manifested most strongly in the form of a strange aftertaste, part Thai Tea (on the surface)  and part VERY strong cheap chemically-treated green tea, which I had never experienced in any Thai restaurant.<br /><br />This tea mix is okay if you're not too picky, but I would rather do without the aftertaste and the rigorous processing and manufacturing it reminds me of.

review/summary: Authentic Thai Tea
review/text: Great taste, the same kind of Thai Tea that you would expect from any Thai Restaurants. Use the amount of tea leaves and water per instruction. I added more sugar during the steeping process than what it calls for. You may also want to use half Splenda and half sugar if you are worried about calories (Per the instruction, it calls for 3 tsp of sugar per 8oz of tea). Once you are done steeping it for 5 mins, use a cloth strainer to separate the tea leaves and tea. Wait for it to cool. You can brew a bigger batch, keep the rest in the refrigerator and drink it whenever you feel like it. Pour the tea into a glass filled with ice, leaving a little room and topped it off with half and half. Enjoy!!!

review/summary: woodsy, mild
review/text: I LOVE thai iced tea but at $3.50 a cup, it gets really expensive, especially when you want to drink A LOT of it in one sitting.  So I tried this brand after looking at the reviews and I have to agree with other reviewers that it looks dusty with "dirt" in it and it tastes "woodsy."  I'm not the type of person who thinks everything that's natural has to be "sanitized" away from dirt, insects, pesticides, etc. (considering that nature is by its definition "wild"), but I really hadn't expected to see just HOW natural it looked and felt and tasted like, (natural like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TAE0RK">Dudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count</a> which is ill-formed and has a muddy dark texture/look.)  Like other reviewers said, this thai iced tea has a lot of orange dye.  The taste takes some getting used to but it definitely grows on you.  The taste is not bold but I still like the mild taste once cooled, especially with condensed or evaporated milk.

review/summary: Cheapest Wasabi on Amazon - yet still (amazingly) overpriced!
review/text: Boy was this a mistake!  Ordered two bottles of this stuff.  It's not as dry as the wasabi one normally gets in a sushi place.  Guess they had to add more vinegar to get it to squirt out the ultra cheap "bottle".  In truth, the "bottle" is more like a plastic bag.<br /><br />I like a fair bit of wasabi on my sushi, a bit more than the standard amount some folks would put on.  When I use the amount to get the heat I like from this brand, it makes my sushi taste sour!  I think it might be the vinegar or whatever other thining agent they use.  Regardless, this is a poor imitation of wasabi (yeah I know, most of the stuff is just basically dyed horseradish, but this stuff is not even that good).<br /><br />OTOH it does pack a punch.  It might even be slightly hotter than normal.

review/summary: it ain't starbucks but it's cheap and it works
review/text: Why do I like these?  They are cheap, convenient, ORGANIC, decaf, and tasty.  You can buy Starbucks VIA for $1/packet or you can buy this whole box for $.20/packet.<br /><br />Now, instant coffee will never taste like fresh brewed beans, no matter what.  I think it tastes fine; it's alot better than the office sludge at my company.  I like instant coffee because it's portable and only requires hot water.  I have a water cooler at home and can brew up a cup in two seconds.  Plus I don't have to make 4 cups of coffee just to drink 1 cup (you know you can't brew small batches in those coffeemakers!)<br /><br />I only drink decaf and it's actually kinda hard to find decaf in any form... certain coffeehouses stop brewing it after 12pm, which means an afternoon cup for me has to come from somewhere else.  That's why I picked up these to have on my desk at work.  It's my second cup of coffee for the day AND it prevents me from dolling out $2 every time I need a cup of coffee.  I use 3 packets per 20 oz of hot water since I like my coffee strong.  It averages to $.60/cup.<br /><br />It's not going to completely replace my coffee habit, but it's a good way to have a decent budget and works in a pinch.  It almost never goes bad-- the expiry on my box says 11.6.17 (which is either in two years or 8 years depending how u read the date) so you don't have to worry about it spoiling or oxidizing.  Overall, I'll continue to order this and have it ready.

review/summary: You get what you pay for.
review/text: I've never been a fan of instant coffee, but after trying Starbucks "via" I thought the industry had made some major advances in taste!  Alas, it appears that it's really just Starbucks that has figured out how to do instant coffee a better way, while everyone else continues with mediocre product.  I was hoping that this would be an organic and less expensive alternative to Starbucks via -- and now have 97 more cups of this coffee to make before I can get back to what I really like!  I don't know what process Sbucks uses or why the other companies can't follow suit, but there is a world of difference.  This Mount Hagen instant decaf tastes marginally better than Folgers or whatever other instant brand you'd buy in a jar -- but it's bitter and has a sharp sweet taste that does not appeal to me.  No body whatsoever.  They say that they use 100% Arabica beans, just like Sbucks, so it must be something to do with the processing.<br /><br />Maybe I will find some other use for all this coffee -- folded into a cake or milkshake or something it might not be too bad?!?  But I don't really see myself enjoying this every morning -- it just makes me crave the good stuff all the more.

review/text: This is really good coffee. My family and I can't even tell that it is instant or even decaf. Since it is organic, it seems that it is much smoother than non-organic, but tasting just as strong as normal coffee. Someone said that they didn't think it was better than Starbucks via, but I think it is a ton better. Starbucks via has that grainy taste because they actually use grounds in their instant coffee, but not with freeze dried. Again, this coffee is really good!

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: Did some comparison taste testing and this came out on top.  Organic and great flavor without the caffeine.  No surprise that Amazon is far cheaper than Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods) and far cheaper than starbucks Via. You'd think that making instant coffe is intuitive. There is a another counter intuitive way.  Many decades ago a young Greek gentlemen in Athens showed a way to make instant coffee that is still my preferred method.  Maybe because I grew up in London I prefer to boil my water on a stove top over nuking it.  While the water heats mix the instant coffee, granulated sweetener of choice (Splenda for me) and if using a non dairy creamer powder that as well into a thick paste with a little of the water that is heating.  Then when the water achieves a rolling boil pour into the cup and stir.  This method results in a nice foam (creama) on top that just pouring water on the coffee granules and then adding sweetener and creamer will not achieve.  Enjoy.

I don't have that effect with Mount Hagen. Sometimes I drink these all day when I don't have convenient access to freshly brewed. For instant, Mount Hagen is excellent.

review/summary: Anorexic Cat
review/text: I have a cat that is 5 years old and had stayed around 5 pounds for years.  She was literally only eating enough to stay alive.  All my other cats are in the 12 to 15 pound range.  My husband and I had consulted several doctors and tried many different approaches and types of food to get her to eat.  One day, out of extreme frustration, I went out and purchased at least 30 different wet and dry foods to see if there was anything on the market I could get her to eat.  I laid out all of the foods, at once, in a room and left her in the room for a couple of hours.  When I came back this was the only food she had eaten all of.  I have been feeding her this food for months and she is now a much healthier 8 pounds.  She seems to like all the wet varieties except for the egg souffl&eacute;s.  (She won't touch the dry variety of this food.)  I would absolutely recommend this food to anyone with picky cat!

I love that the coconut oil is organic, I love the size of the jar, and I even love the jar, which I use for storing various gardening and kitchen tools and products after I run out. Use this oil for all cooking, especially any cooking that requires high heat, like pan frying. Vegetable oils have a low smoke point, meaning that they start releasing toxins after you heat them up past a certain point. Not so with coconut oil, which remains safe and delicious at high temperatures.

They taste very "raw" (can't think of a better word for it) and, no matter how long you soak them in milk, they never seem to soften even slightly. These may be pluses for some people, but if you're looking for an organic Cheerio replacement, as I was, you'd be better off with "Barbara's Bakery Organic Breakfast O's Cereal" (also sold on Amazon, though priced higher per oz.).

review/text: I am obsessed with these Os. You will never - no, never - return to regular old General Mills Cheerios, because there's no comparison. For the review who found these "too crunchy"  - - you're wrong. They're the perfect specimen of what a breakfast (-lunch, -dinner) cereal should be.

review/text: I've loved this cereal for many years.  They are like Cheerios, but stay crunchie in milk.  I used to buy it at Whole Foods, but they quit selling it in these Eco Pacs.  I start every morning with a bowl of this cereal and fruit.  My two dogs also get some of this cereal every morning.  It helps keep us healthy, since it is full of fiber.

review/summary: Crunchy is a good thing.
review/text: This cereal is super crunchy but it sure beats soggy soup, which is what most cereals turn into after a couple of minutes in milk.  It also makes a great pick-me-up dry snack when you're craving something crunchy, but don't want all the calories and sodium of most chips/crackers/pretzels.  The flavor is mild, kind of along the lines of cheerios, but better in my opinion (since I go through a 2lb. bag of Heritage O's a week).  Whole grain, organic, low sodium, breaks all stay-crunchy records... what else could you ask for in an O's cereal?<br /><br />One word of caution though.  This cereal may cause those close by to complain of the crunching noise you emit while eating it.

review/summary: WoW, I finally found it!
review/text: Remember "Raw Bits", that cereal sponsor for the "Prairie Home Companion"?  The one made from "oat hulls and wheat shafts"? By George I think I've found it! YES!!! This is  the number one most crunchy thing on the planet, which is edible. I've not broken a tooth yet, but my ears still ring from eating it. And I tried to like it. At first I thought I liked it. Later I thought I hated it. Then I decided that I was missing the point; "Raw Bits" is not about flavor, it's about commitment, it's about doing the right thing, it's about put up and shut up. Think about your Norwegian Bachelor Farmer ancestors, for gosh sakes! Do you suppose that they whined about their cereal not "tasting good enough"?  Of course not!<br /><br />Eating Heritage O's/Raw Bits gives shy people the courage to get up and do what needs to be done!<br /><br />(Now could someone please help me find those tasty and expeditious "Powder Milk Biscuits"?)

review/summary: ORGANIC CEREAL
review/text: The bagged Natures Path Organic cereal is a superior product made with pure ingredients.  The only problem is UPS sometimes leaves the box without making sure I'm home and the product sits in the extremely hot sun.  Sometimes the box is hot even if I am home which leads me to believe UPS is not keeping it cool enough in the truck and/or storage.  So far it hasn't seemed to harm the cereal but it has harmed a Horizon milk product I recently bought.  These food products should have better handling by UPS.

They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar (but still are quite sweet), no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: excellent loose tea
review/text: I had never heard of Yellow Label. I was looking for Lipton Loose Leaf, which is difficult to find in markets. Ordered this from (fulfilled by) Amazon to check it out. It is a 'gunpowder' style and tastes better than regular Lipton Loose. A smaller gunpowder than you find in gourmet tea stores, but an excellent tea at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Very potent
review/text: First time I brewed it, I measure the amount of tea by guessing from the way I measure green tea. The result was way too strong tea that stained the inside of my white cup. After a bit of experiment, I ended up with microscopic amount of tea per cup. If I could measure it on my scale, it'll be like less than 0.1gram. Compare to this, I use 0.5 gram of green tea per 8oz cup. I think this one pound box will last for years to come.<br />The taste is nothing fancy but what a good tea is supposed to taste like, then again I'm not a gourmet drinker, otherwise I'll be reviewing something else with higher price. It's good enough for me for every day use.<br />The tea in the dry state looks like round pellet, which is easier to control the amount when you scoop up.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone specially who hasn't tried loose tea in a while. I also recommend Finum brewing basket to go with this. Little things that make your life a bit more enjoyable.

review/summary: Great tea flavor and a really good money value
review/text: Lipton Yellow Label tea is very concentrated -- you don't have to use a large quantity to get excellent flavor. This makes for a good money value, as you extract maximum taste from small proportions of leaves. This version of Lipton tea reminds me of how Lipton's used to taste -- a good , traditional,  Pekoe flavor. In recent years, I feel Lipton has declined in quality in their bagged tea, but this loose Lipton's is much closer to the "good old days." <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTRGAQ">Lipton Yellow Label Loose Tea, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: I make the best brewed iced tea with this yellow label Lipton tea. I make it by the gallon using the same amount as regular loose teas. I only add 1/4 cup of sugar per gallon. This tea has quickly replaced soda and tastes even better. After opening, I transfer the entire contents into a glass container (not plastic) with a metal screwed lid to keep the air out. We love this tea and hope Amazon keeps carrying it.

review/summary: Pricey, but durable flavor
review/text: Although the Roland oil contains the artificial truffle essence (don't be fooled by that little dried mushroom in the bottom of the bottle) most of us don't have sophisticated enough palates to tell the difference when it comes to the small quantities you use in food.  My complaint with a lot of truffle oils is that the flavor doesn't last in the time it takes to serve the dish.  Not so with the Roland.  It is more expensive than some of the other brands, but the flavor is pungent enough that you can use less than you might with some other brands, and it is definitely longer lasting.  I would still like to know why a lab-generated taste/odor seems to be just as expensive as an elusive fungus, but I guess good perfumes are pretty pricey too.

review/summary: Chemical taste
review/text: Wow, I  didn't like it at all.  Maybe it's just my palate, but I found the taste of Roland's White truffle oil to be extremely "chemically".<br />Roland makes a really good balsamic vinegar, so that's why I decided to try their truffle oil.<br />Now I have never had truffles before or any kind of truffle oil, but as soon as I dribbled a tiny bit of this in my homemade mushroom risotto, it was<br />extremely overpowering with a chemical odor/flavor.<br /><br />After I tasted it, I went online to research further and found out that most (not all) of the truffle oils are made with petroleum and other<br />chemicals.  I just googled "truffle oil tastes chemical"  and found some articles about making it with chemicals.<br /><br />Since I bought it in a 2 pack, I would love to return the unopened bottle, but there is a "no return" policy.  I still want to try white truffle oil, so<br />I'm ordering another brand that is not made with chemicals.<br />This is just my opinion and others seem happy so .... best of  luck.
