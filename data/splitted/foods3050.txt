review/summary: A very nice chew toy.
review/text: My dog MoJo love his deer antler. He chews on it a lot, and if he's not chewing on it, he's carrying it around. He doesn't seem to have done much damage to it in the month he's had it. Usually he destroys things in a couple of hours. If you've never gotten your dog an antler, here is the scoop- they don't make a mess, don't smell, are all natural and no deer are harmed in obtaining the antlers. They fall off the deer each year, and are cleaned and sanitized before they are sold. Our dog is very large so we get him the giant size, but smaller sizes are availble for smaller dogs.

review/text: Although the product tastes good the actual item is extremely stale and what I received was one lump of almost completely dry........well, candy. It is impossible to actually eat it as complete "strings" because it is all stuck together in one dry mound. Tastes good but I will never buy from this vendor again because they are not selling fresh items. Has to be multiple years old.

review/summary: Loved this product (looks like I may be alone)
review/text: I have never been one to buy chicken in a can (quite a foodie most days), but my sister recommended it for chicken salad and I'm glad.  It did not taste like fresh roasted chicken, but in reality I wasn't expecting it to.  I've had a lot of BAD chicken salads from various locations that I couldn't bear to eat because of the really bad chicken flavor. With a gourmet chicken salad recipe, this chicken is great, but I guess, if it is mixed with little more than mayo it would be pretty bland.  I admit it...I'm looking for somewhat bland flavor in my canned chicken.  For me I'm just glad it doesn't add any bad flavor to my chicken salad.  And yes, if you want to cook your own chicken that's great and the best route, but if you want something easy I recommend this chicken in a can.  I mean, really...it's canned chicken what do you expect?<br /><br />My Recipe:  3 cans chicken, 5 celery, 1 small Onion, fresh lemon juice (2 lemons), 2 1/2 cups red grapes, 2/3 cup pecans & (salt, pepper, celery seed, fresh parsley & mayo to taste).

review/summary: Just opening the can was unbearable
review/text: The smell of this product once the can is open is terrible. Its worse than bad tuna fish and even drained the meat smells the same. I left a half can in my refrigerator overnight and could barely stand opening the door because that terrible smell would wiff out into the kitchen. I would not serve this to friend or enemy. If you are set on eating it anyway, mash the big chunks up and douse it with lots of pepper,garlic & onion powder because it tastes like stinky mummy meat (yes, it is bland in a really awful way). Make sure you cook it. Save yourself money and do not buy this product.

review/summary: Cheap, Lean Protein
review/text: After marveling at some of the previous reviews, I felt as if it were my duty to leave a good comment about one of my favorite lunch products: Member's Mark Canned Chicken. From my local Sam's Club, this package costs $9.98, just under $2 per can. At approximately 300 kcal of pure, lean protein, this deal is phenomenal. My daily lunch consists of a can of this wonderful chicken on top of a bed of spinach topped with a low-calorie balsamic vinaigrette with a handful of almonds. This healthy, 500 kcal lunchtime feast costs under three dollars, and anyone who's not a ravenous teenager or professional bodybuilder will find it quite filling. Please tell me how you can prepare a healthier meal of meat and vegetables in three minutes before heading to work in the morning, because I'd love to know.<br /><br />Yes, it is bland. IT IS CANNED, PRESSURE COOKED CHICKEN BREAST. DO YOU EXPECT IT TO TASTE SOMETHING LIKE YOU'D SEE ON THE FOOD NETWORK? ADD SOME SPICES AND CALL IT A DAY, YOU SPOILED HUMAN BEING.

review/summary: bland, overpriced
review/text: First of all, you can get this same item (5-13 oz cans) for less than $10 at Sam's Club, so this product is ridiculously overpriced, even if you factor in free shipping.  Secondly, as another reviewer pointed out, this chicken is extremely bland, in fact I think it is the most bland chicken imaginable.  It just tastes like nothing.  I honestly use it for dog treats.  It works great for this purpose.  For some reason my dogs will not eat specially made "dog treats", no matter what kind I try to use.  This stuff though is bland and lean enough that it works great as a dog treat.

review/summary: No taste, very bland.....
review/text: I was excited to find this product at Sam's Club.  I purchased it with plans to make cold chicken salad with it.  I opened two cans, drained the liquid and added chopped celery, salt, pepper and mayonaise.  This has to be the blandest food I have ever tasted.  No matter what I did, I couldn't taste the chicken.  The cans came with recipes for cooked chicken dishes but I can't imagine that the chicken has any more flavor cooked than it does cold and straight out of the can.  If you love good chicken flavor in your chicken salad, buy the chicken and cook it yourself because you won't get it with this product.

review/summary: Ready to heat Indian food
review/text: Not a western tasting entree by any stretch but a very good Indian vegetarian curry. Kinda hot but very tasty, especially the big chunks of mushrooms.  The pouch does not contain what I would call a full meal (but says 3 servings= no womder Indians are so slim)but served over a bowl of fresh rice with a salad does the trick.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add some tofu and see how that works.  I'll bet it turns out great.  Itsmells so good that the house carries the aroma for a long time.<br />I cut open the pouches and nuke it in a covered larger bowl to leave room for rice.  I.d buy this again.

review/summary: Beware of the dust
review/text: I bought a large bag of Celluclay for my children's school projects.  It has come in handy.  It stores well and is as easy to mold as Play-doh.  Depending on the size of the projects, the 5 pound bags will last a long time.<br /><br />My son's first project was to make an Indian grinding hole, which was basically a rock with a hole.  This was easy and quite authentic looking.  His next project is to cover a newspaper doll.  His classmate used paper mache and he's using Celluclay.<br /><br />A few things to remember and consider: Don't add too much water or the project will take forever and a day to dry.  My son's rock took more than a week to dry.  Also, mix it outside and use a dust mask.  It is extremely lightweight and powdery.  I made the mistake of not using a dust mask the first time I mixed it and accidentally inhaled the dust.  It's awful.  No matter how carefully water is added and how slowly it is mixed, the dust is everywhere.  I think there ought to be a warning label.  My lungs are still suffering the after effects.

I quickly became used to it.  I even have my Grandkids loving it.  Now you have changed the ingredients again and not for the better.  It is not good....less fat, more salt = less flavor.  It now looks more creamy, the prior recipe was more broth like.  In my head broth is healthier than cream.  And where is that wonderful tiny little acini di pepe pasta.  These big hunkin noodles don't work for me.  I'm so disappointed!!!"<br />If Campbell's contacts me I will tell them to check out the reviews on Amazon.

review/summary: Campbell's Select Italian Wedding Soup is BETTER than mmmm mmmm good!!!!
review/text: A friend of mine got a care package last month from his sister - she always sends him some hard-to-find specialty food items that companies, like Campbell's Soup, make that aren't usually stocked unless you ask your grocer to special order the product.  Stuff like Pilot Oyster Crackers, Nutella and Ovaltine.  One of the things he got was Campbell's Italian Wedding Soup (I think it comes in the regular condensed type and the much better Select version (less salt, more sausage, just-right non-slimy spinach). A dear friend of my late mother, Aunt Lo, who is Italian, used to make it and she taught mny mom, English-Scots ancestry, how to make it, as well as Lasagne al Forno, Fettuccine Verdi ai Quatro Formaggi,etc.  So, my friend heated up two cans of this great soup:  nicely flavored broth (not salty, but you can add your own salt, but remember:  once it's in, you can't take it out, if you pur in too much), lovely little dumpling-like pasta spheres, just right wilted spinach and lots of wonderful pieces of Italian sausage redolent of sage and other savory herbs.  With a side salad, some iced tea and fruit for dessert it was a perfectly delicious lunch.  So, I just had to get some. None of the grocery stres in Seattle carried it and the Italian specialty stores acted like I was the type of person who would put Kraft Parmesan Cheese (from the green tube container) on Spaghetti-O's and call it "Eye-talian" when I asked if they stocked or would special order Campbell's Select Italian Wedding Soup for me.  So, when I discovered that Amazon.com has grocery items to order, I did like you do with Google:  did a search just for the hell of it, and they had it.  I ordered a "case" of 12 cans and have about one a month as a special treat.  Excellent soup; with my cheap Amazon Prime delivery it works out for way less than I could get at the grocery store.  Nice thing about canned items is that they are shelf stable for a long, long time, require no refrigeration (low carbon imprint green bonus) and the can is recylable (another green plus).  But that's just feel good stuff.  What really counts is this soup is better than mmmmm,mmmmm good.  Now:  mangia tutte! (with apologies for my poor Berlitz School tourist Italian).

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: This is my favorite chole spice mix.  I follow the pressure cooker instructions on the package which are somewhat different than the instructions on other brands.  Most brands suggest cooking the chickpeas separately and then adding them to the tomato/spice mixture.  With this, the instructions tell you to add the tomato/spice mixture to the pressure cooker along with the uncooked soaked chickpeas and pressure cook them together.  My experience is that the final result is much, much more flavorful and the chickpeas have a nicer consistency to them.  I have tried several different brands of Indian spice mixes available at my local Indian grocery store and I consistently find the MDH brand mixes to be my favorites.

review/summary: Convenient, liked by my cats, but expensive.
review/text: I have always fed my cats Wellness, and have started feeding them these pouches in addition to cans and dry food.  With the latter two, I have the option of buying larger sized packages which reduces the cost per pound by up to 50% over the smaller sized packages.  But the only sized pouches available are the 3 oz. ones.  I have two cats and usually feed two 3 oz. pouches at a time.  A more economically priced 6 oz. pouch would be ideal.  Until then, I will buy these sparingly in favor of the more economical "dog food" sized cans.

review/text: I got this tea to fill up my Super Saver $25, but I was still slightly disappointed with this product.  Mango tea is my favorite kind of tea, but this tea has a sort of cheap artificial flavor to it that makes it seem pretty mediocre.  This tea isn't bad; the black tea that was used is fine and overall it tastes kind of sweet with suggestions of mango flavor, but the cheap artificial flavoring that was used leaves a bit of a plastic aftertaste that accumulates as you drink.  It is fine in small doses, but I have had much better tea.

If you do make these, beware when you dump the mix into the bowl--it's very "dusty" and the cayenne will irritate your nose!

review/summary: Worst ever
review/text: I was recently "forced" into purchasing this brand by the apparent coffee pod shortage (what's up with that anyway?). I started out with Senseo, which was fine and when Amazon stopped stocking them I switched to a Fair Trade brand. It was OK, although the quality of the coffee and the pods seemed pretty variable.  When the Fair Trade brand disappeared, I ended up going with the Melitta. They are horrible. About 20% of the pods are defective and the coffee simply spills out of the plastic packet when you open it. The coffee (if that is what it is, I'm not actually sure) tastes terrible. It tastes like bargain brand instant coffee. It is so bad I'm considering throwing them away (I still have several boxes) if I can find a decent alternative.

This time, water spewed out the side of the machine.  I stopped it, and tried using the double-pod holder.  Now I got frothy mostly clear liquid, but nothing I would call coffee.<br /><br />These were donated to some other poor sap to use.  I'm going back to the regular Senseo Sumatra packs, at least those are drinkable, this Melitta brand wasn't even drinkable if I could figure out a way to get it to not blow up my machine!

review/summary: A Fantastic Cuppa Joe!
review/text: I think I may have tried just about every major brand of pod coffee available.  Some are good, some just OK, and some can only be described as bilge water.  I've wanted to try the Melitta One brand for quite some time, but they never seemed to be in stock.  When I finally was able, I gave Buzzworthy a try, and I have to say, I'm not disappointed in the least.  This particular roast is strong, aromatic, heady and a real pleasure to the palate.  Being a fuller pod, it fits much better in the double pod holder - don't forget to wet the bottom of the pod before pushing it firmly into the holder.  This seems to do the trick, with consistent, dark, rich cups of coffee being rewarded each time.  I feel this coffee is at least as high a quality and flavorful as Wolfgang Puck's strongest brews, so give Melitta a try if you like Puck's product (I do). Buzzworthy is a much more cost effective cuppa Joe without sacrificing anything in the taste or caffeine department.

review/summary: Works For Senseo
review/text: After Senseo stopped making pods, thought my precious Senseo machine was to become obsolete! Very relieved to find these pods, but confused based on the reviews: some said the pods fit the machine, other said they don't. The pods DO fit: one pod fits into the two-cup pod holder. However, running a "mug"-sized cup through just one pod yielded terribly weak, thin coffee. Awful. So, my solution has been to run a "cup"-sized portion through one pod, then put in a new pod and run another, to add up to one mug-sized cup of coffee. The result is not at all bitter, and while it's strong enough for me, those who like nuclear-strength coffee will probably not be impressed. Agree with others: the individually-wrapped pods are terribly wasteful. Overall, happy with this product, and will keep the subscription.

review/text: My initial review of this product was glowing, but continuing to use it I have found the product quality to be most inconsistent:  Sometimes the coffee is great then the next cup will be like dishwater.  I'm an analyst by profession but I cannot figure this one out.  Until Melitta can correct the inconsistency in this product, I will not purchase it again.  I'm cancelling my subscription.  Original review:  Recently I have been very disappointed with my Senseo coffee pods which I have been buying for several years. The flavor had become so weakened that I was adding other instant coffee to it to try to produce a robust cup of coffee.  I had even considered replacing my coffee maker. When the Senseo pods were no longer available, I decided, reluctantly, to try these Melita pods as they were more reasonably priced than the other alternatives.  What a pleasant surprise!!  Here's my robust coffee back again!! These pods definitely have more coffee in them because, when I discard them, they are noticeably heavier than were the Senseo pods.  Also, I had to use the larger pod holder that came with my machine because, when wet, the smaller holder would not contain the coffee while brewing.  Another pleasant surprise... these pods are individually wrapped and come in a dispenser box!  Try the subscription (you can select your own delivery interval) and save about $1 per box and get free shipping!  Thank you, Melita and please don't change this product in any way or you will be hearing from me for sure.

review/summary: Great coffee, but doesn't fit Senseo
review/text: This is great tasting coffee, but the pods are too thick for my Senseo.  It's advertised as "Fits all pod brewers".  As another review said, you can wet the pod and squeeze them in the single pod holder, but I don't think it's good for the brewer.  I would highly reccommend them for a different brewer where they fit.

review/summary: decent replacement pods
review/text: These were decent replacement pods for the Senseo one cup coffee maker (like a keurig, but with pods). They didn't fit in the single pod attachment that came with the senseo, they were just too thick; I had to use the 2 pod holder that came with my machine. They're a little small for it, so some cups it works fine, but some cups it just passes around the pod, and gives you just water, so i have to cancel that cup and reseat the pod in the holder, then I usually get a good cup. The coffee is pretty good, I think it's on par with the regular fresh senseo pods. One thing i really like about it is that each pod is held individually in a plastic package, so I feel like the pods will taste fresh longer, where I feel like the senseo pods start tasting stale if you don't use them within a few weeks of opening the pack.

review/text: This coffee was such a dissapointment! I ordered it as a subscribe and save and after going through the first box, I replaced the Melitta coffee pods with Baronet coffee pods. The Melitta pods were never consistent. Sometimes I would get a cup of medium strength coffee from the pod and most times I would get a cup of coffee so weak, you could see the bottom of the coffee mug. For those looking for a coffee pod that gives you a rich and strong cup of coffee, buy the Baronet pods. I LOVE them! Each cup of coffee is consistently strong, flavorful and bold. If you like your coffee strong, you will not be dissapointed!

review/summary: Makes a decent cup
review/text: I was really unsure about ordering these pods, but was very pleased what a good cup of reasonably strong brew I got from it.  It fit into the larger 2-pod holder for my Senseo, but didn't fill the whole well so I was a little dubious about getting a good result.  However, it worked really well and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a strong flavor.  The cost for these pods is about half of what I have to pay for K-cups, but makes a cup that is about 85% as strong.

review/summary: Does NOT fit Senseo
review/text: Although clearly advertised as "fits all pod coffeemakers" it does not fit the Senseo units.  A single pod will go in the double pod holder but not in the single pod holder (too thick).  The outside diameter of the Melita pods is smaller than the Senseo and the result is a weaker brew.  I am stuck with eight boxes of eighteen pods each.  Melita does make a Senseo compatible pod which is sold in grocery stores and is packaged exactly like the Senseo.  These are not the same pods.  Don't buy if you have a Senseo machine.

review/summary: Does a cup of coffee have to be this difficult?
review/text: I had high hopes for these coffee pods.  I typically use Senseo Columbian Coffee Pods in my Melitta single brewer and those were fine, but my grocery store stopped selling them, so I thought I would try these thinking there's more coffee and better beans in each pod so it must be better.  I popped one in my single pod holder and out came some hot light brown water.  Totally confused, I came and read some more Amazon reviews, and read that I should be wetting one side of the pod, placing it in the double pod holder, and pressing firmly in place to get it to brew properly.  I tried this method, and it did help, but it still tastes like water, so something must still not be right.<br /><br />I'm open to suggestions.

review/text: Full confession: I'm one of those people who cannot function without coffee.  We have a Melitta pod coffeemaker at work, and so I order these for my work coffee.  This means that this is the coffee that I drink when I am desperate--either I have not had my first cup, or life has spread me so thin that I need more than one cup to get me going, and this coffee does the job.  It is perfect for work, because of the one-cup, on the go feature; the flavor is also great.  We all prefer a very strong cup and the Buzzworthy fits the bill.  It works for both the cup and the espresso options on the maker, and Amazon makes it easy by offering two packages at a time, delivered straight to your door.  Easy breezy for starting your engines.

review/summary: Tolerable for a pod, but not very strong
review/text: I got these pods for a small pod compatible coffee maker I have in my office. I like strong coffee, so I thought these looked like a good bet. They make a stronger cup then other pods I've tried, but it is still not as flavorful as my regular coffee I make at home. I definitely can't make more than an 8 oz cup with these pods (my machine will let me pour up to 16 oz of water in)or it would just be flavored water.<br /><br />These pods are bigger and fuller than other pods, but it's not getting drastically different results. The price is right though and I'm saving money making my own coffee rather than buying it at the 'Bucks or elsewhere. It is also convenient to use these pods in an single office environment where dealing with coffee grounds is more hassle than it is worth. It just doesn't taste anywhere as good.

review/summary: Melitta One Java pods-Buzzworthy for Senseo People
review/text: Fits the Senseo, use the double pod holder. Grandpa Jarhead likes his coffee on the wimpy side, an old Marine, go figure, he uses 1 Buzzworthy pod on the double cup setting. One pod on the single cup setting on the Senseo coffee maker will give you a right decent cup of coffee, strong with no bitter taste.  These pods don't produce as much "crema" as the senseo pods, they are too thick for the single pod holder and a little too small in circumference in the double pod holder to provide a tight enough seal, the pod paper is more loosely woven and the water flows through a bit too quickly.  Heads up to strong coffee lovers, when I brew these pods the initial flow is usually mostly water. I catch this in a dummy cup and when I see the coffee start to drop I pull the dummy cup and switch it with my coffee cup. It's not perfect for the Senseo, but it will do nicely if you're in a pinch.

review/text: I bought these when Amazon ran out of the Senseo pods; the coffee comes out rather weak. They work a little better if you use 2 at a time, but that defeats the cost effectiveness of buying these, and you can't really triple-up for a taller cup. Also, they are individually wrapped, which I guess is better for "fresher" tasting coffee, but we drink so much coffee it just seems like a waste of packaging.
