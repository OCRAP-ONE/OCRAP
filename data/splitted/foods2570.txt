review/summary: bitter coffee gives me headaches and tastes horrible
review/text: The coffee leaves a bitter aftertaste and I always have to brush my teeth after drinking this coffee. This is the first KCup that I've ever tried that is decaf, but I don't recommend. I always get a headache after drinking this, but continue to drink it just because I don't want to take a loss. If I run out of my regular flavors, I have this as a backup. Before writing this review, I've decided to throw the rest out. My suggestion is to try a flavored coffee, because the caffeine content isn't as high as the other full bodied coffees. As another reviewer mentioned this coffee has methylene chloride which may be the reason I get those headaches. Try at your own risk. A lot of people enjoy this decaf blend, so don't take my word for it. I'm just sharing my experience.

review/summary: Will continue to drink...
review/text: I just got my Keurig 2 weeks ago and absolutely love it!  That being said iv'e been a serious quest to find the coffee(s) that i like. I've had kind of a hard time finding the right decaf.  most decafs have a weak flavor because of the decaffination process. I started with Green Mountain's Hazelnut Decaf.  I thought that the flavor would equal out the weakness of the coffee.  It's just ok and pretty weak.  Once it's gone I wont buy again.  Then I tried Timothy's and it's pretty good.  It has some body to the flavor and doesn't just feel like a watered down hot drink.  The four stars is because it doesn't beat Newmans Own Organic Special Decaf which is a little smoother yet with full flavor. I would probably buy Timothy's again.

review/text: When you have to drink decaf and you live in a small town with limited selection, you learn to not be especially picky.  We love our Keurig brewer, but we were paying premium prices for K-cups at our local grocery store.  We found better deals at the Keurig website, but as I'm always on the lookout for a bargain, I was thrilled to see a medium-roast decaf K-cup that I'd tried and liked, available on Amazon's Subscribe and Save.  The deal is great:  I'm paying less than 40 cents per cup!  This decaf is smooth, mellow, not bitter, and not too dark.  I would imagine that if you prefer a dark roast, you'd find this too weak--but it's perfect for my rather tame taste in coffee.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: made with methylene chloride for your enjoyment
review/text: This product boldly mentions on the package that it is "Decaffeinated using methylene chloride". Read on to learn more about the process.  Coffee beans are decaffeinated by softening the beans with water and using a substance to extract the caffeine. Water alone cannot be used because it strips away too much of the flavor. The water containing the caffeine (and the flavor from the beans) is treated with a solvent, heated to remove the solvent and caffeine, and then returned to the beans. The flavors in the water are reabsorbed by the beans, which are then dried. This process is referred to as "indirect decaffeination," because the beans never touch the solvent themselves. The most widely used solvent today is ethyl acetate, a substance found in many fruits. When your coffee label states that the beans are "naturally decaffeinated," it is referring to this process, specifically using ethyl acetate. Although it doesn't sound like a natural process, it can be labeled as such because the solvent occurs in nature. Other solvents have been used, some of which have been shown to be harmful. One, methylene chloride, has been alleged to cause cancer in humans and therefore is not often used. Back in the 1970s, another solvent, trichloroethylene, was found to be carcinogenic and is no longer used.

review/text: I purchased the 50-count package of the decaffeinated coffee. While the taste is delicious, I found that a number of the k-cups had broken seals that resulted in coffee grounds exploding in the Keurig Brewer. I've spent way too much time cleaning my brewer when this happens and have had to discard at least 20% of the k-cups. The other k-cups that I've purchased and used, e.g. Coffee People's Donut Shop caffeinated coffees have worked flawlessly.<br /><br />When you have to discard that many defective k-cups, its a lousy deal.

review/text: I have purchased these K-Cups for some time now.  Initially the coffee was great and the K-Cups worked flawlessly.  However I've had issues with the last 2 cases that I've purchased.  When they work the coffee is still great.  The problem is Timothy's quality control as it pertains to the manufacturing of the K-Cup itself has become extremely poor.  The filter inside the K-Cup is not secured properly resulting in a tremendous amount of grounds in your cup.  This also serves to clog my Keurig as well.  I use to think that this was the best K-Cup bargain around. Not any more.  Looks like I will be changing brands.  Buyer beware.

I normally don't drink, or like, decaf coffee, but this is pretty good. I'd classify it as "donut shop" coffee in style.  It is medium roast.  Doesn't have the definite "decaf aftertaste" that turns me off of other decaf coffee.<br /><br />Although my goto coffee is the bold Organic, Jetfuel, Wake up call, and Black Tiger, I will drink this if I don't want the coffee buzz later at night.  And, as I wrote earlier, my wife drinks this as her first choice.

I have not experienced this with any of my other Amazon K-cup orders and it is probably just a bad batch of K-cups, but since I have seen other comments about this problem as well, I thought I should add to it to warn customers and hopefully encourage Timothy's to better their quality control.

review/summary: The very BEST decaf K-cups
review/text: We have been enjoying the Timothy's World Colombian Decaf for many months.  It is the best decaf we have found, and we've tried quite a few of them.  The flavor is not bitter, it is a medium flavored roast.  I highly recommend it if you enjoy a nice rounded flavored decaf for your Keurig maker.  The price is much more reasonable than purchasing from the grocery store.  We get a box of 50 monthly through the subscription service, and save even more money that way! Other reviewers have mentioned the K-cups exploding or getting grounds in the cup, we've not had that issue at all and we've subscribed for almost a year.  Thanks Amazon for a great product and wonderful service!

review/text: This Timothy's K-Cup coffee is a great price and we love the taste. If you are leary of a decaf tasting "different" - try Timothy's. Many people comment on the taste even before they know it is decaf. I order enough to get the free shipping and joined the club to get the discount - which makes it an even better deal!!!!<br /><br />Amazon has not failed me yet. I've bought toys, electronics and lots of coffee. I had to return one item and it could not have been simpler - free return shipping and the replacement was perfect and in the mail ASAP.

I use the largest setting and it just right for my taste.

review/text: This coffee tastes amazing. I love the Keurig system overall. The only issue I've had is that sometimes it brews about a third of what its supposed to and a bunch of coffee grounds get into the coffee. I guess it has to do with the needle getting clogged or something. Anyhow, I've only noticed it with the Timothy's Coffee. Can't beat the taste though. Both the decaf and regular are the best tasting coffee I've tried!

review/summary: Best coffee for Keurig
review/text: I was about to give away my Keurig until I encountered this coffee.  All other K-cups, no matter what brand, are simply TOO strong.  Timothy's Decaf is heaven compared to what I have been drinking.  I actually had resorted to buying coffee pods and using a nice holder sold here at Amazon to hold the pods in place so they could be treated like a K-Cup.  So if you have been thinking along the same lines, consider Timothy's.  I have had their regular coffees, my next order will be for full caffeine K-cups from them for my morning cup.  This PM cup of Timothy's decaf is the first good coffee I have had since I purchased a Keurig.

review/summary: Timothy's Decaf columbian for our Keurig is very good
review/text: We tried a variety of decaf cup brands and found Timothy's Columbian to be the best.  We like the bold taste, but it's not too strong, we use the 6 oz of water.  If you like it even less strong you can use the 8 oz of water. We just like the taste. It comes in the 50 Count K-Cups, which makes it really easy for price, storage and shipping.  I schedule my order for every 6 weeks and they arrive automatically, without my having to go in and order every time we're low on k-cups, and the shipping is free.  I can also go into Amazon and check the status to see when my order will be shipped and change the order date if I want it earlier or later.  Excellent coffee, excellent service. We're very happy.

review/text: I drink decaf every evening and Timothy's Columbian decaf is great!  If you want a decaf that has lots of flavor and no bitterness, this is the one for you.

review/text: I purchased Timothy's Decaf Coffee for my husband. He tried a sample and thought it was  excellent. Now wants to buy Timothy's regular coffee. We have a k-cup coffee maker and the price for this coffee thru Amazon was a good buy.

review/text: I received this coffee initially in a sample packet that came with my Keurig and loved it so I had to order more from Amazon.  The coffee has a wonderful aroma when it is being brewed.  It has a medium bodied taste.  To me it's that perfect mid range of not too weak or too strong but still has plenty of flavor, not bitter tasting at all.  I drink decaf at night.  I plan to order this coffee as regular for my morning cup.

review/summary: My favorite K-cup
review/text: This is really good coffee. I tried it initially when it was one of the only decaf K-cups, and I've stuck with it despite more options now being available. I had never heard of Timothy's coffee before buying this, but think it has the best taste. It has just the right amount of flavor and strength. (And it doesn't have any hint of a "burnt" taste, which is something I can't stand.) I also can't tell that it's decaf.<br />Another reviewer of one of the flavors of K-cups indicated that K-cups were more expensive on Amazon than elsewhere. I have actually found Amazon to be far LESS expensive than any other retailer, online or in store. You get about double the K-cups for the same price. Less than $0.45 a cup is quite reasonable; plus, we sometimes use the same K-cup to make two cups.

review/summary: It's not bad but I wouldn't order it again
review/text: I ordered this based on the positive reviews but I can't say it was that great. It tasted like a regular cup of coffee...not robust or very flavorful. I do use cream and stevia so this affects the taste..perhaps those who prefer black coffee would like it. My favorite decaf K-Cup is Emeril's Jazzed Up...great flavor, full-bodied..PERFECT! So, if someone served me the Timothy's, I wouldn't complain but having compared it to Emeril's Jazzed Up...I'll stick with Emeril's.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I only drink decaf coffee. I tried many different brands. I found this to be the best. It is very smooth. Not too strong and not weak , like alot of decaf coffees. Green Mountain and Timothy's have the best tasting decaf coffee. I LOVE my keurig coffee pot and cant imagine coffee without it.

review/summary: Very good for a decaf coffee!
review/text: I ordered the decaf by mistake, but Timothy's Columbian K-Cups are still very good - even without the morning JOLT I need!  Nice and smooth on the end, not too strong. It's a good cup for a morning brew and a late nighter since their is no caffeine.

review/text: This coffee is full of flavor, and when you drink it, it's like you have a vacation:)))))))) Feels good!<br />And in my opinion to drink decaf is much healthier and you can still enjoy the taste of coffee.

review/summary: Bland Tasteless Coffee laced with possible CARCINOGEN
review/text: First of all I think Keurig is wonderfull. It produces the best possible taste in<br />coffee due to the optimum brewing conditions. Try the "My-K cup resuable<br />coffee filter" compared to your regular coffee pot and you will see for yourself.<br />But this Timothy Decaf K-cup coffee is bland and tasteless. It is also<br />unbelievable that on the box it is stated that the coffee beans are washed in<br />METHYLENE CHLORIDE , a possible carcinogen, that is banned in numerous<br />countries (Don't believe me, see Wikipedia). Folks, you can do better.....

review/summary: Buyer beware!!
review/text: Timothy's K cups used to be one of my favorites....not anymore. The process they use for making your coffee decafeinated is beyond unhealthy so I'm looking for a true natural alternative. We've also had several of the K cups explode while brewing and leaving us with a half cup of grounds and a mess to clean up. This is unacceptable for an expensive K cup.

review/text: I hate it, even doctored up. I simply dislike all decaf coffees I've tried thru the years, they never improve.  I try  to have some in for guests or a late cuppa to go with cake/pie ...decaf coffees eventually get discarded because of age.
