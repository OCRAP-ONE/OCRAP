review/summary: Seems to work, but it is expensive and requires upkeep
review/text: I've never used pest repellent before however live at the edge of a forest treeline so we constantly have skunks, deer, racoons and other critters coming out of the woods. I like the deer but don't like the skunks, for some reason something startles them around my AC unit and when that happens the house just starts to stink. We also have some bushes in our front yard that neighborhood cats seems to like to use as a bathroom. Typically daily I'd go out and see an animal, yesterday I put this out around the house and I hadn't seen the guys roaming around which is unusual.<br /><br />Also, I appreciate the design of this container. It has an adjustable cap on it that doubles as a dispenser so you can sprinkle a little bit or a lot depending on your application.<br /><br />The repellent itself has a peppery smell, it's a bit overwhelming at first but after it's been on the ground for 15-30 minutes the scent dies down.<br /><br />So far so good. I would recommend this if you have a critter problem.

review/summary: seems to be working for grounhogs
review/text: There was a groundhog digging all around our shed, he had entrances at all four sides of the shed, and we couldn't get rid of it for ages. This year I applied the Critter Ridder at each of his holes and I see vegetation growing around undisturbed, and I didn't  see the animal since then.<br />Most important, it didn't smell of urine as other repellents, so I could actually enjoy my yard after application<br />My only complaint was with the jar shaker cover, it lets too much product out so you should be careful and not dump the mix all in one big pile.<br /><br />Edit on September 28, 2012: the company representative commented on my post that the lid has adjustable opening, I checked the package, and it is true - you can open it halfway, and it "clicks" in this position, so it won't slide as you shake. I wish I realized it earlier.<br />And I still do not see the groundhog, so the repellent still works, maybe it is because I applied too much of it earlier.

review/summary: Works for dogs and cats
review/text: I live in southern Arizona.  We have a problem with coyotes and feral cats and even our neighbors' free-roaming dogs and cats.  This product does work against repelling both cats and dogs, but I've noticed you must use more than directed.  Heavy rains (like our current monsoons) also affect the efficiency of this product.<br /><br />My dogs clearly hate this stuff.  When I opened this container I definitely noted the black pepper aroma.  The granules, which feel like sand, are also oily.  That's surely from the active ingredients of black pepper oil, piperine and capsaicin (the latter being the "hot" in red chili and powder).  All three combined make up only .6% of the active ingredients.  So why is this so expensive?  It looks good in the garden because it's not noticable.<br /><br />Capsaicin is one of the most effective organic materials to use against dogs and cats.  It doesn't harm the plants nor the soil. But its effectiveness is reduced by direct sun and heavy rains.  Capcaicin is one of the most recommended product to use against dogs and cats and is more easily available in raw form in spice shops, and also much more affordable.<br /><br />I find the most effective use is for our large indoor plants.  Our cats now stay away from our potted indoor trees with this stuff applied around the top of pots.<br /><br />I can not vouch for chipmunks, squirrels and raccoons since we don't have those animals here in the high desert where we are.  I rate this a 4-star product because 1) it's very pricy and 2) it needs to be applied more and heavier than 30 days even under ideal, dry conditions.

review/summary: Easy to use and effective
review/text: I got this b/c we have Beagles who keep digging out, so I spread it along the base of the fence.  It has a nice pour spout that pops out of the top and handle, so that makes it very easy to spread, although it does come out quickly b/c the pour spout opening is quite large.  It is the consistency of sand, so it's not visible once it's spread on the ground.  It's been about 1 week and so far it seems to be working, our dogs and the neighbor dogs on the other side of the fence have been avoiding that area and our dogs have not attempted to dig anywhere near the fence where the granuals are spread.

review/summary: doesn't save my peaches
review/text: This product was ordered to help save my peach and pear trees from squirrels. I wasn't thinking and did not realize that it cannot be used on food plants, or sprayed on the foliage. That being said, I spread it liberally on the ground around the base of the fruit trees. The little creeps took a flying leap from my arbor and stole the peaches from the tree tops before I finished applying the product. I will use it in the flower bed to try and deter the feral cat from digging up the ground. It has also been used in the large planter pot that holds my almost ripe figs. I now have to move the pot to an open area so the squirrels can't make the jump.<br /><br />The product has a heavy black pepper smell with is not offensive when sitting on the deck. It says that it can be used in none living areas of the home, such as basement and attic.<br /><br />One note about the cap: the sprinkling lid can be adjusted to open at various widths. This is something I realized later after the product poured out too quickly. Price is steep for pepper oil, if it saved my peaches it would have been worth it. If it saves the figs, I'll up it one star.

review/summary: Great cat repellent
review/text: I recently noticed that a neighborhood tom had started marking my front porch -- not exactly the kind of fragrance you want to welcome your guests.<br />One application of the Havahart granules in the planters he was spraying and he hasn't been back, woohoo! On the negative side, it will get washed away so you need to reapply more often than every 30 days if the area gets irrigated or if it rains, so it can get quite expensive. But hey, it works!

review/summary: Perhaps we just have Asbestos Squirrels
review/text: Last year I got a total of about 6 tomatoes out of our three large plants because the squirrels kept eating the green fruit. None of them ripened on the vine. I tried coffee grounds. I tried vinegar soaked rags. I tried moth balls. (The moth balls DID keep them out of the geranium pots out from).<br /><br />SO this year I thought I'd try something else. I started with concentrated fox urine. The squirrels could not have cared less...but it sure stank up the back yard especially as the humid summer approached the half way mark. I moved on to this industrial strength pepper. I had hope in the first days of use, but the fruit is being harvested by small furry hands before it gets anywhere near big enough for us to pick. This does make our garden smell like pepperoni...but it doesn't keep the squirrels at bay. All this despite a daily refreshed birdbath full of cool water AND a birdfeeder (far from the garden) full of seeds...sigh.<br /><br />The lady at the garden shop said chicken wire is the only fool-proof way to keep them out. So I guess that is what we'll do next year.

review/summary: Works for Squirrels
review/text: I used this in a flower bed that I wanted to keep squirrels out of.  It works well for that.  I sprinkled it on the dirt among the flowers.  It has an unpleasant odor but that wears off after a day or two.  You do need to reapply it while the plants are still young after a rain or every week to 10 days.  When the plants grow and fill in, you don't need to use it anymore because squirrels seem to leave the plants alone then.  (They like to see bare dirt.)  If you're using this for some other critter, I can't really speak to that, but it's great for keeping squirrels away.

review/text: I really thought about buying another brand of this, just because my neighbors little dogs always runs into my front yard and I don't mind but it sets my dogs up to barking and that is annoying! Well, I used the whole canister of this across the whole front of my yard and my neighbors little Papillon and Chihuahua just came right on in, right across the "barrier".  So, I don't know how it works to repel varmints but I certainly didn't see any result with small dogs.

review/summary: Not a Single Solution
review/text: As the container says, Critter Ridder works best in conjunction with a fence or some other barrier. With that in mind, I applied it around the perimeter of my fenced garden. Several rabbits had managed to beat the fence. With the critter ridder, only 1 rabbit was able to make it in. So, it was not as effective as I have hoped but I was pleased to reduce the rabbit pillaging.

review/summary: I think it worked...
review/text: For whatever reason, dogs seem to love using my front yard as their personal doggie-bathroom.  I thought I'd give this product a try to see if it helped.  The conclusion: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it helped.  Here are the details:<br /><br />Only once a month or so do I find "solid evidence" that a dog decided to relieve him/herself on my lawn.  I suspect the brown spots in my grass are from dogs doing #1 on my grass, but I'm talking about the other kind here.  Since I put this stuff on my lawn, I have found nothing stinky on my grass, so that's a plus, but since it only happens once a month or so, it's hard to say for sure if this had anything to do with it or not.  I will say that the brown spots are starting to fade, and that's a good sign!<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I had thought I would get 2, 3, maybe even 4 uses out of this container, but as it turns out, even walking at a brisk pace, just to get all along the grass on both sides of the sidewalk and walk-way up to our door, that was pretty much the whole thing, so I only got one application.  Note that I live on a corner lot, so I have twice as much area to cover as I would otherwise have.<br /><br />I have no idea how long the stuff lasted, or if it still is having any effect now (I doubt it--it has been a few weeks), but I suspect that once you train a dog not to use your lawn anymore by attaching a negative experience with your yard, then the product can continue to be effective, even when it is no longer on the grass.<br /><br />Note that another reviewer mentioned that this product has a slight odor to humans when first used.  Sure, I could smell a slight black-pepper-like odor when I was dispensing it, but that quickly faded and wasn't bad in the first place.  Note also that I observed 0 negative effects to the grass it was applied to.<br /><br />I would have to try this a bit longer to say for certain whether or not it did anything, but I think the amount required to get a definitive test would get rather expensive.  At the same time, if you are having similar problems, give this a whirl.  You may have more conclusive results than me :)

review/summary: Works, in direct areas, not as perimeter.
review/text: This product works to keep critters out of specific areas, but seems to only work directly where it is applied.<br />I was hoping to also use it as perimeter control, sprinkling around my barn to keep out cats, skunks, etc. However as a perimeter control it didn't seem to work.<br />When I applied directly to the corners in the barn that were being used for nesting it cleared out those areas, but the critters found somewhere else to make a home. I kept tracking these areas down and applying more repellent and eventually it seems the critters are gone.

review/summary: Didn't work as I expected...
review/text: I live in an area where feral cats seem to run rampant. We have a small back area to our house (living in a row home in Philadelphia) and needed to keep them out so that our 1 yr old son wouldn't try to play with their feces. A block wall surrounds our back area and I poured this stuff liberally around the wall (where the cats walk). This stuff didn't even stop them. I watched as they continued to walk, day by day, across the wall. I thought to myself, "maybe the Critter Ridder blew away? Maybe there's nothing there." To my dismay, the critter ridder was still thick and visible on the wall - it just didn't affect the cats.<br /><br />Maybe the animals in your area have tougher senses. It would seem that the hard life of the city has affected the cats in our area in such a way as to cause them to be like the honey badger: They just don't care and they do whatever they want.<br /><br />All to say... I WANTED this to work. I WANTED this to be effective. Unfortunately, it didn't work, and the cats continue to mock me and my property as they lay their disease infested bombs around my property.

review/text: We have a raccoon problem in our area and looked at this product as a good option to keep them out of our garbage. The fact that it is natural/organic was a plus in deciding to try it.  But the pluses ended with the product description for this very ineffective answer.  Despite using it heavily especially in the vicinity of our trash the repellent did anything but.  We even tried spreading it heavily on the cans.  It did not stop the animals from continuing to attack our trash.<br /><br />Sounds like a good idea but just doesn't work.

review/summary: Havahart Critter Ridder
review/text: This is a great product and those who use traps, baits and other strategies to catch critters will find this a better investment.<br /><br />The one drawback is the pellets tend to provide results up to 30 days.<br /><br />The technology of the product relies on the smell of urine of the predator, of the animal you are trying to remove.  Thus, once you build a shield by placing the product on the perimeter of your property, you should see  instant results.  The product does not kill the animal but simply diverts them to other unprotected areas.<br /><br />I've tried several of Havahart products and prefer them over the conventional way of terminating nuisance type intruders.

We put down the pepper around the door and she has stopped peeing there.  Now I love this product.<br /><br />So it seems to be quite efficient on pavement.  I am not so sure about soil. I don't think that what I scattered at the bottom of the garden deterred our cats from using it.<br /><br />First Review<br />I scattered the repellent using the shaker.  Very quickly I had gone through half the container to cover a patch of garden about 3' x 10'.  I was trying to scatter it.<br />The smell is that of black pepper, which is the main ingredient.  The next day the pepper smell was gone.<br />I am not sure how effective it is because our pole-cat visitors do not keep to any schedule.

review/summary: Does It Work or Doesn't It? I Don't Know. Here's Why...
review/text: Living as I do in the high desert, with the rear of my property abutting a natural arroyo, I tend to get many animals in my back yard. I welcome most of them. I see two or three families of quail almost every day. I've seen a red fox several times, and once watched a group of five big deer wander around behind my house (I have pictures of them to prove it). Although I've never seen one in my yard, there are often reports of mountain lion sightings in my neighborhood, more so as the ongoing drought drives them down from the higher slopes of the Franklin Mountains. With that said, the only creatures I do NOT welcome in my back yard (other than domestic dogs and cats) are squirrels. In years past, the nasty, destructive little rodents have utterly foiled my wife's attempts to have a vegetable garden. Now she doesn't even try.<br /><br />Squirrels have been a real infestation this spring. I've seen as many as eight at a time running around the burrow they dug just behind my rear rock wall. I almost bought some animal repellant at Lowes, but I ultimately decided not to get it because the label indicated it might also repel the quail, which I do not want to do. But as soon as I saw Havahart Critter Ridder as a Vine program selection, I ordered it immediately.<br /><br />This is the part of the review where I would normally say what I think about the product. I'd like to be able to report that I subjected it to rigorous testing, and that it either worked great or didn't work at all. However, there's a problem. You see, while the Vine shipment was en route, I took matters into my own hands, so to speak, and shoveled dirt and rocks into the burrow. Next day, the squirrels had dug it out again. I filled it in again. They dug it out again. I filled it in for the third time--and they did NOT dig it out. In fact, there's been no sign of them since. I guess they got tired of the game and went somewhere else.<br /><br />So I can't say whether Havahart Critter Ridder works in repelling squirrels, because I got rid of my rodent infestation before I got my hands on it. I'm rating it with three stars simply because I consider that a "neutral" rating. If the squirrels return, I'll put Critter Ridder to the test and update this review. In the meantime, if you have a squirrel problem, some judicious pick-and-shovel work may also be a way to repel the little #$%@!!s.

review/text: If I were a cat, I would not poop where this stuff was sprinkled around.  If I were a dog, I would choose a different place to snuff around.  So in my mind, this stuff should work really well.<br /><br />But my cats are pooping in some loose soil where I sprinkled this stuff.  And the dog is snuffing around there because she has a sick fixation with digging up cat poo.  In this product's defense, I will say that I did not sprinkle a whole lot of it, just some on the surface.  Maybe I need to use more.<br /><br />This stuff is a whole lot of black pepper, with some extra capsaicin added... that's the stuff that makes jalapenos hot.  So like I said, it seems to me that this would work--I would stay away from sniffing around in it.  But so far my animals don't seem phased by it.

We had not had any rain although the yard does have a sprinkler system.  I personally believe this product would do best in warm areas as the heat makes the included peppers more pungent.

review/summary: 30 Days, No Dogs
review/text: I gave this a full 30-days to see if would live up to it's claim. And so far, it has. My main issues are with neighborhood dogs and rabbits. It didn't do a thing for the bunnies, nor does it claim to. But dogs are quite annoying. There is absolutely nothing more annoying than stepping in crap when doing yard work. Or discovering a dog decided to dig through the garden.<br /><br />This stuff is basically a combination of various peppers that would repel most humans, let alone common critters. You might want to wear gloves and mask if you're sensitive to stuff like that. As directed, I applied this around the perimeter of the back and front yard, and waited. I was skeptical it would last with the sprinkler system and occasional rain.<br /><br />Of course dogs are smart. Once they get a smell of that repellent, they often avoid it in the future. In either case, I'll be applying another "border" fairly soon just in case they forget or we get some new dogs in the area.<br /><br />Overall, this is somewhat pricey for what it is. But it does have a handy shaker for easy distribution, and so far, its working against the neighborhood dogs. The only other negative is that I wish there was something in there to repel bunnies. I think those guys actually like this stuff. :)

review/summary: Definitely Works.
review/text: We have acreage that is most attractive to a wide range of "critters", who find it a convenient place for eliminating their waste.  Not merely cats and dogs, but also skunks, raccoons, bears, and other animals have been using the property for years.  We have tried many products, but none had much effect until we applied Critter Ridder.  Wherever it is sprinkled, it discourages the animals.  This is the best of its type!  Its container is easy to use and very durable.

review/summary: Seems to work O.K.
review/text: I received this product through Amazon Vine.  The product was placed in two areas.  The first was around a small garden to keep out some rabbits & small rodents.  It seems to have accomplished this mission but it was put down so thickly that mere pepper would have done as well.  The second use was put around a mail box.  While this product isn't a mole repellant it seems to work.  So, this product does work as advertised.  Generally, I use another product.  This product is a natural repellant & has a rather nasty order so it should not be used next to a house.  That is why it cost a star.

review/text: I was very disappointed in this product. I hoped to dissuade the chipmunks from eating the plants on my deck and to stop whatever kind of creatures were munching on and destroying some of my sunflowers in a small side garden in the yard. There did not seem to be any success in either place and I have to say, on my small sampling, that this product did not work as advertised.

We put the Critter Ridder down and I haven't seen one in the area we protected since doing so.  So, so far, so good.  I am going to purchase another so I can sprinkle all around the house.

review/summary: Save the Money and Get a Dog...or Some Big Cats...or a Snake
review/text: I really wanted this to work...we have had major problems with various critters eating our garden this year...most of our plants have been stripped, nibbled to nubs, dug up, or eaten as seeds.  For certain there are some rabbits, some mice, some birds, chipmunks and lizards involved here to varying degrees.  This just flat didn't help. This was no more effective than sprinkling cayenne, spraying garlic or anything else we've tried.  It's a nice big bottled filled with stinky powder that doesn't do anything more than use up some money that could feed a nice snake for the garden, dog for the yard, or cat to attack visiting rodents.  I've tried way too many sprays and powders by now and am moving on to fences and hanging baskets.  For a minor problem this may be worth something to someone...though I'd go for cayenne over this for the neighborhood cats pooping in the yard. This won't save what the non-domestics want to nibble.

review/summary: Helped me rid my garden of squirrels and raccoons
review/text: I have been successfully using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H1GQ8G">Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II</a> for a couple of months to ward off the squirrels, raccoons and cats that were plaguing my garden.  When I ran out of that product, I decided to try the granular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016PC4TS">Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent</a>.<br /><br />This product is granular and you just shake it around areas you wish to protect.  A single application is supposed to last 30 days, but in central Florida we do get a lot of afternoon thunderstorms, so I find that I have to reapply the product after a heavy rain.<br /><br />As with the Deer Off II, this product is nearly as effective.  The liquid solution seems to be a greater deterrent for my animal pest situation, but the granular repellent does seem to work for squirrels and raccoons.  For some reason, the cats still want to use my flower beds as a litter box when i use the granules but they tend to avoid the area when I use the liquid.<br /><br />Overall - the granular shaker seems easier to shake into flower beds and vegetable gardens.  I think the shaker is less obtrusive than the spray - I was hesitant to spray my tomato plants with the spray but I have no issues shaking the granules.  I like that this product is OMRI listed, so no worries with using it in an organic garden.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about Critter Ridder products is the price - it is somewhat expensive, but the price you pay for this product is (hopefully) recouped if your garden is not destroyed by animals.  I recommend the product - it did work for me.  However, I can't speak for all situations.  I think it is definitely worth a try if you want to rid your yard of critters.

review/summary: you can use a cheaper, safer alternative
review/text: After trying this product, I agree with other reviews that it doesn't last 30 days.  The price point is high for what you get.  I prefer going to BJ's or Sam's Club and picking up a vat of black pepper and/or Cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you don't want critters and it is cheaper to use & I feel safer.  I've used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works.  We also use the black pepper & cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away.  We reapply as needed, but it seems once they know it's there, they find somewhere else to dine.  I've also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them.

review/summary: Disappointingly ineffective
review/text: After hours of working in the yard planting bedding plants and mulching under and around trees and shrubs, it is particularly frustrating to go out the very next day only to find one of the neighborhood cats has chosen my newly planted beds and mulched areas for its litter box.  A particularly infuriating situation is the area under a large spruce tree where I have used various colors of mulch to create a pattern that provides an interesting view from the street.  That is until the rogue cat has dug up the mulch, deposited and burying its waste leaving the mulch and the design completely ruined.  Once the mulch colors have been mixed there is no choice but to remove the entire area and replace it.  An exercise in futility however, as the cat will inevitably do the same in another night or two.<br /><br />I have tried various manufactured and home "repellents", none of which so far have been effective.  With the mostly favorable reviews for this product I gave it a try but, to my dismay, I find it necessary to weigh in on the side of those who found this product ineffective.  The very next day after its application, the cat had done its duty and made another mess of my mulch.  Perhaps not enough product, perhaps not spread widely enough, or whatever the reason, I tried again with another, heavier, more complete application.  To no avail, however, as not only did the cat return and make an even bigger mess this time, there was evidence of a squirrel having dug through the mulch looking for buried nuts as evidenced by its tell-tale holes in the ground.<br /><br />So, for whatever the reason may be - this is an older cat with a poor sense of smell, etc., this product did not perform as advertised.  While it may work in some situations, it did not in this case.  I can not recommend this product as it seems to be a hit-or-miss outcome and unless there's a better performance record proven for it, I can not see spending the money for a product of doubtful usefullness.

review/summary: Surprisingly Effective
review/text: Our garden in the backyard had been getting ravaged by some small little rodents. We have gophers, rabbits and chipmunks that are seen almost daily around or IN our garden. Our first response was to put up a garden net to keep the little critters away, and that worked. Sadly the net wouldn't allow the plants to grow much higher and then I was offered a sample of Critter Ridder!<br /><br />Critter Ridder smells like the worlds largest container of pepper. After we went around our garden like Sam and Dean and made our Supernatural barrier against rodents we waited. It has been two weeks and those rodents haven't even been back to our part of the street! This stuff did a wonderful job and now our plants are growing carefree!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to ANYONE who is having issues. It says that you only need to use it every 2 weeks but I used it after any rain at first. Now I haven't replaced it in over a week and still no critters!

The best part is that this product is mostly made from hot pepper, so there's no harmful chemicals or nasty ingredients going into the soil. I would definitely recommend this product.

Since using Critter Ridder, I haven't seen them and there's no evidence of digging.  Though it doesn't make any claims about deer, they haven't eaten my impatiens so far.  Havahart has a pleasant odor to humans, kind of like cedar, but apparently is umpleasant to animals.  A humane solution of pesky animals!

review/summary: I think it works, but that's hard to measure
review/text: It's very difficult to tell if this product is working. I applied it around my deck to repel rabbits. We have them in the yard, and sometimes they hover around the hostas around the deck. I haven't noticed any rabbits near the house since application, but we had rain nearly every day for a week, so I'm not sure if the product is effective anymore or not. I also sprinkled it around one of my gardens that doesn't have a fence to deter rabbits, groundhogs and moles. Since I don't have a camera set up, and I'm not monitoring it round the clock, I just can't tell if it's keeping all or some of them away.<br /><br />When I sprinkle it on, the product has a very strong smell of black pepper. It's easy to apply, but doesn't go very far. It's a little expensive for me to purchase for additional applications.<br /><br />For those wondering what the other 99% of inactive ingredients might be, I'm 99% sure it's sand. So, this is black pepper, Piperine, and Capsaicin, and a ton of sand. If they made it in a liquid that customers could mix with sand for spreadability, I wonder if they could make it at a better price.

review/text: We have problems with deer, raccoons, possums, groundhogs and more, eating grapes off our vines and flowers out of the garden. I sprinkled CRITTER RIDDER liberally around both areas, and was really pleased for several days. I could literally watch the deer completely avoid both areas. Unfortunately about five days later we had several days straight of on and off heavy rains, and before I could re-apply the product, the grapes disappeared. Perhaps the product would work better in a drier climate than what we have, as I can see the cost being prohibitive if I have to re-apply it every week or so.<br /><br />When it worked, it worked great. But rain is NOT your friend when it comes to Critter Ridder.

review/summary: Works well, but takes a lot!
review/text: Let me set the stage... I have a fairly big yard with some fairly big trees, and a dog that likes to hunt rabbits and leave a big mess for us to clean up in the yard.  We've tried numerous options for keeping the rabbits out of the yard, but nothing seems to work.  The critter ridder is the first "chemical" option we've tried because we're usually worried about the safety of the dog, but this product is made in the USA, and contains nothing more than natural spices, so we figured it was safe for our dog.  We spread the whole jar around the perimeter of the yard.  We noticed that rabbits would no longer enter the yard, but the ones that were already in the yard would also not leave.  So, yes, it does what it claims.  Unfortunately, it rained two days later, and the effect was then gone.  Of cours this isn't the fault of the product, but it's simply too expensive for us to sprinkle a whole container around the perimeter of the yard every couple days.  We will continue to look for solutions to keep the rabbits out of our yard.  This product is probably better suited for sprinkling over small gardens to keep the rabbits out, as you can make a whole container last for months when you only have to sprinkle such a small area.  For large yards, this is too expensive of an option.  I'll update the review if I ever find a perfect solution for my yard.  (I rated this product 4 stars because it does work as advertised, but had to dock it a star because of the fact that it's not the "perfect" solution for my yard.

The little critter is constantly using my mailbox flower garden as a toilet, and I requested this product to see if I could deter him. It definitely works short-term. I like that it has natural ingredients, but it also says don't use around vegetable plants. That is a bit concerning to me. It's also pricey, so I'm not sure this could be a regular solution, since it doesn't seem to work for anywhere close to 30 days, as the label states. Now, we've had an unusual amount of rain this year, so that could play into the effectiveness of the product; but the price would even make me think twice about purchasing it once a month for an entire season.

review/summary: Can Irritate Pets' Eyes; Advertising Misleading
review/text: I ordered it with the intention of using it on the garden of my daughter in law while visiting my son this summer.  She has complained about chipmunks eating her flowers and this seemed to be a good way to deal with the problem.  Initially she was very enthused about testing this product, especially after I showed her on the Amazon description that it could be safely used around pets:<br /><br /> "Safe for Use Around Children and Pets<br />Made from all-natural ingredients, Critter Ridder is Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) listed and USDA approved for use in organic gardening. Because it's EPA-registered, parents can feel confident using Critter Ridder around their children and pets."<br /><br />However when she read the fine print and discovered this "Precautionary Statement" she declined to give it a try:<br /><br />"Hazards to humans and domestic animals.  Caution: Causes moderate eye irritation."<br /><br />If there is anything that my daughter in law enjoys more than her garden, it is her 2 cats.  The possibility of causing discomfort to her "children" or somebody else's dog or cat was enough to deter her from using this product.<br /><br />The product may be very effective, but the advertising in misleading.  I'm sure there are many other pet lovers with gardens that would like a product that deters pests but does not harm pets.  They shouldn't be assured it was safe for pets then find otherwise in fine print after making the purchase.

review/summary: Kept rabbits away from my lettuce, but doesn't last 30 days
review/text: I spread this around my lettuce boxes, which have been exhibiting little nibbles despite us living in an urban area (I see the bunny hopping around from time to time).  I made sure to apply on a dry night, when I knew there wouldn't be any rain for a day or two.  There were no new nibbles, but the smell was significantly diminished after a night or two.  It's worth noting that most of what I'd want to protect (herbs, veggies) needs a lot of water, making this "lasts 30 days" claim a bit dubious.  That being said, I think a mouthful must have deterred Peter Cottontail, who hasn't been back for seconds.  So, maybe even if I can't smell it, it's working (or maybe he has a memory of these things).  I'd purchase again if I saw more rabbits.

review/summary: Info on the ingredients
review/text: This definitely works to keep our cats from using our window planter as their favorite litter box.  I don't like spreading chemicals all over the garden so I researched the ingredients in this product before I started using it.  I like that it's all natural.  Here's a description of what it contains:<br /><br />Essential Oil of Black Pepper - Famous for its use as a spice, some animals hate the smell, but it's perfectly safe.  According to the EPA: "When used as proposed, Animal Repellent Granular is not expected to result in oil of black pepper residues at levels that are of toxicological concern. The information submitted indicates there is already widespread exposure to oil of black pepper without any reported adverse effects to human health."<br /><br />Piperine - This is another extract of black pepper, which triggers nociceptors (pain sensing nerve cells) just like the effects of red pepper.<br /><br />Capsaicin - This is the main ingredient in chili peppers that causes the burning sensation, familiar to those who love spicy food.  Although it triggers nociceptors, there are no lasting biological effects.<br /><br />Animals have an excellent sense of smell and will avoid these compounds before they get too close, and will learn to avoid it forever if they do, so pets will not be harmed.

A few weeks ago I sprinkled some of this stuff in the areas I have seen the cat hang out and so far so good. I haven't seen any evidence of the cat leaving its "calling card" in our yard. I like the convenience of this product. The granular pellets are easy to scatter around the yard. I don't have to deal with a messy, smelly liquid that I have to spray all over the yard. I just grab a handful of this stuff and scatter it around. Couldn't be any easier. It has yet to be determined how effective it will be over the long run. I will update my review when more time has passed. Like most other animal deterrent products, you have to reapply after heavy rains. The biggest drawback of this product is the price. Hopefully the price will come down and make it more affordable.

While most of these critters are not problematic, the raccoons are a nuisance and empty our birdfeeders and even our hummingbird feeders. After sprinkling this product around the entire area, the racoons (and squirrels) pretty much ignored it. I have found success with Deer Away spray which works much more effectively.

review/summary: It Appears to Work
review/text: This is a tough product to review.  I put it around the flowers in the pots at my pool.  I was having squirrels literally toss the flowers out, I assume looking for nuts from last year. Not being terribly squirrly myself I can't claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess.  I put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since.  I am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned.  They are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants. Since I am not sure that the product drove the squirrels away I can't give it 5 stars but since I am pretty sure, I will give it four stars.  BTW it does not have the strong odor I have found on similar types of products I have used in the past.

review/summary: I still have a rabbit invasion
review/text: I got this in hopes it would stop the rabbits in my yard.  I applied it as directed in paths of the critters.  I did not notice ANY improvement, nor did my cocker spaniel seem to stop at it's locations.  I wish I could report it works well, but not for me id doesn't.  My imagination says it kept them at bay for maybe a day, but a no rain day later, things were back to the way they were.  I think it was my imagination.  I have not had luck with any product.  Nothing more to say about this - it failed me.

review/summary: really works
review/text: It's kind of a running joke in my neighborhood about how many cats I have.  I have NONE but my yard is fully of them, using my mulch as cat litter.  My yard is big with lots of trees and bushes and lots of mulch.  Now you can't even walk to the back of my yard because of the fleas and cat poop.  I've tried many things over the years.  This time, after my grass was cut, I sprinkled this stuff on the many spots that I've seen the cats go to the bathroom and they no longer go there.  I also have alot of squirrels and a possum or two from time to time and haven't seen them either.  This stuff is safe for your grass and plants.  I'm hoping it works until it rains then I would have to sprinkle again.  I'm not sure why the cats dont' like it but I've seen them walk to their normal spots and then just walk away.  It must have something unpleasant in it.  I will have to get gallons of this stuff but if it works, it's well worth it.<br />If you have pest problems, try this.

review/summary: Excellent deterrent for squirrels
review/text: I managed to trap 8 squirrels in 2011 with havahart animal cage (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPAVCG">Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Chimpunk, Squirrel, Rat, and Weasel Trap</a>). See my previous review of havahart animal cage. They were attracted to the bird feeder on my neighbor's backyard. It was a way to catch humanely. They have been "relocated" to a much bigger park where they can search more food and harass small birds. This year I have a difficulty catching the newcomer squirrels. They do not respond to the tasty peanuts that I put in the trap. I am not happy to find some spots here and there that have been dug by squirrels. So I pour this critter ridder around the garden and in the container. It works. The squirrels hate the powder so much that they do not touch my garden anymore.

review/summary: Rain rain go away
review/text: This Critter Ridder says it is rain resistant and then at one point in their description says heavy rain resistant. When I received it, the weather forecast had a low probability of rain for the next 10 days; so trusting? that, since it was the best I could do, I spread this along my problem area for dogs. We have a sidewalk with a grassy median between it and the street and several trees surrounded by hosta gardens that it's been very irritating, in more ways than one, to find dog waste left in.<br /><br />The directions say to use gloves to spread it, but since the can is a shaker, it seemed much more handy to just give a shaking application that way. I spread it along the edges of the sidewalk and in a ring around the hosta gardens. As luck would have it that evening was one of those 10% scattered showers, not that heavy of a rain. The next morning there was no trace of the granules or the smell, which had a slight ammonia odor and there in the corner which had probably gotten a heavier dose because that is also where an area the hosta are was a huge pile of dog poop.<br />That sort of destroys my opinion of this product's effectiveness.

review/text: This gentle and all-natural organic formula repels by taste and odor groundhogs, skunks, dogs, cats, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks and other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its oil of black pepper, peperine and capsaicin are not offensive to people and applicable not only gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also in basements, cellars, and storage.

review/text: Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shaker<br /><br />Skunks, opossums, raccoons, fox, gigantic Cottontail bunny rabbits, groundhogs etc. -- there seems to be an endless parade of some cute little critter, or another, wandering around my yard (especially at night) looking for something to chow-down on -- vegetable gardens, flower beds, young trees and even my lawn -- especially in Spring and Summer!  If it's not a hungry critter, it is a stray Kitty looking for a place to take a dump -- usually in my vegetable gardens.  Yuck! :|<br /><br />So I thought I'd give Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent a try because it says it is safe around humans, lasts for 30 days and will not hurt the critters -- just keep them out of the important stuff, if ya know what I mean..<br /><br />A couple of my observations:<br /><br />the smell is extremely spicy/pungent and may cause the eyes to water -- so, (tempting as it may be) don't unscrew the lid and take a big sniff (like I did)...<br /><br />wearing rubber gloves, the sturdy plastic handle, on the container, is very easy to hold on to and sprinkle Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent at the same time.<br /><br />broadcasting over a wide area, around the outside perimeter of my vegetable gardens and flower beds was quick and easy.<br /><br />It's been 30 days (since I first applied Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent), and my vegetable gardens and flower beds  are still intact, with no munch marks or bare spots where plants might have suddenly disappeared over night.  The stray Kitties have stopped using my vegetable gardens to bury their treasure. :)  A "plus" if ya ask me!  Still, I do see the rabbits hopping around the yard, in the evening, but they make a wide path around the areas I have treated with Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent and head straight for the untreated clover and grassy areas to dine -- which is what I wanted them to do to start with.<br /><br />Life just got a whole lot easier. 'nuf said. *sips ice-cold lemonade and relaxes*<br /><br />Does Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/summary: Seems to Work for Some Things, But Pricey....
review/text: My main reason for trying Havahart Critter Ridder is the neighborhood cats. They like to hang around my house for some reason and I even found one in my car one day when I had left a window down. I sprinkled Critter Ridder all around my perimeter and especially around the garage where I see the cats hanging out the most. I watched for a week and saw only one cat where there are usually there are three or four in the gang and the one didn't hang around long. It's only been a week, so I'm going to keep watching, but so far so good for the specific reason I tried this product. However, I have not noticed it effecting the gopher that shows up every couple days, he still shows up and doesn't seem bothered by the granulars at all. The squirrels are unfazed too, but they don't really bother me. I have not seen the skunk that waddles occasionally through my backyard either, but it's a little too soon to tell with him, he doesn't show up all that often. All in all, I'm pretty happy that it seems to be deterring the cats, but it's pricey. If it only lasts 10 days as some have said in other reviews I don't know that I will be using it again.<br />I've never tried a product like this, so if this is the case, I will be checking out other similiar products to see if they work as well. If I am cat free close to 30 days as the description promises I may reconsider.

review/summary: Keeps the dogs and cats away
review/text: I have 4 dogs in my house, two of whom are real diggers.  Their favorite places to dig, naturally, are my flowerbeds and garden areas.  Two years in a row I've tried to use a 4' x 8' raised bed for growing some vegetables.  Each year the seeds or plants were dug up and often replaced by a bone, rawhide chew, or even a toy.  I'd decided not to even bother using it this year because of the wasted time and effort to say nothing of seeds and plants.<br /><br />I received the Havahart Critter Ridder a few weeks ago and immediately sprinkled it over my raised garden bed just to see what would happen.  My garden bed has quickly become a no-pets zone.  Every animal I have, dogs and cats both, avoid the treated area.  No more holes, bones, or "kitty surprises".  I can finally use my raised bed for what it was intended, not the amusement of my pets.<br /><br />Great product, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Keeps wild things away, does nothing for suburban creatures
review/text: I have a lake house in the Pennsylvania woods and have long had problems with small wild creatures in my shed and trash area. I had only partial luck with ammonia, commercial urine products and other repellants. I found Havahart worked quite well, although as other reviewers have noted, an application does not last 30 days, more like 10 days depending on conditions.<br /><br />I recommended it to a friend in the Connecticut suburbs, it did nothing for him. Scanning the other reviews, this appears to be consistent. My guess is the repellant resembles something common enough in areas with moderately dense human population that the local creatures are indifferent.<br /><br />So, based on my experience, use it for wild creatures in the woods, but do not expect good results in areas with too many humans around.

review/summary: A Bit Expensive, Limited Results
review/text: We have two neighbors who put out peanuts for the local squirrels. The squirrels like to bury them in our flower beds. I guess that the soft earth is the easiest choice when they want to dig. Likewise, we have some chipmunks who dig and eat the bulbs of some of our flowers. So it is pretty common to come out in the morning and see small holes in the ground in the flower beds and even sometimes in our containers holding herbs or other plants.<br /><br />We spread this product over the popular areas for a couple of weeks and at first we didn't see any new holes. However, they have started reappearing. Either rain or watering seems to have lessened the effect.<br /><br />Though it seemed to improve the situation initially, I think that it would be a bit expensive over the whole year, especially now in the late spring when we have a lot of rain, sometimes quite heavy, and we would need to reapply it often.

review/summary: Works well for wildlife, not so much for our dogs.
review/text: We live in a completely wooded area in NW Wisconsin; woods begin where our lawn ends with the nearest house 1/2 mile away.  We have had "issues" with deer, bear, coyotes, raccoons and little ones like rabbits and gophers.  We've tried moth balls, pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.  Nothing really worked on a consistent basis.<br /><br />This does seem to work.  It is obvious when you open it that pepper is the main ingredient.  The container has a built in pour spout, it is convenient but may be larger than really needed and given the price of the Ridder this is important.  It comes out smoothly and is easy to sprinkle around.  But a five pound container does get a little heavy quickly.  We went about a week with no problems around the three flower beds and one tree that I put this on.  Given the amount used this application would have cost about $10.  After some rain I did have to reapply it as I noticed some animals seem to have reappeared, in fairness the Ridder does say this in the instructions.<br /><br />Two caveats:<br /><br />1  Above I repeat the word "seem", there is really no concrete way to know for sure, we have gone weeks with no problems with no product used and then have found bears tipping our garbage cans (they have to go out the night before pickup giving bears, etc. a night to find them - we actually spray a liquid repellant on the cans), deer munching on our newly planted trees and so on.<br /><br />2:  It does not work on for dogs.  We have FIVE dogs and to be honest they do not bother our planting areas of which we have nine.  The day after I put this on three planting areas all three boy dogs (two Shelties and one Golden) went around and marked the area as if it were a challenge to beat out the smell of the Ridder, our female Golden stuck her head into the plants like she was searching for the Holy Grail.  Our female Sheltie did ignore it.  So for dogs it did have an 80% failure rate.

review/summary: So far -- no squirrels !!
review/text: A neighbor puts out whole peanuts for what was one squirrel.  Now all the squirrels in town know about it.  They get a bunch of peanuts, all that will fit in their mouth, then come to my flower pots and flower beds to stash them for later.  Not only are my pots & beds sown with peanuts, they dig up everything!!  As soon as I received the product I put out the Havahart Critter Ridder and no trace of squirrels in the pots or flower beds since.  I smoothed the dirt before spreading it and it is still smooth!!  There are no deer around but there are cats...  I don't see signs of cats digging and covering poo out there, but it's harder to detect (until one is digging in the dirt to insert a new plant).  I haven't tried this powder around the edges of the back yard plantings yet to keep my dog from going into the area to 'talk' with the neighbor.  If it DOESN'T keep out the dog, I'll be back to let you know.  So, if you don't hear from me again on this...  it's working for the dog too.  Yeah!!!!  Finally something that truly works (and even after a rain or two on it).  Oh, it was very easy to spread with the built-in shaker.  Since my areas are small I just barely lifted the lid section intended for spreading the product and the right amount came out.  For larger areas one might want to open it further to get a handfull for broadcasting, although I believe it works best as the label describes, to just sprinkle it around areas where you do not want critters to enter.  It's working!!<br /><br />7/9/2012 update:  Saw a squirrel head down the fence top yesterday so it's time to re-apply.  Lasts a good month which is really good for this type of a product.

review/summary: Critter Ridder: Caring Control for Pets and Wildlife
review/text: About a year ago, a female groundhog burrowed underneath my front porch. Until I did a little online research, I didn't know just how annoying and destructive these rodents can be. Among other names, these critters are also called woodchucks and whistle-pigs. Having one of these near your foundation (and my basement) makes getting rid of them extremely difficult. According to online "experts," the usual extricating methods are putting a water hose down the burrow or pumping carbon dioxide in from the exhaust pipe of your vehicle. Of course for my situation these methods are neither practical nor safe for the house or the occupants. So, short of catching her outside the burrow when she happens to be out for a stroll or foraging for a snack, what could I do?<br /><br />Critter Ridder! Manufactured by Havahart (Caring Control for Pets and Wildlife) [I'm not making this up] seemed like my only solution. The company claims that their product is "The #1 selling multi-species animal repellent on the market." The product I obtained came in a 5-pound jug and, according to the label, the granules repel skunks, groundhogs, chipmunks and raccoons. Further information in the small print on the back indicate this can also be used to discourage domestic pets, like dogs and cats, from coming into your yard, flowerbeds, tagging your property, and damaging your lawn, gardens and other mischief.<br /><br />The label also stated that the formula is "Patented & Proven Technology" and sounded like just what I needed. It came with an "Adjustable Shaker Spout and a Comfort Grip Handle. Each application is only good for "up to" 30 days and must be reapplied for maximum effectiveness. The instructions are very explicit that gloves must be used when applying. The printed red sticker on the label [can be seen in the product photo] had a curious claim: "2.5x More!(than 2 lbs.)." Though I didn't expect there would be math involved, I soon realized this was a mildly clever, but completely unnecessary way of letting prospective customers know that this jug contained...2 � times more granules than their 2-pound jug. In plain English, the seal affirmed that the jug I had contained a full 5 pounds of granules. Some advertising is just plain unnecessary.<br /><br />After filling the hole with as much dirt as it would allow, I sprinkled the Havahart granules in the opening and around the burrow according to the instructions on the container. Every good burrow has a backdoor, so I did the same with that exit. Since it is spring (almost summer), this is a popular time for rodents to emerge from a long winter hibernation and stock up on food. I sprinkled the product about a month ago and so far there is no signs of any activity, either digging in or out of her burrow (aka, my home!), which is a thumbs up for this product, so far.<br /><br />CAUTION: When I opened the box containing the jug of Critter Ridder, I noticed that the lid had a built-in pop-up spout for pouring out the ingredients. The label on the container has the expected number of cautionary statements on concerning hazards to exposed skin, eye, clothing and domestic animals. One thing I also noticed there was NO protective seal on the cap and spout. Also, after screwing off the cap in search of a safety seal, I noted that there was a seal over the opening of the jug, but the seal was BROKEN and some of the contents were missing. I doubt that this is the manufacturer's fault. I was probably sent a used container from Amazon.com. I will take that up with them and this discovery will not factor in my product rating. I do think, however, if the manufacturer would put an external seal over the outside of the cap, with a warning not to use product if the seal is broken, it would go a long way in preventing this kind of mistake. In the case of my package, there could have been a spill inside the box during shipment.<br /><br />I plan to add periodic updates to this review as postscripts to provide a complete picture of this products effectiveness over time.

review/text: I'm always cynical about these sort of products... especially the more natural varieties, but this one does work. I don't know how long it will work, it's worked now for about 5 days. I used the whole container so I would have to buy another to refresh it, 5lbs seems like a lot, but I have a lot of area to cover.<br /> It smells good, almost good enough to eat! :) It helped cover the cat spray smell that we have in the front yard from strays. I was very happy about that part.  I used it in a circle around a favorite pooping spot and so far, 3 days later and a light rain, it's still effective.<br />The only thing wrong is that I'll probably need a 25lb container of it to cover all the areas that have been used by the neighborhood cats. Other that, since it works, I like it!

review/text: I cannot speak to every type of animal listed on the product label, but my mother's suburban home has had problems with raccoons for a couple of years. We gave Havahart Critter Ridder a try and it worked, no  more unwelcome visits from raccoons.  We applied the product on the ground around the perimeter of her home where it would be somewhat protected from rainfall by the eves on the house.  The only thing we have had to do is reapply once in a while and problem solved. It is also worth noting that when in the immediate proximity of this product, it smells mildly unpleasant to humans but the smell fades after a couple of days.

review/summary: It Really Depends, Can Work, Might Not
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 7:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>It really depends on many factors, so experiences will vary.  I think you will likely find varying degrees of success, not complete eradication.  If you have multiple pests, then you will probably deter some of them, in which you find 2-4 star reviews.  Or if you have one pest, whether or not it works on that one determines 1 or 5 star reviews.  I am happy with the products attempt to deter and isn't a gimmick, but the value will depend on your level of success.  Based on many reviews, clearly success varies.  At least this 5-lb shaker seems to last longer than the smaller cans at the local store.<br /><br />So it is really just a big can of pepper, mostly black pepper and cayenne pepper which are two of the 3 active ingredients.  Peppers smell and taste unpleasant to animals.  Whether this blend and processing are the perfect solution and cost effectiveness versus wholesale black and cayenne pepper depends.  It isn't a fence or barrier, just a deterrent to make it more unpleasant than the next alternative location for the animal which will hopefully move on and do its business elsewhere.  But you will be fighting against (1) habits that might take time to break, (2) areas previously marked by animals or other droppings that are more attractive that offset or overpower this, (3) if yours is still the least unpleasant alternative to limited or worse options, (4) the animal's sensitivity to taste and smell of this deterrent, and (5) how fast it gets washed away and perform at reduced levels.  You could have an old dog that has lost much of its sense of smell and has been using your lawn for ages and has marked the area that probably would be less deterred to change.  Or a cat's habit and previous droppings might overpower this product.<br /><br />This is similar to you going to the beach.  Suppose rocks litter one side of the beach along with a dead fish that washed up on shore and smells a little.  It doesn't stop you from walking through there, it is just unpleasant to setup your towel or walk around over there.  But you might walk through it to find better sands elsewhere.  But you would prefer to walk to the side of the beach that is sandy with a fresh air breeze.  Your yard is the beach to the pests.  You are just trying to make it less desirable.

review/text: Don't waste your money! Did nothing to repell my racoon problem. They continued to tear up my lawn and garden. You can make your own mixture. Go to your local store where everything sells for less than one dollar. Buy red chile powder and some crushed hot red chilies. Mix and sprinkle where you have the problem. Sprinkle some every week at first then you can tapper off. It works 100% The racoons have NOT returned to tear up my yard! There were also some stray cats in the area....not anymore. I live in the hills and occassionally would see coyotes as well. Have not seen coyotes in a while since I have been using the red chile powder mixture. Not certain if that is a coincidence...but I am certain it got rid of the racoon problem.

review/text: The screens around the pool and deck were breeched.  Finding that a raccoon (in the middle of the night right outside my door) had come in was bad.  Finding that the raccoon had found the cat flap and gotten into the house was much worse.  I had a broken arm the first time and still I went after him swinging a broom and stomping loudly on the reverberating deck.  Yes, he was scared.  He was so scared that he didn't look where he was going and landed in the pool.  He came back a few nights later.  Finally I set a trap with a chicken leg tied in the back over the trip plate.  He was so annoyed that he tossed and turned and moved that trap 15 feet from where I had left it and in turning it over - escaped.<br /><br />I put critter ridder outside on his avenue of approach and carnage.  NO FURTHER INVASIONS !!!<br /><br />Nuf said?

review/summary: Sends squirrel's to the neighbors
review/text: For years I have been dealing with squirrels digging acorns into my lawn in the fall and digging them out the rest of the year.  Nothing, and I mean nothing has worked to prevent this digging damage.  That is until I sprinkled this pepper intensive Critter Ritter on the areas they like to dig.  It has cost me 8lbs of pepper so far, and I am going to order another 8 today.  It is now obvious, squirrels hunt with their nose to the ground -- it is a very sensitive nose -- that cannot handle this pepper.  Result -- no holes in the lawn since.  If you need to get rid of any pests with a nose, this will do it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016PC4TS">Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular 5 Pounds</a>

review/summary: Seems to work for deer, woodchucks and groundhogs
review/text: We have a vegetable garden - tomatoes, cucumber, basil, parsley, rosemary, and mint.  I have seen woodchucks, deer and a groundhog munching on my garden.  We have tried several things in the past to deter them.  The rosemary actually worked to deter the deer, but the woodchucks and groundhog kept coming back.<br /><br />This stuff smells terrible - like a very strong black pepper.  We shook it around the perimeter of our 25 x 15 garden.  We reapply after each rainstorm.  After a week of use, we have not seen any more woodchucks or groundhogs - they were previously daily visitors.<br /><br />So, I would say that this works.  However, it need to be reapplied often (certainly after any rain).  It is quite an expensive solution.

review/summary: May not "repel" but does discourage.
review/text: My home is in a semi-country setting and there are plenty of critters wandering around it.  Although I don't have any specific problems, I am not a fan of the many stray cats that I see (and sometimes smell ) nearby.  There is a sandbox for the children on the property and, even though it is covered, I worry about the cats using it as a litter box.  I also worry about the possibility of animals making their way under the deck and creating nests and homes under there.  My usage of this product would be to deter cats and any other critter that is seeking shelter under my deck.<br /><br />Although I do have a neighbor whose dog does his business in my yard sometimes, I would not use this near the property line of another home owner. Although the product states it is safe to use around pets, the neighbors do not know that.  I don't want to be seen shaking a substance near a property line and have a neighbor think it is to try to harm their pet. I hope that makes sense.  I can deal with picking up occasional dog or deer doo...I cannot tolerate the smell of cat urine.<br /><br />Without cameras monitoring my property, I can't 100% verify that this product works.  I did do an experiment with the family dog.  I did do is sit on the floor, with my dog in the room when I took the seal off of the product.  I placed the paper seal, which had product stuck to the top, product side up, on the floor next to me.  My dog (a large Laborador) walked by and started to sneeze. She is usually a "close sniffer" but didn't even attempt to investigate the seal.  She then walked around me and sat far away from the seal.  She did eventually get up and walk near the seal several times but not close enough to sneeze.<br />The smell of the product was actually somewhat pleasant. It is a mix of cedar, wood and spices.  I sprinkled it around my flower beds, the perimeter of the deck, and in a wide circle around my kid's sandbox.<br />I didn't use it near my garbage cans as this is not an area of concern for me.  I could see the benefit of sprinkling it around the cans or even some inside.<br /><br />Without surveillance tapes, I can say that this works.  What I can say is that, at least with my dog, it discouraged her from coming near the area.<br /><br />Final impression: I like the smell of the product.  It did prove to discourage a dog. I have not smelled cat urine or skunk near my home since applying the product.  I think the price is a bit steep. However, in 30-days, if I start to smell cat urine again near my home, I would shell out the money to buy a canister of the product.

review/summary: $30.00 for just my SMALL front yard; this is not an economical product!
review/text: I was excited to get something to keep the dogs from doo-dooing on my lawn, but there just wasn't enough of this stuff to create a solid border.  I sprinkled it sparingly around part of the front yard, but that is it.  How can it keep the animals away when there is not enough of it?<br /><br />As for the container, it states to wear gloves when handling the product so I was nervous about removing the label which was inside the container.  I didn't know if I should just cut the label or remove the lid.  I ended up cutting the label off.<br /><br />There are little openings that made spreading easy.  The smell of the product is like cayenne pepper and the consistency is like wet coffee.<br /><br />Does it work for animals?  I don't know because I haven't had it down long enough.  If it rains tomorrow, however, I will NEVER know because the product doesn't work after a rain.<br /><br />Would I buy this product even if it worked?  No, because they don't give you enough for it to be a border.  I bought a bag of weed and feed for $30.00 that covered the whole back and front yard.  This costs $30.00 and it doesn't even border the front yard all the way.

review/text: We tried all sorts of stuff to get rid of squirrels, with little success.  They seem to find a way up the downspout and like to build "nests" in the gutters.  It was very difficult to get rid of them.  Most products did little good. "Critter Ridder" by Havahart is helping to keep the squirrels away.  I don't know if its the odor they don't like, or what, but it has worked.  It doesn't take much of the "stuff" to make it work. It's easy to apply and keeps my gutters clean.

review/summary: Works if you use a lot
review/text: I discouraged squirrels from beneath my birdfeeders with a heavy application of this stuff.  It worked until we had rain.  I also spread some in front of my hosta to keep the dogs at a distance, but those two applications, far less than advertised coverage, used the entire container.  I started with a light application, but that had no effect at all, so I sprinkled quite a bit more in the places I wanted protected.  I saw no squirrels where I applied it for over a week, but after it rained they were back.<br /><br />The container handle and pour spout makes spreading the product quite easy.  The material looks about like rough coffee grounds and isn't visible on the ground but would be on a deck or concrete surface.  I didn't find the odor bad at all and could only smell it when I was first applying it.  If it were less expensive, I'd continue to use it for problem areas like around the trash cans and birdfeeders, but as it is the price is a bit high for me, especially when considering the need to reapply after rain (and I presume after watering flowers or shrubbery in the area).

review/summary: Not sure about ingredient safety
review/text: One thing I've learned about critters: Not much is going to stop them if there is promise of a big reward, especially in the way of food.  I doubt this product would work to keep squirrels away from a bird-feeder, for example. And if a yard is overrun with raccoons, it might not make much of a difference unless you eliminate the attractant.<br /><br />Our main issue is the racoons going for our garbage can. We already use a bungee cord, so they can't get into the can. But they can still create a racket. I've sprinkled this product around the area and so far, so good.<br /><br />I took off one star because I remain uncertain as to the safety of this product. There are too many warnings about how not to use it (e.g. in vegetable beds). I don't know if that's due to the pepper, etc,. potentially damaging delicate roots or something more toxic. The active ingredients comprise less than 1% of ingredients. I would like to have known about the 99.3%. Why not say what it is?<br /><br />The product container does sport a "seal of approval" from the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute), which could be legitimate or could be a pesticides-industry mouthpiece. I don't know which one.<br /><br />Here's what it says about OMRI at Sourcewatch:<br /><br />The Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) describes itself as "a national nonprofit organization that determines which input products are allowed for use in organic production and processing. OMRI Listed -- or approved -- products may be used on operations that are certified organic under the USDA National Organic Program. ... Mainly, however, the organization generates income through fees collected for the review of products intended for use in organic production or processing."<br /><br />At any rate, I'm unlikely to use this near any soil where food crops might be grown.

review/text: I use Critter Ridder to keep cats from using my garden as a litter box.

review/summary: Product arrived with granules spilling out of it: two stars for sending a damaged, messy product
review/text: The seal inside was also broken, which made me reluctant to use this as I don't want to kill the pests with a product that might have been tampered with--I just want to keep them away. I could ask for a replacement but am not sure I want to go to the trouble.<br /><br />I opened the box for this noticing no problem, then picked the Critter Ridder up to move it to my laundry room. We only noticed the pointy granules much later in the day on the dining room floor when we stepped on them. It took us quite a while to figure out what they were--did the dog track this in? Had it been on someones shoes? Finally, I remembered opening the box with the Critter Ridder container in it there. I went and looked at the product and saw granules on the side of the plastic container. When I opened the loose lid I saw the white circular protective tab was down in the product and covered with the granules, as were the sides and tops of the container inside, plus the container was only about two-thirds full.<br /><br />I don't like getting something that is damaged and requires more work of me, and I really don't like it when it drops scratchy granules all over my hardwood floor. This did not appear to do any damage but I hate to think of the Critter Ridder being there all afternoon before we swept it up.

review/summary: Sometimes Works
review/text: I live in an area frequented by all kinds of wildlife -- chipmunks, deer, squirrels, groundhogs, foxes, raccoons, and even the occasional bear.  I had hoped that Havahart's Critter Ridder would keep them all at bay, particularly the groundhogs.<br /><br />This product cannot be used on vegetable or fruit gardens/plants.  Although I knew that going in, I decided that I could outline the perimeter of those areas to discourage critter trespassing.  I also had newly planted areas of my property where the deer had nibbled, and I wanted to see if this would keep them out so I didn't have to spray the actual leaves of those delicate, new plants.  Last, I had clear entry points to my property where the deer and groundhogs entered and left, and I wanted to encourage them to find other ways, hopefully onto someone else's property.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the Critter Ridder did nothing to discourage the chipmunks that had already moved into my vegetable garden.  It also did not discourage new animals from visiting.  Veggies must be too tempting to let the scent of Critter Ridder drive them away.  I had much better results around my newly planted areas.  My guess is that this product works best first thing in the spring, before animals have a chance to establish their routines and favorite feeding grounds.<br /><br />The product smells like black pepper when first applied, and then dissipates in a day or so.  Animals supposedly can still smell it.  This 5-pound container doesn't go far, unfortunately, because it must be reapplied after heavy rain.  For those of us with larger properties, one container doesn't begin to cover the perimeter of garden beds and property lines.  I wonder if a large container of ground black pepper would work just as well -- and that could be used in vegetable gardens without toxic results.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

review/text: Among other gardening pursuits, my wife and I have a modest little strawberry patch. However, we also have a local population of squirrels, chipmunks, groundhogs, etc., etc. Thanks to the wildlife, we have yet to see a single ripe strawberry; as soon as a berry begins to ripen, it's a sure thing it will be gone by the next day.<br /><br />So I tried this product on our strawberry patch. I applied it a little more liberally than the instructions indicate, replenished it after heavy rains, and followed all other instructions on the container.<br /><br />The result is... we still have not tasted a single home-grown strawberry. The strawberries are still being pilfered by critter or critters unknown. This product may work for some people, to some degree, under some situations. On the principal of giving the manufacturers the benefit of that doubt, I'm giving this review 2 stars. But in the test just described, I'm afraid it came up a total bust.

review/summary: It either did a great job or no job...not sure
review/text: I put this around our yard because we live near a canyon where skunks love to live, they meander into the neighborhood and then a neighborhood dog will scare them and they always seem to spray a foot away from our house.  The last time, it hurt my eyes so much, I almost cried.  So I put this on the lawn, also where people walk their dogs (you'd be amazed how many people don't clean up after their pets) so the dogs wouldn't use our lawn.  All of this is random, for a month can go by without a skunk visit or a dog messing up our lawn.  My assumption is that this either worked or didn't.  So I give it a three because I am not sure if it worked or destiny just worked its magic. It is easy to apply and looks to me like a mix of black pepper and chili, though it does have other ingredients that I am not sure of, another reason not to use it.  It is a humane way of getting rid of unwanted animals.  I think skunks are rather cute when they aren't smelling up the place.

review/summary: Goodbye neighborhood cats!
review/text: Someone in our neighborhood allows his/her cats to roam freely.  Often, the cats favor our front lawn and shrubbery.  We've tactfully mentioned this to those neighbors who have pet cats, but the problem has persisted.  With the milder spring weather and windows open, the smell resulting from cats relieving themselves on our property has become a constant irritation.  After diplomacy failed, we decided to tackle the problem ourselves.<br /><br />Critter Ridder has been terrific.  The first thing to note is that the granules should be scattered when the lawn and shrubs are dry, so you shouldn't get overly ambitious after a heavy rain.  Product instructions suggest spreading granules every 30 days or after heavy rains.<br /><br />The product contains all-natural materials which undesirable animals will find unpleasant to smell, taste, and touch.  These ingredients include oil of black pepper, capsaicin, and pipeline.  The product does not have an unpleasant odor for humans and is not harmful to kids.  For folks who want to rectify a quality of life problem without permanently harming offending creatures, Critter Ridder is the answer.<br /><br />Please read the directions before just spreading the granules.  It's recommended, for instance, that gloves are worn during the process of spreading.  Also, the directions tell precisely how much product should be used for it to be effective.

review/summary: Effective so far against a groundhog curtain call at a summer den...
review/text: Our house is adjacent to a wooded area that is part of a reservoir watershed area. The woodland critter life is abundant: deer, fox, possum, groundhogs, raccoons, squirrels and chipmunks abound. Individually, cute enough in Disney movies or as babies (except for the possums), but collectively we've experienced the damage they can do when they move out of the woods and into the small area next to the woods we'd like to preserve for human habitation.<br /><br />We tolerate the full, two-entrance ground hog den just inside the woods beyond our back yard, but have had an intermittent problem when these chucks extend their range, and dig a one-hole "summer den" closer to our house. The spoil from the entrance digging is unsightly, and we can also do without the other evidence of ground hog life they leave behind. And if this summer home didn't annoy is enough, our dog can see it from the family room window, and gets more than a little agitated when he sees (or imagines he does) one of them traveling between their homes in the woods and our lawn.<br /><br />Enter Critter Ridder:<br />I applied this liberally to the entrance and approach areas of the summer den. So far this pepper-based repellent has been effective in discouraging the groundhogs from returning. We'll re-apply after the next heavy rain, and then fill in the summer den...again (and keep some in reserve, in case the next crew to appear has no memory of the stinging reception!).<br /><br />I recommend wearing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QXACO">nitrile gloves</a> when using this, and washing your hands immediately after. And don't touch your eyes or face in between!

review/summary: Consider your situation carefully before buying
review/text: This product can be washed away easily.  So consider the area you want to protect:  A garden that you water frequently?  A yard that is covered by a sprinkler system, or is mowed frequently?  If those situations are representative of your problem areas, forget this repellent and keep looking.<br /><br />But if you can keep the product out of the weather and away from the watering, then this will work for you.  I've used it around the perimeter of our pier and beam house--placing it underneath the house about 6-12 inches.  My neighbor's cat likes to hang out underneath the house where it's cool.  We do love Coco dearly, but she started stowing her kills under there--somewhere we can't reach.  Well, she's put some very large dead things under our house this summer and you can imagine the smell that lingers.  This product has put a stop to her habit.<br /><br />I could rate this product five stars because it worked for me in our particular situation, but claiming that it works in gardens is far-fetched.  I wish it worked for armadillos and possums. If Havahart ever develops an effective armadillo deterrent, I'll buy stock in the company.....<br /><br />We used to have a major problem with squirrels and we got them under control using three Havahart products:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HHO2CI">Deer Away 5202 Animal Repellent Ready-to-Use Spray with Hose 128 oz.</a>  We spray it on tree trunks and the dense foliage keeps the spray from washing away in the rain.  We also use two Havahart traps:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UFLIA0">Havahart 1083 Easy Set One-Door Cage Trap for Squirrels and Small Rabbits</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQPGQQ">Havahart 1078 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Rabbit, Skunk, Mink, and Squirrel Cage Trap</a>  The first trap I mentioned is the better choice for squirrels.  (We trapped over fifty squirrels in the past six months.)

review/summary: Difficult to apply and ineffective for squirrels!
review/text: The product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb. per 40 square feet. Impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs. were gone in about 50 square feet (???). If it had some color to it you could a least see where you've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you can't tell. I used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain. I think I will look for a cheaper alternative or I will have the most expensive peaches in the country.<br />  This is a follow up to my review. It has been about 4 days since I sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees. It has not rained but today I was watching the squirrels running through the "protected" area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches. So much for that idea!

review/summary: Critter Ridder to the rescue
review/text: I like cats.  I like dogs.  I just don't like my neighbors' cats and dogs using my flower beds for toilets or digging through my trash cans.  Therefore I ordered Critter Ridder.  It has a strong peppery smell but I like pepper so it didn't bother me when applying.  I would advise not using when windy out, though, because you might get a face full and I fear it would be like being pepper sprayed.<br /><br />The shaker container is easy to use.  I sprinkled in my flower beds and so far (two weeks) no cat visits that I can tell.  But then no rain either and I have spot watered so the repellent doesn't lose its effectiveness.  I also sprinkled some in and around my trash cans.  One dog is pretty persistent and it hasn't kept him away but it does seem to keep the other dogs away.<br /><br />I also have some ground squirrels that have burrowed under my storage shed so I sprinkled out there, too, and haven't seen any activity since I applied.<br /><br />I hope this continues to work and that I don't need to apply too frequently because it is fairly expensive.  But if it lasts at least thirty days as promised I will be happy and will continue to use it.

review/summary: Works, but for less than a week!
review/text: I ordered this because I needed to find something that would keep Lady, my black lab mix dog, out of the garbage.  The mice like to burrow underneath the garbage cans, and Lady loves to dig, trying to get to the mice.  This worked.  In fact, after the first application, she tried to dig under the garbage cans, and she looked at me in disgust and walked away.  Unfortunately, this only worked a week, instead of the 30 days promised.  Lady is back to digging.<br /><br />If this had worked for the full 30 days, I would have bought a year supply of it, just to keep Lady away from the outside garbage cans.  Unfortunately, it is too expensive to apply every week.  I'm still searching for the perfect product.

review/summary: Critter Ridder Works, Along With Your Persistence
review/text: When it comes to nuisance animals, pepper always helps, and this Havahart Critter Ridder's main ingredient is pepper. We have problems with chipmunks and rabbits digging holes in our yard and of course there are the dogs and cats that keep using that same area of our yard to do their business. I always just use regular pepper on the spots of our tree lawn that are dead from the local dogs and cats leaving their business there. Does pepper work? Yes, but you have to re-apply it every single day. The animals must do their daily business, so in a week, they will find a new place, as they hate the smell of pepper- which is great for our lawn.<br /><br />Now, when it comes to hole digging animals, that's another story. You can put a whole can of pepper in a rabbit or chipmunk hole and you will simply see a new hole dug a few inches away. We have found that moth balls, peppermint oil, and pepper placed in a hole will make the animal move, but you have to keep putting these not so great smelling items in each new hole, until that animal will get the hint that moving may be a better option. We finally figured out, that adding tiny stones or gravel in the holes with a little cement to make it hard to keep the animal from digging around helps even more.<br /><br />This Havahart Critter Ridder does work, but not for over a day. You have to reapply it daily, just like any pepper to bother the animal. You literally have to keep at it, so the animal will find it easier to move to another place than to be bothered by you every day. And don't forget for those hole digging animals, that you have to add stones or gravel with a dab of cement in the hole- when you make their bed not so cushy and comfortable, they will eventually find a more comfortable place to live where it isn't so smelly either. By the time you buy all the different moth balls, peppers and expensive peppermint oil, the price comes out to be the same as this Critter Ridder, so it doesn't matter which one you buy- as one is not cheaper than the other.<br /><br />This Havahart Critter Ridder works daily, but your persistence in working daily to get rid of the animals is just as important. Making their existence on your property less comfortable will eventually drive them away to a more comfy home.

review/summary: Works great! 30 Days? I don't think so, Scooter :)
review/text: This DOES DOES DOES repel just about every critter! I put it along my tree line and it repelled the neighbor's pug who loves to dump in our yard. Also, the folks across the street have a cat that loves to poopy in our garden. With this stuff, no issues! The only reason I took off a star is because (to me) it's expensive and it does NOT last 30 days. I suppose if it never rained, it might last three weeks. Maybe..maybe four?? Now if they would just make something to keep my Beagle from running off..because at top speed, this doesn't keep her in the yard! (No, I don't expect it to..just dreaming...)

review/summary: Worked OK For A While
review/text: I got this because I have a problem with the neighbor's cat hunting birds in my yard and a couple of squirrels that love the fruit on my trees.<br /><br />It has a pine-like smell to it and isn't unpleasant. I spread it through my garden because that is where the cat stalks and also the run for the squirrels.<br /><br />For a while (a few weeks) I didn't see traces of either - the cat didn't come around any more and there weren't any fruit pits in the yard leftover from squirrel meals.<br /><br />But after a few weeks, the pits are back and my dog has chased the squirrels again a couple of times. I haven't seen the cat, though. Maybe it is still working for that.<br /><br />If this stuff was around $8-$10 per container, I would probably buy more to see if it might work better with more spread around. At the price it shows now - over $25 - I didn't see enough of an effect to justify the money.<br /><br />Maybe others will have better luck but for about three weeks of protection, it's not for me.

review/summary: Seems to repel the barn raccoon
review/text: I poured a line of the Critter Ridder along the exterior foundation of the horse barn & the feed room to discourage a daily raccoon visit. Every night this raccoon trots in the barn like he owns it, rustles around the hay bales & water buckets and he leaves a clear track in the open. Every single night without fail for months, this creature has made a visit. Yesterday I poured the Critter Ridder and went home. This morning there were raccoon tracks outside the barn in the sand and some scratch marks in a couple of places where the stuff was sprinkled, but no tracks inside the barn! He did not cross it to come in. I don't know how long this will be effective, but this morning there were no vermin signs near the water faucet or buckets and that is a good thing. We'll have to see what happens over the long run and how often we have to reapply for continued results. This is a loose product, sort of like a jar of coarse ground black pepper & if you aren't careful, you can pour too much in one spot & not enough in the next spot.

review/summary: FOR THOSE LIVING IN THE TROPIC ZONE - THIS STUFF IS GREAT! 10 STARS!
review/text: YAY!! A 5 lb Havahart Critter Ridder is not available in my area, only the 3 lb one and it isn't even sufficient! But let me tell you this ... I am just so looking forward to receive this 5 lb Havahart Critter Ridder! WHY? I am so tird of having to buy 2 or 3 - 3 lbs if they are available (and it hasn't been for awhile) just one for the front and one for the back yard!<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE TROPIC ZONE AREAS: (By reason of frequent Thunderstorms / Rains)<br /><br />* Wear your lawn or work gloves, sprinkle up in front (I learned this the hard way) in a scattered motion in areas in the front. Areas you know where stray dogs and dog walkers (especially owners who do not pick up after their dog's business) you know that the dog does his/her business, you will sprinkle a little more than usual without dumping the whole entire bottle.<br /><br />* Garbage Can areas - where Coyotes to Wolves and even Foxes and Monkeys raid into them - sprinkle behind the location is sufficient especially helpful if it is in a covered area and lightly in the front (usually where it is going to get wet anyway and the need to re-sprinkle it later). If you have your wife's panty hose that has a hole in it, use the good area, tie a knot on one end and a knot on the other after sprinkling some Havahart Critter Ridder inside. (If you don't have a wife, you can often find them in thrift stores or buy some on Amazon) On the lid inside,  one end and using a fishing line and poking a hole (depending on what type of garbage can lid you might have; or you might have to drill a tiny hole first ... then thread it with a fishing line to two ends. Now you can safely attach the Havahart Critter Ridder inside of your lid of your garbage can which will definitely will can those creatures that opens it for good! (Replinishing it will not be difficult at all)<br /><br />* Veggies to Fruit Trees - be very careful of how much you sprinkle around them for some of the chemicals you place for the plant (fertilizer to feed) contains some repellants themselves. I had found a more effective way to get rid of them due to frequent rains was the same method to get rid of slugs (beer on a lid) - so SAVE THAT CAP to even sardine tin cans. Placing them around after putting Havahart Critter Ridder sprinkles in the clean lid to tin can; the smell itself will drive them away. Even up in the tree itself and what makes it so wonderful is they are out of sight and you are the only one that knows where they are!<br /> - Fruit Rats can't stand it<br /> - The GOOD snakes merely ignores it while BAD SNAKES goes away<br />  except the danged cottonmouth and rattlers after they had a taste<br />  of this.<br /> - 'Coons - "hasta la bye bye"; once they hit your yard, they do not<br />  forget!<br /> - 'Road Kill Casseroles' aka "Possums" - it is a 50/50 coin toss<br />  on this one, young ones always seem to walk right over it (if you<br />  did what I did or sprinkled it on your garden) but larger ones<br />  including as big as a huge housecats notice it and will turn away<br /> - Squirrels - are Squirrels - so the saying goes "where there's a<br />  will, there's a way" ... we've all had our battles to our wit's<br />  end with them! It does work with younger ones, but older ones are<br />  "none the wiser".  :-/<br /> - "Tom Cats" (Strays or Roaming free Cats) - especially those who<br />  likes to mark their territory (P.U.) and not just dig and all that<br />  those tin cans I use works very well - they can't stand the smell<br />  of it and go somewhere else.<br /> - Moneky See, Monkey Smell - Monkey not like!<br /> - Deer - we get them once in a blue moon, but they just graze on<br />  and move on as they spook very easily<br /> - Foxes - they will appear if they are very hungry, but it's your<br />  garbage or trash can they're after.<br /> - Coyotes to Wolves - same as Foxes, they are not shy, and will go<br />  after anything, even your dog's dog food you've left out for your<br />  dog to garbage (trash) can - daylight or night time. This Havahart<br />  really is effective on them<br /> - Florida Panthers and Hybrids - no effect, when they are hungry,<br />  they are going to raid your garbage can anyway but very quick at<br />  it, take what they want and run off with it.<br /> - Bobcats - while rare here, they do appear once in a blue moon and<br />  behaves just like the Florida Panther and the Hybrids.<br /> - Peacocks / Peahens / Peachicks - just cannot stand it (Havahart)<br />  and are the only birds that are sensitive to it that which I love<br />  so much but one has to give or take - because these birds are just<br />  as destructive as other rodents, critters, and animals.<br />SPECIAL NOTE:<br /> - WILL NOT WORK ON RABIED ANIMAL OF ANY SORT - IF YOU SEE ONE, CALL<br />  IMMEDIATELY PER YOUR COUNTY'S ORDINANCE OR 911 SO THEY CAN CAPTURE<br />  SUCH SAID ANIMAL OR CRITTER. Do not make any attempts to make<br />  contact with animal; and bring all your pets and children inside<br />  IMMEDIATELY and keep track of such said animal at all times while<br />  on phone.<br /><br />==============================================================<br /><br />I have for awhile literally BEGGED major Stores to restock this but they say "demand is low", I find this a bunch of garbage; however, I never knew they came in larger sizes (outside of 3 lb).<br /><br />The BAD SIDE is - once it gets wet, you have to reapply - if you opt to use the same method as I do, due to the Tropical Zone and its weather; which is a wise move - make sure the lid to tin can is dry first before applying sprinkles.<br /><br />In my humble opinion .... it would be NICE if Havahart Critter Ridder would last after several thunderstorms / rain which would spare us a lot of trouble here.

review/summary: Havahart Critter Ridder
review/text: I live in the country so have a large variety of wildlife to contend with.  We have all of the popular attractions for wildlife to make them comfortable nearby; shelter in the neighboring barns, wooded areas and windbreaks, food sources in the fields and neighbor's pet bowls, and water in the nearby streams and our pond.  What more could a varmint ask for, right? So, my question is, why do they come to our, less-attractive property???  The most frequent and annoying of these visitors are the neighborhood cats that leave their gifts in any newly-turned ground (and even in our stone-covered landscape areas), and the !#@*#! destructive raccoons, that have dug up my potted plants numerous times this year and seem driven to climb anything vertical and relieve themselves at the top.  That said, I was REALLY excited to see this offered in my vine selections and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />In looking at the ingredients, Havahart Critter Ridder is almost totally composed of peppers and pepper oil. It looks like pepper and smells like pepper because that's what it basically is.  In my mind, it seems like a lot of cash for pepper that only covers 200-300 square feet but, as with any repellent, herbicide, or insecticide, one must compare the invested expense to the damage or replacement of what it's protecting, right?<br /><br />I have sprinkled it around the areas as directed and, after a few weeks, have had good results.  No kitty-burried treasures or sign of coons or destroyed plantings so far. My concern is the longevity of the product after watering and rains, as they are absolute necessities to maintaining healthy plants.  I like that it is environmentally friendly and does not actually harm the animals because I do enjoy the cats otherwise.<br /><br />I'm reserving my final judgement until further results are known, though I feel that it is a worthy addition to my arsenal as a safer repellent for animal pests.

review/summary: Not that impressed and neither were my dogs
review/text: We live in a rural/suburban town where there are large open spaces.  We have over a mile of open space behind our home that includes many trees and a creek and is a perfect habitat for coyotes, skunks, rabbits, snakes, etc.  Our yard has a tall wooden privacy fence so we don't usually have a problem with critters in the backyard and our two small dogs run free in the yard.  However, erosion and soil shrinkage has made some spots where small animals can creep under the fence. I often worry that our dogs will try to explore outside the fence and come upon bad circumstances. Two days after a skunk "got" both the dogs inside our backyard, I decided (while still de-skunking the dogs) to get this Critter Ridder product.  It seemed like just the thing.  I have used straight cayenne in the past to mark along fences and stop larger dogs from digging, so I thought that the combination in Critter Ridder would do the trick -- keep skunks out and keep the dogs in.<br /><br />I was really not that impressed.  The five pound canister is heavy and does not spread as easily as the advertising states.  It is very easy to apply too much and run out of product before you run out of fence line.  The ad says that this is not offensive to humans and unfortunately it was also not very offensive to my dogs either.  Less than an hour after I applied it on a hot, sunny day my dogs went outside to investigate and went right up and took a big sniff with no apparent problem, pain, or distress.  One lay down beside the fence.  It has now been about two weeks and we have had a couple of rains but there is no detectable scent even when going right up to the area where the product was applied.  Granted there have been no more skunks in the yard (that I know of) but there have been some very nearby and the one that "got" my dogs was the first in 15 years!<br /><br />It seems that this is a well intended product that just misses the mark.  Not strong or long lasting enough and very easy to over use.  If I need such a product again, I will go to the warehouse store and buy a large container of cayenne pepper.  It works better and lasts longer.

review/summary: It's keeping the cats away!!
review/text: Earlier this summer, we updated our front yard.  We put in new flowering plants and covered the dirt with special paper to help deter the weeds from growing.  On top of the paper, we laid down black mulch.  It looks so nice!  The beautiful effect to the whole front of the house is huge.  We're so happy.<br /><br />But, then we started getting cats pooping in our mulch!  GROSS!!  Yuck...  They would come and mess up the mulch and do their thing.  Then we'd have to clean it up.  Not nice.<br /><br />We used the Critter Ridder on half the area.  On the other half we sprayed vinegar.  Both areas have not had any 'kitty gifts' since we applied both products.  The one big difference between the areas: the cats still come and move the mulch around in the vinegar area.  No poop, but they still make a mess for us to clean up.  Drives me batty.<br /><br />This product works great for what we need it for.  It's a 5 star product for us, but I took away a star because it's so darn expensive!  But, it works.

review/summary: Limited use, but it might be right for you.
review/text: Feral cats are the scourge of my inner city neighborhood.  They keep out down rats, but they have been using my carport as a Kitty Country Club.  They howl and fight all night.  They seem to love playing with my motion detector lights.  They get shade from the hot summer sun.  And  they spray their markers like a drunken poker game.  I can use the Havahart trap, but what to do when caught?  I can take them to the edge of town for coyote snacks.  I cannot just kill them, but the noise and using my yard as a litter box is getting to me.<br /><br />Havahart has a couple of other remedies.  This gritty mixture is one that I am trying.  Three weeks and not a peep.  I have not seen one in my carport.  But I cannot give a blanket endorsement:<br /><br />- It lasts only a month under ideal conditions.  I have not had any rain, but that might shorten the life considerably.  It is too expensive to buy 12 times a year.  And while only irritatingly toxic, I am not one who believes in laying down sixty pounds of chemical a year.  So it better make a lasting impression in just a month, which makes sense.  Negative reinforcement is powerful.<br />- It works by repellant odor.  So while a dry climate may mean it will not just soak into the ground, dryness also dampens odors.  But it is working.  They do not like sleeping around it.<br /><br />It covers 500 square feet, which is just right for me; the Amazon description says only 200.  So if I do not get new cats, or the old ones do not return for six months, that would be acceptable, but only time will tell.

In any case it's very hard to tell if the product is working as it's intended to work. I haven't heard any ringside matches lately, so at this stage I can only hope to say I hope it is working. If I find out any concrete evidence, I will definitely post an update.

I know..rabbits are cute...but sometimes they are cumbersome because of the gardens they destroy.  Moles/Voles just jump in to our pool and die there...thus increasing my chemical costs.  The solution: Critter Ridder:  I sprinkled this in front of our flower beds and around this shaded area of our lawn where we have woods... So far the population of rabbits has gone down from 1 dozen to about 3...which is great.  The mole/vole/mice issue from our pool also improved, we are only finding 1-2 a week where as we were finding 6-8 a week.<br /><br />I dont have many issues with the other animals listed on this item..but it does seem to work.  We sprinkled a little less then half of it - which lasted about 3 weeks or so...once I saw more rabbits I went and sprinkled another 1/4 of the bottle - as a touch up.  Voila...rabbits gone.  This is going to become somewhat permanent in my garage...<br /><br />There is a odor that this stuff lets off, so be ready...but that will eventually dissipate and you will be happy with the results.<br /><br />Great item.<br /><br />ps. I have also noticed that snakes dont like it (we have milk snakes and corn snakes around one area)...they have all but disappeared.

review/summary: The cats could not care less
review/text: The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well.  I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre.  One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter, so a week ago, I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most.  No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all.  In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and � containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days.  The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be:  2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70.  From what I have observed this past week, it would not be effective.
