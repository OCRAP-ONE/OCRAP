review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: With the rise in coffee prices, I was on the lookout for a coffee that tasted good, but was still within my price range. I remembered my Mother always used Yuban, so I decided to try it. I was surprised at the quality taste and aroma from this 'canned' coffee.  One of the first things I notice is the aroma when you open the can.  Yuban smells fresh, and does not have the 'burnt' smell that some coffee has. I am happy I re-discovered this coffee.  Try it !

review/summary: Coffee lover
review/text: We ordered two canisters of Yuban coffee from Amazon which was promptly delivered right to our door step.  The day after receiving it, local stores advertised the same product at a lower price!  However we did save on the gas it required to buy it at the store! But even the price of gas dropped! I was disappointed with the Yuban flavor, but realize to get a higher quality taste you must pay the difference.  We probably will do that after we've consumed the Yuban.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I have had trouble acquiring this coffee since moving to North Dakota [several years]. I like Yuban flavor. Strong but not bitter. I may have to pay a bit more, but it only takes 1/2 to 3/4 the amount of coffee compared to standard brands, so the cost facter evens out or is a bit lower. I also find Yuban does not tend to get that 'burnt' flavor when left on a warmer for an extended time. I recommend Yuban for anyone who enjoys coffee with character.

I have always received compliments for the coffee I've served to my house guests and they are often amazed and pleased to learn that it's Yuban.

review/text: It's easy to become a coffee snob when you really like coffee. I've been just a wee bit guilty of that. Times are tight, though. And I remembered Yuban. And I bought some.<br /><br />Some of the reviews I've read stated Yuban is arabican. I don't see the word anywhere on the can, and I honestly don't know. But it tastes premium. This is good coffee! Flavorful, medium-bodied, smooth, rich with just the right balance of acidity. I'm not missing the clean-up after the grinder, either. With Amazon's Subscribe & Save, I'm finding that occasional third cup is not an extravagance at all. It's just the pleasure a good cup is supposed to be.

review/text: I bought this last month and I've been trying it ever since and it tastes good with a decent flavor ,but nothing special ... before this I used the 8 o'clock colombian coffee beans (11oz x 4 bags) I grinded them myself and brew them ,I have to say the difference is huge ,with the 8 o'clock coffee you feel the flavor right away ,every sip it's like a taste of heaven (at least to me) ,I changed to this brand because I thought it was a pretty good deal and since it was ground coffee ,i said ok it can't be that bad ..but now I regret it ,I should've sticked with the 8 o clock coffee ...now I'll have to wait 2 more months til I'm done with this one *sigh*  ...overall if you want an ordinary and economic coffee buy this ,if you want an extraordinary coffee then buy the 8 o' clock coffee  ,you'll pay a little extra and have to grind it yourself but believe me is totally worth it.

review/summary: LOVE THIS COFFEE!!!!!
review/text: I am so glad that I have found that Amazon sells this.....In Los Angeles, where i just moved from, finding Yuban in the big cans was no problem, and it was often on sale at the Smart and Final for 11 bucks for the big can. Should have stocked up, because its about 6 bucks for the SMALL can here in Georgia. Huh? I am absolutely going to buy this coffee from Amazon, two cans for around twenty bucks is a massive deal. People have laughed at me when i tell them my favorite coffee is Yuban, because its made by the Kraft company- but let me tell you, to me, its THE best coffee i have had and I worked in a coffeehouse where we were encouraged to try every coffee on the wall. Now that i have, good ol' Yuban is my favorite. Keep your gourmet blends. And the Rainforest thing they have going on is pretty great too, which is why i tried it initially.

review/text: We've tried other "Columbian" varieties, but we always end up going back to Yuban for the taste.  We stopped buying it for a while because our local grocery store wanted almost $5 for the small 11-oz cans and it got to be a little outside of our cramped budget.  When Amazon started carrying the 33-oz 2-pack for under $15, that was the ticket.  I drink my coffee black and strong and love the taste of Yuban.  My wife, who likes coffee in her creamer, also prefers Yuban over the rest.

review/text: My family and I were Yuban coffee (Columbian) drinkers for about 25 years+.  We absolutely loved this coffee.  The price was extremely reasonable and it tasted like high-end coffee. However, roughly about 10 years ago, Yuban was sold to Kraft (I think) and they did something to this coffee. The coffee was no longer as smooth as it used to be.  My family and I no longer use this brand. I wish they would go back to whatever it was they were doing RIGHT.  Don't get me wrong; it is not bad coffee but just not what I am used to.

review/summary: 34 years of Yuban
review/text: In 1975, I worked in a little bookstore on Broadway in New York, one that stood on Broadway where it was abutted by Waverly Place. There's a shoe store there now, but then it was Samuel Weiser Books, a specialist in antiquarian and esoteric volumes. The proprietors were Freddie and Donald Weiser, the sons of the founder. Early after my employment there, Freddie passed away, leaving Donald as sole proprietor -- and years later, Donald would become director of the most famous of all occultist shops, the Watkins Book Shop in Cecil Court, Charing Cross Road, London, where Aleister Crowley, A. E. Waite, and Madame Blavatsky each pursued their own ideas of ultimate truth.<br />But when Donald ruled at the Weiser bookshop, he was ever insistent on a constant flow of fresh, hot Yuban coffee -- no other brand! Ever! A young man, then, and not at all a coffee drinker, I acquired a taste for this wonderful brew from Donald, and in the years since nothing has changed...Yuban is head and shoulders over every other mass-produced national brand of coffee, and for my taste there are few even among high-priced gourmet coffees to challenge it. Thank you, Donald.

review/summary: Tastes good, large servings
review/text: 1) SERVING SIZE: The amount of oatmeal per packet is almost twice as much as you get from other oatmeal packets like Quaker or Dr. McDougall's. Note that the box weight and number of packs per box in the Amazon item description is likely wrong (it was for me); zoom in on the image photo, instead, for correct weight and count.  If you are making this for kids, you might even feed two small kids with one packet.  When comparing the price, calorie count, carbs/sugar, etc. of this oatmeal to other brands, you can't compare it based on number of packets and price of the entire box alone, because you are probably getting almost twice the amount of oatmeal in these boxes of Nature's Path Organic oatmeal.<br /><br />2) COOKING: Because these packets contain more oatmeal, I needed to add about twice as much water than I would normally add to cook Quaker oatmeal (makes sense!) and about 30 more seconds of cooking time.  Then after I remove it from the microwave I add a few dashes of cinnamon and some milk to get the perfect consistency, just as I do with other oatmeal brands.<br /><br />3) TEXTURE: This oatmeal has a heartier texture, especially with the nuts.  I personally don't like the nuts.  They add a cardboard flavor and unwelcome crunchy texture to an otherwise delicious and smooth cereal, in my opinion.  I know many actually like the added texture and think the nuts taste good, so this is simply a matter of personal taste.  I'm guessing some kids won't like the nuts either.<br /><br />4) TASTE: The taste is not as sweet as Quaker oatmeal or even Dr. McDougall's, but it doesn't really need to be.  The level of sweetness is a tad shy of "just right" for my taste, not enough to add extra sweetener, which is healthier for me to accept the less-than-sweet taste and enjoy the natural goodness. It tastes very good as it is (aside from the nuts -- just personal opinion).<br /><br />VERDICT: However I have to admit that overall my favorite oatmeal is still Dr. McDougall's Light Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal.  Dr. McDougall's oatmeal is the perfect size serving for me (about the same amount as Quaker's) and I prefer the taste of Dr. McDougall's between the two brands.  It is just a little sweeter than Nature's Path Organic, but still not as overly sweet as Quaker's.

review/summary: Best Instant Oatmeal...End of Story
review/text: After chowing this brand of oatmeal for half a decade now (mostly flax plus but I'm now broadening my range with maple nut and it's yummy, too), I'm addicted.  Previous to my addiction, I wasn't all gung ho about oatmeal in general for the most popular brand(s) never twixed my twiggle, even topped with brown sugar or honey or whipped cream, no matter how much mommy set it in front of me.  Why this brand has so captivated me, I can't say.  I mean, oatmeal is oatmeal is oatmeal, yes?<br /><br />Anywho, the cons of this oatmeal is the relative price and a personal issue with flax plus. It's 5.69/box at my local store.  Still, all-in-all, cheap for the breakfast value/serving but buying by the case saves me 40% including free shipping from Amazon.  And, when I'm in a time pinch anytime of day/night, in two minutes, add a banana and I'm sucking down tasty, clean protein on the double for pert near a twofer in cost.<br /><br />In regards to flax plus, (it has flaxseeds, duh...), the flaxseeds are not ground up so you, me, him, her don't get the full flax effect imbibing whole seeds,(it's difficult to metabolize, my doc sayeth) that is supposed to be so killer awesome health-wise. And, (those under 14 don't read this: A percentage of seeds egress in the same shape they ingress, if'n you know what I mean.)<br /><br />In conclusion, if I had to eat only one food source the rest of my life, this is it.  It even beats our Hershey Kisses...barely but still...<br /><br />And you gotta like that...

(I've been disappointed with other brands that basically taste like processed junk drowned in sugar and salt.) Also, unlike most brands, they give you a nice serving size (Each packet contains 50 grams...I've seen some organic brands at about half that. What a rip off!) Anyway, keep the serving size in mind when you're looking at the 210 calories. You're getting a serving that's 40% - 70% larger than what others offer.

review/text: I discovered this oatmeal on a whim when scrounging the aisle of the grocery store while on vacation. I loved the taste from the get-go. The price is kind of high for an instant oatmeal BUT it is organic (which you pay a premium for) and it so much better tasting then the cheaper commercial brands. Amazon's subscribe and save price is great compared to what I paid for it in the grocery store. I would highly recommend this oatmeal if you want to have oatmeal on a regular basis as part of your diet because I have yet to get sick of it.

review/summary: A little pricey, but quick and delicious.
review/text: These are easy quick breakfasts for when you're in a hurry or out camping, etc. The nuts in it are hazelnuts, which is different than the usual pecans or walnuts and lends and extra earthy flavor that's more crunchy. But there are not a lot of nuts in it if that's what you're looking for. They are a little more expensive, but at least organic so they are trying to be more sustainable for a processed quick meal.

review/text: I LOVE this oatmeal and the other flavors too. Can't decide if Maple Nut or Flax plus is my favorite. This is the first oatmeal that actually keeps me from getting hungry again for at least 3 to 3 1/2 hours. I am usually hungry within 2 hours with any other kind. Our Kroger doesn't sell it, and Walmart only had two on the shelf which I grabbed yesterday. If they don't get more in, I am thankful that I can order from here. Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Nature's Variety has changed their formula
review/text: I looked for a long while to find a dry kibble that my cats would enjoy and tolerate. One cannot have rice or other grains. They preferred the previous formula of Nature's Variety Instinct Rabbit meal formula. I purchased a new bag and the cats wouldn't touch it and in fact were repelled by it. I looked at the ingredients and the order, and they were the same until you got to the ingrediant "Natural Chicken flavor" on the old bag. On the new bag, it said "Natural pork flavor."  The individual kibble are flatter and airy and the old kibble was denser and a bit rounder.  Further the old formula says "90%+ of the protein is from rabbit,salmon,chicken, herring meals." The new formula says "75% pure animal ingredients and nutriousl oils."  In any case, there are some differences. I'm not sure if it is the pork flavor, the disc texture and density or even if there is a change in the ratio. THe first bag references the percentage of protein and its identity, whereas the new bage simply indicates the percentage of animal ingredients. I have some sad kitties who loved the old formula. Looking at [...] review of premium dry, it also lists other types that might also appeal to kitties.

review/summary: best dry cat food available
review/text: I work in a specialty pet store that carries a wide range of high quality products for both cats and dogs. I spend a lot of my time looking at ingredients and researching brands so that I can pass my knowledge onto my customers. Natures Variety Instinct is the best quality food on the market, even when compared to other great foods like Orijen, Wellness Core, or Health Extension. Keep in mind that these other foods (with the exception of Science Diet, Iams, and other big store brands) are also very healthy for your pet and are loaded with high quality ingredients. I personally feed my cats Health Extension because it's the best food you can get for the price. However, if you want the absolute best, this is it.<br /><br />A look at the first four ingredients will tell you why. They're all "meals", which is essentially meat that has been ground up and dehydrated to around 10 percent moisture as opposed to 75 percent. Some fats are also removed because meat this compressed would have too high a fat percentage otherwise. Though "meals" do often contain other part of the animal humans wouldn't consider "meat", it doesn't matter to cats or dogs and is actually more nutritious. This food also contains rabbit organs, a few fruits and vegetables, and two different kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />As for taste, I just opened a sample bag and gave some dry food to my cats. They're currently on my table clawing at the bag to get to what's left of it. They absolutely love the food.

review/summary: A lifesaver especially for cats with skin allergies
review/text: We have been feeding our cat mixed canned food and dry (but more of the wet food). She was with Core Wellness Chicken Grain-Free until she had her dental surgery (with tooth extraction and cleaning), and the vet suspected that the antibiotic prescribed caused her to itch all over after a week into recovery. She started to lick and pull her hair with her teeth, as well as excessively lick her legs, paws, back, belly and the scratching was constant. Our poor baby! The Core wellness was good but the vet told us we need rabbit meal or rabbit canned food for our cat to itch less and to rule out allergy from chicken or fish. We got this Nature's Variety dry food (still has chicken) to supplement the rabbit canned food, which is her main food now. She has to have the dry food to snack on otherwise she would not eat the wet food. And she is normally an active cat.<br /><br />It has been 3 days since we changed her diet and we can see remarkable improvements - less scratching, and she's more active and playing and much happier now! We observed that our cat has been drinking more with this food, which makes perfect sense from another person's review and from the package label. It says it has only 10% moisture. By the way, our cat is pretty much healthy prior to her dental procedure, no kidney problems, not diabetic, no hyperactive thyroidism thank goodness. And she has her complete blood profile done before and after the dental surgery. All other organs tested as well. We ruled out flea allergies since we have her on a flea prevention monthly maintenance(Revolution, update: changed to Advantage II) which we apply on her every month since we got her.<br /><br />So if your cat is scratching excessively with generalized itching on the body, and pulling hair (no vomiting, diarrhea etc. just the scratching,excessive licking and hair-pulling) like our cat, it may be skin allergy .. this cat food proved to be helpful to us. It's definitely a lifesaver for our precious cat. We wish to continue using this product as well as the canned rabbit food to keep our cat healthy and itch-free!

review/summary: Best nutrition for all cats, and a livesaver for sensitive cats
review/text: This is an amazingly healthy food for all cats, as previously reviewed. 90% of the protein is from rabbit, chicken, salmon, and herring meals. Since cats are carnivores, I think it makes sense to go for something that is grain-free and gluten-free.  I mix it with Evo for variety for my two cats. They are active indoor cats with gorgeous coats and of healthy weight.<br /><br />For a cat of a friend of mine, this rabbit-based food has been a livesaver. Her cat had such sensitive skin that even on premium pet store brands the poor animal had hardly any fur left on its belly from overgrooming itself. They tried everything! Since switching to Instinct Rabbit Meal Formula, the cat is happy, healthy, and recovered.

review/summary: Stopped the vomiting
review/text: One of my three cats has suffered from loose bowels her entire life, but no other detectable health problems. (Yes, a vet was consulted.) More recently, however, she started putting on a lot of weight and began vomiting horrifically and frequently. We began trying other foods, without success. After more and more research, I decided to try eliminating grain from her diet. We really could not afford a canned-only diet of quality food, and had heard that other cat owners had had success with rabbit-based food for cats.<br /><br />It has been three weeks now with no vomiting, solid stools, and our calico is starting to lose weight. She seems happier and is definitely more active than she had been six weeks ago. Another fringe benefit-- our male cat, who has suffered from nearly chronic tartar build-up (despite two cleanings and "tartar-control" treats), is showing me a cleaner set of teeth and better breath. Thrilled would be understating how happy we are with this product.

review/summary: Cats loved the old flavor, hate the new
review/text: As another poster mentioned, Nature's Variety decided to change their formula for their Rabbit food.  I had finally found a rabbit diet that my sensitive stomach kitty enjoyed, however when I got my most recent shipment (I was on amazon's auto-refill), I was surprised to find the kernels were smaller.  This led me to do some online research and I discovered that they decided to mess with their ingredients.  I don't know how pork could possibly give this food a "better flavor" than before, but my cats HATE this food.  I have one cat that will eat pretty much anything, except this apparently.  Now I have a $40/12lb bag of food that neither cat will eat.<br /><br />As expensive as this diet is, I had expected better from Nature's Variety and I am sad to say I canceled my auto-refill subscription and now have to find a new diet.  I can't believe that a company that prides themselves on producing a diet similar to what cats would eat in the wild would add pork flavor to their food.  I can see a wild cat eating rabbit, but not a pig!  Also, it would have been nice to see this new formula advertised on their bag of food - I had to find out on my own that they had been messing around.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is awesome.  I inquired about returning the food, and although they do not take returns on grocery items, they did refund the full amount.  I wasn't expecting a refund, but was very pleased with their customer service, this is why I will continue to do most of my shopping on Amazon.com!<br /><br />I have now tried the Instinct Chicken flavor and, while both cats do enjoy this food, I am still wishing I had an alternative protein source (i.e. rabbit or venison) in case the sensitivity was actually an allergy to chicken (I'm hoping it's just an allergy to grains, as this is pretty common).

review/summary: Great for food allergies!
review/text: My 13 y/o cat developed a food allergy and my vet wanted to put him on a prescription diet. I tried switching to several different Organic cat foods with no improvement. An acquaintance recommended Instinct cat food for food allergies and said her cats loved the food too.<br /><br />I decided to try it out... Not only did I have immediate results (about a 90-95% recovery), my very picky cat surprisingly loves it. The regurgitation of food that has been a lifelong issue (we thought from eating too fast) has also stopped. The added pluses are that this food is cheaper than prescription food, doesn't require a prescription and has a 100% satisfaction guarantee. My 3 cats seem to eat less of it (maybe because no fillers = full faster), so the cost almost evens out to the Science Diet dry foods I used to give them.<br /><br />Subscribe & Save reduces the price even further and ships for free to my doorstep eliminating regular trips to the pet store.<br /><br />The only downside is that I found the dry Rabbit food has chicken meal & fat and I believe I've narrowed down my cat's allergies to chicken. The canned lamb food <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLKMG">Nature's Variety Canned Cat Food, Feline Instinct Lamb Diet, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> doesn't seem to cause any allergic reaction, but I prefer dry as their main diet and will look into the other Instinct dry foods for one that doesn't contain any chicken in hopes of a 100% recovery.

review/summary: Amazing product, excellent value
review/text: We have been feeding Nature's Instinct Rabbit formula to our cat for seven months now. The change in her health has been amazing.<br /><br />She's about age 12 now. (She's a rescue cat abandoned by the original owner, so we guess she was maybe 2 when adopted.) We had been feeding her a commercial "breeder" food (Purina Pro Plan Salmon & Rice). She was gaining fat and getting sluggish. Her blood panel showed her to be pre-diabetic, with possible kidney issues looming.<br /><br />After researching, we learned that nearly all cat kibble was dangerously high in carbohydrates and relatively low in protein, and that the protein sources were mediocre.<br /><br />Since cats are obligate carnivores, the inclusion of too much carbohydrate does just what it does to humans as we age: It is converted to fat and stored against a possible future of hunger. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses.<br /><br />Also, poor-quality food sources injure the immune system, placing cats at risk for allergies and thyroid problems.<br /><br />It was clear that the high carbohydrate formula was putting our cat at risk. Our research also listed a number of high-protein, low-carbohydrate formulae. We chose Nature's Instinct Rabbit, which is 40% protein and 7% carbohydrate.<br /><br />Within two months, she slimmed down, losing about 20% body weight. She became more alert, spending more time awake and hanging out with us. She became more frisky, sometimes acting like a kitten. Her coat shines and she has that sleek look. Her gait has improved, because she doesn't have to turn her hindquarters out to get her legs around a bulging midsection. Her teeth, gums, and claws look healthy. All other factors, like living situation, have remained constant. The only change was her food.<br /><br />Her annual check-up isn't for two months, but all the signs indicate that her health has improved significantly since changing her diet.<br /><br />Yes, this kibble costs more by weight than commercial brands. But if you look at the total costs involved - vet bills, monthly diabetes or thyroid medicine cost, etc. - and the fact that she eats less quantity while deriving more nutrient intake, Nature's Instinct Rabbit is an investment in your cat's health and an overall excellent value.

review/summary: Inconsistent but a lifesaver
review/text: This food has been a lifesaver (literally, according to my vet) for my 10 year old.  For years he had really nasty (I mean at times explosive) diarrhea and I tried everything from prescription foods, making my own, raw food, medication.  Nothing worked.  This helped almost from the first bite.  Only the rabbit formula worked, none of the poultry.<br /><br />The problem -- very inconsistent.  One bag might be great and the next one he won't eat and/or it causes problems.  I finally bought based on expiration date and when I found one that worked I stocked up.  There is another review posted here that talks about a formula change, but I didn't notice a connection.  The food does look different one expiration date to the next (darker or lighter, the size of the kibble changes).<br /><br />I met a dealer at an expo and he seemed far from interested in hearing about the problem.  If your cat is really sensitive it is definitely worth trying out.  Be prepared for occasional problems and wasted $$.  But it can work miracles.

review/summary: Two Sick Cats within minutes of eating.
review/text: We having been feeding our two young cats the chicken formula for a while now and they seem to be able to keep it down with little problem. Natures variety touts rotational feeding as a one of the perks of the brand so we tried out this formula. even after adding a small amount in with the chicken the cats become sick with a few minutes and vomit out what they had eaten. Eating it alone without the chicken formula with it produced worse results. Just to make sure I fed them their usually raw food at night and they were fine, but the serving of rabbit dry in the morning resulted in nearly instant vomiting.<br /><br />I hope a company like this reads the various review sites and can balance this formula out.

The only reason we even switched was because our petco stopped carrying their food.

review/summary: Tasty snacks
review/text: I've been ordering these as part of Amazon's Subscribe-and-save program and haven't been disappointed. I'm a college student and live in a tiny room with no stove or oven, only a microwave and a small fridge. Needless to say I don't cook at home and buy a lot of microwaveable foods for when I can't afford to eat out. When I'm studying or just relaxing in the afternoon and feel like a snack between meals I'll grab one or two of these and enjoy them. I also keep a few in my backpack and car in case I ever feel hunger pangs on the go. I can't attest to how healthy they are but I can say for sure that they satisfy my hunger temporarily. They are a delicious snack and I haven't noticed a bad aftertaste as I have with other products I eat way too often. I'd definitely recommend them.

Very handy.<br />As for the quality of the snack, I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars if I could. It's pretty good. I wish they had this in a spicy version!<br /><br />Anyway, this was a sweet deal.

review/summary: Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks
review/text: I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper. They are also a bit more "dried out" in consistency. I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew.

review/summary: Great snack for the troops & movie watching
review/text: These taste great, salty and meaty - they hit the spot late at night watching a horror flick or action movie with especially bad acting, but great special effects. Being single sticks in single serve wrapping they also make excellent items to put in your care package to our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Slim Jims don't melt, go stale or wilt in the heat or at the bottom of a pack out on a march.<br /><br />Granted these things are so not health food - I mean come on... the whole point of junk food or comfort food is that it tastes great and makes you happy. Period. If you're worried about calories or sodium intake, then you need to be shopping for something all together different like lettuce or carrots. Don't slam the Slim Jim for being what it is - we all KNOW what it is... it's a greasy, fatty, salty stick of meat in a little plastic baggie made to be eaten in 3 bites with a cold mug of beer in the other hand and a bag of Fritos as a side dish.

Like all red meat, though, it's not good for you, so eat sparingly. I know meat eating is slowly declining, but here where I live, veganism is not seen. So ignore PETA's cries and take a bite out of this.

review/text: They're not quite as tasty as the regular slim jim, but when you want a little more spice these are what you'll need for your Slim Jim fix.<br /><br />Every once in a while you'll get some that have far too tough a skin, and for that a deduction I give them.  I also wish they were lower in carbs.  They can get rid of those carb fillers and up the price if they need.  That tiny bit of carb filler makes a big difference for those of us watching our carbs, and I would love to see those removed, leaving only the carbs used for flavor.  I can only eat a few in a single day because of those darn fillers.  WAH!

review/summary: What can I say?
review/text: The box came filled with Slim Jims! A funny knick knack to set out on your breakfast bar. Add a plate or slotted bank for the quarter and find yourself the talk of the neighborhood (not necessarily in a good way.)
