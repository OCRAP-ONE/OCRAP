review/summary: Would have given fewer stars...
review/text: These are awful!  Do not waste your money.  My 2 year old daughter is a semi-picky eater so when she wouldn't eat them I tried them.  Ugh - I almost spit them out.  The taste was almost sour/bitter, and the texture was not good either - think stale rice crispies.  I threw them all away.  Its a shame because she likes all of the other Revolution Foods that I've ordered, but I will be more careful with ordering in the future.

review/text: The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant.  I thought it was not fresh tasting.  The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only.  Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash.

review/summary: 2 Sweet n Almondy
review/text: I purchased this product today from TJ Maxx.  They just got it in, and it was only $5.99 so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a bit too sweet and it tasted of almond extract instead of the natural gentle taste of real almonds.  My sister in law always brings the most delightful marzipan from Peru when she visits.  I hoped that this marzipan would be similar, but it wasn't.  Although it wasn't perfect, it was still good.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't throw it in the trash--I nibbled until I ate the whole box.  It's also true that the fruit shapes are only painted on top--it's flat on the back.

review/text: I bought this same brand and type of marzipan from a candy company in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was so delicious that I went back the next two days in a row to get more for myself and my friends and family! I had never had marzipan before but was told that Biermann's is the best! I had another type as well recently but did not like it as much! Be careful though - this stuff is so delicious that it is addicting! Anyone want my address? Christmas is coming up and I'd love some more!

review/text: I'm a long time fan of Biermann marzipan candies and when I bought a box the other day, I was disappointed with the taste and wondered if they changed their recipe since last year. While the candies were fresh (not dried out), the almond taste wasn't very noticeable and they had a bit of a tang to them. I probably won't buy this brand again unless they go back to making it with a strong almond flavor like it had before.

review/text: After spending three years in Germany, we became fans of the fancifully-shaped marzipan that was a staple for major holidays.  It's not easy to find these wonderful morsels in the average U.S. shops, and when you do see them, the flavor is not that special.  This assortment is just as we remembered, and family members are delighted to find several pieces in their Christmas stockings.  It wouldn't be Christmas without them!

review/summary: Bitter and Astringent
review/text: I love most of Stash's green teas.  LOVE them.  Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green.<br /><br />This is the exception.  Blech!  It is incredibly astringent, something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green.  I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea.  That sounds absurd to me, but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P9D3GC">Yamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag</a> (which stash also sells, but I couldn't find it here) is flavorful but NOT bitter.

review/summary: Horrible to deal with, bad warranty, unpleasant, many are hard to chew
review/text: We ordered a large sampler of most of their products and some other items from this company's brochure. The cover says "Harvest Fresh taste". So we thought it was like fresh fruit. It wasn't, and, being middle aged, we could not chew it, it stuck in our teeth, and most was drenched in sugar. We tried it all. No one wanted to eat any of it. We were dissatisfied. They also did not send a free item their brochure promises for purchases above 79 dollars.<br /><br />No fear, the second page says "100% guarantee. All our products are unconditionally guaranteed. If you or your gift recipient are not satisfied, please contact us for an immediate replacement or refund. It's important to us that you are happy with your order."<br /><br />So I did and asked for a refund. So far, not on your life. So far they have had roadblocks and stalling, like requests for data on the bottoms of tins, when most items, and there are a lot, are in  small cellophane packages in a large sampler with no tins. A mess and a time consuming, aggravating horror to deal with.<br /><br />Unless you are addicted to candied type fruits, many heavily sugared and tough and hard to chew, and cannot do without, keep away from this firm or find what you like elsewhere. Especially if your teeth are not the youngest. These people do not honor their guarantees and are really no fun to deal with. I emailed many times and called. Both ways were unpleasant. I probably will have to contact my credit card for help.

review/text: I am very pleased with the products and service from Larks Cake and Candy Supply. They have a large selection of many products that I have been unable to find anywhere else. Their prices are great. They package the order carefully and ship immediately. I do quite a lot of baking and am always trying new recipes, so it is really satisfying to have a resource to go to and find whatever it is I need. From ingredients to decorations I know I will find it at Larks. And because they always get the order in my hands -usually sooner than promised- I can plan my schedule with confidence knowing they will come through every time. Larks is my go-to for all of my baking needs. I highly recommend them any time, and especially if you can't find what you are looking for anywhere else. Go to Larks first - you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Wow this stuff is dangerous to have around if you're on a diet, it's so good!
review/text: I picked up one of these large containers of Fontana Caramel Sauce to use when making espresso drinks. It's sold at Star Bucks website, so I figured it was the same kind they used in their stores. The taste of this stuff is incredible! This is be far not just for drinks. This would taste amazing on ice cream, in a bowl for dipping apple in, etc. It's probably the best caramel topping I have ever tasted. It's just right in every way. Deliciously sweet, but not in an overpowering artificial way. I figured the jug would last forever, but this stuff is so good, it's hard not to sneak a spoonful of it to taste on it's own, ever time I'm near it making a coffee or tea. We will go through this container long before the expiration date ever gets near. The pump works really well, producing about a big spoonful with every press. I've had no issues with clogging or dripping, and when I received it, it had just been bottled about 2 weeks prior. So it wasn't sitting on a shelf for very long. It's a delicious topping that I will definitely be ordering more of when I run out!

review/text: I purchased this sauce after figuring the saving on iced coffee would be almost $1200 over the course of a year. It is delicious with fast shipping and is easy to use. Just two pumps and it tastes just like Starbucks. The only thing i have against this is when you let your iced coffee sit for a few minutes, a clear grease-like substance will form into globules. I imagine as coconut butter is one of the main ingredients that this is merely a byproduct of the process. Still i will purchase more of this product when i need some.

review/text: This is my sauce.  I claim it.  You all stick with your tabascos, franks and whatever else you like - this is mine.<br /><br />On a serious note - delicious stuff.  I have a long history with hot sauces and I have tried a wide variety.  I keep coming back to Matouk's Flambeau though - it isn't the hottest sauce out there but it is the tastiest. I am not sure why it tastes so damn good, but if you can put up with the heat it will take the place of ketchup in your house.<br /><br />I think the key may be the use of pickled peppers.  That seems like a rare choice in the hot sauce world.<br /><br />Taste - 10/10  The Habanero is one of the best tasting pepper's and this sauce is full of it.<br /><br />Heat - 6/10  This is the hottest of Matouk's line.  I have seen others mention they felt other Matouk sauces were hotter, but for me (and heat is a personal thing, some sauces will hit different people differently) this is easily the hottest.  That said, it is still a habanero based sauce and those will only get so hot.  This won't have the kick of a Naga or Butch T Pepper type sauce. It also won't hold a candle to the extracts, but it is still hotter than average.  If you find Franks red hot or Tabasco really hot then this might be too hot. Id estimate that this sauce is 5x ashot as Franks Extra Hot.  Total guess really.

review/summary: Best Hot Sauce on the Planet!
review/text: This is a great tasting hot sauce with some intense heat. Scotch Bonnet peppers give it the intensity. I had a tough time finding this hot sauce after having it on a vacation. The price for 4 bottles was pretty reasonable. If you are timid about intense hot sauces, this will be too hot for you, but if you like a great flavored sauce with heat that numbs the mouth...This is it!

review/summary: French Roast, but not the Best Roast
review/text: SUMMARY: If you're looking for a dark roast with full flavor for your Tassimo, keep looking. Hey -- it's Maxwell House after all. Check out the newer Gevalia Dark Roasts.<br /><br />DETAIL: After Starbucks severed its relationship with Kraft, I was looking for a decent brew for my Tassimo brewer. The Maxwell House French Roast was Kraft's early attempt at this, and it disappoints. It's OK if you stop the brew short, but it's a bit weak if you let it go full cycle. It's arguably the best Maxwell House offering, but it's no Starbucks.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you miss Starbucks, but want to keep the flexibility of the Tassimo, check out the three Gevalia Dark Roasts (Breakfast, House, and Italian), as these more closely resemble Starbuck's Breakfast, House, and Verona blends, respectively. These three form the core of my one-cup brewing, supplemented by a number of espressos and cremas available (Mastro Lorenzo being my fav).

review/text: I have been using the 2-oz. EZ-Sweetz bottles, but this .75-oz packaging is currently a better deal on Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />There is some confusion in reviews about whether this comes in the same strength as the larger bottles. The packaging clearly states that 2 drops = 2 teaspoons, which is identical to the strength of the larger bottles. My subjective experience is that this is correct. EZ-Sweetz comes in .2-oz and .5-oz bottles also, so perhaps the confusion comes from some other version.<br /><br />There have been complaints about the bottles also, but I have not had any trouble so far. I have found it's possible to open up the bottle and transfer its contents into one of the larger ones if desired.<br /><br />All in all, a good deal for low-carbers who don't want the ghost carbs of the powdered versions.

review/text: I've been using EZ Sweetz for about a year.  It is a great product - very convenient for traveling (I keep one in my purse) and when cooking it doesn't suffer from the reduction of sweetness that you get with powdered sucralose.  It has no carbs and no effect on blood sugar levels, so its great for low-carb diets and diabetics.<br /><br />I couldn't believe the deal Amazon offers on this, but when I received my order, I discovered 0.75 oz bottles offered here are half the strength of the same size bottles sold on the EZ Sweetz website. It's still a great deal, coming in at about 1.5� per serving, but its not what I thought I was ordering. I feel a bit cheated as a result.<br /><br />Re: the clogging tips: just stick a needle in the tip.  You will get some of the product building up on the tip (and in the lid) over time, but it will break off.  The resulting powder is very concentrated, so dissolve it in a bit of water before using. I've used about 5 bottles up and not a one was wasted.

For awhile I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan, Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, Tully's French Roast Coffee K-Cups, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast, Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend and Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold.<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee, Emeril's K-cups, Big Easy Bold, Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights, Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda and Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven: Tully's Full City Roast Coffee, Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend, Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark and Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve.<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in red sharpie, of course, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors that I'm going to wind up with. I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on coffee. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.

review/summary: Not my favorite but my college kid loves it
review/text: I was slightly (SLIGHTLY!) disappointed in this flavor.  I expected the chocolate to be more chocolaty.  Instead, the coffee was a little on the bitter side and it smelled much better than it tasted.  My college age daughter on the other hand, digs through all the flavors of K-cups to find this one flavor instead of hazelnut, vanilla and southern pecan.<br /><br />As for the person with grounds in her cup, look in the instruction booklet on how to clean the brewer.  If cleaning doesn't solve the problem, make sure you are using the machine properly (don't open the K-cup!).

review/summary: Okay, so it's just barely flavored with chocolate -- but it is good coffee
review/text: I've now tried every one of the K-cup varieties that has chocolate, cocoa, mocha, -- and now mud (!?) -- in its name, and none of them is even close to actually tasting like real chocolate. -- which is surprising since it would be soooo easy to slip a gram of real cocoa powder into the little cup.<br /><br />However, in spite of the not-quite-full-chocolate effect of Mudslide, the cup of coffee itself is still good.  vibrant, mellow, and smooth -- especially in the afternoon.  And it holds up to a good splash of cream/creamer.

review/text: I'm very happy with the two Gloria Jean's flavors I've tried (this one and Cappucino).  So many of the other flavored K-cups come out very watery when you brew the larger cup size.  Gloria Jean's are not too strong (I'm not a fan of Starbuck's style coffe), and not too weak.  I'll definitely order this flavor again and look forward to trying some of the other flavors.

review/summary: Fabulous stuff - our dogs can eat anything with no more diahrea
review/text: This wonderful stuff has made such a difference for both our dogs.  We have used it for about 4 years. Our younger dog frequently had runny stools - the vet often put him on powerful anti-biotics for the diahrea.  Since I started adding a tablespoon of this to all his meals, he can eat anything (including raw meat) with no loose stools, ever! (My dogs are currently eating primarily a fresh food diet that I prepare.) A vet suggested Wysong C-biotic for the pro-biotics, but I believe it also has digestive enzymes that our dog may have been missing. Our older dog had terrible allergies. She was on a variety of meds and even received regular allergy shots.  Adding this to her meals made a significant difference.  It didn't make sense to me, but her old vet (who is not very holistic) said it made perfect sense.  The immune system is based in the gut, and it is the immune system that goes haywire and creates allergies.  Getting the old dog's digestive track working better helped her immune system work more normally. (Not to say her allergies are gone, but it is as helpful as many of the other things we do for her.)  The dogs love the taste of it too!

review/summary: Rice never softened well enough.
review/text: I know that brown rice takes longer to cook so I was shocked when the box called for letting the rice simmer for 25 minutes.  I let mine simmer for 35 and fixed 2 kiddie plates before I tasted the crunchy mess.  I set the timer for 20 more minutes and put the lid back on..it did soften up a bit but I make my brown rice to be almost as soft as white rice.  Maybe next time I will try making this in my rice cooker since it does a beautiful job on plain brown rice.  The flavor was really good on it though.  Just cooking time was the problem.
