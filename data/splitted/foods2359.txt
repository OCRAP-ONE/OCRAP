review/summary: Absolutely delectable!
review/text: I have had some really tasty chips in my lifetime, but I have to say, these are the most delectable ones I've ever had. Don't let the tame-sounding "garden tomato and basil" scare you into thinking they're mild-flavored. They're not-- they have a tangy, slightly spicy taste that packs quite a punch. I wouldn't be surprised if other chip manufacturers tried to imitate this flavor because it's so delicious. Five stars from me, but with a word of advice-- stay very far away if you're on a diet. Once you eat one or two chips you won't be able to stop until you finish the entire bag!

review/summary: Possibly the worst chip ever
review/text: I don't eat many chips these days, too much sodium  etc., but every once in a while,I like a good chip.  This is not one of those.  My hubby came home with these and I was initially delighted...  What ho, chips!! I said.  Then I tasted them. There was only one word:  Bleck.  I have tried to remember when I had before had such tasteless morsels, but my early childhood years elude me.  Anyhoo, don't eat these nasty little buggers, they suck.

review/text: Not knowing this was a Kraft Foods brand, we bought this in Paris and brought it home to the US. It is one of the best whole bean coffees we have ever had.

review/summary: A Real Delight
review/text: We have tried many coffees and a number of home coffee makers but have  been unable to brew anything to match the quality of the coffees we enjoy in our favorite restaurants. But this morning we tried the Carte Noire given us as a Christmas gift. What a delightful surprise. It has that "blackness" that we associate with good coffee but none of the bitterness. It is unquestionably the best coffee we have ever made at home. And with a small addition of Irish Creme syrup (another Christmas present), it was simply quite wonderful.

review/summary: Best commercial coffee, ever
review/text: I found Carte Noire in France in 1993 and started bringing packages back with me three or four times each year.  What captured my attention so firmly?  What makes this coffee so great?<br /><br />It is unusual simply because: (1) It is 100% Arabica; (2) It is 100% Colombian.  (3) It is roasted by the French.  There is only one other coffee with this particular rare pedigree, and it is good, but not quite as good as Carte Noire.  Amazon's ad terminology calls this an after dinner coffee.  I disagree with them.  We have always used it exclusively in the morning, as do the Europeans who value its rich taste.<br /><br />This coffee is bold but not overpowering.  It avoids giving you a thin or a bitter coffee taste.  One package of 250 grams (very finely ground) will last for exactly five days when brewed in a 12-cup pot.  My coffee philosophy is this:  If you're going to drink coffee, buy and drink the best one you can find anywhere.  This is it.  I wouldn't lie about something this important.

review/summary: Great French Coffee
review/text: My wife and I found this coffee in France during a "coffee buying spree".  We bought a little of everything and enjoyed them through out the year.  One of the more inexpensive brands (in France) is Carte Noire.  It might be common coffee in France, but to us it was the absolute best.  We order several each year.  I'm the hit with my fellow adults when I bring it to a Boy Scout camp out. My fellow adults even pout when I run out.<br /><br />This is some great stuff and the seller does a nice job in shipping it.  Be aware that sometimes it is out of stock, so you might join us and order a few and stock it up in the freezer.

review/text: I'm a Japanese tea fanatic and drink many different varieties, preferring Genmaicha or Hojicha for a good daily drink, saving the better ones (premium sencha, Matcha, Gyokuro, etc.) for special treats.  Love genmaicha for it's roasted flavor, but always look for a good quality sencha behind the fairly forward rice taste.  This tea, turns out, is from China not Japan, I found it a little bitter, not the soft welcoming flavor of a high grade genmaicha.  A good price, but getting what you pay for.  Not finding myself reaching for it among the options in the shelf very often after the first couple tries.

That was almost 15 years ago. We now have one of those thousand dollar plus machines, but my perfect little wife still gets up every morning and makes us that perfect little cappuccino with torani flavoring.

review/summary: The perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea or coffee
review/text: Some foods are just meant for each other, cheese and crackers, bread and butter and for me, biscoff with coffee or tea.  The best part about these decadent little cookies is that a little goes a long way, two cookies with coffee and I'm set.  No need for a third, they have just enough crunch to get me through a quickie morning break and are sweet enough for an after dinner dessert.  They even change my outlook, I feel somewhat refined dipping my biscoff into my coffee, my cup doesn't match my saucer and they are both chipped and old, but still, they wouldn't taste any better served from Wedgewood china.<br /><br />Best of all, I found these cookies at my local grocery store.  My store has a nice little selection of holiday foods out for Thanksgiving, you know the stuff, things like packets of mulling spices, pretty jars of marmalade, bottles of sparkling cider and eggnog flavored tea and nestled in amongst the plum ham glaze and cartons of bright green fruitcake cherries were white packages of biscoff, they were a great price too, 25% off!  When I went back to the store two days later to stock up, I found jars of Biscoff spread for three dollars each, SCORE!  So I bought four of them, plus even MORE biscoff cookies.<br /><br />I have enough to last me several months now.  My life is good.

review/summary: "AIRLINE COOKIES" -- a luscious and still sane delight!
review/text: Oh, I'm so glad to have found these on Amazon!  Our local independent grocer carries them during the holidays, and we just finished the last of the ones we've been hoarding since last December.  These have a very soft, pleasant taste that grows on you.  One of these shortly before bedtime makes me feel calm, relaxed and quite self-indulgent, although they're actually more nutritious than you might think.  A very desirable item to stock in the pantry for last-minute entertaining, or to bring along when visiting a sick friend or a shut-in.  They're actually good for settling a shaky stomach (must be the ginger and/or cinnamon?!), which may be one reason Delta gives them out as in-flight snacks.  They're fabulous with a dish of ice cream or fresh fruit, or with port,  brandy, cream sherry or a liqueur after dinner.  They work well as an item for elegant receptions.  We like to offer them at dinner parties along with coffee and dessert.  Unlike many cookies, they go as well with morning, afternoon or evening tea as with coffee, and of course they're marvelous on their own.  I just ordered 2 packs of 5 and will be ordering more before those are gone.  Hooray!  If you haven't tried them yet, maybe you'd like to: I bet you'll love them as much as we do!

review/summary: Great Product HORRIBLE Shipping Price
review/text: Cheri's Prickly Pear Syrup is far and away the BEST prickly pear syrup you can buy. But when you charge $9 for shipping a 12 oz bottle??? Everytime I'm down in AZ I always buy pleanty of extra bottles and ship a few to friends. And I've never spent HALF this price to ship a bottle anywhere in the lower 48 states. I mean, c'mon, the USPS provides boxes, tape and labels to send the stuff Priority Mail. If you're desperate for Cheri's syrup and don't mind waiting a few extra days for "processing" before it even gets mailed out, what the heck, go for it. After all, it's only money, right?

This bad review is just my way of warning others out there that think ordering grocery is safe with Amazon.  It's not!  I've ordered grocery multiple times and have had packages arrive at my doorstep busted and crawling with bugs.  It's so upsetting to get a package like that, particularly when you find out Amazon does NOT give refunds or extend credit for faulty shipments like these.  Trust me, it's not a good deal to buy from Amazon when things arrived ruined.  It's cheaper to just buy it at the grocery store!

review/text: I love sweet tea, but I wanted an alternative to your normal black tea that is used to make this and that was caffeine free not just decaffeinated. I found out about Rooibos tea which is naturally caffeine free. Initially I just bought the regular rooibos tea and added peach flavoring from a local coffee shop. Then one day when I went to purchase another box of tea a sales associate recommended that I try Bigelow's Organic Rooibos with Asian Pear Tea. The first thing I noticed about this tea when I started making it was how good it smelled, and the taste...Let's just say I haven't gone back to the regular tea and peach flavoring since. Plus I save alot of money not having to add the separate flavor. I love this tea, and everyone should try it. Also on Amazon this tea was less than if I had bought it in the store. Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: The Tea For You, Too!
review/text: If you are looking for a pleasant cup of tea, this is a good choice.  Red rooibos tea is fun on it's own, but the addition of asian pear puts it in a league of its own. They have added just enough pear so that you know that it is there, but it doesn't overshadow the tea or taste artificial. Also, there isn't any caffeine, making it a great beverage to end the day.  I generally don't like herbal tea, as they tend to taste like grass and weeds (IMHO), but this tea is very palatable and does not make me think of cows grazing in the pasture. Originally used this tea in the k-cup form, and truly enjoyed it.  Recently the k-cups have become unavailable, and after a more indepth search found that this tea comes in bag form.  It is truly a better value, at approx. .17 per cup versus .54 for the k-cups when you take advantage of Amazon's auto delivery system.  In addition, each tea bag comes in its own sealed pouch so that you can take it with you and enjoy it any place that has hot water and a cup.  And, finally, this tea makes a great iced tea, and having it in bag form allows you to make a whole pitcher, not just a k-cup serving. Highly recommend this rooibos pear tea as an addition to your year round beverage menu.

review/summary: Fine tasting and healthy tea.
review/text: I was given a box of Bigelow Organic Rooibos(roy boss)tea for Christmas and just looked up the health benefits of this tasty beverage.  The site I visited said that this tea has the ability to inhibit skin tumors.  Additionally, rooibos tea is commonly used for respiratory disorders.  Also, the antioxidants of rooibos tea may be useful in helping to prevent the changes in the aging brain.  With a teaspoonful of honey added to it, the tea has a sweet pear taste that I think is delicious.  The fact that it appears to be a healthy beverage is an added benefit.  I will be ordering this product from Amazon when I run out of my Christmas gift.  Highly recommended.

Taramosalata is supposed to be a mixture of tarama (carp roe) and either bread or potato as a filler, plus olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, or whatever your recipe calls for.  This stuff, which calls itself taramosalata, is tarama mixed with water and canola oil to stretch it.  You get a product which, however nice tasting, has 60 calories and 6 grams of fat in a TABLESPOON!  Buy the tarama and make the taramosalata yourself.

I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

review/summary: Exactly like Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Caramel Apples
review/text: I ordered this caramel, and in the beginning I made a huge mistake and gave it a 3 rating because even though I thought I was doing everything right-I wasn't. I have learned so much from practicing with my caramel apple maker. It deserves a 5 rating now that I've learned what to do.<br />For you novices: Use Fit fruit cleaner to get the wax off of the apples, then make a mixer of half lemon juice half water and wipe the apples off with it-allow to dry before dipping in caramel. This will help caramel to adhere. Also, do not dip the apples when the caramel is really hot. I believe the 'magic' number was to dip them when the caramel was approx 86 degrees. Place in fridge for 15 minutes after dipping and then take them out.  I do not like my caramel apples cold...but if you do, they can be left in the fridge.<br />This caramel is by far the best one sold on Amazon or any other site. It tastes just like Rocky Mountain Choc Factory Caramel, and theirs is homemade!<br />I give it a total 5 stars now!!

review/summary: New Caramel source for my pantry
review/text: I recently purchased my first 5lb block of Peter's Caramel. For Easter dinner this weekend I decided to make a Turtle cheesecake. So today I pulled out my new box of Peter's caramel. I was amazed at how easy it was to work with this product. It comes sealed inside a plastic bag and in a box. The caramel is fresh, has beautiful stretch, is soft and pliable, and has a fantastic homemade caramel flavor. It was quick and easy to mold into turtle sized caramel pieces. (Sad to cut up my beautiful handmade Turtle candy into tiny pieces to sprinkle on the top of the cheesecake.) I must also add that I like the flavor of this Peter's Caramel better than the Mercken's caramel I have bought in the past. This caramel melts easily and will work well with caramel apples in the fall. Also will make candy making at the holidays shorter since I won't be making caramel from scratch any more. This caramel easily matches anything I can make homemade in my kitchen.<br /><br />I simply resealed the original packaging with my Foodsaver sealer for storage. According to the manufacturer this product will last approx 1 year but it will never get the chance to get that old in my pantry. This is definitely a new staple for my pantry.

review/summary: Shipping takes it's toll
review/text: I chanced having these shipped because it was a great deal. They arrived in good enough shape for the price I purchased them for but would never have the product shipped at it's normal rate as some of the pop-tarts end up being crushed/crumbled from being bounced around in shipment. There is no way for Amazon to correct this either as the pop-tarts package just isn't packed tight enough to stop the product from banging against each other.

review/summary: 48 turns into 96 during shipping
review/text: Variety pack of 48 Pop-Tarts for the price of two 8 packs? Awesome deal... until you find out what you have when they arrive!<br /><br />I should have read the other reviews before purchasing, as I too experienced the 48 Pop-Tarts turns into 96 Pop-Tarts effect that UPS shipping has on these. The problem is, there's not even a way that Amazon can fix this. The Pop-Tarts sit loosely in their 12 pack boxes (inside the 48 count box), so even if Amazon were to pad the mess out of the master shipping box, the Pop-Tarts would still bounce around inside the smaller box as UPS drop-kicks your box from the side of a Boeing 747.<br /><br />If you don't mind Pop-Tarts that are pretty much all broken in half, go for this deal. I mean, they ARE still edible. I'm going to pass on ordering them again, though.

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's Pop Tarts are a good source of GMOs! They hit a home run here with 4 out of the 5 biggest GMOs in these products. Kellogg's just spent $632,500 on propaganda in California because they don't want you to know that Pop Tarts (and their other products) contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. That's right, folks... the corn and cottonseed oil in these Pop Tarts comes from GMOs that are registered with the EPA because every cell of the plant makes it's own pesticide. When the insects bite into it, their stomachs rupture. We can only guess what happens when kids eat this stuff. The toxins have been linked to cell membrane death in humans... and have been found in the blood of 93% of pregnant women and 80% of their unborn babies in a recent study.  Pop Tarts also contain GMO sugar and GMO soy. Both (AND the corn and cottonseed) have been engineered to withstand heavy doses of RoundUp. Glyphosate, the active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, has been linked to birth defects, organ damage, inflammatory bowel disorders, cancer and who knows what else. GMO soy caused sterility by the 3rd generation in two studies done on lab animals. I wouldn't feed this stuff to my pets. It hasn't been subjected to long term peer reviewed studies to prove that it's safe. Kellogg is fighting against labeling of GMOs in California. It's no wonder why! My family does not eat EPA registered pesticides. We are saying NO to Kellogg's GMOs.

review/summary: Pop Tarts Contain an EPA Registered Pesticide - DON'T EAT THEM!
review/text: Kellogg's Pop Tarts (and most other products from Kellogg's) contain many GMO ingredients. Their corn based ingredients are genetically modified to create pesticides within the cell of the corn plant, so that it can't be washed off.  In fact, this corn, called BT corn, is an EPA registered pesticide!  That's right, the corn itself is an EPA registered pesticide. The French government is working to BAN BT corn because of health and environmental concerns.  Pop tarts also contain many other genetically modified ingredients, including GMO soy and others.  Plus, Kellogg's has spent over $600,000 to prevent the labeling of GMOs in California by funding misleading ads about Prop 37, which is a simple bill that will label GMOs in California.<br /><br />I would not eat this toxic product!

review/summary: Not what I orderd and NO customer service!!!
review/text: I orderd a box of brown sugar/cinnamon and strawberry pop tarts. I received a box with strawberry, blueberry, and cherry (over a week later, btw). This did not work for me considering my family doesn't like blueberry or cherry, otherwise we probably would have just eaten them anyway. When I tried to return to item or even contact the seller, guess what? No can do! You cannot return this item and there is no contact info for seller. I, then, contacted Amazon directly and they refunded my money for me instead. Amazon is great, but this seller and product, I would not recommend to anyone.

review/text: And we wonder why there is an obesity epidemic in this country? Because manufacturers "Super Size" junk and garbage food! One review here says their "Family has been annoying them for a week!". Really? They obviously have been drinking the Kool Aid and have been lead to believe this garbage if 'food.' It's not, and anyone who feeds their family, especially kids, this crap should be arrested for cruelty and child endangerment. High fructose corn syrup, artificial coloring and flavoring. And you think this is food? No wonder America is the most obese country in the world.

review/summary: A Really Great Value
review/text: I've read a lot of reviews that say their poptarts came 'crumbled' because the package jostled. But I live in a remote part of Alaska where our mail is literally dropped off of a plane. But these poptarts came in perfect shape. Our store is so expensive and these were just too good of a deal to pass up. Inside the box where four smaller normal-sized poptart boxes, which made for really convenient storing. I love poptarts. My kiddies aren't a huge fan of the brown sugar ones, but I like them. My family is more of a strawberry, blueberry, raspberry eating kind. I wish I could find a variety pack of those. I would definitaly purchase them- as this box was a really great value in my opinion.<br /><br />My Personal Tips:<br />My kids love to take these camping. They're good cold, but if you set them on top of a campfire and let the sugar carmelize they are sooo good.<br />We like to dip them in canned milk. Kind of like oreo cookies- except fruity.<br />To keep them from getting smashed when you travel put them in a tupperware sandwich container. It's just the right size and keeps them from crumbling apart.

But, since it showed on the box that roughly half would be Brown Sugar Cinnamon I decided to purchase.<br /><br />When I opened it, it was Cherry, Blueberry, and 2 of Strawberry.  NO B.S.C. as advertised. (no where else in the product description does it indicate "only fruit" or "no Brown Sugar Cinnamon") Now I'm stuck with almost 100 Pop Tarts I really don't care for.

review/summary: A fairly tasty cheap thrill
review/text: In the past, I have absolutely hated pop tarts. I just couldn't imagine why someone would actually eat them. However, my girlfriend loves them, and things were running a bit tight on the grocery expenses front. I certainly wasn't in a position to start buying Ben and Jerry's. These took the place of such expensive gourmet treats. I figured that $8.53 for 48 of these thingys made it a cheap way to stretch our dollars for a week.<br /><br />I think the Amazon description said assorted flavors. We received strawberry and brown cinnamon. Maybe different shipments have different flavors, but I wasn't going to argue given heir low cost. We received four boxes. Each box has six foil packets. Each packet has two tarts.<br /><br />OK, OK, I actually dug into these before my girlfriend. Properly toasted, they're pretty decent. The pastry shell (I guess I can call it that) was not overally doughy or pasty. The filling tasted the way the box said. A single pack of two is reasonably filling as a dessert.<br /><br />Kids and pop tart afionados would probably give these five stars. Given the fact hat I really had expected a one-star treat, I think the four I'm giving this is pretty good.

review/text: Who doesn't like pop tarts?! I bought a box of these since they were at such a great deal and I have to say I've had enough for quiet awhile! I could buy maybe 24 pop tarts for the price I bought this 48-count box for on Amazon so it is a great deal! However, the downside is that almost every pack was crumbled and the pop tarts weren't whole, I'm assuming during shipping and UPS not knowing what's inside the box they just throw them in the truck. I will be donating the unopened boxes I have left to a local homeless shelter as I figure they could be happy to have a broken crumbled pop tart than no food at all.
