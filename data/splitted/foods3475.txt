review/summary: Excellent coffee!
review/text: My wife's sister sent us Highlander Grogg coffee from another coffee maker in St Lois, and that became my new favorite coffee.  I had to find another solution when we ran out, and luckily found this on Amazon.  Boy, am I glad I did!  The flavor is awesome, and the price is reasonable.<br /><br />Once opened, I store the bag in the refrigerator as recommended on the package for freshness.<br /><br />WIll definitely buy again.

review/text: Love this flavor.  It is subtle but there.  Not sweet.  Just the right flavor to make you sip again to try to capture that taste.  Coffee is not strong either.  Right balance of flavor and coffee strength.

review/summary: Does not rate well!
review/text: My husband has been buying his Highlander Grog for 4 years from a local coffee shop. Sadly they went out of business so I told him, No Problem. I will order you some online. I read all the reviews and decided on this product. We received it promptly and he was so disappointed!!! It does not compare at all to what he is used to and we are donating it to the local homeless shelter. I will try others online and try to find him something he likes, but this was not it.

review/summary: Great plants!
review/text: The plants came really quickly, and included a pot, plant medium, and care instructions. Like a couple other reviewers, I also received a bonus plant. The extra plant that came was really small, and I worried that it might not make it, because it seemed really young, but I've had it for a few weeks planted with the rest, and it seems to be doing great. Excellent product, excellent service.

review/text: I had received my venus fly traps a few days ago and couldn't review immediately after I got them because I had to go to a camp with my family. When I opened the box, I had received 4 venus fly traps instead of 3! They were all healthy and 1 of them was pretty big. I was emailed before I had received the vft and on the day I did. I recommend this seller and will be sure to order more from them in the future. I will upload a photo later and update this review(:

review/text: I ordered my plants on a Thursday and not only did I receive an email from the actual seller letting me know when he was shipping the product and some tips on keeping it alive, etc. on Friday, I got my plants in great condition that following Monday.  There is a review sheet that is extremely helpful and if you've ever bought some of these plants at Home Depot or Walmart, you'll know why they never survived for very long.  That's how it was for me in any case.  Overall, I will definitely be purchasing more types of plants from this seller in the future.

review/summary: Awesome Plants..
review/text: I have been a huge fan of Venus Flytraps since I was a child and I've owned several of them over the years. Growing up in North Carolina, I never realized these plants were native to my state until I completed a college Public Speaking class. I decided to do an assigned 5 minute speech on carnivorous plants and ended up talking for about 15-20 minutes. While researching the Venus Flytrap and several others (Sundews, Cobra Lillies, Pitcher Plants, Bladderworts, Butterworts, Huntsmans Horns, etc.), I learned that the only place in the world the Venus Flytrap grows is within a 100 mile square mile radius of the mouth of the Cape Fear River in NC.<br /><br />This plant is intriguing for young minds and adults alike. I've spent many hours in my younger years capturing insects and feeding my Venus Flytraps. They grow best in a humid (but not wet) terrarium with lots of sphagnum moss and indirect sunlight, as they grow in a damp wooded mossy environment.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

review/text: The seller definitely cares about the plants sold, he contacted me to let me know around when they'd be there and what to do when they arrived. The package came with thorough, easy-to-follow instructions and the plants. It's been I think about 6-7 months since I got them and they're doing great! They're huge and colorful and active eaters. I have them in a little jar by the window. They grew a cool flower right after I got them. I will definitely buy more plants from this seller!

review/summary: 3 small venus flytraps 3 inch pot
review/text: I was very excited to receive this item so quickly.  I was imagining that this plant would already be planted but it wasn't.  I am so glad that none of the traps broke when I planted them.  The only concern that I have is one of the plants traps was completely black all the way to the roots.  I just hope that none of the other plants turn black too.  Also some of the traps are not as green as the others but maybe they are supposed to have a reddish tint to them.  Also all the traps from the roots to half way up to the stems are yellow.  I am not sure if I should be concerned about this either.  Other then that I am very happy with the plants I received and I can't wait to see if they grow bigger and have babies I can give to friends and family!

review/summary: Excellent plants
review/text: We bought these venus fly traps for use in a science fair project. We knew nothing about caring for them when we ordered. They arrived quickly and in great condition, along with planting media, pots, and directions so we didn't kill them by using tap water. They are now each in their own pot (we bought 12 plants total). We have them under a light and in a seed tray which has a heat mat under it. We need them to stay active until Thanksgiving and didn't want them to go dormant before testing was complete. Once we are done, they are going in the fridge for 3 months to sleep. They have done an amazing job keeping the fruit fly population down, even though that's not why we got them. They appear to be happy, eating bugs, and growing several new traps each. Even the moss we have them potted in appears to be sprouting now.

review/summary: Hmmm...
review/text: The Venus flytraps come in a little plastic baggy with a wet tissue wrapped around it at the roots so that it doesn't dry out. It also comes with some moss and instructions on how to set up the Venus flytraps as stated. When I received mine, two of my traps were already partially black and I could not recover them back, but like the others have said, I received 4 instead of 3 traps so it made up for it. Mine didn't really last that long, but it's probably because I didn't transplant it correctly. I think it'd help if the instructions were also a bit more clear on how to transplant it correctly and maybe possibly even pictures? In any case, the things listed within the description most definitely came within the package. Good service too as he emails you again to make sure everything is okay. (It was a little too late for me though)

review/summary: What can occupy an active Jack Russell puppy?
review/text: These chews can!  I know the writeup says they're for big dogs, but they're perfect for high-energy active chewers of any size.  They're good quality, and because of the pork layer, they qualify as what dog trainers call a "high value" treat, meaning something that a dog will really really want.  They're also good for dental health, because active chewing breaks up tartar and keeps that canine smile pearly white.  So if you need to distract your furkid while you do something that doesn't really require canine assistance (like making the bed, or putting away the groceries, or paying the bills, or...), break out the retriever rolls!<br /><br />As always, never give a rawhide chew without supervising your dog's chewing, because they can be a potential choking hazard, be prepared to occasionally step on a wet piece of chewed rawhide, and be aware that they do have a certain number of calories, so you'll want to limit the use of them, especially if your dog is the kind that puts on pounds at the drop of a hat.  But they're a real lifesaver -- particularly if your beloved companion turns up his or her nose at a plain rawhide chew...

review/text: These beans had very few clinkers after washing.  Rinse and sort, then soak overnight (do only one batch at a time).  Next day, simmer (SIMMER) for 2-4 hours.  Let cool and then put into a container that will easily let you change the water.  Change the water EVERY DAY for 14 days.  NO KIDDING!!!  Every day for two weeks.  The last day, add about 1/4 cup of salt for every gallon of beans.  Let sit overnight and taste.  If too salty, change the water and replace with less salt.  If not salty enough, add a little more salt.  These bean are so much better than the already prepared ones I can get in the grocery for $4.00/6oz.  Well worth the effort.  Put a couple of handsful in a bowl and get yourself a beer.

review/summary: paler and more spam like than in the photograph
review/text: This sausage tastes fine.  It tastes a little like spam but without the yucky .  I'm using this as a cured meat in veggie dishes that call for a pork component so it is fine but it doesn't have a delicious sausage flavor  to it but a milder salty pork product taste. A 12 ounce can of spam is about Two Dollars so this clean tasting product is a much better choice.<br /><br />This meat was excellent in a heated baguette with cream cheese smeared and a generous amount of cilantro/coriander.  It hit the same notes as a Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwich without the concern over what zactly is in that inexpensive pate.  I don't eat sausage very often and I probably won't buy any more for a long time.<br /><br />This sausage is at least 50% fat nubbins. The other sausage I bought is also very fatty so these are good to have around if you need lard in a recipe.

review/summary: Gummi done right
review/text: If I had to pick just one candy to have for the rest of my life, it would be some fameous chocolate from Europe, but if I could choose two, Haribo Fruit Salad would come in second. This is amazing candy; I never tire of it. My wife and I consume about 30 pounds a year of this stuff, and it is definitely less costly than chocolate. The six flavors are all good, if not always identifiable. What is that green flavor, anyway? Watermelon? Maybe, but definitely not citrus. The flavors I'm sure of are Orange, Lemon, Grapefruit and Cherry. There is one that is maybe peach, or maybe passion fruit. Then, there is the enigmatic green. The soft gummi candy is coated with fine granular sugar, a nice touch. Haribo sells a version of the Grapefruit flavor in a single flavor package, and though slightly different from the Grapefruit found in this mix, it is wonderful, too.

review/summary: Childhood Favorite
review/text: I grew up eating these in Germany, and until I bought it on Amazon, have only eaten it once in the past 14 years. I was so excited to find it online, as I remember it being so good, but I was a little disappointed that it was sweeter than I remember. Also, the inconsistent textures within the bag didn't bother me, but part of the bag had soft (fresh?) gummies and part had hard (old?) gummies. Lemon is better than the common candy-lemon flavor, but orange tases like orange soda, but grapefruit is really the best.

review/text: These candies are crazy addictive.  I had to limit myself to one of each flavor a day because I was finding I couldn't stop after 1.  After a while, I stopped following the restriction I posed upon myself and had to have my boyfriend place it up on the top shelf where my 5'2" self couldn't reach it.  Unfortunately in a weak state of mind I climbed my kitchen counter and ate more candies to my hard-working heart's content.  Did I mention I have a very strong sweet tooth?  These are very very good.

review/summary: Where is the Haribo rehab facility!?
review/text: I am very aware that I have an addictive personality.  Especially when it comes to sweets!  I remember my Twizzler, Pop Tarts, Peeps and Jelly Fish addictions.  Currently, it's Haribo Fruit Salad that I just cannot get enough of.  I go through a bag a day, no exaggeration!  I should say I limit myself to a bag a day.<br /><br />In reading some of the other reviews, I see that the texture within the bulk bag might be a little iffy.  I have purchased bags with some gummi pieces that are too hard or soft.  I'm not too crazy about them, but with any luck, I'll get a bag similar to the texture that I have come to know and Love.  I have to agree with reviewer, Paul J. Carlson regarding the "flavors".  "The six flavors are good, if not always identifiable."  LOL!  Very true!  I always assumed that the green was lime.  I saw it mentioned in another site that it was apple!  So now, I see that it is passion fruit.  Hey, if they say so.  Who am I to argue?  It is hard for me to pick out which flavor I like the best as they're ALL good.  Peach used to be my favorite.  But lately, I find myself saving a couple of the cherry and grapefruit for last.<br /><br />Now, off I go to order my family sized bag (that I will joyously hide from my family)!<br /><br />Peace, Love & Haribo!  :)

The flavors of every type in this fruit salad mix are very good, even though the passionfruit one is a little elusive and an odd color (green).  These have a more tender texture than something like a gummi bear, which is why they are coated in sucrose.

These candies I rate as a five as Harry and Davids have a touch more to give them a six. This is a very good price as the one pound bag of these at Harry and Davids store is about 7.00. I will be purchasing these from Amazon again.<br />Sorry Harry....

It's a favorite at work, more popular even than good quality orange slices.

Each one is coated by sugar shaped granules but is not as sweet and not as messy that it scatters everywhere. A single piece is a good bite size; certainly much bigger than their gummy bears.<br /><br />Nice combination of flavors. I don't think they taste quite extraordinary; but nevertheless decent candies coming from the world's leading maker of gummi bears.

review/summary: Opposite Of Bland
review/text: These are the best gummy candies EVAR! When my sister lived in Germany she would send boxes of various European snacks and candy and would always tuck in a small bag of Haribo something-or-other. Their Fruit Salad is one of my favorites. One thing I've noticed in comparison between American gummy candy and European made Haribo, is the European flavors are stronger, sweeter, and just all around more intense. I'll put it this way, if you like the sweet-tart taste of say Starburst, Now and Later, Jolly Rancher, Airheads, etc. but prefer a softer, jelly candy then you'll probably like these. For some reason people seem to expect fruit slices to taste more like watered-down Kool-Aid than actual fruit. That being said, you may want to try a small bag of Haribo Fruit Salad before you take the 5 lb. bag plunge.

review/text: Everyone loved these and the whole bag disappeared within a short time. People keep talking about them too asking me to bring in more and where did I buy them. Haribo products are very tasty but this mix of fruit flavors seems to suit everyone.

review/summary: Yummy Gummi Candy!
review/text: I used to buy these fruit flavored candies at Byerly's and Lunds.  Then, they stopped carrying them.  I was greatly disappointed, as they were my favorites.  Recently, I discovered they were available from Amazon!  They are so delicious and taste just like the fruits...oranges, lemons, pineapple, etc.  A great sugar fix for those of us who need to stay away from chocolate (for obvious reasons!)  The price is very reasonable for 5 pounds of sugar heaven.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVQWK2">Haribo Gummi Candy, Fruit Salad, 5-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: These are like Fruit Gems?  I think NOT!!
review/text: These arrived today.  Based on another review, I had expected them to be similar to Sunkist Fruit Gems.  Any similarity, for me, was dashed as soon as I opened the bag - the candy smells like room deodorizer.  I still had hopes, though, until I tried to eat one.  The outside of the candy is as tough as shoe leather, and the inside is almost liquid.  I tried one of each "flavor" - they all taste the same, and that tast lingers - on and on and on.  Oh - and there is no nutritional information on the package - I thought that was pretty much standard now, if not a requirement.  The price is good, especially if you do Subscribe and Save, and that is why I gave this product the one star.  Personally, I would prefer to pay more and get something I like.

review/summary: Not Your Typical Haribo
review/text: I've tried many, many gummis made by Haribo.  This one is TOTALLY different from the others in terms of taste and texture.  They are not as chewy as the others, almost more like a gumdrop?  I'm not even sure how to explain it.  Others may like this texture, but if you are expecting the standard Haribo chewiness like I was, you might not like this either.  The texture just ruined it for me...

review/summary: I don't normally write reviews....
review/text: But this was honestly the worst frozen pizza I have ever had, let alone the worst expensive 'premium' frozen pizza. Both Home Run Inn and Vito & Nicks frozen pizzas honestly make this taste like Playdough, which the crust was actually pretty close to in terms of taste.<br /><br />The cheese was nice and stringy but completely devoid of taste, just a stringy blob covering the top of the pizza. The sauce was average at BEST. The crust had the weirdest, most lifeless consistency of any pizza I have ever eaten and could barely be classified as a crust.<br /><br />I can hardly EVER be bothered to write reviews (this was my first online review in probably 5 years) but it was so bad I feel like I had to warn others - STAY AWAY, DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY OR WASTE PRECIOUS CALORIES EATING THIS TRASH!

review/text: I saw this at my local grocer and I love deep dish pizzas so I just had to buy this one.<br />I followed the directions to a tee and sadly........the heavy hulking pizza turned out to be a major turd.<br />The crust is way too hard around the edges and the inside of the crust...well have you ever eaten dough that felt like it started to expand in your stomach?<br />Ewww.<br />The sausage tasted like mouse droppings, the sauce was ok but nothing remarkable.<br />The only good thing was the cheese and really?<br />How hard is it to mess up the cheese?<br />All in all I don't recommend this pizza it doesn't cook right even when following the direction word for word.<br />If you want a good frozen deep dish nothing beats Davanni's.<br />For what you're paying you should expect a product that's........you know........EDIBLE.<br />You won't get that here.........unless you like rock hard crust with mouse poop sausage.<br />Not recommended.

review/text: The new package which indicates Microwave or oven bake for a 10 oz deep dish is a lie.  I followed the directions to the letter and the crust was so hard it couldn't be broken with a hammer and the center was still cold.  Since it would be absurd to turn on the oven to bake such a small pizza for 20-25 minutes to serve one person.  That makes both cooking methods impractical and therefore the product is essentially useless and a total ripoff.  I won't get my money back, but maybe you can save yours.

review/summary: Exactly like the original
review/text: Gino's East Pizza is unique. It is a crust and flavor all its own. If you expect to bite into a Domino's Pizza with a Chicago flair, you will be disappointed.  Gino's East Pizza has a unique deep deep crust that lends itself to the cornmeal style. the cheese is the first ingredient placed on the crust when building the pizza, then the (sausage) in our case, followed by a light amount of sauce. Very filling!  I would suggest no smaller that a 11 in pie, as the crust overpowers anything smaller.<br />  The one we selected is the sausage patty. The sausage is a "manhole cover" of sausage on the top of the pizza. It's thin, but flavorful.  The manhole cover came from Chef Duff Goldman. It's one of his favorite pizzas. He has dozens mailed to his Ace of Cakes in Baltimore.<br />  This is unique. We enjoyed it.  I would say it is worth a sample to make up your own mind.

review/summary: Best noodle soup mix!
review/text: As far as chicken noodle soup box mixes go, Mrs. Grass' is the best.  I had this as a kid, and I still like a bowl of it when I'm sick and want something simple.<br /><br />It's very easy to make, either on the stovetop or in the microwave, and there's something about the flavor egg that makes it more appealing.  The broth is really tasty and has real herbs floating in it, so it doesn't feel like it came out of a box.<br /><br />I have had the Lipton's variety of noodle soup mix, and it paled in comparison.  The noodles were smaller and less plentiful, and there was too much broth for me.  I'll stick with Mrs. Grass.

review/summary: Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners
review/text: Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />This one, the Original Cheddar flavor, is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />The Sharp Cheddar flavor (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1DSMC">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, ut when you try it side by side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />The Four Cheese meal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZ4Q">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Four Cheese Sauce, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is, in our opinion, the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference.

If you're feeling inventive, toss some toasted bread crumbs over the top!<br /><br />Love it!

review/summary: My Favorite!!
review/text: I have been eating this macaroni and cheese ever since my sister made baked macaroni and cheese and gave me the main secret ingredient she was using to get the base so good. This is easy to make and a decent base to make other cheesy dishes. Baked macaroni and cheese is one, the other I make a lot is homemade hamburger helper. If you brown the ground beef with half chopped onion, add the uncooked noodles and water and simmer for 10 minutes then add the cheese package along with shredded cheddar you have an easy, quick and tasty lunch or dinner!

review/text: The 3 boxes of Kraft Mac and Cheese that I was able to eat were very delicious however the expiration date was 7 days after it arrived, in fact 2 days before the estimated delivery date. I ordered this item on March 14th and it only arrived 7 days before the item's expiration date!! There are 8 boxes of mac and cheese and they have already expired now, if it had arrived 1 month before the expiration date it would be ok, but it is outrageous that you sell an item that you know is going to be shipped internationally with an expiration date so close to the estimated delivery date. In fact, the delivery estimate was from March 29 to April 13 which is actually AFTER the expiration date, this is simply scandalous!

review/text: The gumballs are good for about a minute. That's about it. Not a whole lot of flavor. The picture shows the container filled almost to the top. The one I received is 65% filled, just a little above the top of the label. Plus it barely fills the King Carousel gumball dispenser barely half way. While the gumballs taste good initially, the flavors wear off quickly, so I give this product one star for that and for the deception of the photo of the product which shows the container fills to the top when the actual product is filled partially above the label, and lastly for the heavily markup of the price which undoubtedly will increase soon. Quite a  disappointment.
