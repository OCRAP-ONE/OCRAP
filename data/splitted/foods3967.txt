review/summary: Canned Tuna
review/text: This is not your average canned tuna at $10.00 a tin, but if you are looking for a gourmet canned tuna experience this is it.  I have seen the same product in Michigan for $17.99 a tin, so $9.99 is quite the bargain.  I made a simple butter lettuce salad, flaked the tuna on top, reserving the olive oil in the tin for the dressing of sea salt, ground pepper, lemon juice and a couple of capers.  It got rave reviews.<br /><br />Ortiz has different grades and Amazon has the best prices, try one of each in a side by side comparison, include a can of the best tuna you can find in your local grocery store then decide for yourself.<br /><br />On a side note, has anyone noticed that Amazon's prices are better that eBay prices?

review/summary: Who'da thought we'd spend $40 a lb for canned tuna... and like it?
review/text: Just came back from Spain and was reading The New Spanish Table by Anya von Bremzen. She had a sidebar where she raved about Ventresca Tuna (of course, what she was eating was specially canned for Chef Juan Mari Arzak, the Spanish heavy hitter.) But after she raved on and on, I decided to see what the hoo-ha was about. So I bought a can. And it made just about every other canned tuna I'd ever tasted seem like cat food. This stuff is the real deal.

review/summary: Good, harmless peanut butter; too expensive here.
review/text: I was buying this kind for years locally; usually in larger jars than this (26 oz), for between four-seventy and five-twenty a pop. I would only buy the smaller jars if they were out of larger ones; the last batch I got was two-fifty a pop (on sale). However, recently this product suddenly disappeared from all stores that used to carry it -- that's why I'm here, looking it up (I don't find the prices here very attractive: they're mostly above what it was locally).<br /><br />Why this butter is good: no evil ingredients. If you take a jar of your typical run-of-the-mill peanut butter and check out the ingredients, you'll see a lot of crap in there, crowned by the biggest nutritional no-no: transfats. This kind here doesn't have any of it: its ingredients are (directly off a jar): peanuts, evaporated cane juice, natural oil blend (palm fruit and flaxseed oils), salt, molasses. As you can see, still it has many additions (cane juice is sugar, I take it), salt, etc. Flaxseed oil is where the ALA (Omega-3 oil) comes from. What palm fruit oil is doing there, I've no idea. Well, as you can see, there are still additions. (Btw, the amount of ALA in a serving of this butter is very low: if you were after ALA, you'd do better by buying flax seeds and grinding them yourself).<br /><br />Now, as far as Omega-3: it's not one kind of fat, it's a family of fats sharing one particular molecular feature: their unsaturated "moments" start exactly three molecular links from the end (thus "omega", which is the last letter in the Greek alphabet; "Omega-6" fats have the unsaturated holes six links from the end, Omega-9, nine links from the end, etc.). Not all Omega-3 fats are equal: what this product has is ALA (extracted from flax), but what you _really_ need is DHA and EPA (who usually come from fish). ALA can be converted to DHA/EPA but the conversion rate is low and affected by many competing metabolical processes in the human body. Iow, consuming ALA isn't really what you need; you need DHA/EPA, so if you're after "heart-healthy" Omega-3 polyunsaturated fat acids (PUFA), stick to fish or supplements. Flax/ALA is really of little or no use. I'm saying all of this so that people do not overestimate the importance of this product based on ALA in it. For what it is, realistically, I think it's overpriced.<br /><br />Now, finally, I think the company that makes this thing made a big error allowing the disappearance of this product from stores: we humans are creatures of habit, and like I said, I was buying this product for years w/o thinking why. Making it disappear made me, first, uncomfortable; then it made me go around looking for it; then it made me look for replacements -- and lo and behold, I found a better product! To a Trader Joe's I go and what do I see there? Peanut butter, 16 oz jar, costing one-ninety-nine (yep), whose ingredients section reads as follows: peanuts. That's it! Peanut butter means crushed peanuts -- no palm oil, no useless flax oil, no sugar cane, definitely no transfats -- no nothing, just peanuts. That's the kind I'm going to be buying now, and so should you. This butter here, otoh, is OK but, despite ALA, not the best, and it's overpriced. It is, however, definitely preferable to regular (and cheaper) makes of peanut butter that are full of poisonous substances, so my bottom line is:<br /><br />This is a decent, safe product that you should buy if you can't get the Trader Joe's kind; look for it on sale (don't buy it here, it's overpriced, at least at the time of posting this note). Don't buy into the ALA hype: ALA is all but useless to humans, and its small presence in this butter is of no great value.<br /><br />01/16/2012: Was at ACME yesterday (not the place you'd go for best prices), they carry this thing again now, for three-fifty a jar. Still cheaper than here (a dozen at three-fifty will be forty-two, and again, you don't have to buy a dozen to get this price).

review/text: I'm not an expert on food ingredients.  I know what's good for me and I REALLY know what I like.  I didn't care much for peanut butter until I talked with a nutritionist for my health and she recommended peanut butter in lieu of higher fat proteins.  I looked at the nutritional information for the popular brands (Skippy, Jif, etc) and this brand is far and away the winner of all that I looked at.  This does not include other types of spreads such as sunflower seed butter, almond butter, etc.<br /><br />This peanut butter is delicious!  It's awesome on celery, bananas and just by itself.  I snatch this up whenever it's on sale.  I just wish it came in a bigger jar.

review/text: I just want to say how thankful my husband and I are for Elecare. With every other formula we tried my daughter on she had every symptom from diahrrea,gas,colic,reflux,projectile vomiting(at least once a day). We went from milk based formulas to lactose free and from lactose free to the amino acid formula. The very first day on elecare we noticed a tremendous difference! Pretty much all the problems with the other formulas disappeared after one bottle! It was like we had a new baby all together. The only downfall to the formula i have seen is that because it is so broken down, it is much thinner than typical formulas however we thicken it a little with xantham gum and she has no problems keeping it down now. Good formula if your baby has digestion problems!!

review/summary: It was a must for us
review/text: We had to use this formula b/c my son ended up with serious GI issues, and this was the only thing he tolerated. He was (is) sensitive to milk, soy, and wheat - this breaks those proteins down to a digestible/tolerable  form for him. We did have issues with the Vanilla flavored one, which appeared in the form of spitting up more, and was confirmed when he had other foods with vanilla in them.  If your kids has any food sensitivities, could be anything, not just the common ones! Also, our doctor gave us samples to see if it would work, after having tried about 4 other formulas.

review/summary: Best peanut butter in the every-day grocery store
review/text: I guess there might be other natural peanut butters for sale in expensive health-food stores, but I haven't tried them.  However, in the regular super-markets, the only peanut butter I'll buy is SKIPPY NATURAL!  It is the best tasting, and won't clog your arteries.  For those who think it is un-healthy because they remove some peanut oil and replace it with natural palm oil, I disagree.  Peanut oil separates and has to be stirred up every time, or you have to refrigerate it, and then it doesn't spread well.  Palm oil has saturated fat, but it is the healthy kind, produced by the palm tree, not chemically altered partially hydrogenated oil like in regular p.b.  Palm oil is high in oleic acid, like olive oil, among many other things, which are good for you.  Sure, plain peanuts and salt makes a pretty healthy p.b., but it is inconvenient and my family doesn't like it, and I don't care for it much myself.  If we can eat a peanut butter that tastes great, keeps well in the cabinet, spreads easily, and is better for us than most, and maybe just about as good for us as any other, what do you think we're going to do?

review/summary: Best Peanut Butter Ever
review/text: I've had all flavors of Skippy and one jar of every other brand I could find, including the old fashioned ones that separate, and this one was the best for my needs.<br /><br />It tastes as good or better than regular skippy.  The taste is very much like Skippy's regular product.<br /><br />On the topic of texture, it is like a more spreadable version of Skippy or JIF.  If regular peanut butter was thick enough to tear bread if you spread it too quickly, this one is not.  It goes on smooth, as if it was whipped.<br /><br />This peanut butter doesn't stick to the mouth as much.  There is still some of that beloved sticking action, but only half that of normal PB.  The mouth-feel of this peanut butter is differemt than any I've had, so you may like it or dislike it.  Personally, I think it's a lot better.<br /><br />A response to some criticism I've read about this peanut butter that made no sense to me, for the sake of explaining why these criticisms should make no sense to you as well:<br /><br />Is this product dishonest for saying "All Natural" without containing only peanut oil?  No.<br />The bad reviews this received focused on how it has palm oil, and those reviewers seem to think that means it is a dishonest product, since it says "All natural".  I could go on a rant about how crude oil is natural and turpentine is organic, but it would make more sense to explain that "All Natural" peanut butter doesn't have to be the type that separates.  The stuff that separates is typically "Old Fashioned" or "Home Made" peanut butter.  If your Peanut butter is separating and it says "All Natural" you need to be aware that they are following only one possible "All Natural" formulation for peanut butter and that the kid that you are looking for is more reliably found with an "Old Fashioned" written somewhere on the jar.<br /><br />Another thing I've heard is that it contains sugar and salt, and that any "All Natural" product shouldn't have those.  To that I ask, "Do you know what the definition of 'Peanut butter' is?".  Peanut butter is not a spread made of peanut flour and oil, and never has been.  Since day one it was flavored with oil and/or salt.  Being put off by the salt and sugar content is like being upset that lemon-aid contains sugar or water instead of lemons alone.  If you are in the market for a diabetic friendly peanut butter, this is not for you,  Stay away.  If you are looking for something low in salt, because of your high blood pressure, stay away from this product.  It is only as low in salt as the average "Peanut Butter" in the same isle of the store.  If you are trying to eat healthily and want to avoid sugar or salt, find one that doesn't have those ingredients, but don't blame Skippy for making a bad product when the definition of peanut butter nearly always calls for sugar and salt, historically.<br /><br />Is peanut oil more healthy than palm oil peanut butter?  Depends on your beliefs.<br />I like coconut oil, and coconut oil comes from the coconut palm.  Palm oil isn't exactly canola, but it has one great property that you aren't going to get in peanut oil.  It leaves the peanut butter thick and creamy, without the separation.  There are almost no people who believe saturated trans fat is healthier for you than palm oil, so from that perspective this is a huge gain in healthiness over regular Skippy that I've been eating all these years as my favorite peanut butter.  Peanut oil might be healthier than palm, to some people, but it is solely omega-6, so if that someone is in the US, they are probably consuming too much omega-6 already.  If you're looking for an oil soup with some peanut plaster at the bottom, definitely buy "Old Fashioned" peanut butter, but for people like me, who value texture, this product is the ultimate blend of healthy and enjoyable.  You can't have everything ideal in life, and if you could there wouldn't be any peanut oil in this product at all... it would be omega-3 based algal oil.  No oil is perfect and I like my peanut butter creamy and without needing a long mixing process that ends in a product that is different on the bottom of the jar than the top.

review/summary: Name is misleading
review/text: The name of this product is a bit misleading. Most people assume that if peanut butter is labeled "natural" that the only ingredients are peanuts (though some manufacturers add a little salt to their natural peanut butter, too). Skippy, however, also adds sugar and extracts the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. I don't believe most people would think that something made from peanuts would "naturally" contain palm oil. So while Skippy is technically correct in labeling this "natural" since it does not contain any artificial ingredients, I think they're consciously taking advantage of the fact that most people would think "natural" peanut butter just contains peanuts and its byproducts.

review/summary: Protein Snack
review/text: When my health care provider asked me to eat concentrated amounts of protein as between meal snacks,  what could I choose?  That was my dilemma.<br /><br />When looking for snacks I needed something that was easy to carry around with me and rather low in carbohydrates.  I kept finding snack bars and snack cups that were mostly sugars and carbs.  Those are nice for energy snacks, but not for long term slow release that comes from protein.<br /><br />Then I found Skippy Natural Peanut Butter.  To begin it has only 6 grams pf carbohydrates per serving compared with 15 grams for other brands.  Next it does have 7 grams of protein.  So with Skippy I get my protein (most PB has about 7 g), with far fewer carbs.<br /><br />Next I compared the other ingredients.  Skippy Natural contains peanuts, a little palm oil, a pinch of salt, and a bit of sugar.  Regular brands toss in corn syrup, fully hydrogenated vegetable oils, digryceriges, molasses, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, copper sulfate, and pyridokinne hydrochloride.  Skippy Natural is the clear choice on the basis of ingredients.<br /><br />Skippy Natural tastes good and spreads smooth.  I recommend Skippy Natural.

review/text: The taste is good, it is shelf stable and it does not separate, but the name is somewhat misleading.<br />Most natural peanut butters contain one ingredient- peanuts. Some brands also add a touch of salt as a flavor enhancer. This product contains peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt. The palm oil is where I am disappointed. Skippy removes a portion of the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. The peanut oil can be sold for a substantial profit, so it is removed during processing and replaced with very inexpensive palm oil.

This Skippy is OK but not as flavorful as several reviews I read had claimed.  However, right after I placed my order, I noticed that the price skyrocketed by almost triple, so I won't buy it again unless the price comes back down and I can't find my Laura Scudders in the meantime.

review/summary: If you're looking for yummy, smooth peanut butter, look no farther
review/text: I am always torn between buying the yummier peanut butter with the icky trans fat and the healthier peanut butter that doesn't taste nearly as good. Well, actually, I'm not torn, I've just been buying the  icky tasting organic, need to be stirred type peanut butter. I saw the Skippy Natural in the store and quickly scanned the ingredients. No hydrogenated oils... sweet! The ingredients are roasted peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt. I do realize that peanut butter is healthier without the oil, sugar and salt, but I also know that it's nearly impossible to have the best of both worlds, so it's a trade off. With Skippy Natural I get healthier peanut butter and a fabulous taste! Plus, when I compare it to the nutrition facts in Adams Natural Peanut Butter here's what I get:<br /><br />  --------Adam's  -  Skippy Natural  Serving size 2tbsp in both<br />Calories  -  200  -  190<br />Total Fat  -  16 grams  -  16 grams<br />Sat Fat  -  2.5 grams  -  3.5 grams<br />Sodium  -  105 mg  -  150 mg<br />Total Carbs  -  6g  -  6g<br />Protein  -  7g  -  7g<br /><br />So, we're not looking at the much of a difference at all. I will take the better tasting peanut butter in this instance. If the nutrition was severely compromised then I would make a different choice, but not in this case! Now every time I see someone at the store reaching for the gross, hydrogenated peanut butter I want to show them this and compare the ingredients for them and explain that it tastes just as good as what they're planning on getting. I politely mind my own business and move along. I would be awesome if they marketed this stuff better though.  Grab a jar and a spoon and try the creamiest, yummiest peanut butter without the unnecessary trans fat.<br />Nutrition from [...] and the back of my Skippy jar

review/summary: Great taste, no stirring
review/text: In a nutshell, this peanut butter is short on ingredients and requires no stirring.  They remove excess peanut oil and replace it with palm oil which helps the butter stay creaming and eliminates the oil floating on top.  A lot of PB was made this way until palm oil fell under the 'all saturated fats will leap from the jar and kill you' mentality.  Palm oil is (like peanut oil) full of saturated fats, but the types of saturated fats in it are largely shown to be at least somewhat beneficial and are certainly no worse for you than peanut oils.  Do some research and then buy this peanut butter, it has excellent taste and texture and the no-stir nature makes it a lot more kid friendly for them to open and use.

review/text: We're fans of the "brown lid," natural-style, peanut butters... and Skippy doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The peanut flavor is strong, there's no oil separation (so no stirring is necessary) and the texture is very creamy / smooth.  As far as differences between this and the "natural" offerings of other brands, as long as we stick with the creamy variety my kids can't tell a difference... so we don't mind changing it up with whatever is on sale.<br /><br />That said, as long as Amazon continues to carry this 6-pack at a reasonable price with their S&S program, I anticipate that we'll continue to enjoy it.

review/summary: Great Peanut Butter!
review/text: Purchased the items while perusing [...] and decided to take a chance on what looked like a good product from a known company.  I was hesitant to buy any peanut butter with "Natural" in the name because of past experience, but decided to try it.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of probably the finest peanut butter i have ever tasted.  My childeren and wife agreed with me.  They all like to snack on it from the jar.<br />I was also pleasantly surprised that there was not any oils sitting at the top of the product.<br />We will definitely be purchasing more of this and soon.

review/summary: Good, but I like Teddie Natural better
review/text: Skippy Natural is good, but I prefer Teddie Natural because it tastes more like natural, freshly ground, peanut butter. I bought the Skippy because it was a good price and it's a bit easier because you don't need to stir it when you first open it. The oil in Teddie Natural separates and floats on top, but once mixed and refrigerated it stays mixed pretty well. I also like the Skippy because it doesn't require refrigeration, so I can keep it in my desk at work for a quick snack.

review/text: Tastes like PB... I guess I'm not as refined as others but it tastes like PB, I'd say it's good.<br />However, the "no stirring needed" is a bit deceptive. It still has oil in it (I think it's natural in peanuts), and if you let it sit awhile, some of it does come to the top.

review/summary: Ideal for PB and J lovers
review/text: I love to take PB and J for lunch at work so I wanted to get a bulk peanut butter.  I like the natural peanut butters, but most have a big layer of oil at the top that you have to stir into the jar and that gets old fast (and messy).  The Skippy natural is much better.  Some jars have no oil on top, others a thin layer that stirs in quickly.  The PB is smooth and spreads easily.  It tastes great, as one would expect with the simple ingredients.<br /><br />If you like the basic natural peanut butter, it doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Not perfect but better than most
review/text: I try to buy more natural products. Both my husband and I love peanut butter, and it is a good healthy source of protein. However, the "all natural" products are messy because you have to stir them. And if you store it in the refrigerator to keep it from separating, it gets too hard. This product is a good compromise - it does have a trace of less-than-healthy fat but much less than "regular" PB, and best of all, no stirring!

review/summary: Good stuff but may not be as natural as expected
review/text: I like this peanut butter... it is tasty and creamy, contains no trans fats, and I didn't have to stir it which can be messy. It does contain palm oil (non-hydrogenated) and sugar though, but it didn't taste like it had sugar in it so it must be a very small amount. Anyway, some may not want those "unnecessary" ingredients... but overall I like it and think it is worthy of 4 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: "Natural" or Not, It's Not Even Peanut Butter
review/text: I have to love all the reviews and comments to those reviews debating the meaning of the word "natural," and whether or not this qualifies as a "natural" product. Folks, it doesn't matter if it's natural or not, it's not even peanut butter. Peanut butter is ground-up peanuts, with or without salt. This is a "peanut butter spread" -- just like it says **right on the front of the container** -- and contains sugar and palm oil.<br /><br />That being said, this is probably one of the least offensive-tasting peanut butter spreads on the market. There's a decent peanut flavor, although the sugar makes it too sweet for me. But my dog likes it, so it's what we buy for her. I'll stick with the REAL (a.k.a old fashioned) stuff; I've found Trader Joe's to have some of the best out there. Seemingly unlike most people, I actually have the two minutes of time it takes to stir a jar of peanut butter (not spread!).

This spread has it all. Great taste, spreadibity and, can you believe this, better for you! It was high time, and the great minds at Skippy have made this possible.<br /><br />Mankind, rejoice!

review/text: This is a very smooth, peanuty peanut butter. It goes well with jam and bread for a delicious PB&J.<br />The Natural in the product title attracted me.<br />Salt and palm oil are part of the ingredients. I have made peanut butter and like the natural taste. This Skippy product delivers that taste!<br />There is just a hint of oil when opening the bottle... no stirring required. Just smooth, thick peanut butter on your knife with easy spreading.<br />Not an organic peanut butter... this is a very tasty peanut butter with a step toward the healthier side of products.

review/text: The peanut butter tastes slightly better than the Kroger brand, but cost much more.  The word "Natural" is misleading since, as another reviewer pointed out, palm oil is added.  I will not by this product again and will avoid all Jiffy peanut butter in the future.<br /><br />Update--03/05/2012:  I now definately believe that the use of the word "Natural" was meant to mislead the consumer into believing that this product contained something better than "un-natural" peanut butter.  Apparently, this is the new buzz word that companies use to get us to buy something which is better for us healthwise, but there are no FDA standards to the word "Natural" which many products now claim.

I plan to be ordering these at the NEW and much better S&S price come payday.<br /> I use this incredible and gluten/dairy/soy free PB for my homemade PB Chocolate Chip cookies, for which I also use the Enjoy Life mini Choc chips also sold here on AMZ - [[ASIN:B001GZ7SP8 Enjoy Life Foods Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips Gluten Free (12x10 OZ)]<br />Enjoy Life Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips -- 10 oz Each / Pack of 12<br />(Recipe below)<br /><br />I am also planning to use it to experiment with other recipes.  It is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, less expensive than the PB's I used to have to buy to get allergen-free ones, and so much better and easier to use.<br /><br />One trick - - when using the chocolate chips in a cake or cookie recipe, stir them into your flour before adding to the wet ingredients. This is an old baker's trick to keep them from falling to the bottom and staying there.<br /><br />BTW:<br />Gluten free peanut butter choc chip cookies<br />Adapted from Ruth's Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies***<br /><br />1 C. oil (corn, peanut, olive, etc.)<br />1 C.

This makes the PB easier to remove after measuring. ~  (Another trick: One cup from the Skippy's Natural 15 oz jar is to about from the top of the jar to the bottom of the first stroke line of the red "K" in Skippy's Natural label on the jar, or about 1/2 of the jar. It may be a bit short, but it works.)<br /><br />Put two eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat slightly. Then add the oil and PB mix. Mix a bit.<br />Add:<br />1C. sugar<br />1 C.

This keeps the chips from falling to the bottom when baking.<br /><br />Add this a little at a ime, mixing well, to the sugar/egg/PB mix and mix all well.<br />Scoop portions onto a greased or ungreased nonstick cookie sheet. Bake 375 degrees for 12 mins. They may not look done, but remove from oven and let set on cookie sheet 15 mins. to cool, then remove to plate or rack. I get about 2-3 dozen palm-sized cookies.<br /><br />NOTE: If you are using a stand mixer to mix this all up, you may need to add 1/4 C. of liquid, such as coconut or almond milk, or water, etc  - OJ?.)<br /><br />***Adapted from Ruth's Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies<br />By HokiesLady<br />[...]<br />(For some reason, AMZ appears to have dropped this link from my original review - - In the Enjoy Life CChips review.)<br /><br />I find that the use of oil makes for a shortbread-like cookie.<br /><br />I hope you and your family find these as enjoyable and easy to make as I do.<br />Please feel free to comment or contact me if you need more information.

review/text: I'm used to Peter Pan Crunchy and Jif/Skippy Extra Chunky, so I guess my general feelings for creamy are a bit low to start with, but this stuff is downright terrible. It says no need to stir, but every jar I've opened has a few mm of oil floating on top, which kills the texture and taste of this PB. I tend just to drain that and whatever sticks, I just stir in. Chunky/crunchy is naturally healthier and less oily and is so good you can eat it straight up. This stuff just feels gross on my tongue. Maybe good for those who like PB&J and don't like the PB to overpower the J or whatever, but I never buy jelly/jam, so I dunno why I even bought this.

review/text: Skippy Natural Creamy Peanut Butter is really yummy stuff!  Some people may have a fit because it's debatable whether this is truly a natural product, however I think that roasted peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt is pretty good in terms of ingredients.  It doesn't require stirring, nor refrigeration, and tastes great with waffles and jam.  The jars are kinda small (15 oz only), but considering it's a six pack I don't have to drive to the store to purchase another jar because the kids sucked the stuff down, it's a great deal.  Yum Yum Yum recommended!

review/summary: Almost All Natural - Close enough for most of us
review/text: I know that the label is a bit misleading - for a purist - it isn't close enough to 'Natural' - but, sometimes compromise is in order and this is one time when we will compromise a bit - just because you don't have to stir it and because the consistency is closer to the peanut butter we got used to using and the price is right. This product tastes great and the consistency is just like regular peanut butter. Nothing worse than to get a bite of peanut butter than is so dry and gunky that it sticks to the roof of your mouth or so runny that it won't stay on the bread. At least it is NOT hydrogenated. I am hoping that the palm oil won't kill us. We don't live on peanut butter, so are hoping we will be ok with this product.<br />The price on Amazon.com isn't bad - but, we just can't manage six jars at a time. But, maybe get someone to share the purchase? That would be a good option.<br />I give this product a THUMBS UP rating of FIVE STARS!!

review/summary: Sugar Always Tastes Good! Not what I call Natural.
review/text: Well, shame on me. I saw the "Natural" on the label, assumed that it was just ground peanuts (not reading carefully enough), and wound up with 6 jars of regular old american peanut butter that's loaded with sugar. Of course it tastes good, is mixed well and stays mixed, and lasts long on the shelf, but you pay for those things.

review/summary: Best peanut butter EVER!!
review/text: My whole family LOVES this peanut butter. I searched everywhere for a peanut butter that is creamy without the oil separation... AND I didn't want any hydrogenated oils OR high fructose corn syrup... this magic bottle of yummy is the PERFECT because it does not contain any of the earlier ingredients, the texture is smooth and the flavor is the best!! I won't use anything else!!

review/summary: Great Peanut Butter
review/text: This product arrived very quickly and for a great price.  My family was looking for a healthier alternative to regular peanut butter, and this seems to fit the bill.  It is much, much smoother than the Jif or Peter Pan peanut butter we normally eat, and tastes great.  I have also used it in a couple of recipes (cake, bread, peanut butter cups, and cookies) and it seems to perform and taste just as good as using traditional peanut butter.  If you are looking for a more "natural" peanut butter, I would recommend this product as a worthy replacement.

review/summary: Skippy is just trying to trick you...
review/text: Compare the ingredients.. This stuff is no better for you than the original Skippy. They both have the same ingredients (check for yourself) except the one thing they changed was replacing that nasty partially hydrogenated oil with palm oil which is no better for you and will still clog your arteries. If you're truly looking for a natural peanut butter look for one without any oils added to it period. I myself really like Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter with Honey. It tastes great. Stirring it can be a pain but it is so worth it if it's better for our health.

review/summary: Misleading Labeling
review/text: As a rule, you should always check the fine print of anything you buy and not the BIG BOLD LABEL that says ALL NATURAL or FAT FREE or NO ADDED SUGAR. The marketing strategy was not for those who are looking to buy the creamy, easy to spread peanut butter nor for those who wants no partially hydrogenated oils in their PB. But it is for those who wants "All Natural" those who thinks they are just buying all peanut, all healthy, no saturated fats PB.<br />Others are saying they dont care whats in it as long as it's creamy and tasty and their kids love it but this review is not about the taste. We already know that Skippy products are tasty and creamy and yes my kids loves PB for breakfast. Im sorely reviewing about product labelling. All Im saying is theres nothing special about it. They could have just said, its PB without PHO. But again, it's all about strategy and consumers like us really needs to educate ourselves.

review/summary: Not for me...
review/text: I am used to the old fashioned kinds with just peanuts and salt as ingredients. I thought I would try Skippy Natural Creamy peanut butter spread simply because a recipe called for it. I tried some before using it and this stuff tastes like oil and wax. If you like fake flavors than you might like this. Otherwise, stick with the real stuff that you have to stir, it's so worth it!

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: They had this for sale once in Lone Tree, CO at Safeway. I gave it a try and it was absolutely the best. Imported from Italy. They stopped selling it, I guess it was about $16/container at that place, and I haven't been able to find it anywhere since. Found it here, just got a bunch of cans :P<br /><br />I would never buy anything else. The smell is what gets me every time. So smooth!

review/summary: Great tasting coffee; great value!
review/text: Cameron's is a great tasting coffee and a great value for the price.  This particular favorite--along with the toasted pecan--is my favorite.  I'm a picky coffee drinker, and I'm impressed by the quality of this coffee.  The smell is intoxicating and the flavor is unmatched.  I often buy several of these 32-ounce bags and keep them in the freezer.  They stay fresh for several months.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Don't grind it until you're about to use it and toss in a French Press for best results.

review/summary: Chocolate Delight
review/text: This coffee, with its hint of chocolate, is delightful to drink.  I signed up for the 3 month subscription plan but will be purchasing more frequently.  For someone who really tastes their coffee (I drink it black and straight) can say that I am truly enjoying this.
