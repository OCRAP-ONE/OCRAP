review/summary: Major Disappointment ... Stale and Yucky
review/text: The 0810 sell buy date on the packets is a FAIL, these are already past their prime. I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Nice big walnut and pecan halves perked up my taste buds. However, the nuts in this mixture were STALE and made the overall mix taste yucky. The rancid taste had permeated even the cranberries, raisins etc. Needless to say my healthy TV snacks were a major disappointment.

review/summary: Raspberry Tea Dreams - 10 Stars
review/text: Take the warm scent of Italian Bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into South Indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea. This tea, if made with powdered milk, honey, vanilla syrup and a packet of stevia becomes creamy.<br /><br />Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of sugar and you have a honey and vanilla raspberry bergamot tea. I don't think you can only use one teabag. I use four in 16 ounces and like it a little stronger. It is like a raspberry chai without the spice. Perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin.<br /><br />The people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea. The tea leaves are also organic.<br /><br />I think this is the most delicious tea I've ever tasted! Once you try this flavor, you will want to try all the flavors. I'm trying the green tea with mint and also love the Fireside Chai.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Unusual Earl Grey, But Not Berry-Like!
review/text: *****<br />Zhena's Raspberry Earl Grey Black Gypsy Tea is quite an unusual Earl Grey tea. The strongest taste in this tea is the black tea itself, with the bergamot being very subtle. The raspberry is even more subtle yet---this is not a berry-like tea! It is a delightfully different Earl Grey and I like it a lot. If you're looking for something mild but interesting, and/or you're an Earl Grey fan, you'll enjoy this tea. This was the second of Zhean's teas that I've tried and I've found I like them just as much as other premium and organic vendors like Numi and Aspen.<br /><br />Zhena's Raspberry Earl Grey contains: organic black tea, organic essential oil of italian bergamot orange, all organic natural flavors. One cup contains about 1/2 of the caffeine of a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Zhena's Gypsy Tea is a wonderful company that makes teas that are organic, fair trade, and processes tea using green practices. They have high standards and make quality teas. If you are interested, check www.gypsytea.com for more information. They all come in eco-conscious tins. Because of the high quality of the teas, they do tend to be a bit more expensive, but worth it if you believe in supporting the environment and in fair trade.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very good, but needs more raspberry flavor!
review/text: I love tea, in general. I really enjoy earl grey tea, as well as the raspberry flavored teas you can purchase pre-made in the bottles at the store. I was hoping that this tea was closer in flavor to the bottled tea, but it does not quite have enough raspberry for my taste. The bergamot flavor in the tea is quite strong, in my opinion, and it can over-power the raspberry flavor.<br /><br />Is this a very enjoyable, quality tea? You bet. I like it as iced tea, the best. I just wanted others who may be purchasing it to replace the raspberry bottled and canned tea drinks in the stores to know that it has a different flavor than the Arizona brand and Lipton brand (for example) pre-made products, so there are no surprises. Otherwise, enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent with Full-Bodied Reds
review/text: I saw this chocolate at my local Earth Fare, and I thought they were crazy for asking $8 for 8 ounces of chocolate. However, being a fan of both wine and chocolate, I finally caved in and bought a brick: I had to see what a chocolate formulated to complement wine would taste like.<br /><br />Though I can't believe I'm going to say it, it was worth every dime.<br /><br />I can't say I'm a connoisseur, and admittedly, I have a somewhat unsophisticated palate. I cannot tell what type of barrel a chardonnay was aged in, or how long, and I am not adept at determining the notes in types of wine. (Berry? Cherry? Maybe. Spice and chocolate I can generally tell.) However, I can say with confidence that the chocolate goes perfectly with every full-bodied red wine I've paired it with. Don't try it with white, however, unless you have a sweet tooth from hell.

review/summary: Best Iced Tea Ever
review/text: I'm a tea drinker and like a lot of different hot teas.  When it comes to iced tea, though, I'm very picky.<br /><br />I've tried Nestea, Lipton, Tetley, etal, but the smoothest and best is Luzianne for iced tea.  It's not as "musky" as Tetley, nor sharp as Lipton, nor fake and stale as Nestea.  It has a bright, smooth taste that stands alone easily over ice yet still shines through when used as Southern sweet tea with lemon added.  I've tried it with tap water in Memphis, Little Rock, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Las Vegas and have no complaints.<br /><br />In fact, I like Luzianne so much that, when I couldn't find it in local grocery stores in Las Vegas, I ordered it from Amazon.

review/summary: This makes the best sweet tea!!!
review/text: I have tried lots of brands and they were decent for iced tea.  Then,  a family from New Orleans moved here to Washington State.  In the South, sweet tea is like our coffee in Seattle.....a serious matter.<br />I make my sweet tea in a two gallon pan, put in one gallon of water and wait until is is boiling.<br />add your tea bags, let it go for about 5-10 minutes.  Then, while the pot is still on the stove, remove the tea bags.  into the pot, add your sugar (I use 50% brown sugar, 50% white sugar).  Let the boiling tea dissolve the sugar (it doesn't dissolve well if you wait for the tea cool down).  Stir it until the sugar is dissolved.<br />Add a gallon of cold water and stir, pour into pitchers a place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />This tea is rich and musky.  It is not bright a springy.  Sometime, you ought to try stirring in some of<br />that liquid agave sweetener that is supposed to be 1.5 times sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />With kind regards and best wishes,<br />tom in Olympia, Washington

review/summary: The secret to good Southern Sweet Tea.
review/text: If you're at all familiar with the south you'll know that we tend to take iced tea rather seriously.  When I was growing up my mother made iced tea from Lipton tea bags but when I discovered Luzianne tea there was no going back to Lipton!  Formulated specifically for making iced tea Luzianne delivers a consistent product that is not bitter and has a pleasant aroma.  These days I use one regular tea bag along with one Luzianne decaf tea bag to make our iced tea in this manner:<br /><br />Steep a quart to a quart and a half of water almost to boiling.  You don't want to use boiling water as it will singe the tea and create a bitter flavor.  As long as the heated water is steaming, it's hot enough.  Add 1 family sized (or 2 regular sized bags) of each variety of Luzianne tea (caffeinated and decaffeinated) to the water and allow it to steep all day and come to room temperature.  If you're making sweet tea, add a bunch of sugar (this is a personal preference measurement) to the bottom of a gallon sized pitcher, then add about 2 cups of the room temperature (or warm) tea and stir to dissolve all the sugar.  At this point, fill the pitcher with ice.  Pour the brewed tea on top of the ice and stir gently to combine.  (Pouring the room temperature tea on top of the ice allows the ice to crack, which is what helps deliver a distinctive Southern Sweet Tea look.)  Add water as needed to fill your vessel.  Your tea will be clear, sweet and refreshing with no bitterness or after-taste.  Enjoy!

review/text: I am a huge fan of this chipotle seasoning.  It has a mouth watering smoky aroma, and just the right amount if spiciness--not too hot, not too salty either.  I put this in chili and soup, on noodles, steak and much more.  Here's my favorite use: Mix 1 1/2 cups of plain cooked rice with one can of rinsed black beans and one can of diced tomatoes (not drained).  Add a tiny splash of olive oil, and couple splashes of lime juice, then add this chipotle seasoning to taste.  For a different twist, add corn kernels or yellow bell pepper.<br />It may seem that the grinder quits working before the spice runs out, but I figured when there is only a teasppon or two of seasoning left, it just isn't heavy enough to fill the grinder--kind of like the last few splashes of hairspray won't seem to spray out of the bottle.  I just unscrew the white grinding adjuster and dump the last bit of seasoning into the new bottle.<br />I cannot find it in my grocery store anymore, so I am glad to be able to get it on Amazon.  The 4.8 oz bottle lasts me 6 months or so, and I use it a couple times per week.

review/text: This seasoning tastes great. No qualms about that. The grinder appears to be good quality.<br /><br />A few notes that I didn't realize until I got it:<br /><br />- These are HUGE. Much larger than a can of soda. Its going to take me 5 years before I run out of this stuff.<br />- This is not PURE chipotle. It has minced onion, salt and other spices mixed in.

review/summary: Best oil I've tasted outside of Liguria
review/text: This oil is so fruity and delicious, I could drink it. I use a cheaper brand for cooking, because I read somewhere, maybe it was on the Carli site, that this oil can get a little bitter when heated, but it is perfect for drizzling and dunking. A good piece of Ciabatta or Pugliese and this oil, what more does a person need? Heaven can't be better. Try their olives, they're in the same oil and you cannot stop eating them.

review/summary: Excellent Extra Virgin Olive Oil
review/text: I placed an order in response to an introductory offer that I received in the mail.  The acidity level of the olive oil was advertised to be extremely low and I wanted to see if it really was noticeable when I mixed it with pasta,  oregano and grated cheese that I make often.  It took about three weeks for the case to arrive to my home; however, the glass decanter that was included with the deal was smashed to bits inside the box.<br />I called Carli's 800 number to report the damage and the Customer Service Rep. was very friendly and had a great attitude.  She sent out another decanter and it arrived in just two days.  I'm all Italian and consume a lot of Extra Virgin Olive Oil and I got to say that this is very high quality.  I have already ordered my second case, which arrived in less than two weeks with the larger bottles.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends that appreciate the finer things.  My wife who is really into cooking, and usually hates anything that I get through the mail, was impressed as well.  I just hope that they don't get greedy and raise the price.

review/summary: A Very Good Oil
review/text: Edited my review, upgraded to 4 stars. Received Fratelli's introductory case of 1/2 liter bottles of extra virgin olive oil today.  Read many reviews of 5 stars, 4 stars for the rest. I use a lot of olive oil.  Some reviewers say this oil is sweet as extremely good oil should be.  To me, it initially has a smooth, buttery, fruity olive flavor. A second or two later, it was peppery near the back of the tongue, followed by a slight bitterness further back on the tongue. Would not describe it as sweet. It is my understanding that many Italians prefer this pepperyness and I am Italian, but I do not.  Not sure if my sample is typical.  I feel this is a very good oil,and a great bargain at the introductory price, but not worth full price to me. I will stick to my Goya Extra Virgin First cold Pressed olive oil.......yes, Spanish olive oil.  No bitterness whatsoever, made from very ripe olives....my "Gold Standard" (Goya is very golden) I like my wine very full-bodied and fruity....hate wines that are very dry.  guess my tastes in olive oil and wine are congruent.

review/summary: Bland and horrible
review/text: I bought this mistakenly. I wanted to purchase Amazing Tastes Cajun Spice Blend. I didn't realize this was a different company. The spice blend is bland and seems old. The paprika is brown and not a bright red. This didn't add anything to fish. It smells like celery salt. It lacks spice and flavor.  This spice blend didn't even improve with salt, garlic and lemon juice. Whatever you do- don't buy 5 lbs of it. Next time, I will buy Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning which is what I was trying to replace initially with the Amazing Taste Cajun Blend. I don't like writing bad reviews- but felt it was necessary to warn others. Amazon should really not sell this.

review/summary: Good crackers...bad packaging
review/text: I gave these 3 stars because I really like the flavor of these crackers, but as stated in many of the other reviewers' comments, they don't hold up in shipping, so for the packaging, I would only give them about 1 star.  I actually purchased 18 boxes (3 cases), 6 each of the 3 flavors and I had to open all 18 boxes to just get enough "whole" crackers for my guests (8 people) for Thanksgiving appetizers.  I could only get about 6-8 crackers per box that were not broken literally into crumbs.  I did, however, contact the factory and they were very apologetic and said they will address the problem and offered to send me additional boxes.  Hopefully these will arrive in better condition and they will get the problem resolved, because I would love to keep purchasing these crackers.

review/summary: Very good -  Green Tea Frappuccino addict
review/text: I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!<br /><br />1 1/2c milk<br /><br />2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder<br /><br />1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)<br /><br />10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)<br /><br />Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!

review/summary: Great for the price & health benefits!
review/text: I suppose I'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first I've tried, but I really, really enjoy this matcha. It's smooth, mellow, and slightly sweet. I'm picky about loose green teas for steeping; some of those are bitter, & I DON'T like bitter tea. So my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price.

review/summary: Not the best quality, but okay for the price
review/text: Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice.

review/text: I got hooked on matcha but found the habit price prohibitive.  I was paying $8 for 1 oz. Then I found this matcha on Amazon and I made my first cup last night and I hated it.  Then I made my second cup this morning a discover the secret of perfect matcha.  The secret is don't use too much of the emerald green powder or you will have one heck of a bitter cup of tea, which is what I did with my first cup.  A dainty scoop (about 1/8 of a tsp) is all you need for a delicious cup and if it tastes bitter use less.  This is medicine, this is pure pleasure and relaxation and a little goes a long way making this a great deal.  I figured if 2 containers weighing 10.58 oz each would have cost me about $160 if I paid the $8 per 1 oz that I was paying when I got hooked on matcha.  So this deal saves me about $120...now I wonder how long will this purchase of matcha last since I feel free to drink as much as I want and am no longer limited to one cup in the morning and one cup in the evening.<br /><br />A good read that explains the philosophy of tea (Teaism) is The Book of Tea, free for kindle and written over 100 years ago.  It explains the 3 historical periods of tea, which matcha being the second period.  The 3 periods of tea refers to the way the tea was prepared.  The first period is caked tea, then whipped tea (matcha), then steeped tea.  Matcha is an ancient way of preparing tea.<br /><br />Consider purchasing the bamboo whisk to whip your matcha because if you don't whip it you will get little clumps.  I drink my matcha from a small bowl purchased at the local Asian store which allows for the whipping of my matcha and is the traditional way.

review/text: This is the first matcha powder I've used so I am unable to comment on it's quality compared to other products. You do get a LOT for your money. These two boxes will last me at least 6 months.<br /><br />I read about this in Muscle & Fitness magazine for its numerous health benefits, mainly it's high content in anti-oxidants, cancer prevention, detoxification, increased fat metabolism and energy. One tiny measuring spoon of this stuff is 10 times more potent than regular green tea and it's noticable. I have been using green tea extract in capsule form and it is no comparison to the matcha powder. I feel more energized and alert without any jitters or insomnia. I feel less food cravings over the course of the day. My metabolism has increased. I am able to eat 100-200 additional calories per day (yes, I'm one of those calorie counters) yet my body fat has decreased by 2%. I also believe it enhances your immune system as I have made it through the entire flu season without getting sick from any of my contagious co-workers.<br /><br />The powder is easy to use. I micro-wave 1/3 cup of filtered water in a small cup, stir in a measuring spoon of matcha powder, then dump it into ice water or protein shake. The taste is creamy and does not require sweetener for my taste. I am a matcha convert for life. My next project will be making green tea ice cream with this stuff.

review/summary: Price is OK, flavor a bit bitter
review/text: Got some matcha in Japan from the airport and it was surprisingly tasty.  Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out.  So, with matcha it's just gonna happen, since you can't take out the tea bag.<br /><br />That said, the Japan matcha was more granular than a "powder", more like sand really, and did not produce much bitterness even after ten minutes in hot water.  This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder.  It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had.  The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further.  To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings.  I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously.  Using the smaller amount, it works great for hot tea and does not become bitter.

review/summary: Awesome.
review/text: I've got everyone in my office hooked on this stuff, and I drink it daily. It's a stronger stimulant than coffee, and has a smoother, less-jittery feel to it thanks to the Theanine and general nutritional content. It's quite tasty and a great deal for the price.<br /><br />I love the product but don't really follow the tradition whatsoever. I prepare mine in a metal, insulated thermos. One scoop of matcha per coffee-cup sized glass of hot water. Put lid on thermos and shake vigorously. Shaking has provided the absolute smoothest, foamiest blend I've seen so far and gets rid of any clumping. I cut the flavor a bit with honey, but really it just tastes like strong tea. It's important not to add too much matcha to your water or you'll end up with a thick sludge of green tea at the bottom of your glass.<br /><br />The only downside to this beverage is that if you drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, it can make you feel very nauseous. Eating a piece of toast can fix this, though.<br /><br />Another recipe that cures the nausea is: One cup water, Two cups vanilla almond milk. Add honey/sugar and ice. Delicious!

review/text: Many other reviewers have compared this matcha to Starbucks and I agree it has good flavor but the dissolution is very poor regardless of how you make ie hot or cold blended stirred shaken etc...I have watched them make iced green tea lattes at Starbucks and their powder dissolves even when added after the syrup milk and ice...This product just does not dissolve completely and you end up either with a layer of tea at the bottom or if you keep stirring while consuming a flim of grittness in your mouth...Yes is a bargain for the amount you get at the price and flavor.. But I would not buy again and would appreciate any suggestions as to a different matcha that dissolves completely.....

review/summary: This is very LOW QUALITY matcha
review/text: This matcha is terrible compared to real Japanese ceremony-grade matcha. It is bitter, gritty, and generally doesn't taste good.<br /><br />So, why did I give it 5 stars?<br /><br />Quality matcha can easily cost USD $2.00 per GRAM. At that price, 10.53 oz. (the amount in a single ~$21 box of Vita-Life) would cost about USD $600.00!<br /><br />The trade off is that this is really bottom-end quality that a Japanese tea aficionado would scoff at. That said...who cares? If you want the Matcha experience, go elsewhere, but if you want all well-documented health benefits of matcha/green tea as well as the convenience of having a powder that will mix with many other foods, this is a great deal.<br /><br />I use about a teaspoon of powder on my morning breakfast cereal, on smoothies, and I use about a quarter of a cup per batch of cookie dough. To date I am on my 24th box since February 2, 2009.<br /><br />About caffeine:<br /><br />Green tea (and therefore matcha) does contain caffeine. Very roughly, one teaspoon contains about as much caffeine as a 6oz cup of black coffee. The caffeine in matcha tends to be released more slowly, though -- over a period of about 6 hours vs. 2 to 3 for coffee. Do not use this in anything you will be consuming before going to sleep!

When I made it hot, there would be clumps of tea that wouldn't mix and if it sat too long it'd get bitter. As a cold blended latte, however, it's great, and rivals Starbucks' green tea frappuccino.

A few drops of lemon helps with what is otherwise an unappealing taste.

Or for fewer calories, a sorbet can easily be made as well.<br /><br />Add it to your morning oatmeal or other cereal -- green cereal? Why not? &lt;:-)<br /><br />You can cook with it as well, but since I am a sugar addict, I will rest my case with the ice cream/sorbet suggestions.<br /><br />And of course, this is a WONDERFUL brew, just as is, hot from the pot and into your cup.

As a non-ceremonial grade tea, I believe it is well worth buying.

review/summary: Good For Upping the Nutritional Ante
review/text: I bought this recently. When I received it, I was surprised at how much you get...there is a decent amount of tea in each cute green cardboard box. (No, they didn't just toss it in a box, there is a silver bag inside the box for keeping it fresh.)<br />I like to drink chilled green tea, so I bought some Lipton green tea iced tea mix. I was sipping it (it tastes great) and thought, this stuff doesn't have enough actual green tea in it, so I did some looking around and found the powdered Macha. I am the definitive tea drinker and have had almost every tea in the galaxy, but ONE...this one. I am glad I bought it; it adds extra nutrients (EGCG, some more antioxidants, plus it boosts metabolism) to my regular beverages and you can add it to anything you want to..like, say, a smoothie or a cookie recipe. (Martha Stewart's website has a recipe for green tea ice cream and green tea shortbread leaves (cookies) you could make with this powder. I look forward to trying to make ice cream with it, seems unusual.<br />The one caveat I offer for this tea is this: do NOT drink beverages made with this tea *on an empty stomach* or you will rue the day. I did this once, and got a major tummy ache. Let my experience make you wiser. :)<br />And Enjoy.

I usually buy the chocolate (which I still do!), but I made my own drink with the vanilla Instant Breakfast and 2 nice scoops of the green tea powder. It is the best morning drink (for me at least!) This does also make great hot green tea! Enjoy!!

review/text: This powder was not really what I was expecting. When I say that, I mean that I really didn't care for the taste nor the color. This was my 3rd order of matcha green tea powder (3 separate orders from 3 separate vendors). My first order was from MatchaTeaSource and was premium grade matcha green tea powder,I also paid a premium price for this as well as premium shipping costs. My second order was the Teavana DoMatcha, through Amazon and although I liked this equally as well, the price for a small tin of tea was also at a premium plus shipping. I then came across the VitaLife Matcha Green Tea Powder - the color was not the bright green I was expecting and the powder did not mix as easily as the other teas. The aroma I got from the tea was not pleasant and reminded me of fresh cut grass. I have been drinking hot green tea lattes and iced green tea lattes using the matcha green tea powder for about one year. I am saving a lot of money by not buying these at Starbucks and mine actually taste better. I use 2-3 tsp of the matcha green tea powder, 8 oz cold nonfat milk and one Truvia sweetener - I mix this using a latte whip or a martini shaker (if iced). It's awesome!

review/summary: Necco, what have you done?
review/text: The new Sweethearts are here.<br /><br />Yellow is now lemon instead of banana.<br /><br />Green is now apple instead of lime.<br /><br />There is no white heart.<br /><br />The pink one, formerly cherry, is now strawberry.<br /><br />The purple one almost tastes like the old one (medicine), but not exactly.<br /><br />There is a blue one and it tastes like chemicals.<br /><br />The taste for all of the flavors ranges from 'soap-like' to 'chemical-infused'.<br /><br />Why mess with a classic?  Nothing was wrong with the old flavors, but this new candy is too horrible to eat.  I could not finish the bag.

review/summary: One word..... bleckkkk.
review/text: I'm not opposed to change,but I do oppose change when change wasn't needed in the first place. I am so disappointed in Necco's misguided decision to change their classic Sweethearts conversation hearts. Once a great traditional candy they're now just gross. They changed all the flavors, eliminated the white ones all together (which as luck would have it, were my favorites) and changed the nice crunchy texture to a soft disintegrating mess. Bleck. What a huge mistake. Why change a trusty classic? Why not just make a new candy?

review/summary: If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It
review/text: I don't know why companies always mess with a good thing. At least Coke learned their lesson. I bought these last year, thinking I was buying what I had always bought.  When I tasted them I thought maybe these are some new, extra kind, and I just picked up the wrong box...nope. They changed them all. Without even asking their customers. The flavor is fruity in a very bad way, the satisfying slighty crunchy texture is gone. I can see in the stores this year that they are still the same as last year.  A few unsuspecting people pick them up and put them in their carts...but not many.  These are definitely not flying off the shelves.  After Valentine's Day there will be tons of them left, they won't be able to give them away. So goodbye until you go back to the old Conversation Hearts!

review/summary: Disgusting, and a destroyed holiday tradition
review/text: The "new" Necco conversation hearts are disgusting and gross, and they have destroyed a candy tradition that has defined Valentine's Day for me for my entire life.  It's hard to imagine that anyone is buying the new hearts - at least not twice - but after three years I've given up hope that they will reverse their decision.  Necco, you've lost my business - for all of your products - forever.

review/summary: sorry NECCO, the new flavors are gross
review/text: NECCO ruined the Stark Hearts flavors in a move to pander to a new generation.<br /><br />Simply put, every color (flavor) tastes like poison. How can the company that still puts out the decent and old school NECCO wafer, screw up a sure thing?<br /><br />Count me in the disappointed.
