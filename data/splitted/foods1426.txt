review/summary: Not the best, not the worst.
review/text: I recently ordered this because I was excited about the reduced plastic in the packaging. Interestingly, the day I ordered it my husband came home with the same brand from the grocery store, so I've now tried 2 different flavors. I would give both the same review. The coffee is okay. It's not horrendous, as some people seem to imply, and its not amazing either. The smell is good and smells like nice fresh coffee when you open the box. The flavor is nice enough too. I also love super strong coffee. I drink Revv, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, etc. I would not say that this coffee rivals them, but it is stronger than some other medium roast coffees.<br /><br />Big reasons why I wouldn't give this 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The coffee gets very watered down when brewed on a larger cup size. I usually do the 10 oz size and this coffee just doesn't cut it for that. I feel it becomes more like coffee flavored water at that point. 8 oz is better, but its ideal at 6 oz. So, now I just save it for when I want a small cup.<br /><br />2) There is a strange film that brews with the coffee. You can see it floating on top and it sticks to the sides of the mug when you tilt it, so there is like a ring of residue that gets left around the edge where the coffee moved away. You can also see it as darker specks floating on top after you add creamer. I don't know what this is. I have no other coffee that does this. It doesn't really change the taste or texture or anything, but I just don't like it.<br /><br />I think the packaging is a big plus though. I am not sure why the cups being open is such an issue for people. I just put all mine in a zip lock bag (that I can just keep reusing) to keep it air tight. It's really not that difficult. Plus I think it's important to cut down on plastic waste.<br /><br />So all in all, I do plan to buy this coffee again. I like that I can reduce waste and I like it enough that its good for a midday refresher since it has to be a small cup. We are also on a tight budget so that helps as well. However, I don't see myself replacing all my coffee with it, because I want a much larger and stronger cup of coffee in the morning and brewing two of these eliminates both the value and the positive aspects of less waste.

Fog Chaser has its own taste, one you don't have to search for.  Once the pak of 12 has been opened, store the remaining pods in a seal-tight container.  And the PRICE is RIGHT!  :o)

review/summary: Compared to other dark or bold brews...
review/text: Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning.

review/text: I thought I would try these K-cups because they were about 15% less expensive than the other ones available.  I was a little concerned with the packaging in that the bottom of the K-cup is a filter and not solid plastic like a standard one.  However, aside from a very fine trace at the bottom of my coffee mug, there is no mess and no fuss.  The coffee is very smooth, too.  I will be making this one of my regular choices for K-cups from now on.

review/summary: Not a Real K Cup packaging//DO NOT BUY
review/text: I bought these expecting a standard K cup.  What I received was a coffee pod that is smaller in size than a K cup and appears to be a "filter" type material vice a plastic container.  As a result, they do not fit in the standard K cup dispensers and the coffee does not stay fresh like the standard K cup.  It appears the "filter" type material (like fine rice paper) of this coffee pod allows free flow of air and allows the coffee to go stale.  Requires you to store the coffee pods in a zip lock bag to ensure freshness remains.<br /><br />I will not buy these type K coffee pods again and I am surprised that the Amazon web site does not clearly identify the K cup material issue<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++<br />UPDATE-I emailed Amazon regarding the web site issue not being clear as to KCup packaging type.  Amazon refunded my money since they want the customer happy.  Amazon is a great place to shop and has high customer focus and is very much appreciated.

review/text: I must be doing something wrong because I feel this coffee is way too strong for a single 8oz. cup of coffee.  But, I bought it so I'm shoveling some of the coffee out of the container before I put it in my Rival single cup maker (which has no piercing device).  Some have called this a full bodied medium roast coffee; I call it strong.  The cups are more rounded on the bottom but they do fit in my device.  I'll use up the ocffee and then try something even milder as this is too strong for my taste buds.

review/text: I bought these at the grocery store just to try them. They are probably the worst k cups ever. The taste is terrible. I tried both the fog chaser and rainforest blend. They both taste awful, like bark and dirt. There is dark brown "sediment" left in the bottom of the cup when you drink this brand. I find that the taste is strong in the dirt department, but highly lacking in the coffee flavor area. I will never buy these again. I like my coffee in the morning, but I actually dread having to use these if there is nothing else available.

review/summary: Not your average K-cup, but worth a taste
review/text: I have my concerns about this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: It tastes good. Fog Chaser is a little more robust than I like for a morning blend (I tend toward a Dunkin Donuts style coffee first thing in the AM), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. The nonstandard pods fit into my B70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) Grove Square. Yes, I'd buy these again.<br /><br />Now the negatives. As has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. There's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. I've heard concerns about the Keurig success causing more spent K-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; I'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. So a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />However, one of the charms of Keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: I've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. Oxygen is the enemy of coffee. Old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. Keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the San Francisco Bay Coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. The bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. After all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (I can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. If you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, I'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />My concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the Keurig system is a godsend. For example, I dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when I visited. Having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. These, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />So in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. Keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. Companies that go through a whole lot of K-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most K-cups.

review/summary: Delightfully Surprised
review/text: I ordered this on a whim when I received an e-mail from Amazon about new deals in k-cups. I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe.

Since it's not the proprietary k cup design, they can probably avoid royalties to Keurig. But in the end you drink coffee not for looks or cost but taste.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: I was a little worried about this k-cup since it is shaped differently from the regular k-cups. Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic. The bottom part is enclosed in a coffee filter type holding. While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma. There is no bitter or burned taste. This is quickly becoming my favorite keurig coffee and I can't wait to try the other offerings from this company.

review/summary: WARNING - open mesh coffee pods, NOT K-Cups
review/text: I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box.

The only negative side comment I can make is that sometimes the top gets stuck on the upper needle of the Keurig but no problem just pull it off from the top rather than picking it up out of the brewing basket, and if you close the machine and open again it is always off the needle anyway.

review/summary: SF Bay "Fog Chaser"
review/text: This is my second favorite flavor from SFBC.  Breakfast blend is still the best.  All flavors have plenty of flavor for a 16oz travel mug. (If you don't have the larger cup size on your machine, brew at the small cup setting and lift the handle and brew again) Can't beat the value especially if you get them via Amazon subscription.  Hey Amazon when are you going to sell these in the 80 pack?

review/summary: Very good coffee, nice alternative to k-cup
review/text: Having a cup, soon to be two cups, of Fog Chaser from San Francisco Bay Coffee this morning. Very good. They call these "OneCup" but they work in Keurig brewers. Guessing this is a result of the k-cup patent or copyright, whatever it is, running out but wow, this is some good good coffee.

review/summary: Good Coffee at Good Price (good=not GREAT)
review/text: We've ordered the Fog Chaser OneCup twice now. The first time we ordered it, I LOVED it. We are avid coffee drinkers in my house, and both love a nice bold coffee. Since the price was right and we liked the coffee, we ordered again. The 2nd shipment we received was still "good" coffee, but it wasn't as great as the first. My husband says he couldn't tell much difference, but the 2nd shipment did not have the same smooth finish and mouth-watering aroma as the original. That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a "crema" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely. I do think we will try this again and see if "the third time is the charm". I will try to remember to update on what we think so that we can provide some feedback as far as consistency goes.<br />Thanks for reading!

review/summary: finally coffee for my picky palate!
review/text: Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more "green" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma.

review/text: SFBC's Fog Chaser is on the bold side... dark, rich, but not too much aftertaste.  A great daily coffee. Be aware that the entire cup is not plastic, but the bottom portion is almost filter material. This might affect how long you keep the cups before using. The cups are vacuum sealed into a larger plastic bag, so that should help with freshness...<br /><br />The cost is on the low end for k-cups and makes this coffee even more inviting!!!  I definitely recommend as a staple daily coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

Tastes much better with some cream and sugar.<br /><br />I ended up subscribing to these because I like them so much.  Definitely worth a try for coffee drinkers.

review/summary: Great coffee!
review/text: I was looking for a good quality coffee in a K-cup to use with my Kuerig. I have the reusable cup and love it but was looking for the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups for workday mornings.<br /><br />These K-cups were exactly what I was looking for, convenience and delicious coffee! I prefer a bolder coffee and this Fog Chaser fit the bill. I also felt this was an excellent deal considering most K-cups retail for $10.00-$16.99 for a package of 12 K-cups (and sometimes 10) and this was 80 cups for just over $30.00. The other thing I love about this is being able to have it on the subscription program.  You can set up your delivery to be delivered whenever you like beginning with 1 month intervals and you get a small discount on the price when you order through a subscription. With a quantity of 80, I've set my deliveries to come every 4 months but it may turn out that I will have to shorten it to every three months.<br /><br />If you have a Kuerig and love the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups, you can't go wrong with this product. It is a bold coffee but this company makes several types that are available in several blends. I highly recommend this product and the added  value of the subscription option.

I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Doing a side by side comparison, Fog Chaser wins hands down! If you like a bold cup that lingers on your tongue and hold up under creamer too (I use unsweetened coconut milk), you will be happy you tried this coffee. Oh! A huge added bonus of the new environmentally friendly K Cup design is that you get that heavenly coffee aroma from the minute you open the vacuum sealed bag! You don't have to wait until its brewing to "wake up and smell the coffee!" :)

It's really the perfect design for re-use as the grounds dry out completely overnight and dump out very easily. I'm buying the whole bean San Francisco coffee to grind and refill the cup.

review/text: I don't usually write a review unless I think a item deserves it but this coffee deserves it. It came in 3 separate vacuum sealed bags. Make sure you store them in a proper container after you open them or they will go bad. When I opened one, the smell was super strong. I thought the coffee was going to be bitter but after brewing it in my Keurig B130 a few times I was hooked. Not bitter at all but the smell is a little strong. But it grew on me. I brew it with 8oz. of water and the strength is good enough for me. Just a bit of creamer or milk and no sugar. I drink only a cup a day. Also, its cheaper than normal K cups and less waste. I'm not going to say that this will be my favorite forever, but it is good and if you are looking at trying something new with your K cup maker then these are worth a shot. I will keep these stocked along with other the flavors of K cups I have enjoyed.

I usually run a K-Cup through the largest setting and then through the smallest (my coffee cup is rather large :). This Fog Chaser coffee holds up rather well. I've gotten a great, bold cup of joe every morning since receiving these. There have been no problems with grounds in the cup as sometimes happens with regular K-Cups or the refillable K-Cups.<br /><br />The 80 count box came with a reusable storage container that holds a week of pods. It's just a flimsy, clear plastic container but it does keep the coffee fresh.

review/text: Ahhh...nothing like a good cup of coffee! I'm a bargain hunter and have considered going back to my drip coffee due to the rising prices of K cups.I read all the reviews,and feeling there was nothing to lose I debated between French Roast and Fog Chaser. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the "netted" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me. Obviously, I am a San Francisco Bay Coffee fan. If you choose to try this product, I'm pretty sure you will be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Excellent Taste and More Robust Brewing with These Type of Pods
review/text: I decided to give these a try based on the price, the favorable reviews here on Amazon, and its sales rank in the K-cup store.  I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a "clean" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!

review/summary: Good Alternative to More Pricey "Bold" K-Cups
review/text: SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser was a nice "bold" surprise.  I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable.

review/summary: Very Good K-Cup Coffee at a nice price
review/text: Fog Chaser has a very good flavor, and it is reasonably strong especially for a K-Cup.  I like it better than their French Roast version, which seems stronger but more harsh to me; and I like very strong coffee.  Their Rainforest version has a more mellow taste that is also very good, but it is weaker strength than Fog Chaser.  The price for any of the versions, especially for the "subscribe and save", is very good.  The packaging, which is a box of 3 sealed bags of 12 is fine to deal with; once you open a sealed bag (you can't reseal the bag), just use a ziplock to seal the remainder for the week.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: I have been a picky Keurig fan for about ten years, have always bought my coffee from either onegreatcup or amazon (because stores just don't have the selection), and until now had settled on Jet Fuel as my favorite -- just so you know what I like. FogChaser is in that league: rich, deep, dark, zesty, overall INTERESTING and best of all (unlike the plastic-bottomed K-cups) brewing it makes my kitchen smell good again. I'm putting it on subscription.  A good find; a keeper -- glad I tried it.

review/summary: Great Coffee!
review/text: I think this is a little known brand of coffee, but it beats Senseo's  by a mile! I'm glad Senseo was on backorder - I was tempted to try The Pod. It's a very full-bodied coffee, but smooth. Doctor's orders, I can drink only so much regular coffee, and finding a decent decaf is a problem. This decaf is superb! In fact, my husband brought me a cup of decaf the other AM - and I couldn't tell that it wasn't "hi-test.!"<br />If you like a dark, deep, smooth coffee, give The Pod a try.

review/text: Decaffeinated tea is often weak with slightly unpleasant tastes and odors. This tea stands up well to milk and sugar. I often use one bag to brew 12 oz of tea. I purchase most of my tea as loose tea and enjoy Taj Mahal, Chinese Pu Erh and black, and Southern India estate teas. I am glad that this is available via Amazon because my local grocery stopped stocking in it in its rush toward carrying bargain items.

review/text: This is one of the best tea bags you can buy, decaf or not. I love the bold rich flavor and its deep color, which, to me, is essential with milk. It is also perfect with lemon (with sugar). Other than Harrod's Blend #16, which costs way more, this is my favorite (everyday) tea! My kids love it too - okay, maybe because they like to say "Poon-jana"; but i like it because i don't have to give them some diluted tea so as to cut down on caffeine. But then, this can't be decaf tea, can it?

review/summary: Some Education About Vegan Cats
review/text: Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians.<br /><br />Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know "garbage in, garbage out!"<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix.

review/summary: Kitties go crazy for veggie cat food!
review/text: The two little darlings at my home have been eating this particular cat food since we got them from the local shelter at the ripe young age of 6 months.  We chose to switch them over to vegetarian cat food for two reasons: 1) both of us are ethical vegetarians, and 2) we could!<br /><br />We switched them using the same methods vets have recommended when undergoing any change in diet for felines--slowly mixing them together in differing proportions until all that they eat is the new kind of food.  In this way the cats do not undergo any kind of indigestion that might cause them to throw up (those with cats already will understand completely).<br /><br />But what was the surest sign that we were doing the right thing for our cats?  Even on the first day, and for everyday it was given to them after, they ignored the meat-based cat food, eating only the vegetable-based pieces from their bowl!  Everyday when I went to feed them in the morning, they would be waiting next to a bowl with meat-food detritus, staring impatiently for the vegetable goodness.<br /><br />As for their level of health, I have literally never known two cats to be sweeter or more active than these.  And I don't mean chaotic, but playful, pouncy, and sweet.  Is it all because of the food?  I can't say to 100% certainty.  But know this: when we got the kittens they were shy and scared, seemingly because both only have vision in their left eyes.  Now they are more daring than even the most normal of cats.<br /><br />All this and we don't have to participate in the inhumane practice of feeding waste animals to our companion friends!

review/summary: Older cat acting like a kitten again!
review/text: I recently adopted two cats and transitioned them to Evolution food. They like the taste and try to break into the closet where we store the food. My older cat is obese and used to just lie around, couldn't jump up on the bed, and threw up a lot. Since putting her on Evolution food, she is gradually losing weight, plays with the other cat, can jump, and throws up a lot less. I know lots of other people whose animals have been healthy on Evolution food for years.

review/summary: Veggie Kitties
review/text: My cats are just nuts about this food.  I transitioned them (one is 10 and the other is almost 12) to Evolution about 4 years ago with some trepidation. I read _The Obligate Carnivore_ and being vegan myself was persuaded to give vegan cat food a try. At the time my oldest kitty, Daisy, was on prescription cat food (Science Diet, I think) that I could only purchase from the vet--she had a history of urinary tract infections. Even while eating the prescription food she would occasionally have flair ups. Since she's been eating Evolution she has not had even one flair up. In fact, she's practically abusive about having a full bowl at all times. Even her vet (who doesn't know that Daisy's food is vegan) is astonished at how youthful she appears and acts. That's all the evidence I needed to feed my girls an animal free diet.

review/summary: My cats love it.
review/text: I'm a vegetarian. This was my reason for switching my my kitties from meat based food to vegetable based. I was skeptical to purchase Evolution, thinking it too good to be true, but I was so pleasantly surprised. As soon as I set out the food, they took to it immediately. They appeared to be healthier, with fur that was silkier and softer than ever.<br /><br />Taurine and proteins are the main factors for kitty health. Conventional garbage that they sell in the supermarket that is passed off as "pet food" is slaughterhouse  by product including animal s**t. It's true,  they put dried up feces in pet food.<br /><br />If you love your kitty and are concerned for the ethical well-being of all animals, switch to Evolution. Conventional pet food is so stripped any nutritional value that pet food companies have to add synthetic nutrients to give it some form of nutrition. So you might as well give your pets food that is human grade( edible for humans), natural and vegan, and contains the nutrients they need and nutrients they can synthesize. They WILL love the taste of Evolution cat kibble.<br /><br />So people who say cats are supposed to eat meat are just trying to justify their own unethical behavior. It really is about Evolution.<br />Look, we evolved right? So can our animal friends.

I was looking for something different from Tobasco and this fit the bill.<br /><br />However, my boyfriend said it was not very hot.<br /><br />He has a fairly good spice tolerance.  For example, he asks for Thai and Indian food Hot, I ask for it Mild.  I tried some sauce straight and thought it was hot but I have a much lower tolerance.  Keep this in mind that if you like things blazing hot (Indian and Thai food made for the locals) it will probably be medium for you.  If you eat things mild to medium, it will be hot.

review/summary: Spicy, Versatile & Full of Flavor vs. "Knock-Your-Socks-Off" Hot
review/text: First off, can I say that I LOVE Nando's? It's a peri-peri restaurant chain that has many branches worldwide and which I know and love as a favorite standby from the UK, but which has only a couple of branches in the US. Neither of those branches are within even a thousand miles of my home in Ohio, so my Nando's fixes are very few and far between. I love that their peri-peri sauces are available in the US, and buy them whenever I can as an all-purpose condiment to serve with anything and everything that could do with a bit of spicing up.<br /><br />Secondly... while I LOVE these sauces, even the "extra hot" version doesn't even begin to come close to some of the sauces that real chili-heads will be used to, i.e. the ones that rate so high on the Scoville scale that you're advised to only add them to your food one minuscule drip at a time. Nando's sauces are more of the "slosh generously all over your plate" variety if you have any kind of a taste and tolerance for the burny stuff, and I tend to use it more like ketchup than a genuine "hot" sauce. That's not meant as an insult to the sauces, though - don't get me wrong, I really do love them, but I get through a whole lot more of this stuff than I do the dangerously hot sauces I buy almost entirely for the burn. Nando's peri-peri sauces are just not like that; they're meant to be enjoyed for their complex flavor rather than as a challenge, so please don't buy a bottle of this stuff expecting to have your head blown off with a single taste.<br /><br />I love the Nando's Extra Hot and Hot sauces as a dip for fries and anything else that requires dunking, and it is also a firm favorite in my household when mixed liberally with a bit of mayo and/or sour cream for a spicy dipping sauce that works well with appetizers of all kinds. It works really well as a marinade for chicken, too - definitely one to try when you're grilling out.<br /><br />My only "problem" (and it's not really a problem, as such) is that I get through these little bottles far too quickly. Anyone who's ever been to a Nando's restaurant will know that customers can take as many HUGE bottles (I mean, containing maybe 2-3 pints) of peri-peri sauce in any and every strength and flavor variation back to their table to apply as freely to their meal as they wish. When I try that at home I find I've emptied a $5 bottle of sauce before I know it. I just wish they'd start making it available in stores in industrial-sized bottles for dedicated Nando-lovers such as myself!<br /><br />Finally, if you ever find yourself in a city that has a Nando's restaurant, I'd heartily recommend that you go along and try it out. Order some peri-peri chicken to suit your own personal chili tolerance level, a Portuguese or Brazilian beer and (my personal favorite) a bowl of their spicy mixed nuts to munch on while you wait for your order (these are SERIOUSLY hot and I love them so very, very much) and, well... enjoy! :)

review/text: Great to see the Xtra Hot available through Amazon as it was out of stock on Nando site. My family and I love the extra hot.. we can't get enough. You can be fooled as initially it does not feel hot, however a couple more bites and it gets you.

review/text: People.  My husband and I have been buying Seabear Smoked Salmon in quantities of 20 at a time for the past 4 years to give as Christmas presents.  We give it to our work colleagues and friends.  We are heroes because of it!  Our friends LOVE it and so do we.  The flavored versions are fantastic, but so is the "plain" version.  It is terrific as an appetizer, but the few times I have leftovers, I use it in Quiche and it is divine.  You can't get a better deal on it than at Amazon.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: I've had the Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai Blueberries and whatever the pomegranate version is called, and both are excellent, as is the raspberry one (actually, my favorite).  I had ordered two, one for me and one for a friend who just had surgery.  Per the email I received, they were to be delivered on a Friday (my day off) but instead arrived on Tuesday, which would normally be a good thing, but it happened to be 95 degrees that day so both bags were melted.  Still edible as can be chopped up, but defintely ruins the look and ease of eating them.  Will wait until cold weather before ordering again.

One big problem:  it's always treated with alkaline which gives me migraines, and other organics I've tasted don't remotely resemble good chocolate.  Then along came Rapunzel--an ugly can (hey guys, you need to redesign) but terrific tasting organic cocoa that gives me NO MIGRAINES!<br /><br />I used to buy the 5 lb bag but can't get it anymore.

I hope that doesn't mean they'll raise their prices! I tasted it side-by-side with a similar organic product I'd been using, which was alkaline processed, and you CAN tell the difference .. Rapunzel tasted better!

review/summary: The Real Deal - Not Alkali Processed
review/text: This is such a delicious cocoa powder. My skin has never been better since I started using this cocoa powder. The key is that is NOT "Dutched" with alkali. Most of the cocoa powders out there have been proceesed with alkali to remove the acids and make the cocoa taste "better". The problem (undisclosed by purveyors of mass cocoa) is that the alkali Dutching removes a significant portion of the antioxidants. Dutched cocoa powders are less robust but will not deliver the same health benefits. Rapunzel is good value and top in its class.

Sometimes I sprinkle it with a dusting of organic instant coffee. Even a teaspoon full of cocoa prepared this way makes a very nice treat after a meal.

review/text: Rapuzel Cocoa is the best cocoa I have used to date. Flavor is very rich. The fact that it is organic and grown by farmers co-operatives is a major plus for all. The only drawback that I have is that I, or you, can buy it for much less elsewhere online or in a natural food store, in New York no less!  Why does Amazon still advertise this product.

review/text: The last cocoa power I used was hershey cocoa dark chocolate which is a dutch processed cocoa.  The quality difference between this brand and hershey's is night and day.  Rapunzel is very chocolaty and rich.  I usually add a scoop to my protein shakes in the morning and it was the best shake I've had.  This stuff is good.  The only thing I would say was that I bought this stuff for $5.99 a can at Whole Foods, so the price here is a little crazy.
