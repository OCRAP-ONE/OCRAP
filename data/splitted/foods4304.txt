review/summary: Earth's Best variety pack
review/text: Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good.

review/summary: These flavors taste terrible
review/text: My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These "gourmet" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!

review/summary: bad batch?
review/text: I just received a box of these and almost half of them were either frozen and thawed, or packaged wrong. They weren't a creamy consistency at all, but chunky and watery. I have used Earth's Best for quite a while and never had any like this. We did just have a snow storm and it might have come through some icy conditions, but I had to throw half of them out. The other half looked fine. All the lids popped open, so the seals were fine. I have no idea what was wrong, but I won't be ordering these again.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: Purchased for my 6-month-old & as you know babies tend to fluctuate in their interest for what they're eating. My baby enjoys this gourmet food however he does not like the Tender Beef Spinach . . . no matter what I've tried in changing the flavor (such as adding a fruit as a side dish), he still won't eat it. It's strange because he loves spinach, go figure. I've tasted all 4 flavors & they taste great to me. I rated 4-stars for this product only because my baby did not like nor would he eat the Tender Beef Spinach (even though I enjoyed the taste).

review/text: We've tried just about all varieties of baby food made by Earth's Best, and this variety pack is one of our favorites.  Each of the meals is a nice combination of veggies and protein.  Our 10-month-old particularly enjoys the Sweet Pea Turkey Wild Rice and Tender Beef Spinach varieties.  It can be difficult to find baby food with iron-rich beef that our baby actually likes, so we're happy with this one.

review/text: Our son loves the flavor combinations in this variety pack, especially the chicken Mango Risotto. They can be a little runny so sometimes we mix in a little cereal to thicken them up for ease of spoon feeding but since he eats the whole jar, I can't complain.

review/text: I was hoping these would be a bit more exciting than they were. My son eats everything, but was fairly disinterested in these. I don't really blame him, I tried them myself and was underwhelmed with the flavor. Couldn't detect mango at all in the mango risotto! Organic ingredients are a huge plus though, so I'm glad they exist.

review/summary: Am shocked at the contents!
review/text: I chose this brand of baby food as I dont have enough time to prepare my own. Organic and nice it seemed. It states from 6 months and up. My son is 7 months. All of a sudden he started drinking large amounts of water which lead me to look closer at the label. There is up to 20 mg of sodium in these things!! A baby under 1 year has no kidney function and cannot eat salt! THen all of a sudden he had break outs in his face. Happened twice. I looked at what he had eaten those two times. SPINACH! A baby under one year should NOT have spinach! I am absolutely puzzled how a company producing food for babies, have no idea about the most general of knowledge concerning babies. I have taken my son off this food and am making my own and can only hope I have not damaged his little body by these two weeks of eating "Earths Best Organic"!

review/summary: improper seal = botulism risk!
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods.  I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.  He likes the flavors fine except for the Chicken Mango Risotto (hates it).

review/summary: CAREFUL with this product
review/text: Verbac products in general have been SUPERIOR in my opinion, especially the HEXtra chews. I thought I'd give these VeggieDent Chews a try for some variety. Here's the problem - since these are marketed as a means to clean a dogs teeth, I would expect them to last a while during which the chewing and gnawing action would indeed help the dogs teeth, but here's the snag, I have a small-to-medium size dog and he went through one of these chews in minutes, whereas the HEXtra chews last much longer. There wasn't any "chewing" involved, the dog just bit the VeggieDent Chew and it breaks off into smaller semi-sharp shards and only chews momentarily then its gone. I would have expected these chews to have a more chewy consistency rather than a hard consistency so a dog couldn't just bite through the chew and swallow the smaller pieces. I cannot possibly fathom any benefit to the dog's teeth in terms of removing plaque or reducing tarter. I wouldn't buy these again and will stick with the HEXtra line of chews.

review/summary: VeggieDent chews are much better AND SAFER than HEXtra chews
review/text: Our vet recommended getting "C.E.T. chews" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being "C.E.T chews" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole.<br /><br />The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one.<br /><br />In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two.<br /><br />Note: I've posted this review for the HEXtra chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews.

review/summary: These chews work and they are safe.
review/text: I like to keep my dogs teeth as clean as possible in between her yearly cleanings at the vet.  After trying a variety of methods, I settled on these chews for my dog(lab/shepard mix 80 pounds) because the rawhide C.E.T. chews were too easy for her to tear apart and choke on the large pieces.  The thin slices of rawhide tear too easily for larger and stronger dogs.  My dog nearly choked to death on the rawhide chews.  So I switched to these chews for my dog and they work great.  My dogs breath doesn't stink and this formulation is easy on her stomach.

review/summary: Zero Rating if I Could
review/text: One of my dogs has allergies and can't have any food or treats containing meat products.  So I thought purchasing VeggieDents was a logical choice and bought then on three different occasions.  The 3rd bag not only contained the Chews, it also contained small white WORMS.  That was upsetting enough, but I didn't notice the worms right away and had given my dogs these chews 2 separate times.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer,and Virbac wanted the bag sent to them to do an investigation.  I sent the bag back expecting a response.  No response, but I received a new package of VeggieDents in the mail.  This was over 6 months ago.  I called Virbac on several occasions, but no one knew about the bag of worms and chews.  No investigation either.<br /><br />No more VeggieDents for my dogs!

review/text: At my dog's 8 year vet visit, they told me to start brushing her teeth.  The vet said that my dog might even need to have a professional teeth cleaning sometime in the next year or so.  I started trying out some new teeth chews because she really does not like getting her teeth brushed.  I thought that it would be unlikely that she would like these chews - but surprise, surprise!  She LOVES these chews (she prefers them over other chews) and the vet said to me last week at her 9 year check-up that her teeth looked really good.  She said, "Do you brush her teeth?  They are in really good shape."  Good teeth & my dog loves these treats!  What more could I ask for?

review/summary: Great doggy dental cleaner
review/text: Our fourteen month old long haired chihuahua is very difficult to get to eat anything a second time. (Not including fresh blueberries.)Fortunately she likes these dental chews.  Her vet says that her teeth look great, so as long she will eat them these chews are part of her daily routine.

review/summary: cet veggident chews
review/text: This is an excellent  product. Our small golden doodle is a very picky eater and we have tried many different chews with mixed results. Many  gave him an upset stomach. The vet suggested CET veggiedent; he has been on it for the last two years with no side effects. He gets one chew a day and his teeth are free of tartar and plaque. In addition, he doesn't feel the need to gnaw on furniture or anything else but certain toys.

Our daughter has now changed to the C.E.T. Chews for her Shepard puppy. Happy with the price and fast delivery time the last 2 times we ordered.

The ingredients on the bag are: corn starch, glycerin, soya proteins, rice flour, palatable agent (Saccaromyces cerevisiae), sorbitol, corn derivatives, water, potassium sorbate, chlorhexidine digluconate. The bag says they are made in Vietnam. They can be broken in half if they are too big for your dog. Compared to other similar dog chews/treats on the market, these seem like a pretty good value to me.

review/summary: Too hard to chew - use caution
review/text: My dog is not at all a picky eater - in fact, he'll eat anything.  At least until these VeggieDent Chews.  He did initially but reluctantly try 2 of the chews but then refused any additional ones offered.  The chews make a significant cracking sound when he bites down on them and recently I can tell his mouth has been irritated.  It may be related to these hard chews - I'm not sure.  At any rate, he wants nothing to do with them anymore and when I gave him a beef hide CET chew as a substitute, he scarfed it down without any problem.  I liked the idea of the Veggie ones but he obviously prefers something he can actually "chew" not crack with his teeth.  So now I have a nearly full bag of the Veggie chews that may end up in the garbage.  Not sure I want to risk giving these to another dog.

review/summary: My Shih tzu & Pekingese love them!
review/text: I normally give my dogs fresh carrots to help keep their teeth clean but it can get a little messy. The VeggieDents last long - I get the regular size and just break them in half.  The only problem I found is that one of my dogs tries to swallow the stick once she's worn it down so it can be a shocking hazard for some dogs. I have to throw out the stick once it gets short enough to swallow.

review/text: I ordered regular chews and was charged for them.  I received small petite ones that are half the size.  They cost almost as much, however I was charged for the regular.  I always buy the regular and this is no doubt a packaging error.  I didn't realize this  and opened one package to find the small size.  How do I proceed.  This is a very unfair way to treat a continuing customer.  If you made the error, you should fix it.  I live in  a private house, and opened one bag, how can I return them?  Also the package slip says regular which they are not.  Please respond to this immediately.  Carol Gotay

I'm not exactly a chocolate connoisseur, but my wife has told me that chocolate here in the USA uses a high quantity of some wax (bee's wax?) type substances which you wont find in British chocolate (i.e. British chocolate is more pure, and it tastes a bit different than American chocolate). As far as my wife is concerned, this stuff is to-die for (very good).  Anyway, my wife took a second look and this is exactly what she wanted... She tells me this is fantastic stuff.

I buy a blackcurrant tea in Europe that actually tastes like cassis, so I know it is possible.<br /><br />It is drinkable, but nothing special. Look elsewhere if you want blackcurrant flavor.<br /><br />Do a search on Ahmad Blackcurrant tea on Amazon for more reviews.  It is sold in other configurations (different amounts per box).  Most of the other teas are good, this one is not worth the extra price.

review/summary: My bassett hound LOVES his food now...
review/text: Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.<br /><br />I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try "Canidae". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try.

review/summary: Good price for a highly rated dog food
review/text: I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door.

review/text: Both of my large breed dogs love Canidae.  I actually have to limit how much they can eat or they will make themselves sick by eating so much!  The ingredients are wonderful and actually contains stuff I would eat myself.  I would recommend this food for any animal lover.

review/summary: great dog food at the lowest cost
review/text: I bought the chicken meal and rice formula because I suspected my 8 year old Lab mix might have a food allergy related to corn or soy. Well, she does not. However I did learn a lot about dog food in the process. According to [...]  Canidae rates four stars whereas as everything on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart rates only one star. I was considering Blue Buffalo and other brands but they were $15 or higher in cost.<br />  I saved money buying Canidae and received dog food with the highest quality ingredients! I highly recommend it.<br />  One thing I must note. Some dog owners have reported reactions to changing to this brand. Although Canidae gives detailed instructions on their website on how to transition your dog to new dog food, they do not give these instructions on the bag. I strongly advise you to visit their website.

review/summary: Great choice for the active young dog!
review/text: I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.

review/summary: Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull
review/text: I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).

Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious. My dogs love it! They seem much healthier since I've switched to this brand. The folks that sell this are wonderful. Canadae was shipped to me free of charge (Amazon Prime.) It was carefully packaged: no rips, tears, or leaks. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Great food for a great price
review/text: We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food.

review/summary: best food out there
review/text: Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: Cost effective & so far a good alternative
review/text: We have a 52lb Basset/Beagle/who knows. For the past few years Boing has eaten a grain free + low gluten dehydrated food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QF363W">Honest Kitchen Force, Grain-Free Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Chicken, 10 Pound Box</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QW022C">Honest Kitchen Keen, Low-Gluten Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Turkey, 10 Pound Box</a>  But with finances compromised had to find a cheaper option & having completed extensive research decided to give Canidae a try. So far it's 50% HK & 50% Canidae while transitioning to the new food  & in the next two weeks he will be entirely on Canidae. I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains "gas" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn't a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods.

review/summary: Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!
review/text: At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.

review/summary: Food for my picky puppy
review/text: I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).  Great service and good product.

review/summary: Dog developed GI problems
review/text: Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company.

I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.

review/text: I've been feeding my dog (75 pound Golden mix, about 5 years old) Canidae for 3-4 days now, and she absolutely loves it! She's always been a picky eater, often ignoring food in her bowl, but she laps this up as soon as I put it in.  I've been mixing it with her old food to ease her into the transition.  For the first two days I did 75% old food, 25% Canidae.  Today I've done half and half.  No tummy problems.  If anything she seems to have more energy.  The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy! I'm also happy to have found a food that seems to be much better quality, and for a price that's within my tight budget.

review/text: My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!

review/summary: Excellent for large breed dogs
review/text: Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!

review/summary: Canidae totally works for our Retriever/Border Collie mix!
review/text: Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down. How did we find out?  We realized that over time we have been mixing more treats in her food to get her to eat it  (This with only 2 meals a day!)<br /><br />Our dog definitely preferred lamb over the chicken, no more treat mix-in's, only pure dog-food!<br /><br />We = Canidae fans for life!

review/summary: I should've done more research before buying this
review/text: I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats.

review/text: My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.<br />We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.<br />Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though.

review/summary: I ordered this for the benefit of my allergy dog.
review/text: It just came in, and to my disappointment, it contains barley...which she is allergic to.  That is NOT on the ingredient list, so beware.  Fortunately my other dog can eat this.<br /><br />Amazon, please keep the ingredients up to date!
