review/summary: I love coconut water, but this is not good at all.
review/text: I really thought the reviews were mixed because some people just don't like coconut water, so I ordered this.  It is NOT good at all.  In fact it has weird smell to it.  It is in my refrigerator, but I think I will have to throw them all away as I cannot get myself to drink it.  I did drink 1/2 of one mixed with orange juice and it didn't taste bad, but just thinking about that weird smell makes me not want to drink any more of it.<br /><br />I have bought other Vita Coco Coconut Water in the past and loved every one of them.  I should have passed on this one.  It really isn't drinkable, in my opinion.

review/summary: Nothing like coconut water
review/text: Like the previous reviewer, I also received a wet box, with most of the bottles leaking from the spout.  The ones that weren't leaking will start to soon, as the spouts are also starting to rip.<br /><br />Opened a safe-looking bottle, and couldn't stand the taste.  I drank regular ONE coconut water throughout my pregnancy, and kept hearing good things about vita coco... luckily they didn't try this flavor...

review/text: I am a lover of Vita Coco, but this flavor falls short of pleasing. It tries to hard and the guava overpowers the flavor, leaving behind an aftertaste that I was quick to get rid of. Understandable that all people have different tastes but most Vita Coco are subtle in taste, this is not.

review/text: I have gone through 3 cases of this stuff.  The first time I bought two cases, because I like vita coco's other flavors, and this was on sale.  BAD MOVE.  One entire case was spoiled.  All the cartons had a foul odor and brown gunk around the lip.  So Amazon sent me replacement.  I think the new one was fresh, but I just cant bring myself to drink any of it because it still smells foul.  This product is just plain horrible, plan and simple.  Other flavors are great, but not this one.

review/text: Generally, the flavored Vita Coco varieties are anywhere from alright to very good tasting.  However, this one is outright unpleasant.  There's a strong undertone to this drink that can only be described as medicinal.  It tastes like something you'd drink only if you *had* to in order to speed your recovery from some nasty intestinal bug.<br /><br />Just blech! across the board.

review/summary: All dragon fruit, not a good balance of flavors at all.
review/text: I love tropical fruits and thought this would be great, boy was I wrong!  They put so much dragon fruit flavor in it that it drowns out any of the other fruits and that is all I can taste.  Not a tropical fruit BLEND.  A little dragon fruit goes a long way and they way over did it here.  Too bad, I like the other vita coco choices and was shocked at how bad this tastes.  If you are a fan of dragon fruit, you will love this!  If not, take a pass and get a different flavor.

review/text: Don't buy it - it tastes terrible.<br /><br />I am a big fan of coconut juice / water of any variety. I've had the plain "Vita Coco" before, and was quite happy with it. Since they had a deal on this flavored one, I figured I'd try it. Bad call. It tastes so bad, that I'm debating just tossing it all out. I've even had two friends try it, and neither one liked it - wondering if it went bad, or was meant to taste bad.<br /><br />Moral of the story? If you want to try something new, don't buy a 12-pack.

review/summary: Worst packaging and drink ever!
review/text: I was hesitant of buying this product since there were so many mixed reviews. I decided to try it since I enjoy coconut water. I have been to the Caribbean and enjoyed water coconuts and fresh exotic fruits, so I thought I would love this. I was excited when this arrived. I opened it up and the smell threw me back. When I twisted the cap, the pouring spout ripped away from the carton, which made the ease of storing much more difficult. I tried a sip and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It tasted bitter and it smelled like burnt rubber. I have tried several of the exotic fruits listed in the ingredients, but this drink tasted nothing like them. I tried chilling it to see if it made the taste better and there was no improvement. If you are expecting this to taste like real coconut water, you will surely be disappointed. Fortunately I purchased this on Amazon and their customer service has been awesome and taking care of this issue.

review/summary: Do yourself a favor and try a bit first..
review/text: I bought this on sale and thought it was a great deal.  How can one go wrong with coconut juice?  Apparently Vita can with their tropical version.  I haven't tried their plain coconut juice, so I don't know what that's like, but I can assure you that the tropical one is very difficult to drink.<br /><br />One would think it's very tasty due to the mixture of fruits, but it's not.  Imagine drinking coconut juice and adding a bit of sour and a bit of sweet -- that's what this is.  Some people may like it, but it's just not good in my opinion.  To me, it seems like Vita had a bunch of excess juice from other products and decided to just mix it all together with a splash of coconut.<br /><br />It's not worth the regular price, and not even worth the sale price (I purchased these for under ten dollars for the pack of 12).

review/summary: not very good
review/text: I do love coconut water, it is very refreshing on a hot day. This one was on sale and sounded pretty good. Well it is not that good. The coconut uses must not be YOUNG coconuts. Water from young coconuts have the sweetest flavor. This had an almost stale flavor the was slightly covered up by the tropical fruit added. Usually I have to hide the coconut water from my 3 kids or they will drink all of it in a few days. I put all of this one in the fridge and now, 2 weeks later, there is still more than half left. The base coconut flavor was just not right. I have tried several different brands using subscribe and save and the best is "Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp" I have been to SE Asia and had coconut water there from street vendors and restaurants, it is simply delicious. Taste Nirvana is a close the that FRESH wonderful flavor that I have found so far. I would not buy this one if you are not sure, there are much better ones out there.

When I first tasted it, I immediately checked the expiration date to make sure it did not go bad.

But in the end I came across a bottle that just had a very foul taste so I decided to throw all of the remaining drinks away.

Even my teenage son who loves Vita Coco and other coconut waters, refuse to have it so now I'll have to finish it so it won't be wasted. This is the one flavor that I have to force myself to finish, and I rarely come up with the bad flavor like this. Totally not recommended, go for Mango or regular Vita Coco instead!

However, I think this drink is awesome, and being from the Caribbean, this is just perfect.  I love, love this drink.  I should mention to everyone, it is an acquired taste.  If you are not familiar with coconut water and certain kinds of tropical fruit, you probably will not like this.  This is so refreshing, nice and cold.  Thanks Rihanna.

review/summary: Best coconut water.
review/text: Vita Coco has the best coconut water of any and I have tried most of them.  I love the tropical fruit flavor.  It has a distinctive guava flavor.  For those who do not like this flavor, it is probably because they don't like Guava or tropical fruit.  You can add some of the Vita Coco Pineapple to it and make your own fruit flavor.  I usually mix it with the pineapple or the passion fruit.  I also believe that coconut water has helped build my immune system and I drink it every day.  This is a great product.  So not be afraid to purchase because of the negative reviews.  I would give it an AAA***+++++.

review/summary: Flavor not good and container lid was unglued on half of them
review/text: Some of the other flavors in this brand of Coconut water's are very good. This one is nasty in my opinion. Also the screw on lid and the part it screw onto had come unglued. This is the only flavor I had trouble with but out of my 2 cases half were unglued. The product wasn't hurt so I just poured them into a glass but it was a little inconvenient. Otherwise I LOVE this brand. I like the pineapple coconut the best.

review/summary: Never again!
review/text: I purchased this thinking "what a great deal!" Now I know why it was, and it really is a bad deal! First off, several containers were defective. The top parts were not secured (they flipped up), so the screw off top wouldn't work properly. Second, really didn't like the taste. Thought I would as I love the Peach/Mango, but this is awful, doesn't taste @ all like tropical fruit! Perhaps, this was just a fluke (defective bottles, bad taste), & I realize all tastes are different, so some may like it. The defects were just insult to injury...  Turned out to be a big waste!

In fact, they should have put a pic of Rihanna on the containers in a bikini to help market this stuff.  But this flavor sux.  But to potential vita coco buyers, do not be discouraged!  If you want vita coco I recommend the tangerine, pineapple, or even the plain flavors. Those are good.  This flavor is not.

review/summary: Refreshing~~~
review/text: I read the negative reviews AFTER I made the order. So I was worried when I tried the first pack. Apart from having more fruit taste, this is as good as the original Vita Coco Coconut Water. I still don't understand why other people don't like it. One possibility is, if "fruit" only means oranges and apples (and nothing else) to you, you probably won't like the "exotic" fruit taste here.

review/summary: Do you like guava?
review/text: If so, you should like this.  I guess some people expected a more traditional "tropical fruit", like fruit punch, or pineapple or something.  But this is basically guava, with its associated "creaminess" from the pulp.<br /><br />I like it, the kids like it, the wife doesn't.  Ordered the second pack already, because the first won't last long.<br /><br />It's DEFINITELY better than the acai-pomegranate, so I'd say it's a safer buy than that flavor.<br /><br />As a side note, my daughter says it has less sugar than the peach-mango.

review/summary: According to CNN's report on VitaCoCo....
review/text: (update)According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label.<br />"Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, "Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from "soaking the flesh of the older coconut". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, "OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)

(But that's just me.)<br /><br />Anyway, this sauce has a nice flavor--a little tomato-y, a little sweet with a little taste of maybe vingegar. (If it had a little more of an announcement of garlic, then I would easily give it five stars.)<br /><br />The way it is now, I'd say it's really worth about 3-1/2 stars.  It could also be a tad more thicker--I mean, hey it DOES say gourmet on the label.  I think gourmet could stand for that.<br /><br />Eat well!!!

review/text: There is a quiet epidemic in America caused by excessive sugar in our diet and overuse of antibiotics.  The epidemic is Yeast (fungus) overgrowth, and it has been estimated that upwards of 85% of Americans suffer from it, many without even knowing.  Fungal overgrowth has been linked to cancer and other diseases.  There is a simple test called the "SPIT TEST".  Do a search on these subjects and take this test.  If you have the symptoms, purchase this product, Nature's Alchemy Essential Oil of Oregano.  Take as directed (usually 1 drop in water or juice 3 times daily).  Oregano is one of the most potent anti-fungal agents in existence, and it is completely natural with virtually no side effects.  Make sure it is wild oregano.  Don't take my word for it, do some research.  This product worked great for me, and cleared up a stubborn yeast overgrowth problem in just weeks.

review/summary: SOURED ON THIS CHOICE !!
review/text: The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner's sugar "dusting" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.

He seems to be repulsed by commercial 4 and 5 star kibble and canned foods that he used to enjoy.  His  lack  of appetite occurred after the  rabies  and distemper shot that were given simultaneously.  I had requested that this not be done as toys seem to have problems with all the additives etc in the shots, and since then he hasn't had much  appetite.  The vet's nurse suggested that it is the supplements causing the appetite problem.....typical as most of the medical establishement and veterinary establishment as well are hammering supplements lately.

review/summary: The new Zico is disappointing and gross
review/text: I used to buy Zico in the tetrapacks.  Our favorites were the mango and passion fruit, which were delicious.  Then the tetrapacks disappeared from the local grocery store, and a few weeks later this new Zico showed up in plastic bottles with new "Lima Citron" and "Pomberry" flavor.<br /><br />I bought a few, hoping they would match up to the old flavors.  But, alas, they do not.  In fact, the Lima Citron  and Pomberry flavors are downright disgusting.<br /><br />My fiance had the Pomberry flavor.  He had the flu and wanted to rehydrate (which coconut water is excellent for).  His sense of taste was not in full capacity because he was sick, but he commented to me that it just tasted wrong, and he wasn't sure if it was because he was sick or if it was the drink itself.  I tried it myself, and sure enough it was the drink.  It's gross.<br /><br />Then I tried the Lima Citron flavor.  I took a few sips, thinking maybe it would grow on me, and it did not.  I threw away most of it.  The flavor is like a mixture of pure lime juice and alum -- extremely bitter, sour, and astringent, as if the manufacture put in extra tannins.  It reminded me of the time I bought an unripened persimmon from the Asian grocer, and after biting into it felt my mouth go instantly dry and pucker up.  Don't get me wrong -- I can tolerate sour things.  I can eat an entire lemon or lime and enjoy it.  But this was unbearable.<br /><br />The only palatable flavor is the "Natural" flavor, which is just coconut water.  The other two -- nasty, NaStY, NASTY!<br /><br />Buy VitaCoco instead.

review/summary: Nasty, don't be swayed by the 5-star reviews
review/text: I have a feeling that Coca Cola is paying people to write 5-star reviews on their "new" Zico acquisition. The fact of the matter is that I have been drinking coconut water for over a year now, from Vita Coco, O.N.E., Zico (original), Zico (new Coca Cola disaster) and the bottom line is that the NEW ZICO IS DISGUSTING. It's 1) from concentrate (not pure 100% coconut water), 2) tastes really bad cold and 3) tastes even worse at room temperature.<br /><br />Coca Cola, in typical American corporate greed, took what was the BEST coconut water (Zico original, Mango and Passion Fruit) and absolutely and blatantly destroyed it. They really did. It's absolutely horrid and disgusting and probably not as good for you due to it being from concentrate. Should I mention that it's also more EXPENSIVE than before?<br /><br />Good job Coca Cola, glad to see you have taken over a great product and destroyed it to increase your stock price.<br /><br />O.N.E. is currently the best 100% natural coconut water, in plain flavor. The "new" Zico is just undrinkable. Stay away from it.

review/text: I really like this Zico flavor and was shocked to see so many bad reviews.  Taste is subjective though, so to each his own.  I like how it has a mild citrus taste without any bitterness, I did not find it sour -- maybe I just got a good batch? It is delicious mixed with 4 ounces of orange juice!<br /><br />Other things I like are gin and tonics, crystal geyser lime flavored unsweetened seltzer, real margaritas, and just a slice of lemon in ice water; I felt this coconut water did not taste like any of these in particular, but was in the same family with these flavors.<br /><br />Since this is a love or hate flavor, I suggest buying one from a store and trying it out before investing in a case.

review/text: Yep. Buyer beware. Zico is not the wonderful, tasty product it once was (when it was actual coconut water, not reconstituted standardized coconut water).<br /><br />If you like degraded flavor, this is the product for you. If you want fresh coconut water, minimally processed, seek elsewhere (ONE, VitaCoco, Amy & Brian, etc). Amazon has other options NOT from concentrate.<br /><br />If you can get the Zico in the tetra pak with the non-concentrate formula, you will be much happier. This cool bottle design, while convenient, houses nasty stuff.

While I tend to like plain the best, I have never had a bad experience with any flavor... except for Zico Lima Citron.<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were to high, considering my love of coconut water and given the fact that lime seems a natural complement to coconut water (she put the lime in the coconut...)<br /><br />To be honest, it tasted like a cheap alcoholic drink, a bad gimlet perhaps. I could barely finish it, because the after taste was so awful. I finished it out of obligation, owing to the price mostly.<br /><br />I recommend, honestly, any brand and any flavor over this.

Now it's reconstituted from concentrate with cheapo "natural flavors" to make up the difference.  How much coconut water is actually in this beverage? Uh, you don't know and coca cola ain't telling.  Label requirement laws for juice must not apply here.  Reality is this could be just 20% coconut water or less!  Who knows... It certainly doesn't taste like coconut water anymore.<br /><br />Can't believe this was someone's brainchild to water down a drink and try to pass it off as real.
