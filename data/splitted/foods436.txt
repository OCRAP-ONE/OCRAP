review/summary: Won't eat them everyday but a nice change
review/text: I love Honey Nut Cheerios.  One of my favorite cereals of all time.  So I was intrigued by the new Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey from Kellogs.  I tried it first as dry cereal and was less than impressed.  The cereal is corn based so it had the aftertaste similar to Corn Pops cereal after the honey flavor wore off.  I believe Cheerios are whole grain and oats so there is a very distinct taste difference.<br /><br />After trying them with milk, I am much more impressed with the cereal.  They stay crispy for a long time (much longer than Cheerios) and the flavor is very nice.  The corn overtones are more subtle when mixed with milk so I get a similar taste to Honey Nut Cherios but with a hint of different flavor due to the corn base.  It is very nice but this will not replace my Cheerios anytime soon as I prefer the whole grain and oats based cereal.<br /><br />What's funny about me getting this cereal is that almost the same day my package arrived from Amazon, my wife had gone out food shopping and came back with a box of this cereal to try.  So we now have multiple boxes of this which should last a while!

review/summary: crunch and tasty cereal
review/text: I'm very pleased with this cereal, it has a lot of flavor and stays crunchy in milk although strangely, I noticed that the color fades considerably.<br />You can see the bits of peanut on these, and I found them great for snacking as well as for breakfast.  They are filling, too, and I found I was not hungry soon after breakfast, which happens with some other cereals.  My three year old grandson ate a big bowlful, and gave it a thumbs up, and he can be fussy!  The only thing I did not care for is the size of the box, at only about 11 ounces, it didn't last very long in our house.

review/summary: More corn flavor than nut, but certainly does crunch
review/text: These are like ultra-thick cheerios, with a dominant corn flavor, with only a minor peanut smell, mostly noticeable when eaten plain (without milk). They are fairly sweet, but the sugary coating does keep the cereal from getting soggy, which is a major problem with many puffy cereals. All in all, a honey corn taste and a crunch texture, made for a moderately enjoyable cereal experience. I am not sure I would buy these again, however, as they are not particularly exciting.

review/summary: Good cereal that's not too sweet
review/text: They look like puffy Cheerios covered in tiny bits of crushed peanuts and they definitely have the taste of roasted peanuts with a bit of sweetness.  They stayed crunchy till the very bottom of the bowl, so the cereal seems to live up to its name of Crunchy Nut Roasted nut and Honey.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a pretty satisfying cereal.  If you like the taste of roasted peanuts, I think this is a pretty good choice.  Just like Cheerios, they taste pretty good both with and without milk so they make a pretty good snack on the good too.

review/text: If you like Kellogg's Apple Jacks cereal, you'll probably like Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey. It's lighter and not quite as sweet or crunchy as Apple Jacks. Think of it as the version for grownups. At this point, I don't plan on buying anymore. Not because there's anything wrong with it. I just prefer Corn Flakes, Cheerios, and other less pre-sweetened cereals.

review/summary: Looks Like A Cheerio, Tastes Like A Sugar Smack Only Crunchier!
review/text: Kelloggs Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut And Honey Cereal is delicious! One bite and I thought of my childhood in the sixties eating the great old Kellogg's Sugar Smacks- the old style box that was red and white striped with the beaver in the red plaid hunting hat and gold scarf eating out of a bowl that was balanced on his tail. This cereal has that same sweet taste as Sugar Smacks- corn, oats, molasses and honey, only without all the sugar from the sixties that I'm sure kept our dentists busy.<br /><br />I didn't taste any peanuts at all, just honey. So, I asked the rest of my family if they would tell me what they taste. They all said they could taste corn, oats, molasses and mainly honey. No one tasted the peanuts. As sweet as this cereal is, it's calories are surprisingly below average for a cereal- 100 calories, 10 from fat. With 0 cholesterol and 125 mg of sodium, almost anyone can eat it, except for anyone with peanut, wheat or soy allergies. Kellogg's puts the usual 10-25% of the major daily vitamins in it as well.<br /><br />This cereal may look like a Cheerio, but they don't get soggy like Cheerios. They stay super crunchy right to the last bite! I grew up on Cheerios and I hated the sogginess, and as much as I loved the taste of Sugar Smacks, my Mom hardly ever bought them because they were so sweet with too much sugar. If you like the sweet taste of Sugar Smacks, only in the shape of a Cheerio and super crunchy, you'll love this new Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut And Honey Cereal. I've noticed the kids putting this crunchy cereal in their vanilla yogurt with fruit and they just love it! They were enjoying it so much, I tried it too. All I can say in between every crunch is Yummy!

review/summary: I love the new Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cereal
review/text: This new cereal from Kellogg's is another winner, in my opinion.<br />Kellogg's cereals has been a staple in our household for generations. This new cereal is a worthy addition to their lineup.<br />It's made from corn and oats in the familiar "O" shape. The "O's" are topped with roasted peanuts an lightly sweetened with honey.<br />In milk the cereal stays crunchy and is quite tasty. The sweet taste is just enough for me, not overly sweet.<br />It is good for you with 2 grams of fiber and protein and vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I've tried the flakes<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IOVWN8">Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut 14.1 oz</a> and those are good too.

review/summary: OK but not great
review/text: I've got a confession to make - I like cheerios. The good old fashioned original cheerios. However, I try to keep an open mind and am always up for an improvement. This wasn't it. The cereal isn't bad, it's just not that good. It's like cheerios but slightly sweeter. Not enough to make a real difference, just enough to get noticed. For the extra sugar content, it's definitely not worth it. The nuts that are supposed to be in here are completely invisible to my palette. If you want a sweet cereal, just eat honey nut cheerios. If you want a non sweetened cereal, just eat cheerios. This hybrid falls far short of both.

review/summary: Crunchy and nutty, but so-so.
review/text: I was expecting this to be somewhere between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52">Honey Nut Cheerios</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002QF1LK">Quaker Honey Graham Oh's</a>, at least in terms of flavor. But there's a distinct peanut butter aftertaste that makes these unique.<br /><br />The texture is kind of... interesting. There certainly weren't any small clusters of recognizable nuts on any of the bits of cereal I had, and it tastes almost like the O's were deep-fried. I'm positive they weren't deep-fried, but only because that would be a near-insane thing to eat for breakfast every morning.<br /><br />By and large, I think people who enjoy Honey Nut Cheerios are going to find these much too sweet, while people who enjoy sugary cereals will find it not quite sweet enough. It's not really "healthy" per se, but it's also not terrible for you. I guess this was made for non-committal people who know that downing a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHMVQE">Apple Jacks</a> is probably not healthy, but aren't willing to omit the sugar (and flavor) by moving to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ49KG">Kix</a>.

review/summary: Tasty Cereal
review/text: I was expecting this cereal to have the texture of Cheerios, but it is more like Capt'n Crunch. The peanut bits are barely visible stuck on the little o's, and really don't add any peanutty flavor. Since its name is "Crunchy Nut" I expected at least some peanut flavor, which I did not get, so I deducted one star for that.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I like this cereal, both dry and with milk. It's crunchy and sweet. What it isn't, tho, is health food, and I don't expect it to be. What it is, is a crunchy sugar rush, perfect for when I have such a craving.

review/summary: It is crunchy
review/text: I am not a big fan of presweetened anything! This product is exactly what it says it is and what I expected when I tasted it. It stands up to milk and keeps its crunch until its entirely consumed and for me thats important. I could not eat this everyday but I cant think of any product that I could! My Grandson loves it for his snak but I dont give it to him on a regular basis as I think its got too much sugar for a regular diet. All and all I think this is as good as any presweetened cereal I have had but I couldnt eat it more than a couple times a month. This cereal has the same major flaw that all box cereals seem to have, they use a box liner that is not resealable and this limits there shelf life after opening. I think that some day one of the mfg will figure this out and make the liner resealable like the ziplock bags that maney bulk frozen foods come in.

review/summary: Tasty & Crunchy
review/text: Upon first opening the box, I noticed it has a peanut butter like smell. It reminded me faintly of Crackerjacks. The cereal is crunchy and lightly sweet. Depending on your opinion on sugar, you could find this too sweet or not sweet enough. The airy consistency reminded me of Kellogg's Pops. I liked that they remained crunchy from start to finish.<br /><br />I would say that it needs more nuts to carry off the "Crunchy Nut" name. There are probably the flakes of like ten peanuts in this entire box. It doesn't taste very nutty at all. I think the airy consistency would have been nicely complimented by the solid crunch of whole nuts.<br /><br />The cereal has a 100 calories, 10 g of sugar, 1 g of fat, and 11 g of carbs. It has no more than 25 percent of any vitamins or nutrients. The taste is obviously the best feature. It's pretty good. By the time I finish the box, I might like it better. I would buy it if it were on sale at my local supermarket.

review/summary: Where are the nuts?
review/text: I usually eat cereal for breakfast 4 out of 7 days a week, so I was happy to have an opportunity to try this new Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it didn't really float my boat.  It was far too sweet, with no discernable "nut" flavor at all.  I mean, I could *see* the little flecks of what I assume are nuts stuck to the "o"s, but any real nutty flavor has been processed out of them.  The overwhelming sensation was "sweet," and not in a good way.<br /><br />The cereal did stay crunchy in milk (it floats, just like that "other" "o" cereal), and it has a sort of mild honey + corn flavor.  My guess is that Kellogg is trying to find something to compete with Honey Nut Cheerios, and this is their answer.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to my Special K Red Berries and Frosted MiniWheats. Oh ... and Northern Gold Raspberry/Blueberry granola.

review/summary: Crunchy Nuts
review/text: I mean really, how can you not resist saying Crunchy Nut? Oh wait, we're talking cereal here. Breakfast stuff. Not innuendo. On to the lovin' spoonful, then.<br /><br />Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is a sweet, corn-based cereal without any particularly notable taste. It's like eating a somewhat bland caramel corn or candy coated peanut cereal with milk. The honey is not very noticeable; the overall flavor is kind of bland. The good points are that it doesn't get soggy quickly and at 100 cal (minus milk) per serving, is pretty decent in the calorie department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the lack of flavor here makes Crunchy Nut more like Crunchy Not. It's not particularly overwhelming and I doubt it will return to my grocery list.

review/summary: Just Another Honey Nut Cereal.
review/text: I am beginning to think all Honey & Nut cereals are the same. I did not find Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal to be any different in taste from the other leading brands. It has the same sweetness, crunchiness and texture as the others. I would suggest reading the nutrition facts to compare this cereal to your usual brand of honey & nut cereal to see if one is nutritionally better. According to the box, a serving is 3/4 of a cup of Crunchy Nut cereal and contains 140 calories with 1/2 cup of fat-free milk. Each serving holds 1g of fat, 125mg of sodium, 23g of carbs (10g from sugars), and 2g of protein.<br /><br />On a side note, I am finding Amazon to be in line with grocery store prices, especially if you sign up for automatic deliveries and purchase in bulk. I have been pleasantly surprised with the grocery orders I have placed. Everything has arrived fresh and safely packaged.

review/summary: Can taste the sugar but not the nuts
review/text: This cereal is tasty, but it's mostly sugary not nutty and there is a bit of an aftertaste to it.  The actual cereal doesn't look like on the box with lots of nuts on each piece.  It's really hard to detect a nutty taste at all.  My husband ended up just packing some in a baggy with his lunches and ate them with coffee to balance out the sugary taste.  If you like sugary cereals, you'll probably enjoy this more than we did.  There are 23 g of carbs per 3/4 cup and 10g of sugars.  The first ingredient is yellow corn meal and the second is sugar...that tells you enough right there.

review/summary: Crunchy sugar lovers delight
review/text: Three members of our household tried this cereal, and in general it met with favorable evaluations. Only one of us pours milk on cereal and he was impressed that even after 5 minutes it still remained crunchy - probably because of the sugar coating. The other tester has the philosophy that nothing is ever sweet enough and this met their criteria (yellow corn meal is the first ingredient  and sugar is the second). The third tester was a bit disappointed that there was not as much of a peanut flavor as they expected. The cereal pieces are not as textured with peanut slivers as they look on the box picture.<br /><br />We all came to the conclusion that we would buy it, except for the price that it is presently listed at  ($29.95 + $7.71 for 4 boxes). That seems a bit high for many budgets.

review/summary: Not my favorite cereal
review/text: As soon as I got this I opened it to taste it, very crunchy and sweet. I like to carry this kind of tid bit to nibble on while I am out and about.  I even gave a few to my dog, he liked it, but he'll eat anything.<br />In the morning I tried it with milk, I am not a cereal person but this appealed to me because it seemed like it would have a Cheerios flavor, it does not.  The only problem, which is why I am not a cereal person is the sweetness, it is too sweet.  The longer it lingers in the milk the more sugar oozes out.  I had to pour out some milk and add fresh to cut the sugar.  I must say it stays crunchy in milk, after 6 minutes the crunch was still there.  So if  you like crunch this one is for you. The tiny nuts fall off and they are a treat at the end of the bowl. All in all it is not a bad product but I am afraid it did not do it for me.

review/text: "February made me shiver," sang Don McLean when remembering our loss of Buddy Holly. As a blizzard moved into the Midwest this February, and freezing temperatures took over, the shivering started.<br /><br />Proper planning would have supplied me with a broader range of food before the storm, but... that's the thing. I didn't. Snowed in, I could not leave. The United States Postal Service, however, was undaunted, however, and left the box of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey at my doorstep, thanks to Amazon.com. Though not starving, I appreciated the newness of the cereal, different from my usual Cheerios, Apple Jacks and raisin bran. Would it be different enough to add to my routine?<br /><br />Like as when manna came for the Israelites, I gave thanks. While watching "The Thin Man" series the next morning, I ate the cereal dry (as I usually do), reaching into the box as if it were popcorn.<br /><br />What's In A Name?<br /><br />* The crunch: loud and grinding, much like the sound of a dog eating a Milk Bone.<br /><br />* The roasted nut: reminiscent of other cereal peanut butter flavors.<br /><br />* The honey: I never tasted honey. I tasted a sweet undertone, but not distinctly honey.<br /><br />* The 10.8 ounces: One box. It took three movies to finish.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, but cannot say I found it distinguished from any other cereal. The flavor is underwhelming, but adequate. I may have it in rotation, but it will not be a staple. May your coldest days be warmer with a good breakfast, excellent mail delivery, and Myrna Loy.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: It is difficult to explain what exactly this new cereal tastes like. It's good, crunchy, and sweet. Definitely corn-based. It is closest in flavor to corn chex cereal with a dash of honey and slight nut flavor. It doesn't taste like a healthy cereal (bland and boring) nor is it as sweet as a kid's cereal. The perfect balance between the two will leave you satisfied and happy mouthed. I would recommend it as a good step between getting yourself or your kids off the sugary cereals and yet better tasting that the bladn healthy flake cereals.

review/text: This new cereal from Kellog's look like a cross between Cheerios and a miniaturized donut! The picture on the box (no surprise) is exaggerated, and while you don't need a microscope to see the nut pieces on the actual cereal, they are quite small.<br /><br />They do deliver on the crunchiness and as the honey name suggests, these are sweet but not as sweet as their Crunchy Nut cousin, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut, 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. There are 10g of sugar per serving and 11 servings per box. Assuming of course you have the self-control to measure and eat one serving per day.<br /><br />On their own, these are perhaps too sugary if you are health conscious or count calories/sugars, but as with other sweet/sugary cereal, you don't have to fill your cereal bowl with just one type of cereal. Mixing these with some of the healthier sugar-less cereal can still give you some taste, sweetness and crunchiness, but without the sugar overload. That's what gets them four stars.

review/summary: Grows on you
review/text: My 8 and 9 year old kids uprated this cereal from a 3 to a 4 after the second day of eating it. Originally, my son said it tasted good but "didn't have that pop of excitement" he got from some other cereals (I don't know where he got that phrase). My daughter pointed out that it tasted somewhat like Captain Crunch, due to the fact the Crunchy Nut "O"s are coated with the same kind of crunchy coating. The second day of eating them, my son couldn't get enough, saying he was addicted to them. The fact the kids like them is great. Myself, I wasn't so excited. They seem like the kind of cereal I have seen before. They aren't bad; I can taste the nuts and honey, but I don't think I'd eat them on my own. One thing to note is that the crunch is not produced by the nuts but by the coated "O"s.

review/summary: Not as sweet as the Crunchy Nut flakes...
review/text: I'm not a huge cereal nerd having grown up on a steady diet of mostly M&uuml;slix and Kix, with only the occasional box of Trix or Captain Crunch in the cupboard. Though there are six million varieties of cereal products on the shelves, I pretty much stick to the occasional box of Raisin Bran or Honey Nut Cheerios, but of the brands that I do eat I have some very specific likes and dislikes. When I picked this box of Crunchy Nut I was skeptical that it would actually deliver on it's namesake, being crunchy and nutty. For my taste I find that the various nutty cereals usually don't have a very strong nut taste, and the "crunchy" varieties tend to lose all their bite after a few seconds in milk.<br /><br />Lo and behold my surprise when I tried the other variety of Kellogg's brand cereal in flake form and it delivered wholeheartedly on both accounts.  This variation, the O's, on the other hand is only slightly crunchy and not very nutty in flavor at all.  I've read a lot of complaints that the Crunchy Nut flakes are too sweet, this is one area where the Crunchy Nut O's excel in that they have a much better balanced sweet flavor.<br /><br />Overall though I found them to be pretty bland.  They aren't coated with all that many peanuts and they lasted (crunch-wise) only a little longer than Honey Nut Cheerios or Fruit Loops before getting soggy.  They're not bad, but not great either.  Probably wouldn't buy them again which is a shame since I enjoyed the flakes version of Crunchy Nut so much...

review/summary: Very nutty flavor; a little on the sweet side
review/text: I'm nuts about nuts, so I did like the nutty taste of this cereal. While it was a little on the sweet side, it was tolerable. The cereal did not get soggy in milk and was true to its "Crunchy" label. The box had the word "honey" on it, but the product contains more sugar than honey in its ingredients. All-in-all, I liked this cereal and would recommend that you give it a try. But for those averse to too much sweetness, it may not be what you're looking for.

review/summary: Nummy Crunchy Nut Cereal
review/text: At first taste, eaten dry without any milk, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLW7A">Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, 10.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> reminded me of honey roasted peanuts. With milk, it has a slightly different taste to it, but is still very good and reminded me of a variety of products: mainly Cracker Jacks, although not as sweet, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LVACUE">Post Waffle Crisp Cereal, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> minus the maple taste, and to a lesser extent Fiddle Faddle and Crunch 'n Munch. This cereal has been compared to Honey Nut Cheerios (HNC) but other than the honey and they're both circular in shape, I don't see the comparison. I'm not a big fan of HNC because I find it to be too sweet, and while CN (Crunchy Nut) is a tad sweeter than I'd like, it's still not as sweet as HNC and I much prefer it to that cereal. Plus, I get a bit of the peanutty taste. If I'm going for Cheerios, I go for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQP4QM">Cheerios MultiGrain Cereal, 16.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>.<br /><br />As far as being a healthy breakfast, you could do far worse. Nowhere does this claim to be a nutritious cereal, though it does use the colors typically associated with healthier options, or those food companies want us to think of as healthy anyway. For a pre-sweetened cereal, the calories and sugar aren't too bad, 100 cals. per 3/4 cup w/o milk and 10 grams of sugar. It also has 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein. There are more vitamins and minerals than I thought there would be in this cereal and no corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup is used, instead they sweeten with sugar, honey and molasses. The only thing I wish the cereal had used would be whole grains instead of yellow corn meal, otherwise it's a more than decent option for breakfast. For me, cereal is a go-to meal or snack any time of day, and this is a nummy option that I will definitely get again in the future<br /><br />Note: I do have a sweet tooth, but generally speaking, I don't like my foods as sweet as the average person and don't eat much of it in a day.

review/summary: Not Up to Expectations
review/text: The packaging for Kellogg's new CRUNCHY NUT cereal gives one the impression that it would be that company's version of the General Mills cereal, CHEERIOS, perhaps even the "honey nut" version. This cereal is much different, however. It is made of both corn and oats, and the corn flavor dominates. While there are some nut slivers on the rings, the nut flavor is overwhelmed by the cereal's sweetness, which tastes a great deal like the Kellogg's CORN POPS cereal. Further, the texture of the rings reminds me a great deal of Quaker Oats' CAP'N CRUNCH pieces, which is another corn/oats cereal. If you like a sugary, corn-flavored buzz, this cereal is for you. My personal preference is not for this kind of the cereal. My rating comes from my dissatisfaction with the flavor of the product and the vague packaging of what tastes most like a cereal intended to satisfy craving for sweets.

review/summary: Lightly Sweetened Crunchy Nut Goodness
review/text: Since flavor can be so subjective, I will try my best to draw comparisons.  The new Crunchy Nut cereal is similar to Honey Nut Cheerios size.  They're slightly sweeter than Honey Nut Cheerios but with milk added, the flavor reminds me to Corn Pops.  And it's definitely sweeter than your Honey Bunches of Oat available at Costco in the 2 pack.  This cereal doesn't get soggy as fast as Corn Pops or Honey Bunches of Oat.  It's also 100 calories per serving.  I'm more of a Special K with Strawberries type of guy so I enjoy a little sour/fruity flavor along with my sweet cereal.  I hope this review helps in your decision whether to try it or not.

review/summary: It tastes great!
review/text: We regularly eat cereals both as breakfast of my champions (2 boys and a little princess), and occasionally as snacks.  They like them mixed with milk in the morning and dry at other times.  The one I can think it is more comparable to is Cheerios, except it looks twice as big, glazed  and sprinkled with peanuts.<br /><br />Some interesting comparisons  between  Crunchy Nut and Cheerios (identical servings of 3/4 cup):<br /><br />Crunchy Nut has 110 calories, while Cheerios has 100 calories<br />5% vs 7% sodium<br />1% vs 3% potassium<br />8% vs 7% carbo<br />Same dietary fiber content<br /><br />For allergy concerns:<br /><br />Crunchy Nut has peanuts, wheat, traces of soybeans, and may contain tree nuts.<br />Cheerios has almonds and may contain wheat ingredients.<br /><br />It tastes great.  Only time will tell if it will also be a regular staple in this household.

review/summary: Tasty ... Not too Sweet
review/text: I was expecting these to be like Honey Nut Cheerios, which I also like. These actually were different. Not necessarily better, but different. More of a nut taste (I suppose that explains the name). They are not as sweet tasting as some similar cereals (though the sugar content is about the same). They also make a good snack dry.<br /><br />Personally I found these to be a nice change of taste and liked them quite a bit. So did my son (11), who ended up having it as a second dinner if he was still hungry but did not want a desert. My wife, however, did not like them, so obviously they are not for everyone.<br /><br />I will be buying this cereal again.

review/summary: Great Tasting Cereal
review/text: I'm a daily cereal consumer. My wife is a health fanatic so I eat mainly organic cereal with very little sugar and as little refinement as possible. So that being said it was a treat to be able to try Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal. With 10g of sugar per 3/4 cup serving it is quite a bit sweeter then I'm used to. (Compare with Kellogg's Fruit Loops at 12g of sugar per 1 cup serving). Although it looks like Cheerios with nuts on it, it is not - the texture is heavier and crunchier and the taste is completely different. The nuts add a nice touch even though it would probably taste great without them. The vitamin content is quite high which means they probably fortified the cereal although I see nothing on the box that states this.<br /><br />As I said I enjoyed trying this cereal but knowing my wife (bless her heart) she won't be buying this cereal for me any time soon. I'll be sticking to the healthier varieties but at least I know I'm cared for.

review/summary: More of a "Kid" Cereal
review/text: I assume Kellogg is marketing this product towards adults who want a healthy cereal that does not lose its crunch over time. Why? The name is Crunchy Nut. The image on the box contains no cartoon characters. In fact, the box design is rather bland. Other than some text stating that "It's Morning Somewhere" therefore you don't need to wait until tomorrow to enjoy the "perfect blend of sweet and nutty in every crunchy bite", it's a pretty uninspiring package. Not at all for the kids...<br /><br />Is the cereal tasty? Yeah... I enjoyed it. Though immediately felt the need to workout even harder the next day.<br /><br />Why? The nutritional information states a serving size (3/4 C) contains 1 g of fat. If you add 1/2 C of skim milk, the fat content goes up. Carbs? 23 g before milk. Fiber? A meager 2 g -- a negligible amount. Protein? 2 g.<br /><br />Tastes good. Is crunchy, even with milk. But be prepared for that sugar crash late morning.<br /><br />I don't predict it will be around long. I'd much rather eat a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios... Similar taste and crunch with additional nutritional benefits.

review/summary: Crunchy!
review/text: It smells like reeses pieces peanut butter cups out of the box. The cereal is a bit larger than cheerios and more airy/puffy, felt like a kid's cereal. Being airy, it made it more rough and it scratched the roof of my mouth when I ate it. I didn't think it was that sweet. Compared to Frosted Flakes it wasn't that sweet. It didn't have anything really special or unique about it. It turned the milk a bit of a light brown color when I was finished with it.<br /><br />The nuts were hardly noticeable, especially since they are so huge on the package. It was crunchy. Didn't really get a nutty flavor when eating it just when smelling it. After one bowl I felt like I could have another.<br /><br />The box was easy to open, and so was the plastic bag the cereal was in.

review/summary: Tastes great, average nutrition, very expensive
review/text: Don't get me wrong, this cereal tastes delicious.  It has a nice crunchy texture, good nutty flavor, and a sweet glaze.  If you buy cereal just for the taste, this is like gourmet Honey Nut Cheerios.  Very delicious.<br /><br />That said, it is not as vitamin enriched as some other cereals that have similar amounts of sugar, so the trade-off for the sugar is not as good.  Crunchy Nut has 10 grams of sugar per 3/4 cup serving.  Malt O Meal Honey Nut Scooters has 10 grams per 1 cup serving--totally comparable.  But Scooters has more calcium, and zinc, and twice the iron and folic acid.<br /><br />Also, Crunchy Nut costs about 3 times as much as Scooters.<br /><br />My advice:  If taste is king over any other consideration, buy this cereal.  If not, there are other more nutritious, economical options.

review/summary: Doesn't look like package
review/text: The picture on the package is a little misleading: it suggests that each morsel has at least a couple of flavor nuggets with peanutty goodness attached. In fact, these flavor nuggets are quite a bit sparser than one might expect, and it's not clear whether they are actual peanut fragments. But this cereal is certainly delicious. It's quite crunchy, and the crunchiness lasts for several minutes even in milk (it's delicious enough that it doesn't stay in the bowl long enough to get soggy). My partner thought the sweetness was just right and found lots of nutty flavor. I thought it was just a little too sweet without much nuttiness. But the kids will certainly love this! Even though we enjoyed it a lot, I can't give it more than three stars, based on its rather dubious nutritional value.

review/text: Frankly, I was expecting this to be a nuttier version of Honey Nut Cheerios as the product looks pretty much the same only this one appears to be covered in nuts.  Not the case!  I couldn't taste anything remotely nutty in this cereal, just honey and sugar.  The taste reminded me of that kid's cereal, Honeycomb, really both in taste and texture.  I was hoping for a cereal with more 'adult' flavors, or at least something nuttier, and this cereal didn't deliver that for me.  For anyone who likes a super-sweet breakfast cereal this would be good for you; if you are looking for something nutty and not too sweet, I would keep looking.

review/summary: Solidly mediocre
review/text: This product was not bad, but was disappointing.  The box promises "roasted nut and honey."  While I could detect the "honey" flavor, rendered as a glaze more reminiscent of sugar than honey, there is little to no nut flavor.  In deed the product image shows each "O" covered in nuts and promises, "nuts in every bite," the actual appearance is much different with no visible nuts on the cereal.<br /><br />The texture is fine.  The crunch holds up in milk.  It is more of an airy texture than say a dense Cheerio.  More the texture of Honeycomb brand cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally this product is mediocre.  Again not bad, but could be better.  Sugars rack in at 10g, less than many sugar sweetened cereal but still high.  Fiber is 2g which is something, but a bit low.  1g of fat is gaood and none of it saturated or trans fat.<br /><br />I will finish the box, but will not by more of these again.

I ate it growing up, all the classics, Frosted Flakes, Lucky Charms, Apple Jacks, Cheerios, etc etc...this Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is indeed another classic! It's got the yummy box, the little "o's" with dark honey covering it, and sprinkin with some nuts! The color looks good and healthy, not too kidsy - and once I opened the box, all the little "o's" fell out dinking-donking into the bowl :)<br /><br />The ultimate taste test is the "grab a handful and toss'em in your mouth" test --- how did Crunchy Nut do? Superb! Wonderful fresh crispy bites, not too sugar-just enough flavor of honey and nuts mixed together! I really like it, and well, ate a whole bowl without the milk even :D<br /><br />Sure, if you read the ingredients, who knows what you will find...but I don't read that, I go by taste and it tastes good! Good snack with or without milk, will be getting some for the car during those traffic stops and early morning traffic jams!

review/text: I wasn't too fond of this cereal in any way. Out of the box, it has a strange, artificial butterscotch color. If it only tasted like butterscotch, I could forgive this unusual shade. But Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut & Honey is far from Kellogs' best effort! The cereal was rather bland, and the promised crunch reminded me only of the familiar "Captain" cereal of the same name. I just did not get the nut and honey experience that is available in other brands. As a new cereal on the market, this cereal won't last long, I predict. It isn't anything different than those that have been around awhile, those that present this variety much, much better. Also . . . Vine clearly stated "10.8 oz. pack of four" and I just received one box. Not that I miss it, but I at least could have given the promised remaining three to my sons who are in college. (There was no disclaimer that Vine reviewers would receive only one box.)

review/summary: Tastes like "Corn Pops" and isn't very "nutty."
review/text: Like so many Americans I grew up eating quite a few varieties of Kellogg's cereals. The new "Crunchy Nut" cereal looked like it might be good so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />To make a long story short, it's tasty but it isn't anything like what I expected ... and isn't like what is pictured on the box.<br /><br />First, Kellogg's probably needs to get rid of the individual who came up with the idea of calling this cereal "Crunchy Nut." Besides the fact that it's unimaginative and blandly descriptive, if you tell your friends you just ate a bowl of "Crunchy Nut" you're going to get some pretty disgusted looks in return.<br /><br />Beyond the unfortunate name, as soon as you pour a bowl of Crunchy Nut you'll notice that none of the pieces look as "nutty" the the pieces shown on the box ... not even close. The box shows pieces of the cereal covered in small chips/chunks of nuts but the actual cereal just looks like fat Cheerios with the occasional "speck" of what might be best described as "nut powder."<br /><br />Once you actually taste this cereal you'll notice that it tastes almost exactly like Corn Pops (another Kellogg's brand cereal). My wife also tried a bowl of this cereal and the first thing she said (without any coaching from me) was, "It tastes like Corn Pops." This isn't a horrible thing as long as you like the flavor of Corn Pops cereal, but if you purchase this cereal expecting a burst of "crunchy nut" flavor then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a very tasty cereal (just like Corn Pops) but it has a horrible name, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, and it doesn't taste anything like the name suggests.

review/summary: Better flavor Honey Nut Cheerios but "yellow corn meal"?
review/text: First thing I did after tasting these was compare them to Honey Nut Cheerios. Although the nutrition facts are almost identical what really surprised me was that the Kellog's Crunchy Nut did not taste as sweet as the Honey Nut Cheerios. So in terms of flavor these are a hit.<br /><br />Now the bad part. Go look at the list of ingredients...<br /><br />Kellog's Crunchy Nut: "YELLOW CORN MEAL, SUGAR, ..."<br /><br />Honey Nut Cheerios: "Whole Grain Oats, Sugar, ..."<br /><br />Enough said...

review/summary: The whole does not equal the sum of its parts
review/text: What do you get when you combing Cheerios with Honey Smacks and peanuts? You get this - and it actually sounds good. Unfortunately the combination of the flavors is just okay. Not great, and I'm not sure it is even good. There is a weird cloying aftertaste, and the cereal feels too dry, the individual pieces too large, and too crunchy. It just wasn't for me. The kidlets think it is okay but prefer Honey Nut Cheerios or even Raisin Bran (my fave) to this - and that's not a good sign.<br /><br />Bottom Line: YMMV, but I won't be replacing this box with another one.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I thought Crunchy Nut would be similar to Honey Nut Cheerios but I was mistaken. While Honey Nut Cheerios is dense and almost powdery when chewed, crunch nut is more crunchy and crispy. I am a fan of both, but I believe that the flavor of Crunchy Nut is better. The O's have tiny peanut pieces on them and then are covered with honey to give them a great taste and a better texture than Honey Nut Cheerios.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Super crunchy. Get out your magnifying glass to see a nut.
review/text: When they say "Crunchy nut" they're not kidding, at least not about the crunch.<br /><br />These O's are sort of a cross between Honey Nut Cherrios, Cheetos, and broken glass, and they are very crunchy. To me, they smelled a bit synthetic out of the box (though they do not contain artificial flavor), but the flavor nicely rounds out (very similar to honey nut Cherrios but sweeter and nuttier) once milk is added. They keep their crunch: By the end of a bowl, they are minimally softened.<br /><br />To say they are made from "Corn and Oat" is a bit misleading. The first ingredient is corn meal, but oat flour is a distant 8th, squeezed between salt and caramel color. That's like saying you ate a cucumber when you really had a slice of pickle on your hamburger.<br /><br />Nutwise, it's more taste than nut. They do have a nutty flavor, but there's a meager dusting of ground peanuts scattered through the box. Any cereal with sliced nuts or a granola gives you many more nuts. I think it's a nice nut flavor, but the tagline "nuts in every bite" is only technically accurate.<br /><br />I got tired of all the chewing by the end of the bowl, so only get these if you really want your cereal crunchy.

review/summary: Yummy treat but lots of sugar
review/text: On a daily basis we don't have sugary cereals for breakfast.  But on Fridays we have "special cereal" day, when we splurge and have a treat.  I don't go as sugary as Foot Loops or Frosted Flakes, but certainly a bit more "fun" than plain Bran Chex.  I tried Crunchy Nut cereal to see if it would be a good choice for us.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the taste of this cereal.  It stayed crunchy in milk, but wasn't too hard either.  It did have a bit of a nutty taste, but it wasn't overpowering.  I wouldn't put this flavor in the "peanut butter" category either. It was just modestly nutty in flavor.  I liked the taste-- while good in milk, it would be fun to just eat dry as well.<br /><br />At 10 grams of sugar per serving, this would definitely be too sweet for every day, and it might be just a bit much for our Fridays.  27 grams of this product has 10 grams of sugar, whereas 27 grams of Froot Loops (almost a serving) has 11 grams. Crunchy Nut cereal also has less fiber per gram than Froot Loops.<br /><br />My verdict on this one is that while it's yummy, it's too sweet for a regular purchase for my family.  However, maybe every once in a while we could splurge a  bit.  It does taste great, but isn't much of an improvement over sugary kids cereals.

review/summary: Says my son: I like these better than Cheerios!
review/text: These do not pretend to be like Cheerios.  They are a completely different texture...very crunchy, with a nice amount of sweetness (more sweet than, say, Honey Nut Cheerios...much less than the super-sugar-coated cereals I'm trying to avoid).  The sweetness comes from sugar (the 2nd ingredient) and honey and molasses...no corn syrups.<br /><br />For me, these will make a nice evening snack...and for my son: breakfast.<br /><br />One note: I don't care how much the picture on the box is "enlarged to show texture", the truth is that the depicted texture is exaggerated...not just enlarged.  My son commented on this right away, noting that the box makes it look like there are BIG pieces of nuts on the cereal.  There are pieces, no doubt, but nothing close to what is pictured.  I still give the cereal 5 stars...I really like the taste (and the texture).  It's just not quite what's pictured.

review/summary: Low in Sugar, but a bit too sweet
review/text: I was excited to try this cereal.  It is low in sugar (10g) and the calories per serving are reasonable (100 calories per 3/4 cup).  I loved the initial taste, but the after taste was a bit too sweet.  When you first taste it, the cereal is crunchy and nutty. However, it becomes too sweet after a couple of spoonfuls.  If it weren't for the after taste, I would rate this cereal 5 stars.  In good faith, I must tell you that I'm a runner and don't like sugary cereals (I usually buy Kashi's Go Lean cereals)- so if you don't mind a sweet after taste this may work for you.

review/summary: Mixed Family Review
review/text: My teens loved it, my husband and I did not. The younger ones liked the extra crunchy peanut taste. Of course what they liked the most was the sweetness. My son felt it had more of a honey taste than sugary and I would agree. They commented that they would like it more as a snack out of the box then in cereal. They still felt that Honey Nut Cheerios was much better tasting with less aftertaste.<br />I thought I was eating caramel corn which I can only tolerate once in a great while and in small doses.  What I was hoping for was that Kellogg's would of listened to all the latest media hype about too much sugar. They didn't. This is way too sweet. I also wish they had used almonds or walnuts in this cereal. The protein to this cereal is only 2g per 3/4 cup. My teens may purchase this on their own but I will not be. I will continue to eat plain Cheerios, adding our own nuts to get some breakfast protein.

review/summary: Better than Honey Nut Cheerios
review/text: Open the box and the aroma will hit you! Its a delicious smell, like honey roasted nuts. The "O"s are smaller than cheerios and much cruchier. The honey flavor is throughout the O and not just a coating on the outside. The actual O tastes somewhat like a corn pop, only much crunchier, and with a hint of nut flavor.<br /><br />Eat this out of the box and your hands won't be sticky like they are with the cheerios version. They make a great snack. Eat them in a bowl of milk and they hold up well against the milk and do not get soggy.<br /><br />This is a great cereal that I will be sure to have in my pantry from now on.

review/text: These O's are just as the name describes. They are crunchy with peanut pieces in the actual O's and they are very sweet.  But the calorie count is reasonable (100 calories for 3/4 cup), and I like eating a handful or two as a midday snack or instead of a dessert. Given the peanuts, I'm surprised how little protein the cereal contains and wouldn't really make this my regular morning cereal.

This would be good for an occasional change but with its 10g of sugar for every three quarters of a cup of cereal is rather high. This serving size also contains one hundred calories. As has been mention before there is an after taste to this cereal but it is the same after taste I get from eating peanuts. It does taste good and stays crunchy in milk, it was sweet but not sicken so,  but I get enough sugar in other products that I do not want this much in my cereal. Though I would eat this cereal Kellogg's has a little more work to do. For now I would rather have  regular Cheerios.

My kids also enjoyed them as much as they enjoy other favorites such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Apple Jacks, and Lucky Charms.  The nice thing about Crunchy Nuts is that this cereal stays crunchy minutes longer in milk which was a nice surprise.  If you enjoy a sugary cereal now and then, you must try Crunchy Nut cereal.  It's delicious.

review/summary: Miss the cereals of your youth?
review/text: Have no fear, you CAN eat cereal that tastes just like those sweet cereals you ate as a kid without incurring the derision of spying neighbors. No more do you have to hide your Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Cookie Crisp in a Cheerios box, just buy these!<br /><br />(After finishing the box, I remember the cereal it tastes like: King Vitamin!)<br /><br />All kidding aside, this is a good (but not great) sweet cereal. Biggest plus is total lack of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup). This is sweetened with molasses and sugar. It is not too sweet and it is nicely crunchy. And like most fortified breakfast cereals it contains 25% of a lot of the vitamins you need daily.<br /><br />It's not a great source of protein or fiber. But on the flip side, it's not carb heavy or high in calories (for what it is). And to be honest, there's no great nut taste even if peanuts are the 4th ingredient. And I don't get honey from it either.<br /><br />So to wrap up: sweet crunch: yes. great nutrition: no. Probably not worth 7$+ a box, but it is probably cheaper at your grocery store. Worth a try, but it probably won't be your favorite.

review/text: After trying to search for the "nuts" in as detail as the picture on the packaging for a while, I decided my eyes are not to blame.  The peanuts are almost invisible -though seemingly they add to the crunch.  For the relatively small package size (10.8 oz), low nutrition value (2g protein, 10g sugar) and the fairly high listed price - this product's value is questionable.  A relatively OK substitute for Cheerios if you want a change, but to make this a default choice may be only because you REALLY liked the taste and not worried about the low nutrition.  Overall, this product is not going to make me switch my cereal loyalties.

review/summary: Honey Nut Cheerios Want-to-Be
review/text: I had high hopes for this cereal, as I am a big peanut fan.  However, while the cereal itself is "not bad" it's lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First and foremost it's not made with whole grains like Honey Nut Cheerios is.  Another reviewer put it nicely when they said this is equivalent to eating candy for breakfast.  The amount of sugar and refined carbohydrates is way too much for any type of health benefit whatsoever.  The peanuts are so small and in such small pieces (more like granules) that I don't consider them anywhere near enough to consider any health benefits from the nuts.<br /><br />The taste itself is good, and it's a bit softer of a crunch than most cereals, but outside of that it's just too many carbohydrates to be on the breakfast table.  Kellog's could really improve this cereal by getting rid of some of the added sweetners and switch to a whole grain recipe.  Until then, if you like sweet cereals with little health benefits then this is for you -- but otherwise, stick with Honey Nut Cheerios.

review/summary: Great taste!  But pure junk!
review/text: Breakfast cereal manufacturers try to make their products sound healthy and wholesome, but most are made almost entirely from flour and sugar with added vitamins (and, these days, a little fiber).  And that pretty much sums up Kellogg's Crunchy Nut.  Corn meal, sugar, corn bran (sounds like a good idea, but it's not), peanuts, honey, molasses, salt, and oat flour make up the main ingredients (note the three different forms of sugar).<br /><br />A 3/4 cup serving has 100 calories, 1g fat, 23g carbs (10 of which are sugar), and only 2g each of fiber and protein.  With numbers like that, I consider this to be candy or pastry.  It can be regarded as a "breakfast" item only in the way that a donut can.<br /><br />Having said that, Crunchy Nut does taste great and has a good crunch (which holds up in milk).  When you first open the bag, you'll smell the roasted peanuts (though they are only very scantly sprinkled over the pieces).  I like sweet things, but this is actually a bit *too* sweet for my taste.  My 10-year-old loved it.<br /><br />In summary, this is a (sadly) typical kid's breakfast cereal.  If this were sold as candy, I'd give it four stars.  But I expect a little bit more nutrition from an item that's sold in the breakfast aisle.

review/summary: Remember Nut & Honey Crunch O's? They're Back... Almost.
review/text: I assumed that this would be the Kelloggs version of Honey Nut Cheerios, but actually it isn't.  Instead it tastes like Kelloggs famous cereal from the late 80's - Nut & Honey Crunch.  I hadn't eaten that cereal in forever, but the smell and taste instantly brought back the memories.  I actually remembered that in the early 90's they came out with a Nut & Honey Crunch O's cereal, which wasn't as popular.  To me if you had ever tried that cereal - then Nut & Honey Crunch O's and the new Crunchy Nut cereal would seem very, very similar.  You could almost say that Kelloggs upped the nut flavoring (since the cereal smells slightly more like peanut butter than I expected), but probably pulled out a stock recipe of the original Nut & Honey Crunch flavoring.  This is probably an attempt by Kelloggs to introduce a previous hit to a new generation.  For me, I wasn't disappointed.  The cereal is really tasty, and not too sweet.  But if I hadn't just tried the cereal on a whim, I probably would have never realized the similarity to a childhood favorite.  Remember this popular commercial tagline - "Whatcha eating?" - "Nut'n honey." I highly recommend Gen X and Baby Boomers that liked Nut & Honey Crunch cereal to try Crunchy Nut.

review/text: I was expecting Honey Nut Cheerios.  But it was different.  These Crunchy Nuts were much crispier.  I checked the ingredients and the first ingredient was corn, which would explain the Kix sort of crunch.  They stayed crunchy until the last bite, perhaps because of the sugar coating... second ingredient is sugar, which is why I can't give it 5 stars even though it tastes great.  The "nut" in these is just peanut, no tree nuts, and they are very peanutty with chunks of peanut on every O.  I loved the flavor.  My son said it was maybe the best cereal he had ever tasted.  Ten grams of sugar per serving and only two grams of protein, so it's not the healthiest cereal on the market, but it does taste great.

When I saw it on Amazon, I had to try it to see if it was as good as it remembered. It is!<br /><br />The brand I tried when I was in the UK was more like corn flakes and this one is more like cheerios. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not as sweet as I remember from the flakes brand. I liked the crunch this cereal had and it never got soggy in the six or so minutes it took me to eat a bowl.<br /><br />At 100 calories for 3/4 of a cup, it would seem this cereal delivers taste as well as not hiking up you calorie intake for the day. Now I am no nutritionist so I would advise looking up all its ingredients for things that may not agree with everyone.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this cereal and would not hesitate to get myself another box.

There really wasn't a flavor other than the sweetness and by the end of the bowl I had to force the last spoonful in. It was kind of blah.<br />If the kids really want to eat this I would buy it for them but I don't think it will be on the top of the shopping list.

review/summary: Mighty Tasty
review/text: What a delicious breakfast cereal! These aren't dry oatey O's covered in honey and nut like I had anticipated they would be, but rather they're a crunchy, dark-amber, honey-corn O, covered in little nut particles.<br /><br />Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey cereal stays crispy [enough] in milk. I turned this box into two after work bowls one night, and then two breakfast bowls the next morning. So they're good enough to be considered a multi-bowl-per-sitting cereal.<br /><br />As far as the name goes, "Crunchy Nut" sounds more like a variety of something than a proper cereal name, so maybe they'll change that down the line, but I like them, I'm sure kids will like them and if you're in the mood for a crisp, tasty, moderately sweet cold cereal then I think you will like them too.

review/summary: Oh!s, Get Your Honey-Smackin' Kix
review/text: Kellogg's new "Crunchy Nut" cereal isn't particularly innovative from a flavor/texture perspective, but it is pretty tasty.  It's flavor is like a hybrid of Kix and Honey Smacks with the texture of Oh!s.  If you like any (or better yet, all) of these cereals, "Crunchy Nut" will probably be a hit at your breakfast table.<br /><br />Don't be caught up in the "Nuts in Every Bite!" hype, though.  You'll barely taste 'em, and they certainly don't raise the nutritional value.  (See below.)  For reference nutritionally speaking, this product very similar to Froot Loops.<br /><br />In short, this cereal is crunchy, not particularly nutty, with a nice mild honey flavor.  It's unlikely you'll be able to use this as a gateway cereal for your kids to start eating muesli regularly.  ;-)<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL INFO:<br /><br />Serving size:  3/4 Cup<br /><br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat:  1g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 125mg<br />Potassium: 25mg<br />Total Carbs: 23g<br />Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: 10g<br />Protein: 2g

review/summary: Good taste, and of course, bad for you
review/text: Like many other reviewers, I'd have to agree that the cereal is very good. It tastes like Cheerios with a sweet, nutty taste. However, it has 10g of sugar per serving...that's quite a bit for cereal. I actually munch on it as a dessert rather than eating it for breakfast. Just like most things that taste good, it's definitely not good for you, but it's a good little treat in moderation.

review/summary: Very Sweet Cereal
review/text: My first impression of the Crunchy Nut cereal was how sweet the cereal is.  Eating the Crunchy Nut cereal was like eating Fruit Loops or another sweetened cereal.  A look the ingredients revealed that sugar is the second ingredient after yellow corn meal, resulting in the very sweet taste.  The cereal also has a definite aftertaste of nuts which is pleasant.<br /><br />It is my belief that Kellogg's produced the Crunchy Nut cereal to compete against Honey Nut Cheerios and so I will be comparing the two cereals in my review.  I found that the Crunchy Nut O's were bigger than Cheerios and rougher.  The rough O's tended to irritate the roof of my mouth when I ate the cereal.<br /><br />A comparison of the nutrition information of the two cereals suggests that although neither cereal is really healthy due to the high sugar content, Crunchy Nut is actually better for you than Honey Nut Cheerios in terms of the sodium and calories.  However, this does not take into account that Honey Nut Cheerios is made from whole grain oats whereas Crunchy Nut is made from corn meal.  Surprisingly, Crunchy Nut actually has the same dietary fiber as Honey Nut Cheerios.<br /><br />Of the two cereals, I preferred Honey Nut Cheerios due to its slightly less sweet taste and since the Cheerios did not tend to irritate the roof of my mouth.  Overall, Crunchy Nut is not a cereal that I can recommend to people who do not like sweetened cereals or who are looking for a healthy cereal.

If you like more of the honey taste, then this isn't the cereal.  I would buy this cereal if it was on a good special, but it wasn't my favorite.  The texture was a lot like cheerios, but it didn't taste as sweet as honey nut cheerios.  I compared the ingredients to that of our other cereals.  It wasn't too bad.  Still had the carbs etc.  A lot like the standard box of cereal.

review/summary: Very peanutty, nice texture
review/text: This cereal is like a more grown-up version of Apple Jacks, with a roasted peanut taste instead of apple. The cereal consists of cherio-type rounds that have the same little sprinkles on them as Apple Jacks, only with a peanut taste. These sprinkles give the cereal a good, crunchy texture. The peanut taste is very pronounced and peanut lovers will delight in it. I've tried other peanut cereals and none tasted more peanutty than this. A good quality cereal, and the box came with a coupon for the next box on it - which I was happy to use after enjoying the cereal. Also has the usual offering of vitamins and minerals you would expect from a major brand cereal. Recommended!

review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut: Roasted Nut & Honey<br /><br />Much better than expected!  I generally don't gravitate towards the 'O' shaped cereals, my favorite cereal is Honey Bunches of Oats.  That being said, when I saw this Nut & Honey cereal, I figured I'd give it a try.  It's tastier than I imagined, it has a stronger honey flavor than most honey-flavored cereals do.  The 'enlarged' picture of the cereal on the box makes it look like there's more nut 'shavings' than there really are, but that being said, there's enough nut there to make a difference and have the cereal taste slightly nutty, which is a good thing in my opinion.  ...I'm not one to eat (or snack on) dry cereal, but this one makes the cut, it's currently sitting next to me on the desk.

review/summary: Sweet, Nutty Crunch
review/text: Lots of reviewers have mentioned how this cereal is similar to Honey Nut Cheerios, and I agree, EXCEPT, I think this is much crunchier.<br /><br />I like crunch, and I also like a sweet breakfast cereal, so I was happy with the taste and consistency.<br /><br />Now, if you don't like sweet in the morning, these may be a little much for you. In addition to sugar, they also have honey and molasses.  The sugar CONTENT however is only 10g. I say "only" because there are some cereals out there, which claim fiber and other health benefits, which have more sugar than these. (Example, frosted Mini-Wheats--12g of sugar. And a certain bran with raisin cereal, 23g of sugar!)<br /><br />Much as I liked these, I wouldn't eat them every single day, because I think the sweet factor might be too much (even for me :>) over time. But they're a nice every-few-days choice.<br /><br />One caution: Peanuts. If you're allergic, be aware that these contain peanuts.

My wife and I dug into this one evening and, 24 hours later, have demolished it. It's not very "peanut-y," except for the artificial peanut flavor (despite, strangely, the flecks of peanut glued onto each "o"). If you're looking for sugar and aren't discriminatory in your brand names, it should satisfy your craving. Om nom nom!

I've tried just about everything in the breakfast aisle, but I've never found anything to rival my two stand-by favorites, plain yellow-box Cheerios and Honey Bunches of Oats. I figured these Kellogg's Crunchy Nut O's were worth a shot, however, as they had both honey and peanuts going for them.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. I thought this cereal was much, much too sweet, and felt that it left a bad corn aftertaste in my mouth. My husband, a huge fan of Honey Nut Cheerios, didn't like this either. After a few bowls, the box sat untouched in my cupboard for months until I finally threw it out. Definitely not for us!

I got distracted by my baby for about 20 minutes and came back to a bowl of cereal that was still crunchy.<br />* Cereal is sweet, but not overly so (i.e. honey nut cheerios are about 2x as sweet)<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The crunchy nutty bits actually left a cut on the inside of my cheek.<br />* If you have dentures, bridges, or false teeth, you want to have them in before you eat this cereal.<br /><br />The flavor is okay - I didn't love this enough to purchase it on my own, but I also wouldn't turn it down if it was my only breakfast option.

review/summary: Not very good, Odd tasting, Not popular with my kids
review/text: First, if you look at the picture on the front, you see large pieces of nuts attached to a an O. I understand this is enlarged, but the reality is the nuts are much smaller relative to the O; more like a coating that an attached piece. They were largely encapuslated in the sugar coating. There was no distinct flavor or texture of nut and O, just one experience.<br /><br />The O is not like a cheerio. Instead it is a sugary construct, sort of like captain crunch but a little less sweet. The sugar coating either has honey or honey flavor. In any case, the honey makes for an odd taste as there is a floral overtone to the cereal that doesn't belong. I don't get this with "Honey bunches of Oats" or the like, but have experienced in a cereal called "Puffins".<br /><br />I have four kids (5 through 13) and, although they ate mose of the cereal, no one was eager for more and a few didn't finish. I certainly wouldn't buy this again. There are tastier and healthier (at the same time!) alternatives.

Shape-wise they look like Cheerios, especially the honey-nut variety with flecks of peanuts.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, these are fine. They have a nice crunch to them, don't get soggy, and they feel light when you eat them.  As other reviewers have commented, they are not overly or syrupy sweet, which is good because you get a nice balance between the sweet part versus the corn and some nuttiness. These are crunchier than Cheerios.<br /><br />The only non-positive thing about this would be the price.  It seems rather pricey to me.

review/summary: Not great, Horribly overpriced
review/text: I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey cereal.  The taste is redolent of corn puffs, with a hint of Multi-grain Cheerios.  Too much honey on the front end, with corn notes that are slightly overpowering in the finish.  The bouquet has distinct peanut notes which is unsurprising as peanuts (which actually aren't a nut) are the main nut in the cereal.  Somehow this combines however, into a cereal that is at once both, overly sweet and mealy.<br /><br />I would also add that the price, $30 + $8 shipping comes out to about .88 an ounce.  Compare that to major grocery chains and other cereals, such as Crunchy Nut Roasted O's at .38/oz, or Honey nut cheerios at .28/oz, and its clear that these are horribly overpriced.<br /><br />Also, when it says nuts (and I realize I'm being a stickler), I really expect it to contain treenuts, like almonds, cashews, etc.  Peanuts are a legume, a groundnut, and technically a bean.  Not a nut.

I'm guessing that the honey is supposed to cut the flavor of the peanuts, but it is hardly detectable.<br /><br />People will of course disagree with my thoughts on peanuts in the morning, but let's take a look at the side of the box.<br /><br />To keep the calories per serving at 100 (without milk), Kellogg's has shrunk the serving size to 3/4 of a cup. That means with milk, a bowl of Crunchy Nut is going to be 300 calories or slightly more. So if you go back for a second bowl, that's a pretty high caloric breakfast. Further, the base ingredient is yellow corn meal, which doesn't have much nutritional value.<br /><br />While there are certainly much more unhealthy cereals out there, in this day and age I'd like to see a more healthy, lower caloric cereal.

review/summary: Crunchy but not nutty...
review/text: I liked the crunch and held up well in milk but there was no nutty flavor and felt it was too sweet.<br />To me, this is more of a snack type than a cereal. Even my husband who eats a cereal daily said there's just 'too much in it." I will just finish the box as a snack but probably would pass it in the cereal aisle.

review/summary: It's Not Honey Nut Cheerios - but it tries to be
review/text: Honey Nut Cheerios (HNC) is a good cold cereal if you're concerned about high Cholesterol and want more fiber.  Kellogg's Crunchy Nut (CN) tries to imitate HNC and doesn't quite get there.  But it's not too far off.<br /><br />They're both tasty.  CN is a bit too sweet for my taste (of course, you might prefer it sweeter) but it only has a little more sugar than HNC.  Must be the way the honey is glazed on CN.<br /><br />HNC is made with Oats, CN with Corn and some Oats.  Oats are supposed to be better for Cholesterol lowering, so HNC gets the edge.<br /><br />HNC and CN both have 2 grams of fiber.  More than most cold cereals so that's good.  (for comparison, Oatmeal has 4 grams).<br /><br />HNC has almonds, CN has peanuts.  I think Almonds are supposed to be a bit healthier but peanuts aren't bad.  Small edge to HNC.<br /><br />Summing up, when i eat cold cereal I prefer HNC to CN but CN is acceptable.

review/summary: A decent choice
review/text: Think of this cereal as a puffed (like Rice Krispies) version of Honey Nut Cheerios, with small pieces of peanut in each O for added crispy-ness and nutty flavor.<br /><br />I say these Os are "crispy" as they're puffed, airy kernels (like Rice Krispies), not "crunchy" like corn flakes or the like.<br /><br />I make the distinction between crispy and crunchy because being the puffed and airy kernels that these are, they have the characteristics of soaking up the milk over time and becoming more dense and taking on a more chewy consistency, but still also holding on to a level of their crispiness. Whereas crunchy cereals tend to get soft and or mushy the longer they're in milk.<br /><br />As to the flavor, these certainly hold-up to the Nut and Honey claim. The sweetness of the nut and honey flavor holds all the way through to staying with you awhile in after-taste (in a good way). I enjoy these Os.<br /><br />Parents concerned about healthy content and sugar might want to be more mindful about this cereal, but otherwise it's a tasty treat.

review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey cereal is very comparable to my beloved Honey Graham Oh's by Quaker. I  can eat both by the fistful right out of the box.  Got milk?  Who cares!  The Kellogg's offering has a hint of peanut flavor to them as opposed to the Graham flavor of the Oh's but is comparable in texture and crunch.  Certainly you can find a MORE nutritious breakfast cereal but on the other hand you could also find a LESS nutritious snack.  I wouldn't want to eat these every day but with sparing use, these will certainly find themselves on my shopping list again.

review/summary: Crunchy Peanutty Flavor
review/text: This is a very tasty cereal, but I find it a bit too sweet for my liking. The Os look similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>, but they taste more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPOEF8">Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch</a>. In terms of sugar content Crunchy Nut is comparable to Honey Nut Cheerios (about 10 g each) so if you like that amount of sugar in your cereal then the choice between these two will come down to taste. The little pieces of nuts that are embedded in each O are hardly noticeable, both visually and in terms of the overall taste. It turns out that these are technically speaking not really nuts, but rather peanuts. They mostly have an effect in terms of the overall flavor - the combination of corn/oats and peanut pieces is probably responsible for the peanut-buttery taste. The Os are indeed very crunchy, and they are among the crunchiest cereals that I have ever tried. They don't lose this crunchiness easily even after a minute or two of soaking in milk. Crunchy Nut Os also make a very tasty and convenient snack. I have also tried them with blueberries and the fruity flavor comes as a nice contrast to all the sugariness of this cereal. Overall, this is a very nice cereal but it's nothing spectacular.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: Upon first taste, I thought that I was really going to like this cereal. I thought that it was another version of Quaker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPMKRC">Honey Graham O's Cereal, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. As such, I was pretty excited. I mean, I like Oh!s. It's one of my favorite cereals.<br /><br />Then the aftertaste caught me. And made me start looking at the ingredient list. I am guessing that it is the corn bran that they put in here, but the aftertaste is somewhere between burned popcorn and Honey Smacks (you know...the one with Dig 'Em Frog). Not so much ideal.<br /><br />If you don't mind the aftertaste, it's pretty reasonable cereal. There are only around 100 calories per 3/4 cup serving, so it's not terribly bad for you like many oversweetened cereal. I think that this is probably the vanguard of an effort by Kellog's to sweeten their cereals with honey, but they haven't quite gotten it figured out just yet. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't think that it was super sweet, but it certainly was sweeter than my normal cereal.<br /><br />ALLERGY WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PEANUTS.<br /><br />Harkius

review/summary: Just as described - delicious
review/text: The word that comes to mind over and over when eating this is "nutty".  The flavor is delicious and it didn't get soggy in milk.  Has a nice crunch to it and an overall great flavor.  There isn't a whole lot you can say about breakfast cereal but the main thing I want to know is "does it taste good" and my answer is "absolutely". We checked the price in our local grocery, it's selling for four dollars a box around here so that is much to expensive for our price range (a house full of children who eat cereal for breakfast AND snack every day) but definitely yummy!

review/summary: A pleasant surprise, and quite possibly my new favorite cereal.
review/text: When I first got these, I was expecting a Honey Nut Cheerios knockoff. I'm not a big fan of breakfast cereal and normally would rather eat something like bacon & eggs for breakfast, but I ordered these from Amazon since it's been awhile since I reviewed anything for the Amazon Vine Program, and I figured this would be an easy review.<br /><br />Surprisingly, not only are these not a knockoff of Honey Nut Cheerios, in fact the taste reminds me of what was my favorite cereal as a kid, but was sadly discontinued by Post. The cereal I am referring to is Waffle Crisp, a Post brand cereal with a maple-syrup taste to them, and one of the only cereals I actually enjoyed enough that I would choose it over bacon & eggs.<br />This doesn't have the same maple-syrup taste as Waffle Crisp though, it has more of a honey-roasted nut taste like the box suggests. However, something about the taste of the cereal itself, (beyond the honey flavor) reminds me of Waffle Crisp.<br /><br />Once more, I'm not big into breakfast cereal, but I could really see myself buying this in the future, and I most likely will, assuming I can find it at my local grocery store. So if you were a fan of the late Waffle Crisp cereal or just plain looking for something different, try these out.
