review/summary: SUMI LOVES IT AND IT'S GOOD FOR HER!
review/text: After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no "powdered protein" or other questionable substances.  My dog loves it but to be honest I have to tell you that she practically inhales anything that she thinks might be food. I have the reassurance that this product won't hurt her.  The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent.

review/summary: Diarrhea
review/text: My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?

review/summary: Newman's Own for Puppies/Dogs Canned Food
review/text: I love this dog food. I eat very well myself, being a vegetarian for over 20 years and try to eat organically as much as possible. I did a great deal of research on commercial dog foods and I was disgusted when I discovered the amount of chemicals and pesticides they contained. I tried my puppy on many different natural dog foods and she would have gas and the runs with every type, but Newman's Own.  So I am back to my first choice since she never had negative effects with it. Unfortunately it was a little hard to find locally, but now I can order it through Amazon and get it delivered every month. Thanks Newman's Own and thanks Amazon for making my puppy and I very happy :)

review/text: Our dog loves this food, but this seller keeps shipping me damaged goods. In each shipment we get at least one or two severely dented cans. This is not due to shipping. The box it's shipped in arrives without a dent. It's only inside, therefore, the dents are happening before they ship.

review/text: My dogs have food allergies and I tried a holistic brand and they would not eat it. I tried the Newman's Own dry food and they loved it so I decided to add a little of the wet food. This food is not your standard wet food it looks more like mousse. It isn't a jelly loaf with yucky bits like some others. My dogs love it and lick their bowls clean.

review/text: My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.  Of course, if air gets into the cans, the food will not be safe to eat.  Makes me wonder if they are selling "seconds."  Would account for the great price.  Would have liked to have heard back from them.

review/summary: This one is an obvious winner at our house - for my lab mix!
review/text: I offered my lab mix his new DRY dog food yesterday. He refused it. It was one of the Newman's Own dry dog food. No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!

review/summary: Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice
review/text: I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!

review/summary: All beef wonderful
review/text: My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own. The liver was not her favorite and was a little strong smelling for this vegetarian, but the beef was great. She loves it, I steam some veggies and mix them in, then put a dry food on top and she scarfs it down. I do wish Newman's would put out an organic beef treat and a dry food that does not have chicken and corn but am very happy with the beef.

review/summary: Newman's Turkey and Brown rice formula
review/text: My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year. I mix it with Flint River Ranch kibble so they have some crunchy food also. They are spaniels (a breed prone to allergies) and have had no allergy problems and have shiny, sleek coats. They are healthy and love the food. I strongly recommend it. It is a high-quality, human-grade dogfood.

review/summary: Gives my dog terrible diarrhea
review/text: After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them.

review/text: I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.

Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever.

review/text: First, I feed my dogs fresh raw food I make into patties and frez, each morning they eat one frozen,and I give them Fish oil, Garlic and Klamath shores Blue Green Algae caps. Then at night I give Newmans Chicken can food and mix in their Probiotic Miracle & Enzymes and Plaque off. Then they always have their dry food (Taste of the wild, grain free)anytime they are still hungery.<br /><br /> My 2 big dogs are very healthy at 8 years old, hardly get fleas anymore, I don't use chemical flea or heartwormer products anymore, as one dog had a bad reaction to them and lost most of his hair and had hot spots for two years. Then nat. path vet said my other vet should not have given him the yearly vacinations,which also caused the problems. He went on a 10 week detox after that.)<br /><br />For the alternative heartwormer I do 1 week each mo. I give my dogs Natures sunshine Artemisia Combination 2 in the morning, 1 at night with 1 BlackWalnut. then 2 times that week I will give them 1 HS2. I give these about 20 min. before I give them morning food. Then at night before bed. My dogs weights are 100 and 70. The dog that had allergey, I also would give him first thing in the morning, before eating, Transfer factor, or colostrum, also everyother day a kelp tablet, which I think helped the hair grow back in. I used emu oil with lavender oil and tea tree oil mixed in, on the hot spots. Also for the ears, I used Zymox, OTIC Enzymatic Solution. it worked great.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone.

I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again.

I think she especially loves the smell of it, although that occasionally puts me off a bit because it does contain fish. Some cans are stinkier than others, but it's all perfume to Marie's nose. She gobbles it up. I do vary her diet to include some grain-free products, but this is the food she gets most excited about.<br /><br />I love it because I trust this company, and I believe that Newman's Own products are of high quality. (I hope I'm right.) I also like their mission to bring good green and fair trade products to the market, and to use their profits to support charitable causes. Bottom line: I feel confident that I am giving my girl something wholesome and good.<br /><br />I stock up on this food because the chicken they put in it is "human grade." I hope the fish is "human grade," too, because I have several cases of this in my garage. I'm thinking that when the "Big One" (earthquake) hits here in California, I'll just break out a case of this food and Marie and I can both survive on it until help arrives.

review/summary: My Yorkies love this stuff!
review/text: After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth. For a well rounded nutritional meal, I mix the following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK339Y">Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula for Dogs, 12.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMDYZA">Newman's Own Organics 100% Organic Liver for Dogs, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>. The dogs really go nuts for this stuff and seem to enjoy it. It appears to me that the dogs have more energy and are in an overall better mood. One of Yorkies had a licking issue and that behavior has decreased dramatically since I made the switch to Newman's. It keeps their stool very solid as well. Overall this a great, nutritional meal at a good price......5 STARS!

review/summary: Turkey and Chicken Formula smells like fish
review/text: Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that "Turkey & Chicken Formula" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as "contaminated".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.

review/summary: Too Rich for my dogs
review/text: I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the "organ" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!

review/summary: My picky eaters love it!
review/text: I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!

review/summary: Good food but...
review/text: I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.

review/summary: My dogs love this stuff from Uruguay
review/text: OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay.

review/text: I bought a case just to try out on my wiener dog, Oscar.  He has lost weight.  Now he is much more energetic and can jump higher which means he can get into more trouble.  Before going up stairs was slow and sometimes I had to wait. Now he is the first up the stairs just like the old days.  Keeping weight off of Dachshunds is very important for their back.  It costs a little more but I think I will make it up in vet bills and also have my buddy around for a longer period.<br />Doesn't have that dog food smell and you can actually see the ingredients.

review/summary: Glad we tried, has made a difference
review/text: My family rescued a pug mix from a shelter a couple months ago.  We used the puppy food they gave us and then matched the brand at our local store later.  A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.

Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended.

I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]

I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.

review/summary: GOOD FOOD ...BAD PACKAGING
review/text: just received a case of 12 chicken & brown rice formula...every single can was dented beyond use...this was a problem before and supposedly amazon was to get their shipping problem with this item corrected...it states that this item is not returnable although damaged, i wrote to amazon requesting a return label and credit ...will see what happens...i want to return the case of food so they can see the damage, there were 4 air pillows in the box but they had holes torn in them so they were flat and just laying on top of the food...ordered this product from another website while waiting for amazon to straighten out their shipping problem, the other company sent the order UPS and the case of food was surrounded by the Styrofoam pellets and not a dent one !...UPDATE... Amazon replace order, came UPS this time instead of USPS, air pillows were again torn and flat, but only one can barely dented,...Also, i opened one of the dented cans from the first order, bad smell and food was pulled away from the sides, so take care with dented cans of dog/cat food

review/text: Citrusmint is probably the best Orbit flavor, and I've tried them all. This is the first gum that I actually chew like it's a real food product, and not just some chewy mint. I make it through about a pack a day, it's that good. Citrusmint is somewhat of a misnomer, as there is really no mint flavor to it, just a burst of refreshing orange. The texture of the gum also seems softer than most of the other Orbit flavors, making it even more appetizing. This is truly a world-class gum and it's good for your teeth as well. On the downside, as with all the Orbit varieties, the package is poorly designed and  sometimes it can be difficult to remove the individual pieces of gum. However, this inconvenience is a small price to pay to experience such a magnificent gum.

review/summary: I use it instead of Nicotine Gum....
review/text: I gave up smoking years ago by chewing nicotine gum instead. The nicotine gum is as addictive as the cigarettes were. So now I am trying to quit that bad habit. Orbit gum is great for that. It stays soft and holds the flavor the longest of any gum I have tried yet. And it's a heck of a lot cheaper than nicotine gum! I like the orange and spearmint best but each to his own flavor. And sugar free too!

review/summary: Premium Gum - Good For Your Teeth
review/text: I like orange flavor that is why I prefer this new Citrusmint from Orbit.  Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of "Juicy Fruit". Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.

review/summary: Best citrus flavor gum
review/text: I became a fan of Orbit gum through the citrusmint flavor. I've tried most of the Orbit gum flavors and citrusmint remains my all-time favorite, which initially surprised me since I tend to be more of a cinnamon fan.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, "citrusMINT" is a bit of a misnomer as it isn't all that minty and I agree its more of a refreshing orange-dominated citrus burst than anything mint. Citrusmint seemed to disappear from stores here in AK this spring and summer so I tried a variety of other orange/citrus flavored gums and found them to be disappointing: too artificial tasting, too minty and not citrus enough, all-around low quality.<br /><br />I agree that citrusmint doesn't "clean" your breath as well as a standard mint flavor but that's not always why I chew gum. At work I chew gum to prevent myself from snacking and for this Orbit gum excels. Compared to other brands, it last a VERY long time. Another reviewer mentioned that the citrusmint seems softer and I agree - it is much softer than other flavors of Orbit and it actually STAYS soft for hours where other gums might get gritty or squeaky and rubbery. I find that the longevity of citrusmint Orbit helps offset the potential increase in expense.<br /><br />XYLITOL: a lot of gum these days boast of bacteria-fighting xylitol content. Unfortunately, though Orbit contains xylitol it is a negligible amount (around .38mg per stick depending on the flavor). The daily dose required to actually have an impact on negative oral bacteria is more than 4g. Most big brand names of gum don't have enough xylitol to be useful in this arena (there ARE brands that do!). Personally I eat Ricochet mints for my xylitol intake.<br /><br />PACKAGING: Orbit gum currently comes in a little wallet-like box with two overlapping rows of sticks of gum. The box helps protect the sticks better than paper wrappers like Trident, especially for keeping out lint, but it does mean you end up with an entire box protecting the last stick of gum. This doesn't bother me but it could bother others. And I agree, the pieces at the outside edge often get stuck.<br /><br />Still, I can't find a better citrus/orange flavor with the same good flavor and longevity of Orbit Citrusmint gum, my hands-down favorite.

review/summary: Decent gum, not great for your breath
review/text: Its not like I have horrible breath, but hey, we all get the spicy nachos from time to time.  This gum may be great for my teeth, but it doesn't pack much punch for re-flavoring your mouth.  It's always been a problem for the fruity gums while the mint-based gums always seem to last a lot longer.  Probably because they have flavorful oil in them while I suspect this brand to have a little flavor and mostly sugar substitute.<br /><br />It's similar to the orange tic-tacs - they taste good, but they don't solve the breath problem.

review/text: I love these bars! If you are on WW, they are only 2 points. They are much largers than the WW 2pt. bars and very filling. You could treat them as a snack or meal replacement. My local grocery is no longer carrying these bars as a result, I made my purchase through Amazon at a great price. I was paying a dollar or more for individual bars. The chocolate peanut is fabulous. Can easily curb your craving for a Snickers! I was also pleased with how fresh they were.

review/summary: Great for breakfast
review/text: I bought these bars because I never eat breakfast.  I hate eggs, don't like most cereals, etc.  I know breakfast is important so I decided to try these.  They taste okay, leave a gritty aftertaste.  With these particular ones I can taste the chocolate but it's lacking in the peanut butter taste.  I will definitely keep eating them though because they do work.  I had one for breakfast two days in a row and did not find myself feeling hungry until it was lunch time.  On the third day I decided to try a bowl of cereal (Cheerios to be exact) because it was convenient.  An hour after I ate the cereal I felt as if I was starving.  Thank goodness I had an apple with me because I devoured it but was still hungry!  Obviously the cereal did not satisfy me the way the bars did.  I will keep eating them and am curious about trying the protein shakes.

She had told us she was feeling tired but didnt' understand why as she was eating her carbs.  When we sat down and looked at her diet, there was little to no protein.  These protein bars do the trick.  She can put them in her purse or backpack and off she goes.  They don't take long to eat and taste good.  My son also takes them with him if he is going to have after school practice.

I've found that if I eat one for breakfast, I am hungry by lunchtime, but not overly so. If I eat one for lunch at around 1pm, I am generally very hungry after 5pm.<br /><br />They are a good size, not overly chocolaty, and the peanut butter isn't overpowering at all, it's almost subtle. The bsr doesn't stick to your mouth, it's easy to eat, and it has a nice texture, not too hard. Plus the slight crunchiness from the rice parts kind of reminds me a bit of a candy bar.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious
review/text: I prefer these Special K bars over candy bars, because being almost 50 I have to closely monitor my weight.  Obesity is a serious health problem in this country, besides being unsightly, it is unhealthy for all parts of the body, and I need healthful snacks like these to keep my hunger cravings at bay. I know cynics say they are no better for you than candy bars, but what do they know?  One candy bar has almost 55% of one day's(!) portion of fat, whereas the special K bars are substantially less, because they cynics are not working at the Special K factory.  I think they are overpriced, however, I will not pay $1.00 for them, but when they go on sale for $4.00 then I will get a box of six.  I find they taste great and they are not too hard, and I will absolutely not buy any snack bar that doesn't have a little 'give' when I press down with my thumb.  I don't want to eat any snack bar that is harder than my teeth, and the Special K bars are a nice filler between meals.  Any flavor is good.

You have other bars that beat that price, for some reason your peanut butter bars are through the roof.  Epic fail Amazon.  Usually you are my savior...i just don't understand...<br /><br />To everyone else, check your grocery store before buying.  Don't get me wrong, I love amazon (spend almost thousands a year on amazon) but this is a bad deal.  Even our highest priced grocery stores have them cheaper.<br /><br />Also to Kellogs,  These things are already overpriced.  I like the bars, but they aren't the 'best' for you (they have real sugar vs sugar alcohol for instance.)  They have a great taste, and i've bought a few hundred dollars worth in my lifetime (used to order 12 boxes a month until the prices jumped up on amazon.)  My advice to you is to get them below $5/box.  You'll earn me as a loyal customer if you do.  Thanks to the price increases i've been forced to purchase other brands, and you've lost around $700 retail (this year) or so as a result.  Might not seem like much, but get a few people doing that, and it becomes an issue...

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

The smell from the orange blossoms is strong enough to be relaxing while you wait for your tea to cool, though the flavor is minimal, in keeping with the delicacy of the tea.  On a health note, research indicates that citric acid, as found in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges, is one of the most effective common additives to tea to increase the absorption rate of the plentiful antioxidants that tea contains.  I had hoped this might have that acid in the bag, but from what I've read, orange blossoms don't contain that acid content.

review/summary: Cold Brew
review/text: This is good for me, as I do not boil my tea.  I let it brew in the water (without boiling).  I haven't brewed or boiled tea in years now.  Whether or not I was suppose to, I just let the tea bag seep in the jug of water.  When it sits in the water, the tea seeps out, and you'll never know I never boiled it.<br /><br />However, when I saw this tea, that said cold brew, I had to try it.  I don't boil it anyway, so this is how I'm suppose to do it.  And it tastes good.  I do love tea.

review/summary: Consider something else
review/text: I recently bought the Nespresso Totem for my Nespresso capsules.  I did not buy it through Amazon, but was compelled to leave a review.  Out of the box the product looks decent enough, however, upon taking a closer look, I noticed that the clear piece (I believe it's acrylic)  gets scratched easily.  The piece is basically a clear tube that sits on the black plastic bottom.  It is not held into place and sits loosely on the base.  Additionally fingerprints, water spots, and dust are very visible on the "tube.". Finally, when capsules are added into the holder, you have to be really careful because the weight of the ones higher up in the tube can easily push the the ones in the base right out of the holder and onto the table. Oh, and one other thing, the base doesn't turn.  The carousel for Nespresso is much cheaper, looks nicer, is more sturdy, and is on spinning base.

review/summary: Worst capsule keeper ever
review/text: We purchased this capsule keeper with our new nespresso machine and we end up having most of the capsules all over the counter. when you put in new capsules from the top - it pushes the ones from the bottom right out and onto the kitchen counter - we have to be really careful also taking capsules out from the bottom cause if they shift and push down the same thing happens - i am sick of cleaning the capsules up all the time so it was time to retire this piece of ....

review/summary: My 20 month old Golden Retriever Loves Them
review/text: My Golden looks like she just got away with something when she gets one.  They last her about 10 minutes and seem to help keep her teeth clean.  The 12 pack is a good value and I'm on my second bag.  I have given her one every few days for the last couple of months and she doesn't seem to have any problem digesting them.  I am sticking with Peanut Butter Flavor for now but will probably try other favors.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Yummo - say the dogs
review/text: I have two medium size dogs and they both love these.  We get the peanut butter flavored treats.  When I have to leave my older dog at home and take the younger one, the older dog usually gets really upset.  If I give him one of these treats as we are leaving, he couldn't care less that he's being left behind.

review/summary: Not for my dogs
review/text: My dogs seemed to really like these the first time I gave them one.  However, when I gave them a second one a few days later, I noted that my Lab and Boxer wound up with diarrhea and my Rottweiler was forcing herself to throw up until she finally brought up a huge piece of the filling.  It was hard like a rock and you could tell that many pieces of the filling had fused together.  I shudder to think what would have happened had she not been able to bring it up.  She won't even look at these treats - nor will my boxer.  My Lab seemsed to really like these so I cut them into smaller pieces and he did fine - but I will never buy these again.<br />I have read a lot about these treats and realize my dogs may not have normal reaction to these treats.  It appears to be a love/hate - either the dogs really do well and love them or - like my dogs - don't do well and really hate them.

review/summary: I've been buying these for my dog for years!
review/text: My dog, a full grown Golden Retriever, LOVES Pur-Luv bones. He's never had any problems with them and my vet always tells me how great his teeth look.  I don't brush his teeth, but these seem to manage to help keep his teeth clean.<br /><br />These are an EXCELLENT alternative to rawhides that can be swallowed in chunks and may cause a choking hazard for dogs.  My dog one nearly choked to death on a rawhide bone and I stopped buying those for him immediately.  These take the place for his chewing needs and for his dental needs quite well.  Perhaps more expensive than rawhides, but isn't your dog worth it?

review/summary: Awesome value
review/text: You cannot beat the price on these. I have 3 dogs and am always looking for the best price on things. I have bought these treats before at many different stores, but on here they are the cheapest around and my dogs just love them. These are even cheaper than the walmart brand I usually buy them and more come in this bag. My dogs are very sensitive/allergic to alot of products, so I have to be careful, but finally found a treat that they are not allergic to and now at a great price, so I am very pleased.
