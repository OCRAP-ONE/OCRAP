review/text: The chips tasted stale and were so broken up from poor packaging that I could only eat a few from each bag. The bags were crammed into a box that was lightweight, and thus, the problem. I will not be ordering them again.

review/summary: Very Tasty Chips
review/text: I bought the Ripple lightly salted chips. I find that the chips are very good as other reviewers have said. I like that that they are lightly salted and it is still enough of a salted taste. The chips were not broken (any more than when you get them in a store) or crushed. They are packaged quite well for shipping. This is February and the expiration date on them is 6 months from now (Aug.). 12-8 0z. pkgs. to a box is a lot of chips but for those who don't know it, the chips can be refrigerated for quite a while, even past the expiration date, and still be as fresh and crispy as if just bought. I put extra crackers and cereal in the fridge too with the same results. I have a fridge in the garage so I can do this. I do recommend these chips.

review/summary: You Can't Eat Just One....
review/text: 12 Bags, with a six month expiration date; packaged well to avoid your typical delivery process of testing the packaging.<br />Chips are as advertised: thin, crispy, & unsalted, but surprisingly flavorable; difficult to stop eating them. There is a fair share of breakage, & a few over-cooked pieces per bag, but no higher than any other chip-seller I've seen.

review/summary: Always keep this in my pantry
review/text: back in 1990 a colleague, Tim, and i were on a business trip to Cincinnati.  Tim knew about this great BBQ place, so it was an easy decision as to where to eat dinner that night.  We went to the Original Montgomery Inn and needless to say I had the best full slab of ribs I'd ever had.  Since then I've been buying MI sauce and it is a killer BBQ sauce.  Not too hat, but just warm enough.  Read the label.  You don't cook with the sauce on the meats.  First, You cook the meat, with a dry rub of your choice (they don't tell you that); then after the meat is done, you heat up some MIBBQ sauce and just pour it on.  I don't think you can overdose on it.  That's the way it's done and it is just phenomenal!<br /><br />Recently business took me back to Cincinnati after some 20 years.  Guess what, the MI was only 15 minutes from the hotel.  Went back, ordered another full slab w/ baked potato... Hog Heaven!!!

review/summary: Suprisingly good.
review/text: Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.  If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out.

review/summary: Really Good If You Make A Few Adjustments
review/text: I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes "okay" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads.

review/summary: Some and good, others are not
review/text: As a general rule, in my opinion, if you stay away from the creamy-type dressings, you should be ok. For example, I love the balsamic one and the honey dijon is pretty good, but ranch and bleu cheese are just inedible; I would rather just eat my salad plain.  I'm on a very low cal and almost zero carb diet, so these (especially the balsamic) have been a life saver.  I'm going to try the cocktail sauce next.

review/summary: Great alternative!
review/text: These salad dressings are a great alternative to other popular fat free dressings.  I hate those sprays that are on the market now because there isn't enough dressing for a serving for pete's sake.  I like Thousand Island Waldens Dressing the best -- made a salad with veggie steak strips, spinach, black olives and mushrooms and this dressing was perfect! I've tried Ranch, Balsamic, Caesar and Blue Cheese.  The bleu cheese is bland, but the rest I've tried have been tasty and very satisfying.  I'm glad that I don't have to waste a 60-80 calories on dressing for my salads.

review/summary: Terrible: Walden Farms Ranch Dressing
review/text: This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.  I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor.  Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.

It is the only dressing you can use when on the HCG diet. I use this on my spinach and salads ... and also on my chicken, as a marinade! It is awesome. Sure makes the hcg diet a lot more bearable.

review/summary: Diabetic's Dream
review/text: For type 2 diabetics trying to control blood sugar by diet alone or with minimal medication the Walden Farms brand is heaven sent.  I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life.

Now the shipping is still the same for this flavor of dressing only. But if you try to order their other flavors you'll find that they are charging $6.95 PER BOTTLE. Quite a surprise when you see hundreds of dollars show up in your shopping cart. I spoke with Amazon and they told me to get in touch directly with the vendor because the vendor sets the pricing. I spoke with someone at the vendor who told me to get in touch with Amazon. Then she finally told me to email her manager, be brief, and explain the difficulty. I did this and got no response. Caveat emptor, buyer beware.

review/text: As other reviewers have said elsewhere, these Walden Farms salad dressings, and other Walden Farms products, can be hit or miss. But everybody's taste is different, so I would say they are definitely worth a try. When they hit it's excellent, with no calories, fat, or carbs, and few if any artificial ingredients. When they miss... well, you move on.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the pricing on these items. They are all over the chart, ranging from reasonable to highway robbery. Some have shipping charges of $4.95 PER BOTTLE! It would seem to be a mistake, but they refused to acknowledge it and actually defended the charge. Others are over $8 per bottle w/free shipping; no bargain there either. Some, with shipping, are over $10 a bottle. It's not difficult to find much better deals on the web-try allstarhealth.com for starters, and there are probably even better ones out there.

But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.<br /><br />I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!<br /><br />I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?

review/text: I love this dressing. I use it pretty much with everything. This year I decided to get serious about my weight (and lost 23 lbs by the way)and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet (along with those friends). In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products, although I've never heard of them before. Being an on and off dieter since I can remember, that would be shame on me. I am in love with their products now. Well, most of them. This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip. I use it with everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach. It goes well with everything. It tastes good, it's light and calorie free. And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all. Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good.

review/summary: If you're serious about calories...
review/text: I've tasted the best of the "real things," and they were wonderful and dreadfully high in fat, carbs, and calories; that includes dressings, dips, and sauces.  Yes, I've added up what goes into a salad, and those oil and fat content calories soar!  If you expect a fat-free substitute for most anything to be a close equivalent, forget it; you'll have to do with eating the tiniest bits of food to lose weight.  If you expect a zero-calorie substitute to taste the same, ditto.  However, the key here is to find the best of the WF products for you.  I can't do the Peanut Spread (and I'm addicted to Peanut Butter), but most of the other products I can manage.  Some of the dressings are really good, especially the Balsamic.  Loving sweets, I keep handy an assortment of chocolate sauce and dip, caramel sauce, pancake syrup, and I've recently "discovered" the blueberry pancake syrup.  The trick is not to use too much because, yes, there is an aftertaste, but if you use the right amount, it's a darn good substitute.  AND...the calories...the carbs...the fat...don't add up!!

review/text: I would certainly compliment Walden Farms for their line of zero-calorie salad dressings.  It's really quite amazing how they can do this.<br /><br />The Thousand Island dressing is fair.  The major flavor that comes across is vinegar.  In small amounts, mixed into a salad, it does the trick.  It gives a kick to "boring" field greens.  In larger amounts, it's no better than tolerable, but you may feel good that you can have a huge greens salad and dressing for under 50 calories.  One thing is clear:  It does not taste much like full fat or low fat Thousand Island dressing.

I actually had a fairly low expectation, so for me, this was a bit better than I expected.  I used it to make a tuna salad, so some of the flavors are better suited to that perhaps.  I am on a strict low carb diet so this seems to be good enough.

review/summary: Absolutely DISGUSTING! TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..

review/text: This is not bad, it's good on a salad, and decent as a veggie dip as well.  It's very tangy, and nice in it's own way but does not taste like a normal full fat ranch dressing.  It's on par with other low fat or light dressings I have tried, but with 0 calories.  I like to add a little cracked black pepper to mine.  I may buy this again, but I prefer their Caesar dressing.

review/text: I've tried a number of different flavors and found the Bleu Cheese and Vinaigrette more suited to my taste.  Nothing I've tried of these dressings really tastes like normal salad dressing, but these make terrific alternatives if you're looking for a dressing that minimizes caloric intake.  The Vinaigrette also has made a good "dipping" dressing for bread, etc.  Just try a few and see which ones you like.

review/text: I am a serious weight control person.  I recently lost 25 lbs and I determined not to regain it.  The key is lots of salad and lots of veggies with adequate protein and eat frequently. I use Bacon Ranch and add some straight balsamic vinegar to my salads.  Delicious.  I use the vinaigrettes on vegetables and then roast or BBQ them.  If you hate these dressings, in my opinion you don't REALLY want weight loss or weight control.  Are the "regular" dressings better?  I don't know and I don't care.  I am a 66 year old female athlete and I love being trim.

review/text: I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.

review/summary: From a HUGE fan of Walden Farms
review/text: We've been ordering these dressings directly from Walden Farms for many years and haven't yet had a flavor we didn't like.  Our favorites are the Caesar, the Bleu, and the Ranch, but we also regularly enjoy the Creamy Italian, Russian, and Thousand Island.  You can buy them directly from Walden Farms, up to 10 bottles in an order, for a flat shipping fee of $7.95. Make the salads as rich as you want with tasty ingredients -- we like avocadoes in ours, providing healthy monosaturated fat, or a dollop of virgin olive oil -- and save calories BIG TIME with these delicious dressings. Any of them will also make a wonderful dressing for cole slaw and broccoli slaw, although WF also has a very good Cole Slaw flavor.  And the kids love them as dips for fresh veggies.

review/text: I am a Diet Coke addict.  As a result, I'm trying to find an adequate substitute, and for now, sobe lifewater seems to be doing the job for a nice refreshing sweetened beverage with my lunch.  I know I should just drink "plain" water - and do drink plenty of it - but it is nice to be able to have something with a little sweet flavor.  I like that this product is sweetened with erythritol (a natural sugar alcohol) and Reb A (stevia) instead of aspartame - though this does not exempt the beverage from having sugar carbs.  I have tried only three flavors: the pomegranate, apple, and strawberry (and like all three, but prefer the strawberry over the other two).  The only thing I do not care for is the price!

I get them when they are on sale for $1.00 a bottle. I have paid more if they aren't on sale, but never more than $1.50. I guess if you want to try a different flavor, my local stores don't carry all of the 0 calorie flavors, but I still wouldn't pay this much. Great product though.

But, if you think you're drinking a holistic refreshment in lieu of a caffeinated beverage, you are not.<br />The caffeine content is about 25 mg/8 ounces (20 ounces per bottle), so you are getting as much caffeine as a cup of coffee! If you think the natural ingredients and B complex are giving you an energy boost, it's probably the caffeine.<br />Me and my heart arrhythmia didn't appreciate being duped. Sobe should label this product to include the fact that it contains caffeine on the front of the label, not on the very, very bottom under the ingredients.

review/text: Upon first swallow, my pallet took me to a serene place somewhere near Nova Scotia.  It was a cold country devoid of any trees or vegetation. The only sound was the gentle lapping of arctic waves upon the shore and an occasional distant "or! oor!" bellowing of a sunbathing seal.  Then I awoke to find myself in a hospital.  "Drink this, Mr. Nova!" the nurse held out a small plastic cup filled with a pale orange liquid.  I realized it was time for my daily dose of melted hospital jello.  It was the only thing I could gulp down after my last circus performance as a sword swallower.  Anyway, this Lifewater beverage from Sobe takes me back to those quiet afternoons of looking out at the snow, dreaming... always dreaming of the cold North Atlantic.

review/summary: Nice natural hint of cherry aroma
review/text: This tea came in a resealable plastic pouch.  The brand printed on the pouch is English Tea Store.  The following information is on a sticker on the pouch: "Sencha Kyoto Cherry Rose Festival Green Tea, Certified USDA Organic, Loose Leaf Tea, 113.4 grams (4 oz)"<br /><br />The first thing you will notice upon opening the pouch is the strong, almost medicinal cherry aroma of the dry tea -- but don't worry!  Unlike what I have read about other types of teas with cherry, the flavor and scent of the liquid tea after brewing is very mild and natural.  Just the right hint of fragrance remains, not the overpowering taste of chemical flavoring.  The sencha itself also seems to be a fairly mild variety -- I have had others that tasted too "green" for my palate.  This tea has neither the taste nor smell of seaweed like some more intense varieties of sencha.  The leaves expand to a good size to be caught in a strainer without too much slipping through.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 4-star rating instead of 5 is because the package is not dated in any way.  While tea may not expire in the sense of becoming unfit to consume, freshness can affect flavor.  Even if an "expires on" date isn't correct, and a "best by" date is a matter of opinion, having a "packaged on" date would be useful, and a "harvested/produced on" date would be most preferred.

review/summary: After trying several GF ginger snaps, these are my favorite!
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item. For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

When you are in the mood for something different this fits the bill, plus the ginger is good if you are feeling nauseous.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: I've read quite a lot concerning what cat food is best for cats.  Most of the cat foods at grocery stores (and even pet retail stores) is extremely unhealthy for a cat.  This is generally due to extremely poor ingredients (such as animal by products that no creature should be eating) and other factors.  It is all about marketing when it comes to even the foods that everything THINKS are high quality.  (i.e. Science Diet)  Do some research on the subject and you'll quickly find most of these foods look great to humans but not so great to cats.<br /><br />The ingredients in this food are extremely good, and this is one of the most affordable foods I have been able to find of this quality.  Plus it is made in the USA so you are supporting US manufacturing at the same time you are taking care of your cats health!

review/text: These rawhides are the only ones my dog will actually spend the time and effort on. Other rawhides, including Dingo's non-beefy ones, are usually just left alone by him. I would recommended that you have a area for your dog to eat these though, unlike one of the other reviewers I've found that these can mark lightly colored carpets/rugs. (luckily for me it was just a bath mat). However, since my dog loves them it's a five star item.

review/summary: Dogs love them, Amazon Distribution Center needs to be careful
review/text: Like the most recent reviewer, my most recent purchase of these had a slash across the top of the bag--my slash didn't cover the width of the bag, more like two inches but it is easy to spot. This leads me to believe that when the people at Amazon Distribution Center(s) are opening the cases / boxes that contain the bags, they're not showing due diligence when working with sharp tools. Today our dog's treats, tomorrow someone's hand? PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL AMAZON SHIPPING EMPLOYEES, I don't want you folks to cut yourselves or my dogs treat bags!<br /><br />Other than my complaint about the bag, the bones are well loved by my dogs and the slit in the bag has not reduced their desire to have their daily treat.<br /><br />I'm still awarding the product a five star rating since I suspect that it's not the bone' manufacturer that is responsible for the slit top bags.

review/text: My Shiba Inu (who already is somewhat picky) usually goes for the regular Dingo knots, so I though something with a little extra beef would be a plus. The first thing I noticed upon opening the bag was a very strong "smoky" smell. Not like BBQ ribs or Brisket smoky, but more like "Charcoal" or "burned beyond belief blackened meat". It was not pleasant to this human, but to the dog...?<br /><br />Nope, it's a no go. She took a couple of whiffs and walked away. Guess the dog doesn't like them either. Now I need to find someone who wants an opened bag of stinky charred dingoes.

review/summary: Still "Mmm-Mmm Good" After All These Years!
review/text: I typically like to make my own soups, but when I want bean with bacon soup, I buy Campbell's Bean with Bacon. I can't seem to replicate the flavor of this, and prefer it to my own version of bean with bacon soup. I've been enjoying this Campbell's flavor since I was about 12 years old when I first had it, and it's still one of my favorites.<br /><br />This comfort-food-feeling soup has a hearty flavor and density that keeps me full for hours. In the thick broth, there are little soft bits of bacon, as well as tiny pieces of (soft) carrots. The main attraction of this soup, the beans, are plentiful, have a great flavor and are nice and soft. Nutrition fact wise, the total fat per serving is only 3 grams of fat, calories per serving 160 grams, protein: 8 grams and 5 mg of cholesterol.<br /><br />Not only for the great flavor and protein, but also because this is a relatively healthy soup, I recommend this to anyone that needs food every now and then :)<br /><br />As a side note, it's a nice little bonus that each Campbell's soup can has a 5 points "Labels For Education" label which is worth actual money (5 points = 5 cents) to participating schools.

review/summary: Possibly the ultimate potato chip . . .
review/text: When local stores stopped carrying these, all the other neighborhood noshers and I almost starved during the Packers games (the package even has Packers colors!), but even fans of the B**rs and V**ings forget the colors when they take the first bite.<br /><br />Allegedly, olive oil actually helps with blood cholesterol.<br /><br />The main problem is trying to keep from eating the whole bag after the first bite.<br /><br />Tip to Luker and others who complain instead of using an obvious simple solution to their problem:  Open the BOTTOM of the bag (Hint: It's very similar to the top, except on the other end of the bag).  Eat from that end to get rosemary more evenly distributed with every chip.

In fact, we found it difficult to consume one serving size.<br /><br />At first, we were hesitant about purchasing this because often one never knows what they are buying by a limited description alone.  However, we were glad to have assumed the risk with these.<br /><br />The flavor balance includes a perfect amount of salt (not too much), healthy olive oil (non-greasy), and a hint of something special. This simple treat will greatly reward your taste buds, if they are attuned with ours.

review/text: We have ordered cases of the Sea Salt/Olive Oil chips and they have been well liked.  A good balance of crisp, salt, oil flavor and appearance of pale yellow potato like chips. This case of chips was completely un like previous product.  The chips were greasy to feel, oily in appearance, so oily they were transparent and looked like oiled sponges.  I don't know if this was just a bad batch, poor qualilty control or a change from a good product to not good at all.  I will hesitate before re-ordering the chips again.  Such a shame, when most people at least did not feel quite so bac eating what seemed a more healthy chip.  Now they look so saturated with oil that no one would eat them.

review/text: My, is this an interesting product. Officially called olive oil potato chips with cracked pepper and sea salt. I have sometimes had chips that feature sea salt and cracked pepper. An odd combination; pepper does not seem right on a chip! But, oddly enough, it does work.<br /><br />The salt and pepper actually seem to complement one another, each adding its own taste and creating a tasty crunchy treat!<br /><br />If one take a look at the nutritional information, this isn't so bad for one! No trans fat and rather little saturated fat. Cholesterol=0. This is certainly not hesalth food, but--for comfort food--one gets a nice taste and lower levels of the negative nutritional effects that often go with chips.

We went back to get more and could not find them with the regular chips.  I asked a store clerk and he said that what is left would be down 2 isles.  My husband and I purchased all seven bags because the clerk mentioned that it was not one of their regular items.  I'm sure that these seven bags will last us 2 months or more depending on if we have much company coming.  When they are gone we'll be on the hunt for more.  We may have to order on line.

review/text: These Olive Oil Potato Chips with Rosemary were SO GOOD at one time when produced under the name of SOLEA.<br />I bought them frequently, first at Whole Foods then online.  They were large heavy chips that one could easily tell were cooked in Olive Oil<br />with just enough Rosemary on them to give a great distinctive taste. Now they have been RUINED.<br />The chips are smaller, lighter with less Olive Oil and the Rosemary is piled up at the bottom of the bag(instead of on the chips)!<br />Oh, did I mention they are virtually TASTELESS as well?  And I have a box of 12 bags!  UGH!!<br />David<br />Washington, DC

review/summary: Rosemary overpowering
review/text: The taste of rosemary is overpowering, especially in the bottom half of the bag.  Same chips with sea salt are significantly better tasting.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I can't get enough of these.  I have tons of food allergies and these are something I can eat because they are made with olive oil instead of all the other oils I can't eat.  They are light and tasty.  I eat them every day with my lunch.

review/summary: My all-time favorite chips!!
review/text: I am NOT a huge Kettle Chip fan, but I was hooked on these after my first bite!! Hands down - my all-time favorite chip - PERIOD!! The Rosemary does tend to settle to the bottom of the bag, so I simply shake the bag each time I go to eat one, or two, or three...OK, who are we kidding here??.....a few handfuls!! I like to take my time eating these because they are so good, and this 5 oz bag usually lasts me 3-4 days with my casual munchies.<br /><br />My young kids do not like these at all (they have a very strong Rosemary flavor & are definitely GROWN-UP CHIPS), which thrills me to know that this is my very own bag ...and I savor every last chip in there! When you get to the bottom of the bag, you find a huge pile of Rosemary sprigs & a few  little chip crumbs that have marinated in all this rosemary-goodness!! YUMMY!!! You HAVE to try these!! You will never buy another bag of Lays.

review/summary: They MUST be great!
review/text: Our son gets a bag of these chips out of the pantry EVERY time he stops by for a visit. I have to hide some for us. The ingredients are simple. Nothing in them is questionable. The flavor is amazing. It's a great chip.

review/summary: Good but not the best
review/text: They are pretty decent chips but when you get down to the bottom crumbs, just throw it out. They have so much rosemary on them, they're not edible. I will probably buy this brand again, just not this flavor. It's somewhat bland but still not bad. I much prefer the salt and cracked pepper.

review/summary: Great Chips
review/text: These chips are amazing, I first purchased at my local health food store then decided that I wanted a whole case for my family to share. Shipping was prompt, I will definitely purchase again!
