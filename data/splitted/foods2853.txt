review/text: To me, it tastes a lot like a (slightly more vinegary) version of Arby's Sauce.  In fact, I would bet that Arby's Sauce is based on HP Sauce.  It's terrific on french fries.

review/summary: Simply the best!
review/text: I first encountered HP sauce as one of the condiments on the table when I had my first English Breakfast at a B&B in the English Lake District. While I can't swear to it, I'll bet that HP sauce is as common as salt on British dining tables. And well it should, as it is the best choice, in my opinion, to put on any meat that requires a sauce rather than being eaten au natural.<br /><br />The first person to review HP here mentioned that he was expecting something more like A-1 sauce. Well, different strokes for different folks. I am happy indeed that is DOESN'T resemble A1, being more mellow and fuller flavored. There was (and may still be) an HP STEAK Sauce, and that DID (to my disappointment) taste like A-1.<br /><br />Despite it now being owned by Heinz, It is in my experience devilishly hard to find in the usual supermarket. That's why I plan to order some here from Amazon as soon as I finish this.<br /><br />Try it, you may, like me, like it.<br /><br />Rich<br /><br />P.S. Marmite is definitely an acquired taste.

review/summary: Where can I find this stuff again...I really miss it :)
review/text: This is hands down the best hoisin style sweet sauce for Chinese/Asian cuisine! I paid only $1.70 a jar for this from Big Lots about 2 years back, the last time I was able to find it here in Richmond, VA, but since then, I've been completely unable to find this product anywhere, even on Roland's own website/shopping area! I know they still make the stuff, so if anyone finds this anywhere in the US for a reasonable price per case/jar, please post that information to Amazon.com or google.com so those of us looking for this can have some assistance finding it. ALSO...to you Amazon.com administrators out there...if you know of such a distributor, please get this product in stock by the case full...I will personally buy a case of 12 jars of it myself, lol. That's just how good the stuff is. I have my last jar in my bedroom, emptied, washed out/cleaned, and to this day I can STILL open that lid and smell the sauce that was inside, haha. It's just THAT good.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend - Nothing Special
review/text: Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.

review/summary: Fine, But There's Better Out There
review/text: The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for.

It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.

review/text: I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after brewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice).

review/text: My wife likes her coffee really weak and finding that in a K-cup has been a tough job. I like stronger coffees than the Breakfast Blend but I also enjoy this. It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's brewed on). I've been unable to find a "lighter" K-cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a "weaker" K-cup coffee, let me know!

review/text: My wife and I bought the Keurig and started experimenting with coffees.  Most were too strong, but this Breakfast Blend hit it right on the head.  Of course it's a matter of personal taste, but if you don't like your coffee as strong as Starbucks typically is, this is a great coffee.  Love that Keurig!

review/summary: best coffee ever
review/text: I have tried all the k-cups that came with my Keurig at Christmas and by far the best of all for me was the breakfast blend.  Not too strong or weak, JUST RIGHT.  I use the 12oz size for my mug and a little half and half and enjoy!  I was not enjoying the coffees I kept trying so bought some medium roasts at the store but still not satisfied with the taste. By far the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is it for me.

review/text: Having a delicious, hot, instant cup of coffee in the morning is the perfect picker-upper, eye-opener, and motivater to leave those toasty blankets behind.  BUT it took more than just the brewer to do all that.  We received ours for a Christmas gift along with our first pack of coffee and quickly had to order a new supply from you.  Why did the world wait so long for K-Cup Green Mountain Coffee?  We feel like kicking up our heels--at least mentally!  AMAZON, you are s-o-o-o good and up-to-date.

review/text: I love it! I received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying all the different flavors. While I enjoy a flavored coffee, I like my first cup of the day to be just "coffee". I've found the perfect one with Nantcket Blend. It's not too strong, not too weak. And the twin pack is a great value. Haven't found it at the grocery store so I'm very pleased to see it offered at Amazon. While I have a supply of various flavors, Nantucket Blend is my "go to" first thing in the morning. Best way to describe it? Smoooooooth.

review/text: My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.<br /><br />This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).<br /><br />Good choice for your K-cup pantry.

That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter, but it still has good flavor.

review/summary: Not What Expected....
review/text: I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected.

review/text: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, is by far my favorite k-cup coffee!!! I was a die-hard Starbucks girl for years, and now that I live in a town without one-I use my Keurig daily. I don't like strong or dark coffees, so this one is nice and mild for me. I also use fat-free, flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend. I also love getting this shipped to me fast on Amazon. The boxes that I found at Walmart, Kohl's, etc... had less kcups in them. I find that ordering them online via Amazon is a great value!

My room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the Breakfast Blend is terrible.  Green Mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isn't one of them.

My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.

It's not too strong of a coffee, but not too weak of a coffee either, it has a great blend of flavor.  It has a smooth taste and is not to bitter like some coffees tend to be.  Good price on this brand as well.  Overall I would have to say this a keeper for my morning ritual.

review/summary: Perfect medium blend
review/text: Many of the brands I've tried are too bold. I tried several brands and types and this is the one for me.  I am very pleased with it and will continue to order it.

review/summary: Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right
review/text: I found these first at my local supermarket.  I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it.  I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice "coffee" presence you can actually taste.  *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you're *not* into the "make your hair stand on end" type of coffee. This review is based on using the "medium" size on the coffee machine.  You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes.

review/summary: best k-cups
review/text: Have tried many varieties of K cups and green mountain is the best. My favorite blend is breakfast blend. Mild coffee, if you like Dunkin Donuts, you will like this.  If you are a starbucks drinker, try a bolder blend.

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: I love this coffee.  As I get older, my stomach can't seem to take the really strong blends.  Breakfast Blend is perfect.  Great flavor without hurting my stomach.  Amazon has the best price with free shipping.  I only wish I could start an automatic refill of my order.<br /><br />Update 9-1-12<br />Yea!!! This coffee can finally be ordered with an automatic refill.  I am always guaranteed the lowest price and don't have to worry about searching for it.  I am one happy Amazon, coffee lover.

review/summary: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend K-cups
review/text: I buy K-cups all the time and it was nice to buy a double pack for less money than I would have paid in the store. The breakfast blend is not a bold coffee. Being rather mellow and not bitter and with no after taste. If you are looking for a mild tasting coffee this would be a good choice.

review/text: Good cup of coffee. If you are looking for a nice cup to wake up to, this is it. Light blend, no overpowering taste. I prefer bolder blends but my husband likes light - so this was our compromise blend, and I enjoy it as much as he does.

review/summary: Great coffee!
review/text: I love this coffee.  I like light roast, but many of them have little flavor.  Green Mountain Breakfast Blend has a nice smooth, full taste without being harsh.  The flavor of some dark roasts leave me with the impression I could get the same effect by just licking the bottom of a dirty ashtray.  (Sorry, dark-roast lovers - I tend to be overly sensitive to bitterness.)

review/text: You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to accomplish this. However sometimes I feel like something a tad bit lighter for that first cup in the morning. Enter Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. It's exactly what that first cup calls fall. A slightly lighter version of Nantucket Blend, yet it still has the subtle punch you're looking for.

review/summary: Best value for a K-cup coffee
review/text: Green Mountain Breakfast blend coffee is a mild roast that goes down easy in the morning.  My wife actually runs a cup through the Keurig twice.  Buying it this way breaks down to 50 cents per K-cup versus a dollar at any store.

review/summary: Perfection...
review/text: This particular k-cup has become my favorite and I've had just about all of them from every k-cup maker.  I still enjoy many others, but this one is perfection. I love, love, love it! Funny thing is it took me about a year to try it. Something about the packaging made me think it might be horrible. I was dead wrong. It's perfect. If you're a k-cupper, and there are lots of us now; don't let this one pass you by.
