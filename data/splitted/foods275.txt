review/summary: No nitrites?  Look again.
review/text: I try to stay away from buying any meats that contain nitrites and I specifically read carefully through the description of the Wild Ride jerky, and here's a direct quote: "Wild Ride is made with all-natural ingredients with no preservatives, no MSG, and no nitrites."<br /><br />We haven't tasted it yet, so I can't attest to that, but I was very disappointed to read in the ingredients list that it contains: "Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite)."<br /><br />No worries if your not concerned about nitrites, but if you are, just know this product DOES contain nitrites.

review/text: I'm not a Jerky expert or anything like some of the reviews here. But I've had a few different brands, some the national brands and some smaller ones. I'd have to say this is a bit below average. It was slightly spicy but not terribly tasty and the texture wasn't that good. I didn't get the feeling I was eating quality meat.<br /><br />So why 1 star? Easy. Within 48 hours of opening it I was greeted with bluish white mold covering about 5 or 6 pieces. I'm sure by tomorrow it will be more but it's now in the trash. I don't even know how that happens

I noticed that the "beef" did not come from USA per the package. Makes me wonder what kind of "beef" they are shipping in to dry. Is it old and rotten? Is it even beef? Sure doesn't tast like any beef jerkey I'm used to. Yuck.

review/summary: Disgustingly Salty
review/text: I got the hickory smoked version and it's packed with salt. I know jerky tends to have a high salt content, but this is the first time it has ever bothered me while eating it. It's usually an after effect like being thirsty. I really regret buying this and would much rather go back to Jack Link's X stick which are less nutritious and taste more like meat flavored than real meat.<br /><br />Salty taste aside, the pieces are thick and are of medium toughness (i.e., prepare to use some mouth muscles), which are good. Unfortunately, I sometime run into overly chewy pieces.

review/summary: It's great! And I'm beef jerky picky!
review/text: I love my beef jerky and this is the style I like at a great price, especially if subscribed. At $11 for a pound shipped, how can anyone complain? Since preferences differ, I'd class myself as disliking the moist style beef jerky that have become popular in recent years, I would say this is similar jack links, a bit more dehydrated. My favorite used to be a bone dry japanese brand I cant seem to find anymore. It's not quite that dry, and they do tenderize it it in some manner. However, not over processed so you'll some across vein and fat as some reviewer complained of, but it give it a very natural texture. I give it 5 stars although its not perfect in consideration of the absolutely low cost as 4 1/2 isn't an option.

review/summary: Must be your first time trying jerky if you left good review
review/text: Let me say this first:  our family of 6 keeps a high protein, low carb diet, and we eat a lot of jerky each month ( avg 30 lbs).  We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there, and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive, not to mention gleaming review.  Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed, but their packaging used to say "all natural", but NO MORE, because they know it is not.  Now it says " naturally hickory smoked", or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).<br /><br />i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.<br /><br />OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package.

review/summary: Decent taste, cheap meat
review/text: I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.

review/summary: Moldy meat.
review/text: I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.

review/summary: No Better Taste, Worse Nutrition Than Local Brands, Higher Price
review/text: It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz. rather than the 4 oz. in brands available in local groceries.  The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.  But the fat content is 13% compared to a more typical 2% and delivers 35 fat calories per 1 oz serving compared to a typical 5 calories from fat in a 1 oz. serving from the three different brands our local Kroger Grocery carries.  All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.  And there was 520 mg salt compared to 470 from the store brands.<br /><br />Unless this just hits your palate in some incredible way, can't understand why anyone would buy this product.

review/text: My daughter is 13 months old, has been eating these for a few months now and absolutely LOVES them, both flavors. I wish they made more flavors, not that my daughter cares which flavor she gets, she gobbles them both up! If she sees the bag in the cupboard she goes crazy and says more (in sign language) and literally says snack. If given the opportunity she would get the whole bag, lol. I wish I discovered them earlier then I did, I say that the package said toddler so I thought she couldn't have it, but they are just like the yogurt melts to where they are easily chewable, if your child can chew food then these will be just fine, in my opinion.

review/text: I guess I've never had roasted pecans before.  My experience has been whatever is on the shelf at the grocery store, which have been raw.<br /><br />Roasting imparts a distinctly different flavor and texture.  These pecans are kinda dry and brittle (not like raw pecans, which are a little bit oily and chewy).  And I prefer the flavor of raw pecans - the roasting imparts a kinda smokey flavor that doesn't work (for me) with pecans (almonds are a different matter).<br /><br />I have bought other products from Azar - always top quality.  No doubt these pecans would be top-rated by people who prefer roasted pecans.  If that's what you like, buy these nuts!<br /><br />But if you are looking for typical grocery-store raw pecans, look elsewhere.  I didn't think that roasting would matter very much - but it makes a HUGE difference.

While I do sometimes drink coffee with caffeine, or do half-caf, I often drink decaf because I'm hyper enough without it.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that this is an outstanding, full-bodied coffee.  It developed excellent crema (the reddish-brown foam that forms on a proper shot of espresso) and has a wonderful flavor and aroma.  No one would ever suspect that this was a decaffinated coffee if you didn't tell them.<br /><br />The beans were extremely fresh and they didn't overroast the beans, the way that some major chains seem to do.  This is a very nice and satisfying coffee.  I strongly recommend it.

I received some as a gift and was very pleased to find that it is just as good as the Dek.<br /><br />It is absolutely wonderful in a moka pot and french press. A bit lighter in taste than the Dek, but just as smooth and rich, with a hint more sweetness. Very nice aftertaste. The medium roast lets the flavor through without any harshness or burnt taste.<br /><br />I also tried it as espresso and, while it was good, I prefer the Dek. The Grand Filtro was a bit flat as espresso.<br /><br />Can't beat Lavazza Dek for espresso, and Gran Filtro for pretty much any other type of brewing. Highly, highly recommend!

The beans, while smaller than I'm accustomed to using, resulted in a crema which is very good, although coloring is more brown than golden. Overall, this is a flavorful bean, and produced a smooth espresso.<br /><br />BTW, my coffee-snob-barista-son said he really liked these...and that's praise not easily garnered.<br /><br />I'll try another few bags before making a final decision, but would think most espresso lovers will find the Lavazza Gran Filtro bean to be a good choice for most occasions.

review/summary: Very flavorful decaf.
review/text: A surprisingly good decaf with very good flavor. Seems to be a bit darker roast than typical decafs, but it doesn't taste bitter. The price is quite good too, especially since each bag is notably larger than the typical beans you buy at Target or the grocery store.

review/summary: A little bit disappointed
review/text: We bought this coffee as a replacement for Lavazza Supercrema while my wife cannot drink caffeine, and found it of uneven quality. We use it for making espresso in a Saeco Odea Giro, which brews consistently high-quality espresso from the Supercrema beans. However, some of the espressos from this decaf were excellent while other brews had a bit of a weird taste. Whether it's due to the visible inhomogeneity of the beans, I cannot tell. Or maybe this coffee is for what it says: drip coffee. Either way, we'll keep looking for better espresso beans. :-)

review/text: Decafs can be so Blah!  Not Lavazza. I love the aroma and taste of coffee, particularly after a meal. I have tried many products and this one is such a favorite at my home that I signed up for delivery every few months.  There are three bags in each order, so the price is certainly a bargain and the flavor is rich, so no need to use large amounts. The whole beans are our favorite.

review/summary: Excellent Decaf
review/text: I have been experimenting with half normal half Decaf blending for a long time. I was looking to make a blend that basically had everything - Flavor, nose, robustness and smooth taste. After trying 100+ combinations, we found 50% dark roast Hawaiian Kona (from Amazon) and 50% medium roast Lavazza decaf the best. Because it is decaf and medium roast, Lavazza by itself at times might seem a bit flat. This is compensated by dark roast Hawaiian. Both coffees have excellent nose, flavor and smooth taste. A few remaining experiments include Jamaican Blue mountain and Indian Mysore gold nugget.

review/summary: Not as good as reviews make it out to be
review/text: I don't drink decaf, my wife is the one who drinks this coffee. I bought this going off the great reviews from Amazon and the Lavazza name.<br /><br />I would have to say that the coffee is over hyped in terms of a taste/price ratio. When I purchased it, it was approximately 9.4/lb. We all know coffee has gotten more expensive over the last year or so, so I was expecting a medium-good coffee for this price.<br /><br />My wife says it doesn't taste much better than other "lesser" brands of coffee. She actually prefers a local brand that generally doesn't cost more than 7-8/lb.

review/text: I like coffee and I love using my plunger. In Australia there is a version of Lavazza ground decaf coffee in an aqua coloured packet. I was really hoping that this coffee would taste like that one. It doesn't.<br /><br />This coffee is really quite nice and better than most you get in Safeway or Giant. But, it isn't a complex flavor. So, it is good for afternoons but that wonderful "morning coffee" taste that really gets me going isn't there.<br /><br />I was an idiot and didn't realise that this is three bags of coffee beans not pre-ground coffee. Wish i had been more careful as it is a hassle to grind it all the time.

review/summary: Great Product - Horrific Price...!!!
review/text: I have purchased this product for many years in local stores, and love it!  However, I can't seem to find it readily available locally any more, so I decided to purchase this online.  The product itself is great; makes the best guacamole I've ever had, but paying $6.00 for one package is outrageous... and just plain wrong!!!  I made the mistake of purchasing this item 'assuming' that they had just left off the point that this price should be for 12 packages, like what is provided for the Spicy version.  Unfortunately, I found out to my dismay that they did truly charge me $6.00 for just one package when you can buy this in a store for approximately $1.00 per package.  I usually purchase online in the hopes of always finding a 'better' deal, well this is definitely not one!!  Again, this product is great, but look elsewhere to purchase...!!

review/summary: IGNORE MY STAR RATING AS IT RELATES TO THE PRODUCT (WE LOVE THIS STUFF), BUT APPLY IT TO THE PRICE HERE.
review/text: Due to our cooking habits we use a lot of avocados in preparing our meals.  From Mexican food to salads and sandwiches and of course Guacamole Dip, they are an important part of our dietary intake.  The Guacamole dip is a favorite in our household and my wife has at least six different recipes she prepares it with.  We do though use and try out various prepared mixes such as this McCormick brand...which by the way, is one of our favorites. This adds variety and we do love variety! I can tell you right now that if I were grading this product on quality and eating enjoyment I would give it five stars in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am giving this particular one a one star review and if it were possible, I would give it less.  Did you read the price on this thing!  I must tell you that the first reviewer here saved me a bunch of coin and a major temper meltdown.  Thank you Dutch for pointing the price of this product out to me.  I was actually ready to hit the purchase button on this one after I had added it to my shopping cart.  Thank goodness I had second thoughts and went back and read the review.  This product, when we purchase it at or local store cost around one dollar.  This is a somewhat reasonable price.  Did you realize that these folks are selling ONE PACKAGE (ONE OZ) for a total of $6.00!  Either this seller is trying a big time rip off or there has been a major typographical error here.  In either case there is NO WAY I am going to plunk out that much money for this stuff...as good as it is!<br /><br />Anyway, the mix itself is quite good.  We use a lot of McCormick products and have yet to find one we are dissatisfied with.  But the price here is absolutely outrageous to the point of being offensive.<br /><br />End of review but as long as we are talking about saving money.....<br /><br />Did you folks know you can freeze avocados?  Yup, for dip and spreads freezing these things works perfectly.  I am not sure how things are in your part of the country, but here in our little part of the world the price of avocados goes through wild fluctuations.  I have quite often seen them selling for $1.50 apiece!  No there is no way that I am going to pay that much for one of these things.  On the other hand, we often, for one reason or another, find these things relatively dirt cheap.  I just purchased a whole bunch of the things for .32 cents apiece.<br /><br />When we find these on sale like this be buy a great number of them.  We take them home, let them ripen to our taste, wash and dry them and then stick them in freezer bags...usually three our four or our family.  When we want to whip up a batch of dip or spread, we simply take them out of the freeze, let them thaw and we are in business.  After they have been frozen the skins simply slip right off and you can mush them up quite easily.  This dose not work if you like sliced avocados for salads or sandwiches as they are too soft and mushy. On the other hand, it makes great dip and spread.  We cannot tell the difference in the flavor of the frozen ones over the fresh.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/text: I must admit the yellowish color was a little weird at first, but after all it is Butterfinger.  But, the flavor is excellent and it became an instant hit at our house (just put a lid on the cup or you'll have flashbacks of changing baby diapers.)  We buy these machine mixes and add them to hot water dispensed from our Keurig machine.  Much cheaper than going to the mini-marts and buying drinks and we often keep a variety of half a dozen or so at all times.  So far though, this is one of my favorites (right behind the Reeses Peanut Butter Cups which is very hard to find at the moment.)

All this came to mind when I was in my local grocery store with my 3 1/2-year-old son and spotted a display of Cracker Jacks. I wondered if he too would like Cracker Jacks. Well, the answer was yes, as expected. We got the only size bag available, 4.25 ounces, but it's exactly the same Original product as listed here.

I asked what I could do and the diabetic nurse suggested I keep some pure apple juice available.  I found Motts to be a reliable brand.<br /><br />Motts Apple Juice suggests  8 ounces as a serving.  The nurse suggested that 4 Ounces should be my first dose.  Four ounces of apple juice has 15 grams of carbs and 13 grams of natural sugar.  I discovered that the 4 oz.  serving reliably raises my blood sugar 25 points, which is usually enough to reach  the rescue goal of 75 bg (mg/dl).<br /><br />I have concluded that apple juice is a natural healthy beverage for most humans.  Motts is tasty and not very acidic.  The 4oz. Serving is a natural "pick me up" available for everyone.  I am very happy with this product.

review/summary: Sukhi's makes the best pre-made indian sauces!
review/text: Sukhi's sauces are amazingly good.  Seriously, the BEST quick indian food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  My in-laws are from Kerala, and I wouldn't be embarrassed to cook them a meal using these sauces (and then hide the evidence, of course!  what?  me use a pre-made sauce?? never!)  Everything I've ever tried, from the vindaloo to the masala to the spice mixes for potatoes, etc, have been wonderful, and you can switch up the meat (I usually use chicken breast, but sometimes use lamb or pork instead, and sometimes just veggies).  Last night was the first time my husband and I had tried the korma, and it might be our favorite now.  It's got a bit of a kick to it, which is unfortunately rare in most americanized indian sauces.  I added skim milk instead of cream, and it still came out great.  I usually saute onions first (but not always - if I'm in a hurry, they get left out), then brown about a pound of meat, next the sauce packet and milk, and then add a a couple of boiled potatoes (cubed) and half a can of peas.  I then simmer until the potatoes have absorbed the flavor.  Each packet is for about a pound of meat or veggies, but I've used one packet for a pound of meat plus about half a pound of veggies and it was fine - very strong, concentrated sauce.  Last night I used 2 packets because I used about a pound and 1/2 of chicken breast, 2 large potatoes, and peas, and the meal lasts for about 3 night for the two of us. It makes for a easy, fast meal, and goes great with rice or naan.  If you live near a specialty grocery store, you might check to see if they carry the frozen sukhi's meals, too.  The samosas are especially delicious, and my husband and I practically live off the frozen naanwiches during the weekends!

review/summary: They Took the wHore Out
review/text: Buyers of a certain age who are looking for old-fashioned horehound candy will be sorely disappointed in these bland lozenges which have no real flavor at all.<br /><br />The horehound root has an alkaloid which numbs the nerve endings, and that made horehound drops or candy useful when one was afflicted with a sore throat. As kids, we'd buy it in large squares, and it would numb one's mouth like novocaine. (It was likely the first dope I took.)<br /><br />Now that I have a sore throat, I'd like relief from real horehound candy, but these lozenges apparently contain no horehound extract whatsoever. Instead of horehound, they should be sold as the favorite flavor of Ned Flanders -- "plain."

review/text: I recently purchased a giant bag of these at Costco after they had samples out to try. I was blown away at how good they were and bought two bags. I don't live close to Costco and now wish I bought more when I was up there. You have to try these chips they are so good. They are not too salty and they are very crispy. They are a little corny as well as a little grainy and naturally slightly sweet. Very best chips I've had, great with guacamole and hummus or just plain. They are worth my 3 hour drive to Costco!!!

review/summary: Great taste but complete rip-off from supplier
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012LAFG0">Multigrain Tortilla Chips</a>I have never posted a review before but this was such an outrageous rip-off that I felt it was important.  This is without doubt the most delicious chip I've ever eaten.  However, I thought there would be more than one bag in the box. Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered one bag of chips for $9.95.  I chose this supplier because it was available on Prime through Amazon.  It would have been much cheaper for me to have purchased this from the Food Should Taste Good site or if I had purchased it at the store.  I don't know who the supplier is but this is a complete rip.  Buyer beware!  Amazon - take this off your site!  I am not happy.

review/summary: Best Chips Ever Made!
review/text: These are the best chips I have ever tasted.  I usually don't eat chips because they're gawd-awful in every way (taste, oils, artificial stuff, salt, etc.).  From Doritos to all the "healthy" chips I've tried all thru my life, nothing really caught my attention.  I usually could never finish a bag of chips.  I've been a vegetarian for 20 yrs, vegan for the last 5 and RAW/Fruitarian for the last 3 months, so I had given up processed/cooked foods for quite a while now (w/ no regrets).  However, the other day, my mom got me to try these stating they couldn't be too unhealthy when they're chalk full of Flax, Sunflower, Sesame, Brown Rice, Quinoa & Soy!  Now, I'm a RAW/Fruitarian, w/ the exception of these--they're my secret sin.

Nothing was mentioned in the writeup, so I called Amazon Customer Service and they said that, as far as they could tell, it's $9.95 for a single bag.<br />I like the chips, but that's a bit pricey. I'm wondering if it's an error by the 'Food Should Taste Good' folks.....

It maintains the consistency I like once milk goes on--not too crisp but not soggy either.  I have no complaints at all.  It's less expensive in my local supermarket by a couple bucks and I'm totally satisfied.  I plan to try the other Mom's Best now.

review/summary: Brought back memories of sunny Spain1
review/text: Having lived in Spain for almost six years, I know the importance of Saffron being kept in a glass jar. Having depleted the supply I'd brought back with me; I decided this product would be a suitable replacement. The moment I opened the shipping box, I could smell the Saffron! I knew I had something spectacular, but held off using it till I cooked a dish of Paella for a group of friends. The spice did just I felt it would, and more, imparting the lovely golden tint I love, and giving my dish a smokey taste. The mortar and pestle were perfectly sized, and I showed one friend how to use it; she was amazed! My friends had never had anything with fresh Saffron in it before, and were blown away by how wonderful it was. I will be ordering this again!

review/summary: Back to Nature Crispy Wheat Crackers - 8 oz.
review/text: These crackers are made by Back to Nature Foods located in Madison, WI--made in the USA! I give these crackers 4/5 for flavor, 5/5 for texture, 5/5 for maintaining Earth conscious integrity, 0/5 for truth in labeling--score 3.5<br /><br />The carton is made of 100% recycled paperboard and the ink is derived from vegetables. The company supports the Nature Conservancy (Protecting nature, preserving life).<br /><br />These are crispy wheat crackers with a sweet and mild flavor.  These are super crispy crackers that will hold up to any dip or topping.<br /><br />The sweetness adds just enough flavor to make your toppings pop.  I personally serve them with fish dips (salmon) and cheese toppings--yummy!<br /><br />The crackers are made of unbleached enriched flour and contain wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid, safflower oil, raw sugar, defatted wheat germ, cornstarch, brown rice syrup, sea salt, malted barley extract, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), natural turmeric flavor.<br /><br />The 8 oz package contain 8 servings--17 crackers.  Each serving contains 130 cal., 4 g fat, .5 g polyunsaturated fat, 2.5 g monounsaturated fat, 230 mg sodium, 55 mg potassium, 22 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 4 g sugars, 2 g protein.<br /><br />The package states that the crackers contain no artificial perservatives or flavors and no hydrogenated oils.  However, the product does contain Thiamine mononitrate which is a 'synthetic form' of vitamine B1, and medical and nutrition experts recommend a daily potassium intake of 4.7 g per/day.<br /><br />Don't forget to recycle the box!

review/text: My 14 month daughter loves these, she's been eating them since around 10 mos old.  Because 1/3 of the bag is a full fruit AND veggie serving, I sometimes give them to her along with her main dish at lunch time.  They're also great for snack time and it's good to know that they are healthy and count towards her daily fruit & veggie servings, when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available.  I also love that both flavors of these fruit & veggie melts are a completely mess free snack, which is always a plus. :)

review/summary: These are a favorite
review/text: Out of all the snacks out there and all the ones my daughter has tried, these are her all time favorite.  Even if she's full, even if she won't eat anything else, she will never say no to these.<br /><br />They smell great, although admittedly I've never tried them to see what they taste like.  They melt very easily in her mouth, don't crumble or leave a mess.  They're also just the perfect bite size for my 14 month old.<br /><br />I prefer the tropic version over the berry version because it's colorless.  The berry version, once wet, can stain chairs/clothes.  It comes out but now you have to spend your night cleaning the stains out.  A few time my daughter ended up sitting on them after dropping them and the colored stained her stroller.  And once she somehow managed to get her water on them, perhaps it dripped, and that was a huge mess.  So I learned to stick with the tropical, and she doesn't mind.<br /><br />The price here is much higher than the grocery store though.  I usually get them for 2.99 a pack and there's quite a few in the package.

He was a picky eater to begin with and was starting to get alarmingly thin because he won't eat his kibble. I tried topping it with different things like plain yogurt and nothing. He still won't eat his kibble. I decided to try the raw medallions and he eats with so much gusto! Also he has gained some weight (a great thing) and looks so much healthier now. His coat is looking better and better everyday. Also his poop is so much smaller. I noticed that the goop from his eyes is slowly disappearing. It is pricier than kibble, but for a tiny dog, it really is not that much. It is way worth the price. Will recommend to anyone who will listen.

Lots of hazelnut coffees have unpleasant notes or aftertastes-- this coffee is just rich, smooth, and perfect.<br /><br />I've been in crisis because stores in my area have stopped stocking it. Thank goodness you can get it on Amazon!

review/summary: Very Good Hazelnut
review/text: Price was right and the taste very good.  We were buying Harmony Bay but this was a better deal, and actually has a little more flavor.

review/summary: Real Deal Tonkatsu Flavor
review/text: This sauce gives you authentic tonkatsu flavor - and six bottles of it! The bottle tops are cleverly designed to allow pouring or precise squeezing of the precious sauce.

review/summary: SO GOOD!
review/text: This sauce is so good! Ordered it and it arrived 6 days later intact and not a one missing (plus the delivery guy was cute, XD ROTFL.). This sauce tastes good on anything fried, and really scrumdiddliumptious on pizza. Definitely worth the bucks. I give it a Bajillion out of 10, only because it's that good (the delivery guy was CUTE.)

review/summary: Have you seen how much Ranch 99 is trying to charge!!
review/text: I bought this 6 pack because for the price that my local Ranch 99 was trying to charge, I could buy 3 through Amazon.  Product is identical and managed to save tons of money on sauce I use on everything.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: We use it on fish sticks, chicken, burgers, meatloaf, rice, etc.  It's similar to country bob sauce, but a little sweeter.

review/summary: There are better gluten-free breads...
review/text: This bread is very dry and crumbly compared to the other major brand. Will definitely not be switching from my usual brand (without the 'R').

review/summary: Good value, not as flavorful as some
review/text: We always drink the vanilla flavored coffee so I've gotten to know quite a few brands.  This one is good, but not the best (that's why I rated it 4 stars).

review/summary: Vanilla Nut, Organic Whole Bean Coffee
review/text: I like the flavor, but it is very weak for me. I am not really a person who likes really strong coffee, but this is just very weak coffee.
