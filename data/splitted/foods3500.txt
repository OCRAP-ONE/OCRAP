review/text: This is an excellent product.  I'm ordering for the 2nd time through Amazon.  I did pass along a comment previously that the bags need to be better sealed because 6 of the 10 bags had broken and popcorn had spilled inside the shipping box. It's unfortunate that I have to order online.  For all the local choices of popcorn, every brand I have tried just does not compare to Wise.  Keep up the good work.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JDFBKW">Wise Whole Grain Original Butter Popcorn 7.5 oz</a>

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've only had the Vanilla flavor so I can't comment on others but this product tastes great - especially with tea.  It's a subtle flavor that doesn't take away the flavor of the drink added to it.  It's definitely a bit pricey but I think it works better for digestion than any of the popular fiber promising citrus powdered drinks whose contents always seem questionable to me.

review/summary: Good Peanuts, but...
review/text: Both good and bad for these peanuts. Product is described aa extra large redskin peanuts.<br />the Good:  peanuts are extra large,roasted and salted excellently.  Taste is also  excellent.<br />The Bad:  mostly peanut halves, not whole peanuts.  Maybe one in six is whole. Of the whole peanuts, maybe one in six has the skin on. What you get (I have eaten 3 cans) are mostly peanut halves in a swirling cloud of skin fragments.<br />Bottom Line: Taste great but not what I paid for, i.e., whole redskin peanuts.  Will not repurchase.

review/text: I was expecting all the peanuts to have skins on them, but some of the skins have flaked off and are "in the can".  Nevertheless, these are seriously good peanuts and the only brand I've found that are not cooked in genetically modified cotton seed oil!  Worth every penny, for sure.<br /><br />I add extra sea salt to them but they are probably plenty salty enough for normal taste buds.

review/summary: Best Dog Toy/Chewy/Snack EVER!!
review/text: My dog has never been willing to play with toys, or chew on things he couldn't just eat (i.e. food items that he is given. That is, until we lucked out and found the Kong Busy Buddy (large). He loves the darn thing. His face lights up, his tail starts wagging, he opens his mouth wide, grabs his offered Busy Buddy, and goes to town. It's some work to get to the treats and he seems to enjoy working the bone as much as eating the treat. We have actually bought several of these - for two reasons - one for when we travel, and one home, one for vacation. It is expensive, I'll admit, but for the delight it brings him, I'd have to say it is well worth it. Don't expect it to last very long (not the treats - which are gone pretty fast regardless, but the Busy Bone itself - if your dog has a strong jaw, it will eventually start showing serious wear, and the bristle may start wearing off). You can control that by keeping an eye on your dog and removing the Busy Buddy when the treat is gone and he's just chewing on it, but frankly, I don't have the heart. I'm happy to let him have his way with his Busy Buddy, and replace it once in a while. Bet your dog loves it too!

review/text: These 44 ounces of Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are perhaps the finest thing I could have bought with the eleven dollars and fifty-two cents that I spent on them.  They taste just like the classic, not-Easter themed Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures, but their festive blue-and-pink wrappers are so pretty.  Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are definitely my favorite way to celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: These are good! Each roll is only 45 calories with 2g of sugars. They are similar in consistency to a rice cake, but slightly firmer due to the rice syrup. I think they taste sweeter than the 2g of sugars they contain, but not so sweet that you'd consider them candy or junk. They come packaged 8 rolls to a box. Because they're not individually wrapped, they can stick to one another in the package (although not to the extent that they're destroyed). Also, because there is no wrapper, although they are a decent snack for kids, they tend to leave little hands sticky. This order was for a dozen boxes. These are certainly good enough to order more than once, but I imagine it will take some time to get through the initial order. A 6-box option might be better.

I haven't really noticed any dramatic difference but my skin does feel smooth when I wash off the honey.<br />And it tastes really great.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed when I read what it said on the package. Its 50% manuka honey and 50% rewarewa honey. Now I don't know what rewarewa honey is but if the title is going to say 100% pure, shouldn't it be 100% manuka honey? I am not an expert but i think it should say that somewhere in the description.<br /><br />Overall, I would not buy this again.

review/text: I had the opportunity to go tea tasting (similar to wine tasting) and try many different varieties of tea and discovered Oolong to be my absolute favorite tea.  I tried Twining's Oolong slightly skeptical since it is not loose tea.  As it turns out this was a wonderful tea.  I buy several boxes at once so I can enjoy at work, home etc.<br /><br />The flavor and texture are velvet smooth, slightly sweet (even without sugar) and rich.  It is definitely not a thin or watery tea like many other teas can be.  This tea creates a sense of peace for me as I drink it.  I especially love to drink this tea on my deck looking out over my wooded back yard.

review/summary: Twinings Chinese Oolong Tea - hmm...
review/text: I thought I'd give Twinings Chinese Oolong Tea a try based on other reviewers feedback here on Amazon.  I did not enjoy the flavor of this tea and maybe it's due to my like of simple/common oolong teas versus the fancy-grades which seem too complex for me.  The description on the box labels it as a "sweet and delicate tea with reddish colour"... but personally, I have to disagree with that description.  It was more of a perfumed sweetness with a hint of bitter aftertaste, not delicate at all.  Everyone has different tastes and most likely I'm the odd one in the bunch.  I prefer a loose-leaf oolong tea and still trying to find my favorite.  For oolong in a tea bag, my current choices are Bigelow Chinese Oolong and Foojoy Wuyi Oolong Tea.

review/summary: Terrible Oolong
review/text: I have previously had inexpensive Oolongs served at Chinese resturants and the Bigelow brand tea.  This tee is much different, and in my opinion, much worse.  The teas I've had previously carried a much stronger and longer flavor.  The Twinings tea has a very weak taste with a short, lackluster aftertaste, regardless of the steeping time.  It should also be noted that the contents of the tea bag may only be described as "dust", even more so than the average inexpensive, grocery-store teas.  In fact, it tastes almost exactly as Bigelow brand teas do upon their second steeping.  I wouldn't dare attempt to twice steep this Twinings tea.  This latter point and the "weak" taste give me the suspicion that this tea contains primarily green elements, rather than black elements -- those new to Oolong with a taste for black teas or whom already enjoy a strong Oolong should avoid this tea.

review/text: This tea is my all time favorite.<br /><br />Here's a tip... try it with a little local honey. Local honeys have more flavor and taste better than store bought honey.<br /><br />Also, with honey, keep in mind that the lighter in color it is, the sweeter it will usually be. The darker honeys have a stronger more bitter taste. So buy your honey to your tastes. Farmer's markets usually have a few to choose from and often let you sample before you buy!

review/summary: Oolong Tea is wonderful
review/text: Bought this tea after reading about the benfits of controling weight.  I drink alot of coffee and also wanted to find something that I can subsitute.  This tea taste great and all have said no aftertaste as some teas do.  Have been recommending it to others. It's very light and just use a little splenda...I feel milk would make it too weak.

review/summary: Oo-long or Oo-short
review/text: I usually do not bother to write any reviews as I think there are enough reviews already that one more makes little difference. Not in this case. I do not know what the people who wrote about this tea before me drunk or smoked (e.g. Kasia S., et al). I wasted hard earned $16 on something that even does not taste like a regular cheap washed out tea bags one can buy at any no-frills grocery store. If you never had a real Oolong Tea (like Pete's Phoenix Mountain Oolong) you may be fooled into believing that Oolong Tea tastes like this product. I think it sucks big time and I think potential victims should know the truth about it. This is how I use reviews for other products on Amazon to get an honest assessment of something I am thinking of buying. I am giving away all 5 boxes of this tea to people I do not know as shipping it back would waste additional time I do not want to donate.

review/summary: No redeeming qualities at all
review/text: I just don't understand the love for this tea.  I love almost all of Twinnings teas (except for Darjeeling, but that's a separate review).  In fact, Twinnings is my favorite brand of hot tea - and I drink hot tea several times a day - so I am guessing I must not like Oolong tea.  I had high hopes for this Oolong tea - the description on the box was most inviting.<br /><br />My first hurdle in trying to drink this tea (after steeping a few minutes in my tea cup) was the smell.  Oh, and what a smell it is - like freshly turned earth with a sour note - difficult to describe, but nauseating nonetheless.  And if I thought the smell was bad, the taste was even worse (and I didn't think that was possible).  Oh, how to describe - like muddy water with sharp grassy notes - at least to me.  My husband laughed when he saw me sip this the first time - he said the look on my face was the same expression I had when I would change our son's diaper after he left a particularly large gift to clean up.<br /><br />So, I think I will just stick with my beloved Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey, and English afternoon teas by Twinnings.  From reading the reviews, it looks like my lack of love for this tea will not be a problem.

review/text: I was looking for a selection of k-cups but having commitment issues. I just couldn't bring myself to commit to buy 24 cups of Vanilla Creme or Toffee or a certain decaf blend, without actually knowing what it tasted like. And the pre-packaged mixed selections already had half the flavors I wasn't interested in. This is an ingenious idea! I just ordered a wide selection of exactly what I wanted to taste. Ordered it Saturday, the seller emailed me back within two hours of receiving my order email, and mailed it out Monday morning. Package received Wednesday. Great service, all the flavors I want to try. Can't recommend this enough to folks!

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I've tried many gourmet brands and realized the coffee in the office I work at was great. I asked them what brand and they said Farmer Brothers Medium Roast. I rememberd many coffee shops in California had Farmer Brothers. You can't buy this brand in stores. I happen to find it on Amazon and bought a 5 lb bag. I like to brew it slightly strong and the flavor is not bitter just better. I mailed baggies full to 3 friends I like it so much.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about the price. Try buying specialty bean coffee in the stores, 13oz for from 8 to 10 dollars so the price is comparable, maybe slightly less.<br /><br />There's a confusion in the labeling online. It says Arabica but it's actually Medium Roast.<br /><br />Once you open the bag keep it in the frig.

Hadn't had it anymore in yrs., till a few mos. back, when I ordered a bag off amazon. Something has changed in the taste..it's not near as good as when I 1st tried it. I remember the taste very well, and it was uniquely different than any other coffee I'd tried. Disappointed.., but still fairly good.

Ordered these thru Amazon... same brand and everything. A little more expensive than buying them in Hawaii but the price I pay for not buying more while I was there. The nuts were delivered within 4 or 5 days after I ordered them and they were as fresh and tasty as the ones I bought in Hawaii. Will order again if Amazon offers the same deal I got when I ordered them the 1st time.

I would always leave disappointed if the local markets were sold out.

review/text: This crunchy version of Sunbutter is so very delicious.  It really does taste like peanut butter too.  Amazon has it priced way too high though.  I get it in the health food section at my local Kroger store for over $1 cheaper per jar and I don't have to buy more than one jar at a time.  Amazon makes you buy 6 jars at a time AND charges significantly more per jar.<br /><br />Quick tip, the ladies at my local health food store told me to store this upside down so that the oil would be absorbed back into the sunflower butter rather than separate and sit on top.  I have found that this method works pretty well but you will need to do some stirring.  This seed butter is soft though, not stiff like natural peanut butter and stirs fairly easily so no worries.

review/text: As with many people who purchase this product, my daughter has a severe peanut food allergy.  As a person who practically lived on peanut butter through my childhood-and as an adult who used to eat peanut butter for breakfast on toast with sliced banana-this product is a perfect substitute!  I can honestly say that I prefer this product to peanut butter.  I like Almond butter, but Sunbutter is better.  Actually, I like the Sunbutter with seeds or flaxseed in it because the creamy is a little too sweet for me. What I like about this product better than almond butter is that you don't kill yourself stirring it.  It stirs easily, then when you put it in the refrigerator, it stays stirred and firm.  It's easy to spread too.  I'm going to try making some Sunbutter cookies with the Allergy Food Mama's recipe (check out her cookbook!). I had to purchase this on Amazon because my local supermarkets quit carrying it (even after I repeatedly requested it!). I could find it only at Target where I was paying $8 per jar.  Ridiculous.  I just get it here now.  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Peanut butter substitute
review/text: For all of you who think that because you're allergic to peanuts you're at a loss when it comes to a bread spread; things are looking up. SunButter Natural Crunch Sunflower Seed Spread is available through your convenient Amazon.com website. This spread is even more delicious than a peanut butter spread. I've had both; and, since my allergy to peanuts I've been looking for a substitute for the peanut butter spread. Not only have I found it, but, if you buy it through Amazon with the Subscribe & Save Plan, you will save a great deal of money. The retail stores are charging so much for this product that I would have to use it sparingly. Since I discovered the SunButter on Amazon I now get it delivered regularly; and, can use as much as I wish. Wishing you all much enjoyment in "spreading" that bread.

review/text: I love peanut butter but occasionally have allergic reactions after eating it so, I avoid it when possible.  I first purchased "SunButter" after seeing it on QVC and BOY, was it wonderful!! I purchased it several times through QVC until they quit carrying it.  Fortunately I was able to purchase it again, through Amazon.  The pleasant, smooth, nutty flavor will keep me coming back for more!!!

review/summary: Sunbutter - Best choice for those w/Nut allergies!
review/text: The first time I purchased Sunbutter was in the Organic section of my supermarket, it's quite difficult to find in most stores, so being able to purchase it online is a huge plus. I use it very frequently as I'm allergic to peanuts and this is by far the BEST peanut-butter alternative in existence I feel. Highly recommend!

review/text: It's a pleasure to be able to mimic a crunchy peanut butter sandwich again,<br />without the annoying food allergies often associated with it.<br />I am intolerant to peanut butter and to wheat bread, due to migraine headaches.<br />I am able to enjoy SunButter Sunflower Seed Spread on gluten free bread.<br />I love the creamy consistency and the undeniable crunch from so many sunflower seeds. The texture is neither too dry, nor too oily; it is in fact perfect eaten as is; fresh out of the jar with a spoon!<br />I may be 50, but the little kid in me adores the fresh, excellent taste.

review/summary: flavor and crunch
review/text: My family turned to SunButter because a couple of us can't tolerate peanut butter.  The SunButter was meant to be a PB substitute, but now we use it because we simply prefer it to peanut butter.  The Natural Crunch and the yellow lid versions are our favorites.  As a bonus, we have found that we can substitute SunButter for PB in recipes.  The manufacturer also publishes a small book with recipes for yummy baked goods.

review/summary: Way better than peanut butter
review/text: The flavor of sunbutter is toasty, buttery and something like peanut butter but twice as good. Sunflower seeds are nutritionally superior to peanuts, but Sunbutter works anywhere peanut butter does. Including making great cookies and Thai peanut sauces.<br /><br />I buy it by the case, because everyone in my family loves it. If you're allergic to peanuts, or just looking for a better nut butter at a reasonable price, I recommend this. It does come, by the way, in an organic version, but I like this crunchy version the best.

review/text: This is the most versatile item in my refrigerator.  I've used it in smoothies, in tea, in cocktails, in marinades, in just about everything.  It is so much easier to use than fresh ginger, since you don't have to worry about the ginger fibers settling to the bottom.  One of my favorite uses is to combine it with club soda and agave syrup- such a wonderful ginger ale!  I like to make it more ginger-y, less sweet.

In a cocktail shaker, add lots of ice and ingredients<br />doubling etc as necessary for the number of drinks you wish to make) shake<br />well and strain into a chilled martini glass with a piece of crystallized<br />ginger on a decorative toothpick. This is the perfect cocktail to serve with<br />Asian fare or at the holidays:-) Susan Van Luchene

review/summary: My sensitive APBT loves this
review/text: I have a rescued American Pitbull terrier. She seemed to have a sensitive stomach and it also showed in her eyes and skin. She was on Science Diet when I first adopted her and a friend of mine who also has an APBT was telling me her dog had a beef allergy and that her vet told her that this was an issue in some ABPT. That is how she found Fromm. She made the switch and her dog looks great.<br /><br />I had never ordered dog food online before but I was willing to try anything to help my sweet furry pal out.<br /><br />I am glad I did.<br /><br />I was going to slowly introduce this to her diet. Wean her off Science diet and switch her on Fromm.<br /><br />She wanted none of that. She LOVES the Wisconsin duck and sweet potato. The day I opened the bag she wanted to eat from it and would not go near the Science Diet. (I don't recommend a cold switch but her actions really did show loud). Not only did she not have any noticeable upset from the sudden change in diet. She started to perk up in a way. I had not seen before. Her skin issues started to go away. Her eyes cleared up. And, she enjoys meal time.<br /><br />The other thing I like about Fromm is they are an American Company that makes all of their Pet food in America. Nothing is made outside of the USA.  This wasn't always the case, from what I understand, with the canned food. I hear this changed after the pet food scare with food made in China. The Company decided to make all of its food in America. That says a lot. And, to me means a lot.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to all dog lovers.<br /><br />Good ingredients = healthy food = happy dog.<br /><br />All in all a great experience for my dog and for me. Delivery was prompt. The price is fair compared to other sites that offer this brand. Packaging was good.<br /><br />Please be careful when opening the packaging if you are using a knife or a box cutter. You might cut the bag when opening the box. I learned that the hard way.... Dog food everywhere.<br /><br />EEKS!<br /><br />Thank you for reading. :)

review/text: My 24 pound sheltie mix likes this food - can't tell you why. He'll eat it happily and he's a pretty picky eater. The kibble size is pretty small and is easier for him to eat than larger kibble. The dog is also the picture of health, although I can't make any claims about that resulting from his diet. So at least one picky dog likes it, it seems to keep him healthy, and the kibble size is okay for smaller animals. What else can you say - it's dog food.

review/summary: works great if used correctly
review/text: I don't usually write reviews but I think there is some information about this product that will be helpful.  I had a terrible yellow jacket problem and could not eat in my backyard at all.  I researched yellow jackets a lot on the internet and found that different species are attracted to different kinds of bait and that the key to yellow jacket control is to attract the queen before she sets up a nest in the spring. Once she lays eggs, she produces so many yellow jackets that it is practically impossible to stop them all. The queen yellow jackets where I live in northern California are attracted to protein baits, not sweet baits, and the queens leave hibernation in about March of each year to start their new nests. This product is the only one I found that uses a protein bait which is why I love it. I can put it out in March, catch the queen and no yellow jackets  come summer.  You can make your own protein bait with tuna etc but it will rot in a few days and yellow jackets do not like rotting protein so you have to keep replacing it. That does not happen with this bait.<br /><br />If you have a different kind of yellow jacket, this product may not work for you.<br /><br />As to the top falling off, it is not a screw on top. You have to push the top on until it clicks. I agree that it is not sturdy and I use a new one each year.<br /><br />Bottom line: know the kind of yellow jackets where you live. If you need a protein bait and don't want to mess with a trap every few days, this is the product for you. Put it out at the time of year when queens are swarming and looking for a new nest.

review/summary: I've used these and every other kind...
review/text: And they are ONLY as good as the season you're trying to use them in. If you do your research about the feeding habits of wasps/hornets and stinging things, you will see that they are attracted to sugary things early in the year, and you should set this kind of trap out early. Like before you even SEE the first flying terror early. Before you're thinking about "I need to get rid of these things" you must be getting rid of them! If you wait until May, you're WAY too late in most places. You really need to catch queens to reduce local populations and that happens as soon as the ground starts to warm. Think NOW (I'm in VA. It's February). As the year progresses, they like protein to prepare for over-wintering. It's also the same time they tend to get more aggressive. So you put some tuna or raw meat in small quantities in your traps instead. I also get a TON of bees and wasps around my pool which is also salt water and a great spot for thirsty bugs of all kinds it seems- never mind that I border a forested preserve. What doesn't nest in my yard has free rein right behind my pool! I use a combination of traps on my fence line and those cheesy looking fake wasp nests that you can hang from soffits (wasps are territorial and avoid other wasp's nests). My traps are going out this week, it's been unseasonably warm. The ground is warm and once I even consider putting veggie seeds in the garden, it's time for bee/wasp/hornet control too. The fake nest things go out a little later in the spring. It's a combination that has worked well. Yes, Flies and misc flying things are also attracted. It's sugar in most traps. What do you expect?<br /><br />Something else to consider... there are many kinds of bees and hornets. Some look very much alike. Honey bees and yellow jackets, esp when the bees are small can look very much alike. We NEED honey bees. You really don't want to get rid of your good bees and you can encourage what you like, and discourage what you don't. Poisoning the good things just leaves more space for the bad things to eat and breed. Before I kill anything I'm sure I've got a hornet, and having some wasps around isn't a bad thing either. They predate nuisance flies and other things I also don't want around. If you kill all the wasps, before you know it you're overloaded with flies! So the enemy of my enemy is indeed my friend. If I was deathly allergic I'm sure I'd feel differently, but if you're not give a thought to what you're doing and when.

review/summary: Use this trap and the bait recipe below to slaughter 'em!
review/text: I am deathly allergic to jackets, wasps, hornets, etc, so I've been searching for as many ways to control as possible, since I live in the "sticks".  While I haven't caught any wasps, I catch between 5-10 yellow jackets and/or hornets per trap per day ... THE KEY IS THE BAIT: DON'T USE THE ONE THAT COMES WITH THE TRAPS ... INSTEAD, FILL ALMOST TO THE LINE WITH MOUNTAIN DEW, THEN ADD 3-4 CAPFULS OF APPLE CIDER VINEGAR ... this trap was average at best until i read about this bait-mix on line.  They can't resist.<br /><br />You do catch a lot of flies too, and other random insects, but day in and day out, you'll catch whatever jackets/hornets come around.  I have to change them once every 3 days b/c they fill up so much that the insects can actually use the dead ones as life-rafts and, obviously, that delays the dying thing.<br /><br />Best natural trap (or maybe it's just the bait recipe?) I've ever tried, and we've tried a bunch.

We love that they are disposable but DOUBLE BAG it first or your trash can will reak. Even when they catch bees, traps do smell badly. So we expected this.

Of course, I purchased only one thus kicking myself!<br /><br />This salt is fantastic!<br /><br />Regular iodized salt that we are used to is mild and somewhat bitter. This salt is completely different! Large salt crystals (similar to the Kosher pickling salt size) are perfect for meats, stews and bagels; by putting this in a salt grinder makes this suitable for all other uses.<br /><br />Note: the taste is very salty, strong and finishes slightly sweet.<br /><br />It does not take much of this salt to flavor the dishes so only use about 2/3rds of what you would use regular salt in your recipes.
