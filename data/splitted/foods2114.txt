review/summary: nasty
review/text: I am from Jamaica, and I had coconuts straight from the trees and this does not taste natural at all, as a matter of fact this is the worst tasting coconut water I have ever tasted.  I was very disappointed, Zico does not come close. I have to give VITA COCO FIVE STAR and this None.

review/summary: Pretty good.
review/text: I had coconut water when I was in the Philippines & loved it.  So, I ordered this when I got home since I enjoyed it so much.  Zico coconut water is pretty good, but not as good as the fresh coconut water I had previously, so I was slightly disappointed.

review/summary: Favorite flavored coconut water
review/text: I have tried SO MANY coconut waters, most range from good to absolutely undrinkable (I am looking at you Vitacoco with Tropical fruit >:P ).  This Zico with Passion Fruit is my favorite and seriously helped my through some HORRENDOUS morning sickness.  It tastes fresh and crisp with no off flavors or aftertaste.  I would put the 11 ounces on ice with a bit of chilled water in a huge cup and sip it all day, adding more water as the day went on until I was just drinking water.  If I tried drinking plain water I would retch immediately so this was a great help.  Also nice to get some electrolytes to help with dehydration.

review/text: I've been drinking ZICO brand coconut water after yoga for a few years.  My favorite flavor disappeared after ZICO sold out to Big Business, and my next favorite flavor since the sell out never seems to be available.  So I tried pineapple because it was available and I like another brand of coconut water with pineapple, but ZICO definitely did not nail this flavor!  I will choke down the rest of the nasty pineapple case and switch to something else...have lost faith in ZICO since they sold out.

review/text: Knowing well that my wife and I have taken to this refreshing drink, our son regularly<br />  sends us (through amazon.com) Zico- pure premium coconut water (natural). It is a very<br />  convenient and economic way to order and receive the product at our doorsteps.  My<br />  wife especially likes the drink and enjoys it almost daily.<br /><br />  The taste is not quite the same as that of fresh coconut water, but it comes pretty close.<br />  If one feels really thirsty or dehydrated and looks for something other than plain water,<br />  this product could be very satisfying.

review/summary: Hydrates better than sports drinks AND tastes better!
review/text: Many popular sports drinks have a lot of sodium and glucose as well as other electrolytes and stuff. Their flavoring frequently is nasty.<br /><br />ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).<br /><br />After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks.

review/text: I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.<br /><br />However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me.

review/text: Like many of the other reviews, I have tried coconut water and hated the taste. I do love chocolate and had a free sample of this and was hooked. Since these sell in NY for about $3 a bottle I decided to buy the cases. As soon as I saw that amazon only had a few left I bought 4 boxes. Hopefully they get more in stock when I am ready.<br /><br />Side note: I used to get really bad headaches at work and now that I drink one with my lunch I feel much better (refreshed). I highly recommend giving it a try.

review/text: I grew up in the tropics where the best shade at the beach is from a palm tree. Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.<br /><br />Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.<br /><br />I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)

review/summary: This stuff is great!
review/text: What this is:  coconut water - not coconut milk - flavored with chocolate.<br /><br />Coconut water is taken from green coconuts - they haven't had the time to form the meat or milk yet.  Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts.  It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories.  I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.<br /><br />This chocolate flavor is excellent imho.  It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.<br /><br />Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.<br /><br />Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.<br /><br />About me:  I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give "5"-star reviews.

review/text: Zico is a very mild green coconut water that lacks the sweetness of the Vita Coco brand. I mostly drink coconut water for the benefits so the specific taste range is broad for me. I don't like the floating prices on this site because when I purchased it, it was a good deal (especially coupled with free shipping). I've since seen the prices rise to almost double at times PLUS shipping sometimes which is severely unfair. I can find this at the supermarket so if it's not cheap enough here I'm not buying it. Bottom line!

review/text: Unfortunate that Zico natural coconut water was reformulated when this bottle was introduced. I like the convenience of the bottle, and find it easy to believe that the bottle is environmentally friendlier than the tetra pak, but the flavor of the coconut water is unpleasant--the kindest characterization I can come up with is "flat". Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging. A look at the nutrition information on the label makes it clear that there is a difference in the two products, though I haven't analyzed the changes. Will not be purchasing any more of this product.

review/summary: Coconut + Chocolate = Bliss!
review/text: I love coconut water in all its raw incarnations: Brazilian, Thai, Indian. I'm hit or miss with the fruit juice blended beverages of any brand. Along comes chocolate Zico. It doesn't seem right given the consistency and flavor of coconut water. Well, it is creamier in appearance than any other water or blend -- as it, well, should be. You wouldn't mistake this in a glass beside the plain variety. The flavor is rich, very cocoa and in surprising harmony with the coconut core of it all. I enjoy it because it tastes more like a treat than the regular and goes down smooth just in case I really need the hydrating lift! You've done juice blended coconut waters. Now try this. Be careful of price they really shouldn't be more than twenty dollars per case!

review/summary: I taste zero plastic, just great coconut water
review/text: I am amazed to see so may negative reviews. Best I can guess is that the bottles the negative reviewers tastes were mishandled somehow. Maybe they got too warm or something during shipping.<br /><br />I buy Zico Natural in the plastic bottle from my local grocery store all the time, and they are the closest thing to actual fresh coconut water I have found. I love fresh coconut water, and I absolutely hate anything that tastes like plastic or metal.<br /><br />In fact, I dislike most bottled or canned coconut water because of the off tastes, but I simply don't taste anything wrong with the Zico Natural in plastic bottes.<br /><br />Accuse me of working for Zico if you like, but as you can see I am a long time Amazon user and reviewer.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: Had come across a number of comments mentioning that the taste isn't the same as it used to be.<br /><br />I don't know how it tasted previously, but the contents of this packaging are perfectly fine in taste. I found that cooling the contents a bit tasted much better than consuming them at room temperature or chilling them.<br /><br />Also, the contents contain more sodium than water but, then again, you derive maximum benefit from coconut water if you use it as protection against dehydration or for replenishment, and not as a substitute for regular water. Also, drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade seemed to make me feel more bloated - so far, I have experienced nothing of that sort with Zico. Admittedly, carrying a Powerade bottle to the gym looks much more normal than carrying a Zico coconut water bottle :-)<br /><br />For what it's worth, my mom-in-law suffers from hyperacidity and has found the Natural variant of ZICO to be a blessing.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars because I haven't been consuming it for long to know what side effects there might be, and nothing beats real coconut water, right out of a tropical coconut.

review/summary: Cure for Cottonmouth
review/text: This product is absolutely delicious. I purchased a case and received it in 2 days thanks to amazon prime. Its been less than 24 hours since I've had the Zico and I've already drank around 5 or 6 bottles. Its an excellent cure for dry mouth and is great for quick hydration. It is basically chocolate milk except not horrible for you. It may actually be better tasting than chocolate milk. There is some sugar which could be a concern for some people, but for people who consume it moderately and don't have health problems its hardly a concern.<br /><br />This beverage is best served cold, if not slightly frozen.

review/summary: New bottle/formula tastes plastic-y
review/text: I really like Zico in the tetra pak. When I tried the bottled formula, I didn't realize that the formula was any different...I just thought it was a new bottle. My reaction to every sip was that it tasted and smelled very plastic-y. It seemed that sitting in the plastic bottle was imparting a plastic flavor to the drink. I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back! I then did a little research and realize that this is the new flavor of this formula using a new variety of coconut and from concentrate. I really don't like this new flavor at all. I will not be buying this product in the bottle again.

review/summary: Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!
review/text: Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is "natural" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to "optimize" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's "optimized" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to "optimize." (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under "Todd O'Connor". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by "Todd O'Connor" and under Alio "Alio"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio "Alio" confirming the fake identity.)

This was one of the highest reviewed coco waters on Amazon before this change...what a pity...<br />I'm dropping Zico from my auto-ship and going back to something that doesn't have artificial "natural flavor" added to what should be pure coco water.

review/summary: Zico coconut water is great, but you may get a bad batch
review/text: I've ordered Zico Mango Coconut Water three times from Amazon. The first two times, the dozen I received were fine. This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a "slightly imperfect" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution.

review/summary: Not a good change
review/text: I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn't made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. It's as good as the old Zico was if not better.

review/summary: Tastes like Yoohoo, no kidding
review/text: I've been on the search for palatable coconut water for the last month or two and I finally found it in Zico's Dark Chocolate coconut water.  Every week, I would drive over to my local Whole Foods, pick up a few boxes of any brands I could find comparable flavors for and I always made sure to buy two or three at once to compare flavors.  Nothing ever really stuck taste-wise until I found this and it's absolutely delicious.  If you remember drinking Yoohoo as a kid, you'll recognize this taste immediately.  I don't know how Zico did it but this tastes identical to that chocolately smooth goodness of my youth but, you know, much healthier.  I will say though, it tastes much better cold -- as the bottle says -- but that doesn't mean it's bad when it's warm, it's just better cold, that's all.<br /><br />I also carry these to the gym and when I run obstacle course races, especially if I'm unsure of what the post-race rehydration drink will be (typically Powerade or Gatorade).  I honestly didn't think much to Zico's claims on their site and the bottle that it supports "rapid hydration", whatever that is, but I do know that its huge amounts of potassium have kept me from bonking after a race to maintaining my perk.  I typically pound one of these and one to two bananas or Larabars post-race and I've certainly jump started the recovery process better than I ever did with sports drinks or water alone.  After I'm done in the gym, I chug some Zico to cool off and wash the taste of electrolyte-flavored water out of my mouth.  I can definitely tell a difference in my moods after racing or lifting when I drink some coconut water versus when I'm just drinking water alone.<br /><br />For me, no brand can touch Zico in the taste department on this one.

review/summary: A Good Mix Of Electrolytes After Heavy Workouts.
review/text: I recently discovered Coconut water to be available in a nearby grocery store so I've been trying several of the different flavors. The latest is Zico  Mango. It's all right. It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: 1 Liter for about the calories of a can of coke
review/text: First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water.  I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add.

review/text: Zico Coconut Water in chocolate is my absolute favorite! It's 100% natural and soooo delicious. It's super powered water, that's good for you AND tastes like dessert! For a really healthy snack or smoothie, make ice cubes of the Zico chocolate water and blend with frozen bananas. For a little more of an energy burst, add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter. SO GOOD! :)

review/summary: Runner's best friend
review/text: I started drinking Zico because we carried it at my work and I instantly loved it. The taste is unique but great. I did a marathon in January and the chocolate Zico was my best friend during my training. Not only was it refreshing after my long runs, but I instantly felt rehydrated. I have told anyone that I meet to try it after long runs and they always come back and tell me how I was right. I have probably gotten at least 5 other runner's to be Zico drinkers :)

review/text: Great value & taste!!<br /><br />I love coconut water and we drink a lot in my household.<br />It's great (actually the perfect thing) for rehydration after a night of drinking, long weekend, or after hard work.<br />It has potassium, a few vitamins, and a weakly flavored but pleasant taste that really grows on you.<br />I've tasted a lot of brands and Zico has probably the best taste of them all.<br />And I've shopped around on Amazon, which is already much cheaper than your grocery store or gas station.<br />And this item, with it's larger volumes (which stay fresh), and low price<br />has proven to be the lowest priced (cheapest) price per ounce -- definitely the greatest value you can find!<br /><br />So I highly recommend this item, especially if you like coconut water and want the cheapest for the best product.

review/text: My boyfriend loves this stuff and since we live an hour's drive apart I surprise him with cases of Chocolate ZICO when I can't surprise him with my own company. There's no shipping, it only takes a couple days to get there AND if you have some foresight, you can preorder a handful of cases at a lower rate and have them sent periodically. The only downside - having to stop yourself from downing a whole case of ZICO.

review/summary: Fantastic, Love the Larger Bottles
review/text: I love this coconut water, (I also purchase VitaCoco cases at least 1-2 times a month). This coconut water is my husband's favorite, so we always have it in the refrigerator. Our family doesn't purchase soda, and now with the coconut water, we don't buy sports drinks, either! It's great to rehydrate, take to the gym, etc. And a liter is the perfect size-- I always found myself drinking at least 2 of the smaller ones so this is a more economic option.<br /><br />The items shipped fine, arrived in great shape. I'm on autoship for this product, so I don't even have to get it from the grocery store anymore.

I ordered many different brands and most, if not all of them were not made from concentrate.  This tastes diluted, re-constituted and plastic-y.  There are many other brands, I recommend any one of them over Zico.

review/text: I went to Hawaii last Fall to see a friend who introduced me to fresh, young, coconut water. Once I returned to the mainland I craved the flavor of coconut water. It is yummy and so refreshing. So I found some at the local grocery store, but it wasn't very good. Then I found this brand on sale at the store and tried it and fell in love. It is SO close to the same refreshing coconut juice I had in HI and I love it so much I have it ordered via the Amazon subscription service so that I can save a little $$$ too. Definitely recommend.

review/text: I tried the original Zico coconut water on recommendation from a friend, and really like it. When I saw the chocolate flavor I was skeptical but intrigued. I'm a huge "chocolate lover" but chocolate and water in the same sentence sounded kind of weird. I tried it anyway and I am so glad that I did! WOW! This stuff tastes amazing and doesn't taste "watery" or "watered down" at all. It's has a rich chocolate flavor and is basically a dairy-free way to enjoy chocolate milk. Plus it has all of those good electrolytes :)<br />Definitely worth a try!

review/text: Anyone who says this tastes like choc milk or Yoo Hoo is nuts. I had it over ice and could hardly get it down. I wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting. Delivery was not what I expected either. It came in a box with many other items, it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds. I think the UPS guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out. I guess the good news is it came quickly, along with the disappointment.

review/summary: This was my FIRST coconut water!
review/text: And I gotta say......I like it!  I did a lot of research on coconut water before I purchased.  Zinco brand seemed to get better reviews, and people saying it actually has ALOT more electrolytes etc.  I have heard the benefits of drinking this versus Gatorade etc and wanted one that didn't taste like crap.  This is chocolate flavored.  Well , anything chocolate in my book is a winner.  the product arrived fast, and was packaged very well. I put a few in the refrigerator and in a couple hours, I tried one.  It didn't gag, or spit it out. It actually has a once taste to it.  Kinda like watered down chocolate milk.  Didn't taste any coconut flavor, just chocolate.  It filled me up, and seemed to make me have a little energy,  I plan on using these as after workout drinks, or even after too much  indulging in the wine, I think these would help!  Lol.  So I am pleased with the price, the packaging ( recycle) and the taste.  Also happy that this brand has been rated the best out of the top 3, for it's "quality".

review/text: Wow.  This drink is awesome. So awesome that I picked up the phone and called the friend who recommended it to me immediately after my first sip of it to thank him.  Everyone else who I've introduced it to is equally hooked.  The best ways to describe the taste are 1) the leftover milk in a bowl of cocoa puffs cereal or 2) upgraded yoohoo.  Also worth noting is that several people who do not like the taste of plain coconut water are in love with this chocolate version.

Nonetheless, I will struggle through the remaining 10 bottles and cancel my Amazon subscription for it.  Off to the next brand...

review/text: Chocolate Zico is great!! Though I should start with the fact that we don't really enjoy Coconut Water as a whole.  The regular (non-flavored) is great mixed with OJ or in a smoothie, but the flavor is not that appealing.  I know people love the stuff, we just have not developed a taste for it yet.<br />The Chocolate however, is not like typical coconut water as it also has some coconut cream and yummy dark chocolate.  The flavor is reminicent to Yoohoo, but without that milky taste or concerns of lactose digestability.  It is rich tasting, but not heavy.  We often drink it after a Bikram Yoga class and it hits the spot.  Not knowing much about cocounut water and it's benefits, we are learning quickly, there are many.

review/summary: Much better quality than competitors!
review/text: We saw a comparison of coconut water brands on Dr. Oz. At the time, we were subscribing to Vita Coco.<br /><br />Zico has the fresh taste and consistency of real natural coconut water, whereas Vita Coco has a taste that suggests it is not as fresh or not as pure. Zico is more like fresh-squeezed.<br /><br />The only reason we had purchased the Vita Coco brand initially was that it seemed more available in local stores (as a backup, we love you Amazon and would never ever go to the store if we didn't have to).<br /><br />Zico packaging was the same as VC in my opinion and has no issues. We ordered the 33.8-ounce 6-pack to make the cost much less comparable to VC's 12-pack of 11.1-ounce cartons, and that seems to have been a happy accident as a space-saver (for us) in the refrigerator. Now one container looks right instead of 3 or 4 of the other.

I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water.

review/text: When I told her I was a distance runner, my Naturapathic Doctor recommended that I drink coconut water after my runs as a good recovery drink.  I bought several brands and flavors and tried them.  I found the Zico to be the best tasting, and I really like the chocolate.  This stuff has great electrolytes and way more potassium than a banana ([...]).<br /><br />I keep them in the refrigerator and chug one after my runs.  If I run a race or drive to my runs, I often stick a couple in a small cooler to drink afterward.<br /><br />The price here is less than my local grocery store, and you can't beat Amazon Prime shipping.

review/summary: Best alternative for water and soda!
review/text: I was very skeptical when I ordered these, but have made a great find! I don't love regular chocolate milk because it is much too thick and sweet for me. The Zico Chocolate is not thick at all, not overly sweet and NOT at all as coconut tasting as I feared it would be. I also found this drink to be a great energy booster between my mid-afternoon teaching schedule. I have to skip lunch and am running low on energy, but these electrolytes really help get me through to 6PM!

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: So healthy and good for you, and it tastes great. I know that's a personal view, but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters I have tried. No added sugar, and so not too sweet.<br /><br />The pack of six x 33.8oz cartons are great value too.

review/summary: Healthy Refreshment
review/text: This product is very refreshing and is a great natural alternative to things like sports drinks.  Natural electrolytes.  In Brazil they give people coconut water after they have had surgery because they believe it promotes healing.  I have tried several brands and this one is my favorite.
