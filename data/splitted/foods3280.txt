review/summary: There's a reason the ingredients aren't posted!
review/text: Ha!  Jokes on me - there's not any actual Maple in this "flavor."  Ingredients: Glycerin, water, natural flavors (contains soy), malt extract (contains barley), caramel color.  No maple taste and does not even smell like maple!  To me, it smells very much like canned tomato juice.  I don't want to waist any other ingredients, so this is going back.<br />I actually ordered 3 flavors from Frontier.  Maple, Banana and Coconut.  The coconut is the only one that actually has coconut in the ingredients.  The banana smells totally artificial, like a cross between a fresh new Sharpie marker and a Little Debbie banana moon pie.  The coconut smells kind of like coconut flavored movie theatre popcorn.<br /><br />Update:  My product review remains the same.  I will refrain from ordering anything from Frontier.  However, just had my first ever "return" experience with Amazon.  5 stars for their customer service!

review/summary: Not as Good as Mapleine Flavor, Crescent Brand
review/text: My Gramie has been using Crescent Mapleine Flavor to make pancake syrup for generations. She gave me the recipe but since I couldn't find Crescent in my local stores; I tried to make the syrup with Frontier and it just doesn't have the depth of the Crescent. It taste flat and extract like. I even tried to adjust the recipe with different sugars and adding a butter extract. None of them had that sweet but not too sweet flavor. I'm going back to the Mapleline. I guess Gramie knows best.

review/text: Out of all the hotsauces that you can readily find at local grocery stores--unlike Sriracha--Tobasco habanero is my favorite. It is quite hot with a lovely flavor that is deep and rich. The complexity of its taste makes it far superior to its parent, the timeless Tobasco sauce. I enjoy it and an added benefit is that it is fairly cheap. My one regret is that I can't find it in a 12 ounce bottle.

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/summary: A Little Flavor and a LOT of Heat Go a Long Way
review/text: Habanero has two great advantages as a pepper--tremendous flavor and tremendous heat.  The Tabasco habanero sauce captures both, especially the latter.  It's got a serious bite.  A bit too much in my mind, to be honest.  More problematic is the consistency.  For some reason Tabasco's habanero sauce is much thicker than Tabasco's other sauces (and the Yucatan Sunshine habanero sauce).  This is particularly problematic when using the itty-bitty 2 oz. bottle.

review/summary: Tabasco has a new King!
review/text: The McIlhenny's  have done what very few in this space have been able to manage. They have engineered<br />a habanero elixir for the extreme palate that tastes good on just about everything, and I do mean everything.<br /><br />I've got over 50 different brands of hot sauce in my collection and this jewel from Tabasco has pretty much<br />obsoleted all of them. It's got a mild island flavor reminiscent of a jerk/calypso sauce and it's guaranteed<br />to make everything from bar-b-que to hamburgers to collard greens to bloody marys and even salads tastes better.<br />It doesn't have that sting regular Tabasco has that hasn't been properly aged, but it will bite you, and it will<br />bite you hard if you're not judicious with the amount you're pouring on. The best thing about this sauce is that<br />is commercially available just about everywhere. And at this price ($2.40) it makes sense to buy several bottles,<br />cause they don't last long. And unbelievably, my local Publix stocks these 2oz. bottles for $6.99 each! Will rate<br />out at about 8,000 Scoville units, and thats enough for most aspiring pepperheads.<br /><br />Warning - This stuff is addictive. After a couple of weeks on this juice you'll get the "hot sauce slobbers"<br />every time you walk through your grocery's butcher shop. Don't say I didn't warn you. 5 Scovies!

review/summary: Great Taste - Less Filling....
review/text: These fruit gems were delicious as expected.  I went for this packaging as a nostalgic gift for me wife.  I did have an issue with the packaging and selection in the box.  All the gems were clumped together, one larger clump on side and I guess the outkasts on the other side.  Would have been nice to see some packaging keep them in place as they are not individually wrapped.  Secondly the amount of loose sugar outside the packaging spilled out when these were opened.  Lastly and not sure how quality control reviews the packaging.  But we received only one yellow, a couple green/red/pink gems, leaving virtually 80% of the batch orange gems.  They sure are good, but I was expecting a balance of available colors/flavors.

review/summary: Odd flavor
review/text: This is my first time trying this product, and I was slightly disappointed by them.  Certain flavors (particularly the yellow and green) left a strange flavor lingering in my mouth for a long time after I'd eaten just one of them.<br /><br />The fruit gems themselves did not fit very securely in the packing.  As soon as I removed the outer plastic wrap, I found the box covered in a sticky layer of sugar.  Inside the box, the gems had become all muddled up and were no longer in their set places.  The box was not divided into separate "spaces" for each gem, but instead split into two compartments where the gems were all just sort of tossed in together. I was hoping for some better presentation, and if this had been a gift, I would have been quite upset.  Additionally, the ratio of colors seemed somewhat poor:  I got a lot of reds and yellows, but very few yellows and greens, and not a single white one.  Not one!<br /><br />I didn't like these sweets much, because the yellows and greens (as I mentioned) left a particularly odd aftertaste and made my tongue feel weird.  The reds and oranges were not as strongly affected by this weird flavor, and I enjoyed them more.  They were quite irresistible!<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will be buying this product again.  The strange aftertaste was off-putting, and I would have been more disappointed by this product if there had been more greens and yellows in the box. I am glad that I mainly got reds and oranges; but this might not happen next time.  (I really liked the red and orange gems though, and wish I could just buy a box full of only them.) I didn't think that the gems were presented very attractively in their box, and would have definitely preferred that at least the colors be split up more cleanly - this would perhaps help with quality control too, and ensuring an even ratio of each color.<br /><br />I gave the product three stars because I felt it had poor quality control due to not having a very even ratio of flavors.  I, as I say, was glad that I mainly got reds and oranges, but if those are not your favorites, then it might be something of a letdown.  Anyone who loves the white gems would have been horribly disappointed if they had gotten my box - there wasn't a single one in them!<br /><br />I also give it three stars on account of the strange after-taste.  It spoiled things somewhat for me.  I was glad that it was only certain colors that were affected, or else I would not have been able to eat these gems at all.  I found that I was only able to have one of the gems that had an odd flavor, before the after-taste got too much for me.

review/summary: Premium bread flour
review/text: This flour (although not purchased through Amazon) gives the lightest, highest-rising qualities to breads, cakes, and short-dough (baking powder) bread recipes I have ever seen. I used it without changing quantities in any recipe, straight from the bag. Yeast dough raises to artisan-bakery standards. Quick breads are lighter and more flavorful, not crumbly, with no change in recipe. It makes pie crust rise like puff pastry, and the gluten content is enough that the crust holds its shape --does not crumble --while staying light, airy, and slightly crisp. An absolute marvel for baking.

review/summary: Cat Loves It, Doesn't Reduce Odor
review/text: I've been feeding this food to my cat since I got him (3 months), after weaning him off the food he'd been on. It's fairly expensive but it's good quality and he LOVES it. I gave it 4 stars because, despite its claim, it doesn't seem to reduce odor. Even when I wasn't giving him any other food or treats (he doesn't like the treats I got him) his bowel movements still smell pretty bad. It's been long enough that he's gotten used to his food so whatever they put in the food to reduce odor didn't work. Still, it's a good product and it's possible that the odor-reduction will work in the future or for a different cat. The most important thing is that he loves this food. The ingredients are fairly good. Amazon has the best price for this size. 7 lbs lasts me about 2-3 weeks (but my cat is big and active).

If you care about nutrition, and know what byproducts are and what grains can do to your cat, I strongly urge you to avoid any food containing them, not just RC. For the same price as RC you can get higher quality Wellness Core, or Alpha Cat by Natural Balance, even Before the Grain has better ingredients.<br /><br />My cats are all back on raw. Turned out to be a beef allergy in the one, NOT, as the vet said "getting sick from uncooked meat." I didn't realized lions grilled their meat. Blood work is back to her typical perfection.<br />First five ingredients make up the majority of the contents, keep in mind this is before its cooked, after cooking, meat weighs less and falls down the list.<br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, brown rice, rice, corn, corn gluten meal, chicken fat, chicken, natural chicken flavor, pea fiber, rice flour, rice hulls, wheat gluten, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), soya oil, sodium silico aluminate, dried brewers yeast, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), calcium sulfate, salt, potassium chloride, dried egg product, choline chloride, DL-methionine, taurine, Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), niacin supplement, biotin, riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplement, D-calcium pantothenate, vitamin A acetate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], sodium tripolyphosphate, tea (green tea extract), Trace Minerals [zinc oxide, zinc proteinate, ferrous sulfate, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, calcium iodate, sodium selenite], L-Carnitine, preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of vitamin E) and citric acid, rosemary extract.

review/summary: Gourmet Taste on Soup Kitchen Budget
review/text: In a normal day we will drink two pots of Folgers in the morning and two in the afternoon followed by at least one during and after dinner.  Would you say we have a drinking problem?  Actually it is not a problem but more a habit of consuming a quality taste.  When available those cups are filled with Gourmet Supreme.  Sometimes it just is not available.  Amazon has filled most of the empty holes for our coffee addition, however.  Maybe it is just us but the coffee we have received from Amazon appears to be of a fresher nature and not stale as we have received from other grocers.<br /><br />Even though we sincerely enjoy drinking this brand, we fault the producer for several matters.  There are too many instances of ground stems in the contents.  A rep from Folgers assured me that there were no stems in the coffee; however, coffee beans usually are dark brown and not in the shape of a ground light colored stem.  Additionally, it seems as if almost all producers of most products are playing with the net weight of it packages.  It used to be (dark age era) that a 16 ounce bag of coffee was a pound and no more.  If I wanted a larger container I had a choice of buying several one pounders or a three pound bag.  Most of the bags came as beans and I had to self grind it or get the clerk to do it for me.  Not today.  The large container here is 27.8 ounces today and we have no idea what it will be tomorrow other than the price will probably increase.  Even the old pounder is now 13 ounces.  I recall potato chips coming in a pound bag but today it's 10 ounces or 11.3 or some other amount of ounces.  Each time it is with a price increase.  My needs are simple:  top quality coffee at soup kitchen prices with no fillers or constantly changing packages.  If a price increase is needed because of fluctuating international markets then increase the price.<br /><br />Regardless of my comments in the above paragraph I still find Folgers a quality brand and will continue using it.

review/text: I'll admit that for awhile I had the perception that Folgers was an 'old folks' brand which wouldn't taste nearly as good as the Starbucks blend I was buying. However I was having coffee at a friends house and when he served me this stuff I was pleasantly surprised. It is very rich and smooth with great flavor. I have now started buying this blend just because the price is so good compared to some of the other premium brands on the market.

review/summary: CONVIENCE and great flavor.
review/text: I found this is one of the easiest ways to shop for coffee. The Subsribe and Save program saves you money and you never wake up to an empty canister.  Folgers Gourmet Supreme Ground Coffee, Deep & Full Bodied, Dark Roast, 27.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)priced well and I prefer the Folgers brand better than the fancy coffee house brands. As another reviewer stated it " as the old stand buy."<br /><br />I love to shop online. It is often cheaper and without hassle. I could drive to Wallet World, park and fight the crowds, hopefully find my specific brand, stand in line and wait for the person ahead to clip their coupons, have their CC declined, write a check, etc. OR I could login to Amazon and click one button, then wait two days for my no sales tax, free delivered product. Please don't get me wrong, I like to shop at the big box stores, when I have time, but usually I shop online.<br />Trip to grocery store, $10 , two canisters of coffee $16, plus tax and hassle. Have is delivered free without tax for $18. Without the hassle.<br /><br />PRICE: C<br />CONVIENCE: A+++<br />TASTE: A<br /> Comment | Permalink

review/summary: Overroasted and burned
review/text: This is not what I would call gourmet coffee, not even by ground standards.<br /><br />If one has tasted other brands, such as Peets, or Intelligentsia, to compare, one will immediately recognize that the Folgers beans are overroasted and burned.<br /><br />However, for a long time, I had not tasted those brands, so I thought that Folgers Gourmet Coffee tasted fine.<br /><br />I did not realize what I was missing out on.<br /><br />But then, my tastebuds woke up.<br /><br />If you drink Folgers Gourmet Supreme, order a pound of Intelligentsia French Roast. If you don't taste the difference, then you haven't lost much money. If you take a deep whiff of both beans, there is a distinct difference between the two. One will smell burned and the other will not.<br /><br />For a supermarket variety coffee, I would say Folgers is a good value. For a little more money, there are other coffees that would give a better flavor profile.

review/text: My dog cannot be bribed.  I have tried EVERYTHING.  The only thing he can be bribed with so far are these treats and real food (steamed chicken meat, peanut butter, and cheese whiz).  I can't really use these for training, because he still doesn't like it as much as the human food.  But it's an good treat if I want to reward him for going potty in the right place in a pinch.<br /><br />My pack didn't come crushed like some of the other brands.  Some are crushed, and I do have to be careful with them if I want to pack them to go.  I need to put them in a hard plastic container to keep them from turning into powder.  Also avoid getting them wet...man they become one sticky mess when they do.

review/summary: Great-for-Training Treats
review/text: Either chicken or beef freeze-dried liver is a great training reward for dogs, and because it has such a strong flavor, it's also great to mix with crushed pills if a dog refuses to take medication in other ways (like my dog who hates peanut butter and cheese). My dog goes crazy for these treats, so I buy large quantities. But I suggest starting out with small size bags until you know your dog will like these treats as much as my dog does. The only down-sides of using freeze-dried meat is that dogs can only eat small amounts at any one time, and the handler MUST wash his/her hands afterwards. I have found that Pooch Passions treats are very expensive, compared to other freeze-dried meat treats, but I feel that this brand is well-worth the expense.

review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea. Perfect!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip."<br /><br />It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

Not unreasonable, I thought, but I already knew that candy stores in our area either didn't carry sugar-free brittle or it was way too expensive.  So I got on Amazon and found this product for around $1.63 per three ounces.  That's about the same or even cheaper than some of those 3-oz. sugar-free candies you can get at stores like Wal-Mart.  I ordered Judy's sugar-free peanut brittle (two-pound pack), and when my wife tasted it for the first time, she said it was the best she's ever had.  So now Mama's happy.  That means everybody's happy - ha!  Thank you Judy's!!

review/summary: Made in China - these treats caused anal rupture and renal failure
review/text: I bought this at Costco after reading the ingredients - only chicken, sweet potato and glycerin.  Only later did I see that were made in China.  I had given my Standard Poodle 2 of them about two months ago and afterwards she couldn't poop for 3 days, a problem she never had.  I thought it MUST have been something else she ate but was concerned so I put the treats away.  Three days ago, I thought I was being neurotic and decided to give her 1 treat and see if there were any problems.  The next day she didn't poop and by that night a bump was forming next to her anus that clearly made her uncomfortable; by morning it was red and looked awful.  I drove her to the vet when it opened.  Her anal sac had ruptured.  She needed general anesthetic, surgery, and 14 days of antibiotics.  I told the vet my theory about the treats; she said that two weeks ago, another dog was brought in after eating the exact same treats.  She said that dog died of renal failure.  The vet also said that she had bought the same treats for her dog, and her dog was sick afterwards, so she threw them away.  I wrote an incident report to Costco and hopefully an investigation will follow.  These treats are potentially deadly.  For my dog, it made her very very sick.  The vet bill was $450.  I don't believe there are only three ingredients in these treats.

review/text: My dog was getting one of these sweet potato chicken treats a day.  She began almost immediately having irregular bowel movements and going for days without defecating.  Then she began drinking a lot of water and eating grass like crazy.  This morning she threw up.  Same symptoms as the other dogs who have had renal failure form the Kingdom Pets Premium Dog Treats.  I have thrown out the bag and hope I have caught this in time.

review/summary: kingdom sweet potato and chicken
review/text: My three little dogs love these treats, they started carrying at Costco but them they spot carrying them.  I was very disappointing I did a research and found that the competition was accusing Kingdom Pets of putting out a dangerous product.  I came across a FOUR-YEAR independent LAB TEST that I want to share with shoppers.  So I confidently purchases several bags last week since I ran out of them.  My dogs just love these treats! I have a dog with multiple allergies that I keep on the Blue dog food.  The sweet potato and salmon diet do miracles with dogs that have allergies.<br /><br />When my dog was eating regular dog food, he has skin infections and bald spots from him pulling his hair out.  Now on the blue salmon and sweet potato diet his hair is full, shiny and does not shed.  The Kingdom Pets sweet potato and chicken are great treats, since my dog cannot have any other meet, fillers, rice etc...Others say that the Kingdom sweet potato does not have enough chicken.  It does and its cost is not as high as other competitors.<br /><br />Here is the link to the lab report for Kingdom treats:<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Where's the chicken?
review/text: My dogs enjoy these treats (which is why they get two stars instead of one) but I'm really disappointed in them. There is very little chicken on them, significantly less than in the product picture. I have previously purchased a different brand of these treats, Canyon Creek Ranch Yam Good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N66R6I">Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good Dog Treats</a> . There is a HUGE difference in the amount of chicken on the Canyon Creek Ranch treats compared to these. See my picture comparison of the two in the customer images. The Canyon Creek Ranch treats have a nice thick piece of chicken wrapped around the yam, the Kingdom Pets piece of chicken is so thin it is the color of the yam, I had to look twice to see if there actually was any chicken on several of the treats. On the positive side, if you're worried about chicken treats made in China, these are the treats for you, since there's hardly any chicken on them. Personally I'll be sticking with the Canyon Treat Ranch brand from here on out, when I give my dog a chicken and yam treat I want them to actually get some chicken. The Canyon Creek Ranch treats are a little more expensive but in my opinion they are a much greater value.

review/text: My dogs love this treat, but I just cant give it to them anymore. do a google on them.: "Chicken jerky treats began making my dogs sick over a year ago, and that's when I started looking to see where the meat came from. When I looked at every single chicken jerky treat origin that I could find, and they all listed CHINA, that's when I stopped buying any chicken jerky. This country (China) beat to death hundreds of thousands of dogs in the streets within the last couple of years. They eat sentient companions, and kill them in the sight of the ones yet to be killed. They skin them alive. They treat trained animals cruelly, with barbaric training methods.<br />They have now contaminated their own food sources for HUMAN BABIES with melamine!

I didn't feel it was worth chancing it for my dogs.  Unfortunately, MOST jerky treats are made in China, so I found out the hard way I have to look very carefully at the fine print before purchasing dog treats.  Many of them come from American companies which do the repackaging, but the actual product comes from China.

review/text: First, I have to say, my dogs love this treat. I like that it has the sweet potato, but that was until the FDA started warning about chicken treats from China. Chinese produced chicken treats, like Kingdom Pets, are causing kidney failure in dogs.<br /><br />Kingdom Pets has yet to test, or release test results of their product.<br /><br />I'd avoid any chicken or other dog treats that come from China. This isn't the first time Chinese based pet products have caused a problem.

review/summary: One of the better Hormel meals
review/text: The Spaghetti with Turkey Meatballs is better than many others in the Hormel line in some respects and worse in others. My biggest complaint about the Hormel red pasta sauces is that they are all unfailingly too sweet and have a distracting acidic tang to it. This one, thankfully, doesn't have these issues at all. It is a very nice tasting sauce (a little bland but that's par for the course with this type of meal produced to be enjoyed by many different types of people) that pretty much makes the entire dish. The noodles are noodles. Nothing exceptional, nothing horrible. It's the meatballs where this meal fails. I understand that they are attempting to make a lower calorie meal and applaud their efforts but these turkey meatballs are terrible. They are overly dry and have pretty much no taste. Maybe if the meat was ground up and mixed into the sauce, this wouldn't be an issue but instead they are in fairly large chunks.<br /><br />As a whole though, I would rather eat this meal than many, many others in the Hormel line up. It still has way too much sodium (600mg) but comparing that to some of the other meals (upwards of 1300mg) it's much, much better. If you're looking for something that doesn't have to be refrigerated, is quick and easy to heat up, and is fairly palatable, you really can't go wrong with this one. Just cut up the meatballs first and mix it in with the rest. It'll be much better that way.

review/text: Initially I was skeptical, but my husband and I LOVED this product and will never go back to consuming an impure version of what is supposed to be `licorice'. The flavor is a strong strawberry and the texture is practically identical to Twizzler nibs.  I also like the chunky size since it lends itself to a true "bit-sized" piece.  Of course, that didn't prevent me from eating half the bag! What a shame that popular companies are using such unwholesome, harmful ingredients when this product proves that the purest ingredients will not compromise flavor, texture, or fat content.  The bag contains 5 servings and the fat content is 1 gm per serving.  I was really surprised by the negative reviews for the product.  Sadly, our taste buds have deceived us into preferring what is unhealthy and harmful to us.  Neither Twizzlers nor Vines products contain licorice extract.  Instead those companies "value" their consumers by depriving them of the healing properties of the licorice herb and replacing it with what is artificial and known to be dangerous to our health. It is even MORE unfortunate that some consumers are so highly committed to the products of those companies that are not committed to THEM or the use of quality ingredients.

I love the soft chewy texture and the natural strawberry flavor.  They are very addictive and I can eat a half a bag at one sitting if I'm not careful.  Other natural red licorices are colored with Carmine, which is made from ground beetles.  I am happy that they do not use that as I eat no animal products.  Thank you for coming out with this product and I hope people will continue to demand more natural ingredients in the food they eat, even if it is a snack.

review/summary: Just not there
review/text: The pepermint rounds was not what I was expecting. They were are too sweet and did not have enough pepermint taste. I wanted to try this because it looked like the pepermint balls I got from "The Pepermint Store", but the minimum was five pounds and the shipping was a horrendous $14.00 (oh well, live and learn).

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I drink a lot of tea and enjoy trying new types. I fell in love with Twinings  Peach. It's great hot or cold. Suddenly I can no longer find it along with their Vanilla. I hope it comes back to Amazon soon.

review/text: This is the best peach tea I've found.  It's not over powering or too sweet, just a nice flavor.  I prefer it iced.

review/summary: Delicious aroma, great iced!
review/text: Love this tea! It has such a delicious aroma and has great flavor. Add a tad bit of sugar and I think it's absolutely perfect. This tea is also great iced- much better than any peach iced tea I've tried at caf&eacute;s or restaurants.

review/summary: This is great tea!
review/text: I purchased this to try in my Keurig maker, I am not a tea drinker but since I've gotten these I usually have a cup of this in the afternoon. I put the tea bag in the regular k-cup holder w/ the string and tag hangin out over the front of the machine. I will make either a 6 or 8 oz cup and leave the bag in. This tea bag( i know this may be gross) but it will give me a 2nd cup that is almost as good as the first. I will definitely be buying this again.

review/summary: Discontinued :(
review/text: This is my favorite peach flavored black tea.  Sadly, Twinings' site says they are discontinuing it, and the prices on Amazon have been jacked up to reflect that.  Time to find a new peach tea.
