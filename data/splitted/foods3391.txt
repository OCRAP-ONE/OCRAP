review/summary: A big hit with my two 3-year old felines. And a Google check okays its fat content
review/text: Being totally clueless about minimum recommended content of protein, fat and fiber in feline diets, and considerably worried about the healthfulness of this product after reading another Amazon reviewer's warning of what he found to be the way-too-high fat content of these treats--the label says "crude fat (min.) 34.0%"--, I went online and found a link to a National Research Council site titled "Your Cat's Nutritional Needs: A Science Based Guide for Pet Owners"  which appears to be the work of a cadre of science professors from about a dozen universities.  They say:<br /><br /> "The maximum amount of fat in the cat's diet can be reasonably high without any<br />known adverse effects. In many cat foods, 50% or more of the energy comes from<br />fat. Studies indicate that cat foods containing even higher amounts of fat are safe.<br />At a minimum, cat foods should have a fat content of about 9% of dry matter."<br /><br />Which is a relief, considering how much my two three-year-old cats, Purrcilla and B.J. Honeycatt, seem to love this stuff.<br /><br /> I think this is the first pet treat I've ever seen that is labeled as being for both dogs and cats.  The size of these dry treats--there are about a dozen and a half of them in this 4 oz. bag-inside-a-box, each about the size of a half inch high stack of silver dollars--is  more dog friendly than cat friendly, but the discs break in two easily; Once a day I crumble and split half a disc between their two bowls as a topper for their wet food...or sometimes instead, use it as a bedtime treat. So for two cats I estimate getting about a month's worth out of this package.<br /><br />I've bookmarked the site mentioned above for future reference (too bad Amazon doesn't allow us to link to outside sites in our reviews).

review/summary: "Your're trying to poison me, I just KNOW it"
review/text: My Australian shepherd (AKA "garbage-gut") would kill for these. On the other hand she would kill for a chicken strip or a bite of buttered toast so I don't know if you should depend on her for a review. My ultra-suspicious , paranoid  cat (who has NEVER eaten a treat) sucked these right down when I crumbled them by her food. ...."I just KNOW you're trying to poison me, you old bat.".... They have excellent ingredients, no grains or gluten.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's fair to take off a star for price. I try to get the best food for my pets (I pay $50 for a bag of blue buffalo for the dog) but ,to be honest ,I don't think I could justify over $40 for a pound of treats, good tasting and healthy or not.If YOU can these would be a good choice.

review/summary: Dog Liked It
review/text: What can I say?  The dog liked it - I certainly didn't taste it.  He didn't gobble it down at first since it was something new so let me describe it....<br /><br />I handed it to him and, after a few cautious and tentative sniffs he took it from my hand and took it over to his favorite spot.  He set it on the ground, licked it a few times to roll it over and sniff the other side - this went on a couple of times and humorous to watch.  From there, he was like a little kid and took a small sample bite to give it a try.  After a few tentative chews and a reluctant swallow, he looked up to see if it was ok to proceed.<br /><br />Proceed he did, as he crunched away at the remainder of the treat and, after a satisfactorily smack of the lips he ran over to beg for another (which he didn't get).  I do like the fact there is a lot of meat products vs. garbage in the Made in the USA treat!

review/summary: they don't last long....
review/text: Okay, I'm rating these based on my cats' reactions to these treats. While one is the exact opposite of a picky eater (ANYTHING that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind), the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks.  Needless to say, the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more.  Cat #2 took a little more time/investigation when it came to the treat (that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute, something I really don't put past her), but once she tried it, she was much quicker eating the second bite.  Finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients/less crappy filler is a great thing.<br /><br />That said, these things are NOT cheap.  You do not get a lot for your money, though at least if you're buying them for cats,  you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece. I can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing - at least while on the current budget.

review/summary: Feline hits and misses...
review/text: Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats by Nature's Variety, 4-Ounce Package<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />They're oddly-shaped, greyish-beige, roughly circular pucks about the size of a modern dollar piece around and maybe half an inch thick, that look so thoroughly unappetizing that I immediately gave up all thought of trying a piece of one and reporting on the taste for the sake of art. One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />"Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes. I'll submit to your petting me while I eat it (Stay away from the neck!) and maybe, I say *maybe* afterwards if you have a supply of these and can provide me with more of them.<br /><br />[more chewing} You know, I never liked you, not really, not before, but now I see you're really not so bad a fellow after all..."<br /><br />So there it is. A temporary hit. A great big hit and a definite miss on three housecats. They're somewhat expensive for pet-treats but, with the right cat, you could use them to try and teach the basics like, "come when I say your name" and "hiss at someone else."<br /><br />As far as dogs are concerned, this is going to have to wait until I can overcome the idea of how a stranger might react to my approaching him or her and saying, "Hey, you don't know me. I don't know you, but I still want to feed this to your dog."<br /><br />More about that after I get some time to screw up my courage.

review/summary: Some Do; Some Don't
review/text: I have about 20 cats so gave this product a true test. Results: some like it very much; some didn't...so it probably depends upon when you give your cats this product...<br /><br />Striper was my first taste tester...she went after it right away...but left it shortly thereafter...In fact, most of the cats and kittens did... it was too big for them! When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it... Probably depends upon their regular diets, but this wasn't a treat in my opinion...

review/summary: Mixed Reaction & WAY Too Much FAT!!!!!! Read That Label....
review/text: We have 2 old Indoor Tabby cats about 12 years old who will eat ANYTHING and are 20 & 22 pounds. These monsters are still a terror that is fitting for their names of Lucy & Ethel...But I have to crush these up into crumbly pieces small enough for them to sample. First time they both LOVED it. Then Lucy threw it up and she has only thrown up 1 or 2 times in 12 years. Ethel throws up a few times ever week but did fine. From that time on however, they BOTH simply refused ever trying this food treat. So off we go to the neighbors & friends at work. 2 other families had the problem that NONE of the 6 other cats we tried would even try a sample of this food. We tried baby talking, tried bribery, tried everything but force feeding, the brats wouldn't got NEAR this stuff!<br /><br />  Ok, now dogs. Well here is a completely different result. Every dog we tried simply DEVOURED the stuff. Now, when I walk out to get the mail I almost fear for my life with the way these dogs eyeball me:-) But has anyone ever read the label? The far content of 20% plus makes me a pet owner who would NEVER feed this to my pet. Not even as a treat. The manufacturer seems to almost (to me anyway) market this as a pet health food? Sorry, don't care what pet loves it or hates it, I would never give any to any pet since I love them way too much to feed them all that I see on that label. Every time I complain to out Veterinarian about how big our cats are he explains that they are perfect actually. That they are just very large and STRONG, that it is not fat and not to worry. Sure different that what MY doctor tells Me....<br /><br />  Again, I am no Vet, but read the label, look that best friend you call a pet in the eye and ask yourself if you feel right about stuffing it with fat?

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.<br /><br />I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.<br /><br />According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from "minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients."  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats.

review/summary: Finicky Cat Purrs While Eating
review/text: Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken compares favorable with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052OUXHO">Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Salmon & Chicken Dinner for Cats, 12oz</a> which my older cat really enjoys.<br /><br />As both foods are freeze-dried, they both need reconstitution--I heat some water, place some of the food in a shallow dish and pour the water over the food.  I wait a few minutes, allowing the food to get soft, drain the water and then place in the cat dish.  Its a great "hot" food alternative for the cat who is too finicky to eat other types of raw food.<br /><br />Nature's Variety is easier to portion.  Each chunk of food comes as a disk around the size of a fifty-cent piece with about half an inch of thickness.  Once softened, I have cut this a bit with a fork, but for the most part, my cat likes it so much she moves it off her plate to attack it whole.  The Stella and Chewy food comes in smaller tater tot shapes which unfortunately, depending upon the way they are packed to be shipped can arrive crushed.  For some reason, the crushed food does not appeal to my cat.  In addition, it is difficult to decide just how much food to give the cat--once reconstituted, the food will go to waste if the cat, like mine, decides not to eat it all.  Nature's Variety's size makes this easier to manage and will result in less waste.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, makes for a seemingly delicious entree item for my very picky cat who purrs while she eats it.  Easy to portion out and reconstitute, it makes for a raw treat to "serve" on top of kibble or just alone.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies.

review/summary: Delicacy for my dogs
review/text: One of our dogs is extremely picky when it comes to food and treats. Sometimes he just sniffs and then turns away, obviously disgusted. Sometimes he'd take the treat in his mouth and then moves his head down so the treat just falls out of his open mouth on the floor. Then he walks away... He is an awesome dog but quite the character.<br />However, these treats are a big hit for both of our dogs..!! They aboslutely love this healthy delicacy. They are a bit on the pricey side but I will order them as a special treat for them once in a while. Highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Treat For Dogs!  VERY EXPENSIVE!!
review/text: My dog loves these treats!  They are a good all natural product which I have no issues or concerns with giving it to my dog.  I feed my dog Wellness Core because he cannot eat grains due to skin allergies.  So to find a good quality grain free treat that my dog likes is great.  I break the treats into 4 pieces because of the cost.  Four ounces for almost 11 dollars is quite costly.  That means these treats are 44 dollars a pound!! I won't be buying much of these treat very often because of the cost.  Sorry Natural Instinct....you have a great product line but 44 dollars a pound is ridiculous!  This isn't filet mingnon people! Five stars for quality 1 star for price = 3 Stars overall.

review/summary: My dogs love it
review/text: I have two dogs at home, and my sister has another. One of my Pomeranians is extremely picky which makes it difficult to purchase treats or even foods that he isn't already familiar with, because it's more likely than not that he will reject whatever I get him. Imagine my surprise when my dog loved this treat! He always runs to the kitchen when he senses I'm getting a treat for him, and he actually jumps up and down when he sees that I have these.<br /><br />My other dog is sixteen and has no teeth, so unfortunately these are too hard for him, but I try to break of very small pieces for him so he's able to get a taste. My sister's dog will eat everything so no surprise that he likes these too.<br /><br />They're a little pricey but I think that given how much the dogs love these, and the fact that I have small dogs so these can last for a little while, makes them a worthwhile purchase when I'm out.

review/text: We have four cats.  Two of them went crazy over these treats and fought with each other to claim every last bit of the treat.  A third one tried them once and never could be induced to try them again, and the fourth refused to have anything to do with them.  Every other cat treat we have brought into the house has always been greeted with unamimous enthusiasm, so I don't really know what to think of this.  Your mileage may vary; for my part, if I am going to pay this kind of money for a cat treat, I want something I know everyone is going to like.

review/summary: Great ingredients, but cats can be finicky
review/text: What I find attractive about this product is that the right combination of protein, fat and fiber for your pet. The ingredients read like a list of actual recognizable foods such as plants and animals that you would actually buy in the supermarket rather than a long list of artificial ingredients you would never use in a recipe. Aside from one mineral and one natural preservative, the are things I'd gladly eat myself.<br /><br />The down side of the product is that my cats wouldn't eat it. In fairness, cats can be finicky, and of the three cat treats I have in my house, one cat won't eat any of them. The other likes just one. Obviously I wouldn't buy them, but it's well worth a try especially if you have dogs. If your pet does end up liking them, you can feel good knowing that they are getting real food that a chef might have come up with for their health, rather than something that a laboratory invented.

review/summary: Like the concept
review/text: I really like the concept of this brand. In fact, I was quite thrilled reading all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The biscuits are dry and a bit on the hard side, but despite being a bit older, my dog ate any that were proffered to him. The crunchy bits are probably good for cleaning his teeth. He's a 10+ year old 80lb Doberman-Weimaraner mix and not a picky eater, but he wasn't overly excited when offered the treats. Maybe he was just wary of the new food. He seemed relatively pleased after the first taste because he begged for another. However, later that night he had a bit of an upset stomach and had to go out more than once.<br /><br />I know that dogs may typically have a range of upsetting digestive reactions to new foods. I'd advise only offering one or two treats until their digestive system has a chance to adjust.<br /><br />I think I'm going to give it a few more days to see if he adjusts and still can happily enjoy the treats because I'd much rather give him these than the fake bacon garbage.

review/text: Well, we do not have cats of our own, but our neighbor's cat frequently visits us. I thought it would be nice to feed her something wholesome, organic and healthy from time to time, so we tried the Raw Boost Bites. She didn't like it. Nibbled a bit on it and then spewed it out in disgust. We had more success with the customary tuna fish and ham diet.<br />I have to admit that the sample size of one is not really representative, so I have no idea whether this cat has a special taste, or whether this product is just not what cats want. I may need to try it myself to get a better idea about it ...

It's a little difficult to open the package, but I was eventually successful without resorting to a pair of scissors, which was nice.<br /><br />The smell of the product was as one would expect, with a musky meat (Chicken) flavor that presumably is irresistible to dogs (if not cats).  Not something I'd be attracted to, but then again the product is meant to appeal to your animal friend rather than you.

review/summary: Best treats yet for cats and dogs....
review/text: This is by far one of the best treats. What is best is that they are for both cats and dogs. Usually when I give my dog or cat a treat they eat it right on the spot. When I first gave them these treats, my dog and cat ran away with these treats on hand. They left and probably savored them in private. The treats are great and they are the size of a half dollar and about a half inch to three quarters inch thick. You can probably cut these in pieces perfectly using a knife. If you do it by hand it takes a little more strength and maybe a little messier. Overall, these are great treats that you can use for your cat and dog.

review/summary: Natural pet treats
review/text: These "bites" are almost Oreo cookie sized.  As they are, they aren't the best size or shape for cats, though these are marketed for both cats and dogs.  I crumbled one of these up and dropped them in front of the kitties.  Only a few of the kitties seemed to like the crumbles.  A couple of them weren't interested after their initial sniff.  A few of them tried to give the crumbles a second chance.<br /><br />I think these would be better for dogs.  While the concept of natural and raw is awesome, the shape and texture isn't the best for cats.<br /><br />ETA - I gave these to a friend who has 2 puppies, and they LOVED it.  She has 8 cats as well, and though the cats were interested, they didn't care that much.  I had given this 3 stars for the cats, but if you have dogs, they are definitely 5 stars.  So this review is for 4 stars.

review/summary: My cats LOVEEEEE this
review/text: I have 3 cats. And they all are now obsessed with this. I got the chicken flavor and I crumble one biscuit up, splitting it 3 ways and put it on top of their wet food. I feed them wet food only, but one of the cats is a dry food/dry treat addict. I give her small amounts of grain-free dry food occasionally to satisfy her, but now I think I'll switch to this! I think she just needs something with a harder texture and this is perfect.

review/summary: Good Quality, But Expensive
review/text: We got the Raw Boost Bites in chicken flavor.  Although my dogs will eat anything, they were especially excited about these treats.<br /><br />The quality of ingredients is excellent.  No grains--just freeze-dried meats, fruits and veggies, with some spices, and preserved with vitamin E.  They smell VERY chicken-y, moreso than conventional treats.  The freeze-drying gives these biscuits an odd texture, kind of like cardboard.  They hardly weigh anything.<br /><br />While the quality is good, there are a couple of negatives.  First is the cost.  My box only contained 18 treats.  I have two big dogs, so if I gave them each three cookies/day (not unusual), this box would last us... three days.  Second, while the size is fine for a larger dog, you'd have to break them for a smaller dog.  This makes a huge, crumbly mess.  Third, after eating one, both dogs do this weird smacking thing with their tongues for a full minute, as if part of the treat is stuck to the roof of their mouths.  I don't know if this is bothersome for them, but it drives me insane.<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this 4 stars based on the quality of ingredients, but I would not buy these because they're just not economical.  I don't want to spend $20+/week on dog treats (sorry, doggies!).

review/summary: Cats, raccoons, possums, and skunks turned it down - but the dog likes them
review/text: When I saw Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats in the Chicken flavor, I thought it would be a nice treat for my four indoor cats. I opened it up the very night the package arrived and gave one to each cat. They were interested in these treats at first, licking at them, sniffing them, and one cat even nibbled a little of it. That was the extent of their interest, however. All four treats were still laying on the floor 24 hours later. I've never seen these cats turn their nose up at a treat and they have never left one alone that long.<br /><br />I set cat food on the porch for some of the neighborhood strays, and along with those kitties I see raccoons, skunks, and possums visit my porch every night. I took the four treats my cats turned down and put them on the porch. The next day I found that not even the scavengers liked these treats.<br /><br />The package says these treats are for cats or dogs, so I took the rest of the package to work, where my boss brings his dog every day. CD (the dog) wasn't so sure about the first one, but took it anyway and ate it after looking at it for a bit. After that first one, she ate another right away when she got it and seems to enjoy them without hesitation now.<br /><br />I would say that these are probably not a good buy for your cats, based on my kitties' reactions, but your dog might give it a shot.

review/summary: healthy, happy snack
review/text: I wanted to really use the treats a few different times and such to make sure they didn't upset donny's stomach and be able to give a more detailed review. :) Thanks for sending me treats - Donny (and now Bella) love it. :)<br /><br />So for the Raw boost bites:<br />I really liked these treats because they were such a novelty and treat and my dog gobbled them up super fast. I think I they would better if they were smaller so that the dog doesn't swallow a huge disc of a treat. I really enjoyed knowing that I was giving my dog a really healthy treat every time and it wasn't going to add to his waistline too much. I think due to the large size of the treat and having a small dog I would see if there was a smaller treat size then I would buy them. They would be great for a larger dog though so you wouldn't have to worry about the large size of the treat.

review/summary: My dog LOVES them
review/text: I have a very very picky dog. It's pretty routine to pick out new treats that look like they should be delicious, but have them be completely snubbed once we get them home. I would honestly probably never have taken a risk on purchasing this treat (as opposed to getting a review sample for free) due to the price, because I'd have assumed there was such a slim chance my dog would agree to eat them. It turns out, though, that she thinks they're fantastic. She gets the same slightly crazed look when you offer her these that she gets for a chunk of hamburger.<br /><br />They suggest that you can crumble them over kibble to make it more appealing, but that bit didn't seem to have much effect on her. Still, she really likes them far more than just about any other treat product I've ever offered her, so I'm impressed. I'm doubly impressed that the list of ingredients involved looks so healthy and that this is basically food rather than treats, even if the dog thinks otherwise.<br /><br />You definitely have to make your own call on how much you're comfortable spending. These aren't exactly going to be a weekly purchase for me, but I fully expect that I'll be buying her a box periodically so that I can have them on hand for when I want something special to give her that's safer to carry around with me than hunks of roast chicken.

review/summary: Cardboard Yummies!
review/text: It's funny because these treats look and smell just like old musty cardboard, but the dogs just adore them. They line right up for them and twice I've had to reprimand them for stealing them right out of my hand when I was trying to give one to the dog next to them. They come in a sealed bag inside the outer paper back which can be re-sealed for freshness. Which didn't really matter much to me because these only lasted a week between my three greedy pups.

review/summary: Cats and Dogs Both Liked Them
review/text: Several reviewers have downgraded these treats because their cats didn't like them.  While I don't doubt this at all, cats being infamous for being finicky, both of my cats like them.  They are large enough that I can break off small bits for the two cats, then break the remainder in half for my two dogs.<br /><br />These would make nice training treats.  They are easily broken into small pieces, are very lightweight, and have very little smell (and what they do have is not objectionable).  They are made from, to quote the package, "minimally processed freeze dried raw ingredients."  They contain no grain.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends feeding these as a "boost" to a pet's diet, 1-2 Boost Bites per day per 20 pounds of the pet's body weight.  If I actually fed them this way, they would cost me several times more than my dogs' actual food costs, and I don't feed them cheap food.  It's hard to imagine anyone who would want to budget these into their pet's diet as anything more than an occasional treat.

review/summary: Nature's Variety Instinct Boost Bites
review/text: I received a box of these and was afraid that they would be hard and I would have to break them up for my cat. Yes, my cat, although the description states dog, the box says for dogs and cats. Anyway, my cat is finicky and usually only enjoys treats that have seafood ingredients. First, the bites was soft, so I didn't have to break it up and second, my cat ate the chicken flavored boost like there was no tomorrow. So I have to say that this is a wonderful treat and good to know that it is healthy and pure.

review/summary: Great Taste and Great Ingredients
review/text: I am a big fan of these treats, which I was given a sample to try. First, they were very easy to break into smaller pieces, in comparison to some other freeze dried treats I've bought like freeze-dried liver. This is important as I like to use treats for training and need to break them into much smaller pieces than most treats are sold. I also will break them up to use inside puzzle toys like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZ8FWE">Nina Ottosson  Tornado </a>. The ingredients are excellent, and being freeze-dried, have a good shelf life compared to some soft treats. Also important to me is they are made in the USA. I'm refusing to buy treats made in China as many dog treats are. Just too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Most important of course is whether my dog likes them. Now, my dog is not very picky, but he definitely reacts with more enthusiasm in training according to how much he likes the treat being used. And boy, does he LOVE these! He was sniffing around the shipping box even before I opened it which isn't something he typically does. Chicken is definitely high on his list of favorite foods, and these seem to have a very desirable smell and taste for my dog. I will definitely put them on my list to buy again.

review/text: Raw boost Bites are a great pet snack.  I have three dogs, a Rottie, a Lab and a Basset Hound.  They all love their treats and went crazy over these snacks.  They are soft and easily breakable.<br /><br />5 Stars for taste.  Although I didn't taste them, I can tell when my dogs REALLY love something.<br /><br />5 Stars for ingredients as the first 4 ingredients are chicken and turkey products.<br /><br />3 Stars for value.  They are more expensive than the dog treats I usually buy for my dogs, and when you have three the quantity in the box just doesn't last that long.<br /><br />You will love this product if you want to give your dogs a more organic natural treat and are willing to pay for the naturalness.  They would also make great training tools, and are easily breakable for smaller dogs.

review/text: I broke each 'cookie' into many little bites, as soon as I did, they quickly devoured them.  I do have to say these are very filling, so expect to feed about 1/2 cookie per cat before they walk away.  Health wise, dried chicken is best for your cat or dog.  Cats especially need to be fed muscle meat, and these treats fit the bill.

review/summary: Very nutritious and convenient
review/text: I was really happy to have these Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried chicken treats when my dog wasn't feeling well and wasn't eating a lot of food.  I broke them into little pieces and gave them to her as a snack.  She likes stuff like this much better when she thinks it is a treat, rather than presenting it as a meal.  I have purchased other Nature's Variety products quite often in the past, but this is my first time getting the freeze dried treats.  I like that meat, fruit, and vegetables are the main ingredients and feel confident in feeding this to my dog.  The only reason I removed a star from the rating is because of the price.  It is quite expensive for the amount offered.  I will probably continue to buy another brand (Stella & Chewy's) freeze dried options because the price, while still high, is much better for the amount of product and my dog seems to like them both the same.

review/summary: The Cats Vote With Their Feet
review/text: The Boost Bites include what appear to be good ingredients: chicken, turkey, and vegetables.  What cat would not like this for a treat?<br /><br />My taste-test focus group consists of four cats.  They range in age from one to eighteen, in weight from eight to thirteen pounds, and include both genders.<br /><br />To test the treats on the focus group, I broke the Bites into cat-size pieces and offered the pieces to the felines on two consecutive days.  On the first try, two of the group ate their pieces, one licked at it but did not eat it, and the fourth cat walked away.<br /><br />I tried again on the second day.  This time, none of them would eat it; they all walked away.<br /><br />Clearly, the Boost Bites may be ok for dogs, but hold little interest for cats.  I suggest that the Bites be sold as dog treats, but not for cats.

review/summary: My dog loves them
review/text: My dog loves these treats.  She is not very discerning when it comes to treats.  She'll eat almost anything.  I try to be discerning in the foods I feed her though.  Looking at the ingredient list, nothing jumps out at me as problematic.  I'm not a vet, so I can't evaluate the ingredients scientifically, but they appear good to me. The treats consist of about 40% protein and 34% fat with other ingredient types including fiber and moisture.  The treats are freeze dried, so they feel dry to the touch and can easily be broken in pieces (although, expect some crumbling as they are soft).  The only ingredient I didn't recognize on the label is "montmorillonite clay."  After some internet sleuthing, it appears to be a natural anti-caking agent.<br /><br />Overall, my dog loves these treats and although I'm not a vet, none of the ingredients strikes me as unhealthy.  I feel comfortable feeding these to my dog.

review/summary: Dog and cat tested; 6 out of 6 give it 4 paws up!
review/text: WOW, what more can I say but A++++ from ALL my pets.  I tried Raw Boost Bites, a freeze dried treat; the chicken Formula.  I loved the ingredients.  Almost all real items I understand and would eat myself (if I wanted to eat that healthy).  The inside package has a zip top to keep the bites fresh.  Each treat is a round "disk" of dried ingredients, a little larger than a cracker and thicker.  There is very little if any smell to them, and they are dry to the touch.  I broke one Boost Bite into 4ths and gave some to each dog to try. The box says 1 Boost Bite per day per 20 pounds of body weight.  I have a 40 pound, a 20 pound, and a 12 pound dog.  Each gobbled it up immediately and looked for more.  I had one piece left and the cat was looking at me I offered it to him and he gobbled it up.  Then I re-inspected the front of the box.  It says it's for dogs AND cats!  I have 3 cats.  One cat will eat anything, but the other two are finicky.  There was no turning down the Boost Bites.  They all loved it.  If you have a finicky cat and are looking for a healthy treat, this has got to be your next purchase.  I was amazed at how much they enjoyed them.  Dog and cat tested.  6 out of 6 give it 4 paws up!

My dog hates fruits and veggies, but she likes these even though they contain some veggies.  Good way to get your dog to eat her veggies.<br /><br />The only thing kind of gross is the crumbly texture.  These feel like particle board or something, and they fall apart.  Dog doesn't care about that, but it was kind of tricky to carry them around to use as treats.  There was little disintegrated bits in the bottom of the bag which I dumped on her dog food.

review/summary: Not for Cats
review/text: I have 3 cats with 3 different personalities. None of them were impressed with these treats at all. I gave each one of them a fourth of a treat as I have small cats and the treats are rather large. All three were interested as I was getting the packaging open. Two of the cats tried to eat the treat, but they were not able to chew it. One gave up after just a little bit and the other gave it a pretty good effort and even came back to try again a minute later. Then I decided to take another treat and crumble it up really good. I laid it out for them. One cat actually ate a few pieces, but that was it. The second cat didn't even come over to try and the third actually tried to bury it.

review/text: I got these thinking they were cat treats, but I guess they are for both dogs and cats, which is a good thing, because my cat did not like them at all.<br /><br />They are kind of big for a cat, so I broke it up into smaller pieces, but my cat just took a few sniffs and walked passed it. So then I gave one to my dog. If he loves something, he will eat it immediately, barely taking time to chew it. If he does not like something he will go bury it and never bother eating it. If it's questionable, he plays with it for a few minutes, then either eats it or buries it. For this treat, he played with it for a few minutes. He did his little puppy dance, bum up in the air, then poking his head at the treat a few times. Totally funny to watch. Then he decided to eat it. So I'd say it's not his favorite, but he decided they aren't bad.

review/text: It indicates on the package as well as on the product page at the Nature's Variety site that this product is for dogs and cats. My cat does not of course speak for all cats, but my cat does not like this product. She sniffed the piece I offered her, then licked it, then walked away. I broke a small piece off and put it in a clean dish in case she might try it later. (I'd rate my cat a 5 on a finicky scale of 1-10.)<br /><br />Later when I was in the kitchen, I saw her go to the dish and take a nibble of the product. Within seconds she started to retch (something she rarely does).<br /><br />Based on this I would say don't buy this product unless and until you've had a chance to discover if your cat or cats will actually eat it.

review/text: These are natural, healthy, freeze dried treats that are about the size of a half dollar and a half-inch thick. They're a little too big to fit in a Kong or the rubber mesh ball I put treats in for my dog so I give her these treats as a reward. The texture is just what you'd expect from something that is freeze-dried and they're quite crumbly so they will make a mess on the floor. Fortunately, my dog is such a hog that she wolfs up every last crumb. Obviously she loves the flavor but my dog isn't picky so I would be shocked if she didn't like these. I would buy these again although probably not very often due to the slightly high price which is  a little higher than what  I usually pay for treats. I most often get the Mother Nature biscuits made by Natura. I gave these treats four stars due to the price and the size being too big. The ingredients are as follows: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.

review/summary: Huge hit with cats and dogs.
review/text: Freeze Dried Treats were a huge hit in my house!  My dog absolutely loved them, and she's a dog who isn't all that into food.  I especially like that since they are dry you can stuff them in a kong without getting the kong stuck with nasty food you can't clean out.  So, great kong treats.  They are also sized perfectly to fit in a large size kong (but easily broken apart into smaller pieces).  My cat also wolfed them down with delight and begged for more.  Being raw they should have many more nutrients than most commercial treats.

review/summary: I wasn't impressed...
review/text: Okay, first of all, this says for dogs AND cats, and I sampled it because it actually only said "cat treats."  Ummm, I have three cats, and none of them would touch this stuff.  First of all, they're HUGE, round discs.  You have to break it up into about 30 pieces (which is soft and gross and makes your hands stink) and even then, none of my cats were at all enthused with the results.  They sniffed, turned their nose up, and walked away.<br /><br />The dog however, was happy to clean up behind them.  She loved these treats, and they're definitely more large-dog size.  Each treat is a couple inches in diameter, almost an inch thick, I have NO IDEA why they would label these as cat treats.<br /><br />They're a little expensive for what they are, and there aren't that many in the package.  However the ingredients are good, and my dog loved them.  I'm just pretty disappointed these weren't cat treats since that's what I had originally wanted.<br /><br />Good for dogs, find something else if you have a cat!

review/text: All I can say about these treats is they are not too nasty (they smell OK, and they are not slimy), and my dogs like them. They are very easy to break into smaller pieces, which is good since each one is about the size of an Oreo cookie. Recommended.

review/summary: Good for an occasional treat!
review/text: My dogs LOVE these and so has every foster dog that we have given it to.  These are a treat not a replacement for a meal.  They are full of great ingredients and none of the bad stuff.  They have a high protein and fat content but you shouldn't be giving your dogs 10 a day.  Honestly, we have dogs that range from 35-60 pounds and they only get a 1/2 a cookie at a time.  My husband is a veterinarian and he was impressed by the quality of the ingredients.  They are a great treat and we will definitely buy again.

review/summary: My cat went nuts for these things.
review/text: My male cat isn't too into treats. We even got some plain freeze-dried chicken chunks recently and he was excited but not freakout-excited like my other cat gets.<br /><br />But as soon as he got a whiff of this, he went from disinterested in treat time to holy-moly-let-me-climb-your-leg-give-it-to-me-now excited. He ran in circles trying to anticipate where I'd put it down!<br /><br />The pucks are kind of huge for cats - 1.75" diameter - but they're a soft puck made of freeze-dried powdery foods, so it's easy for them to nibble and fuss with it until it's gone. It takes them about a minute to fully finish their pucks, even with ravenous chomping.<br /><br />It has natural ingredients, but it's not all meat, so there are veggies in there as well. Is that good? I don't know. Most "primal" foods do have some vegetation in there as well, so it seems standard for this type of pet food line.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is that the pucks are powdery enough that they make a crumbly mark where they are set down, so if I treat the cats on my carpet or couch, there's powder left over that they can't get at without licking it up. Other than that, this is a winner. We are rotating between this treat and the freeze-dried chicken breast treat, and one cat prefers these and one cat prefers the other, so overall, I definitely like this product and plan to buy more when my initial package runs out.

review/summary: Portioned better for dogs than cats: ingredient list is healthy & natural!
review/text: These Raw Boost Bites from Nature's Variety Instinct line are about the size of very thick ginger-snap with a recommended feeding amount of 1 to 2 biscuits a day.  High in quality protein and mixed with a vairety of wholesome vegetales, fruits and natural heart-heathy oils, I wouldn't hesitate to feed one of these a day to my dog.  However, even though my cats love them, I only allow them a quater of a crumbled biscuit a couple times a week.  Although ground chicken bone is 1 of the lesser ingredients, you do not find "bone meal" or any other waste product such as "brewers rice" orother nutritionally depeleted fillers.  Just plenty or good dark greens, carrots, apples and butternut squash to help make  a biscuit out of the Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver and Turkey Heart that form the protein base of this healthy treat.  There is a small amount of honey in the product as well.  The ingredients list is one of the best I've seen on a commercially available pet product in a long time.<br /><br />Both my cats and my dog anjoyed the treats a little too much so I have to hide them behind a locked cabinet door!  My favorite aspect of this treat is the lack of dyes and the fact that they aren't rock hard.  They are easy to divide into sensible servings for the cats and probably better for them than their own dry food even though I use a high quality dry food for the cats and feed mostly a meat diet to the dogs.  This is a "raw" product, which means the ingredients where not cooked above a certain temperature.  The product was then freeze-dried to presevre freshness.  As long as you keep the bag well-sealed and out of direct heat & sunlight, you shouldn't have any problems with spoilage.<br /><br />They recommend 1 to 2 bites per day per 20 Lbs of body weight and to asjust for your feeding accordingly.  Obviously that means subtracting a little if you plan to use these as a daily supplement.  Again, with the cats, I cut the disk in half and then crumbled half of that into pieces and used it as a training reward.  If you arent' sure what the correct amount is for your pet, you should talk to your vet, call the company or err on the side of offering less rather than more.  Overfeeding even a well-formulated food can lead to obesity, especially if your pets love these Boost Bites as much as mine did.

review/summary: Just average
review/text: I have two Norwegian Elkhounds, one 6 years old and one 6 months old, and a 10 year old cocker spaniel. I am always looking for new treats to use as rewards for them. So, I took up the chance to give these a try.<br /><br />First thing I noticed, is that these treats come in a almost "health food/gourmet" type bag leading one to believe that they are an all natural healthy treat. After reading the ingredients they are just like most other treats on the market. There is absolutely nothing special about them. That's ok, dogs like treats.<br /><br />Second the individual treats are fairly large. Even my adult Elkhound who is 50 pounds, I would never give her a full sized treat from this bag. For the ingredients they are just too big.<br /><br />Third, the packaging is made to make it look like the box is plumb full of treats. When in actuality there are not that many treats in the bag at all. But, keep in mind that each treat should realistically be broken up into 3-4 pieces at a minimum.<br /><br />Did the dogs like them? Sure they did, there was no messy "side effects" after digestion so that's always a plus. But, at the end of the day the size of the treats, how few there really are, and the ingredients just make this a very average treat. Nothing special here.

review/summary: So So As Far As Treats Go
review/text: First of all I used the bites as a treat and not as a substitute for their normal kibble.  I have two dogs one 20 pds and one 30 pds and each dog gets two treats a day.  I typically buy my treats from 3 Dog Bakery or some other high end dog store and over time feel like I know what my dogs like.  As far as giving the bites as a treat they are way too fatty and high in protein to give a whole size bite as a treat (these were designed to be a subsitute for kibble) so I broke them in half and gave one to each dog.  They ate them and continued to eat them daily until I ran out.  However my dogs go crazy for certain treats and will take a treat to a safe place and if a treat is really good the bigger dog will try and get the crumbs from the smaller dog.  WIth the Nature Variety the dogs merely took the treat and ate it on the spot.  They did not search out crumbs and did not seem to be overly excited for this treat as others I have given them in the past.<br /><br />Once again this was meant to subsitute kibble but in my opinion it would get expensive quickly so I used my sample bag for treats.

review/summary: This is not an ordinary meat treat for pets.
review/text: These treats are definitely different.  They are practically weightless, and have an odd texture like a cross between a packing peanut and paperboard, with a dusty exterior.  For some reason, I keep thinking of a rice cake or a meringue cookie when I look at these.  This is not necessarily bad, it is just different.<br /><br />My schnauzer was more hesitant with this treat, I think it was due largly to the texture, as she is used to hard, crunchy stuff.  She took one big chomp and it crumbled, ending up as a pile of small pieces at her feet that she ate carefully, one or two at a time, until it was finished.<br /><br />The smell of these treats is appealing to me, actually.  We have the chicken variety.  Unlike some meat treats that seem to radiate with a salty, bouillion-cube-like scent, these have a subtle chicken soup-like fragrance.<br /><br />The package contains 4 oz., which works out to about 16 treats.  This is pricey compared to, say, Milkbones, but as a human who is willing to spend more for quality ingredients, I wouldn't call the cost outrageous, especially since I don't give these to my dog daily.<br /><br />I prefer treats that work my dog's instincts to gnaw and chew, and if her teeth get a bit of cleaning at the same time then I'm happy.  The Raw Boost Bites don't give her any of that.  However, as an occasional treat to give her something interesting and different, these are a fairly good option.

review/summary: Dogs went wild for it, cat not so much
review/text: I tested this product out on two dogs and a cat. Daisy, my neighbor's border collie, went "absolutely ape" for it, in the words of her owner. I saw this myself; the dog would "walk" for twenty feet if you held the treat up just out of her reach and started walking away. My girlfriend's dachshund Monkey had a similar reaction. Monkey would snatch up the treat and run into the next room away from everyone else, and scarf it down in the corner. The treats were a bit large for her to swallow whole (about the size of Kennedy half-dollars and about half an inch thick), so I started breaking them up for her so she wouldn't choke in her enthusiasm.<br /><br />Speaking of breaking them up, they become very crumbly, so make sure you either break them over the counter or be prepared to sweep.<br /><br />The crumbs actually worked to my advantage with my girlfriend's cat Cleo. She would not eat the treat by itself, even when broken up. However, when I broke it up in her food, she ate it, though she gave no indication that it was any different from her normal food.<br /><br />The Raw Boost Bites package get bonus points for being irresistible to canines and having healthy ingredients. Since it's advertised as a cat treat as well, I can't give it five stars since Cleo was apathetic toward it, but I know what I'm buying the dogs from now on.

review/text: My dog loves stella and chewy's raw freeze-dried dog food.<br />These Raw Bites from Instinct are pretty similar (grain-free, raw, freeze-dried), except the size is smaller to act as "Treat-sized" bites.<br /><br />Treat-sized is great b/c these little disks can fit into a puzzle toy. Regular Stella & Chewy's are a bit too large for most toys. Secondly, the Raw Bites are a touch harder, therefore less flaky and crumbly than Stella & Chewys. This results in less mess!<br /><br />Overall a great treat and product, just a little pricey (as with all raw, grain-free freeze-dried dog food).

review/summary: Instinct Raw Boost Bites are a good tool for obedience and behavior training of dogs!
review/text: The Raw Boost Bites are � inch thick discs that are about 1-1/2 inch in diameter.  Some treats on the market today range from hard to soft and chewy.  I would classify these treats as somewhere between those two ranges.  The bites have an appearance and texture of a � inch cardboard disc that was easily broken up into smaller pieces.  Of particular interest to us was the ingredients of the treat and we were happy to see that all the ingredients (other than the preservatives) were natural food products.  An added bonus for us was the fact that this treat is made in the USA.<br /><br />In our house, we do "controlled" feeding; meaning that each dog is given a portioned amount of dog food at the same time twice a day.  This is in direct opposition to "free" feeding (having food available at all times throughout the day).  They are all fed in their crated kennel.  Our cats are free fed; with the food on a perch out of the reach of the dogs.<br /><br />A total of 8 dogs and 2 cats were tested for this review.  Five of the dogs and both cats are ours and 3 of the dogs were visiting at the time this testing took place.  The breed of dogs tested were 3 Welsh Pembroke Corgi's, 2 Border Collie adults, 1 Belgian Sheep dog, 1 Border Collie mix puppy and 1 Golden Retriever.  Four dogs are female and four dogs are male.  Six of the dogs are highly food driven, one is somewhat picky of what it eats and the last dog is very picky of what it eats.  The cats are of no particular breed and both are female.  All dogs tested were fed 2 hours prior to testing.<br /><br />We wanted a controlled testing environment whereby each dog was given the opportunity to visit a small bowl of 1 Raw Boost Bite that was broken up into smaller pieces than the original.  Each dog, one at a time and alone, was taken out of their crated kennels and let loose inside of the house.  Each dog easily found the treat.  The 3 Corgi's, the Border Collie puppy mix, 1 of the Border Collies adults, and the Golden Retriever (a total of 6 of the 8 dogs) immediately feasted on the treat and thoroughly enjoyed the treat.  All of these dogs are highly food driven.<br /><br />The other Border Collie adult sniffed the treat, went away for about 30 seconds and returned to the treat bowl and ate each piece but not nearly as vigorously as the other 6 dogs.  This dog is pretty "picky" of what it eats and is not food driven at all.  The Belgian Sheepdog is very picky of what it eats and after one sniff, refused to even try the treat.<br /><br />My two cats live a relaxed life style of sitting on the couch and since they are not trained will only eat soft food.  They both took one look at Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Chicken flavor and walked away.<br /><br />In conclusion, we were pleased with this product.  Boost Bites do not get a perfect rating because one of my dogs and the cats did not want to eat them.  After the response most of the dogs had to this product, I will be ordering these again for them to act as an obedience training tool.

I fully expected him to turn his nose up at this, but he gobbled it right down. I'm really impressed by the ingredients. Grain-free and all natural. I feed both the dog and the cat grain-free food from Blue Buffalo, so I'm obviously a little picky about what they eat. After reading the ingredients, I have no problems feeding them this. It's a great, healthy snack and I will happily buy it for them in the future.

review/summary: Awesome but pricey; however best pet 'treat' ever
review/text: If you get these (and I do highly recommend them) you will look at them and think is this sand paper? They are freeze dried so they have an odd consistency. But your pets saliva quickly solves that. They must smell great, for our cats at least they LOVE them. Love them. They like other treats but I have never seen them like any treat more.<br /><br />I take one 'biscuit' and break it in half. I then break each half in half. I serve 2 quarters to one cat and the other 2 to the other. They gulp them down. And the ingriedient list is spectacular. So good I have been tempted to try them. The highest weight ingridients are chicken, turkey, turkey live, turked heart, pumpkinseeds....Then a bunch of other mostly vegetables. Crude protien is minimum of 40%.<br /><br />I feel great about giving these treats to my cats. By far the healtiest treats we have ever given them. They also come in a nice package with a resealable inner plastic bag. I would highly recommend these for cats and small dogs. Medium and big dogs this can be an expensive product. also a bonus made by a small US independent pet food company. I was lucky enough to get to try these but I will also quite likely buy them. I just feel very good about getting high quality 'real food' into our pets' diets.

review/summary: Finally a dog treat that our dog actually likes
review/text: We've tried a number of different types of treats for our dog, who has remained steadfastly indifferent to most of them.  She has generally preferred table scraps as treats instead of treats marketed for dogs.  However, when this package arrived and we opened it, she immediately responded.  Just the smell was sufficient to get her excited, and she clearly enjoyed the treats when we gave them to her.  The enthusiasm she displayed was pretty much the best endorsement I could ask for.<br /><br />Because the package indicated that these treats were intended for both dogs and cats, we also offered some to our cat.  Here the reaction was must more indifferent.  While the smell seemed to interest him, he never actually ate the treat.  So I don't know that these are necessarily the best treat for a cat, but they are certainly dog-tested and approved.

review/summary: Not good for cats - too hard to eat
review/text: With all due respect to Amazon reviewer "Book and Dog Lover", I can't imagine any cat would enjoy these treats.  Because they're freeze-dried, they are too hard for a cat to chew without an incredible amount of effort.  Even as I held the treat in my fingers, my poor cat could not bite off a chunk.  Are we supposed to add water? I don't know because there are no feeding instructions on the packaging.  I attempted to add some water it didn't reconstitute anything.  The treats remained hard as rocks.  Breaking up the piece into smaller chunks didn't seem to make a difference either.  Plus, the addition of water suddenly made the treats unappealing to my cat.  Apparently all she liked was smelling and licking the sticky powder coating around the treat.

review/text: I love this company so was excited to try these new treats. Both our cats are 2 years old. These remind me of little hockey pucks. Easy to cut or break up. Each treat has 20 - 23 calories so I want to make sure to count that in with the calories they are getting for the day. I gave them each 1/4 of a chicken treat and they grabbed it off the plate to eat it. They loved it!  When I was getting ready to give them 1/4 more they were meowing for more and then purred while they were eating it. They were very happy. And so was I. These treats are  healthy for them  and that is important to me.

review/summary: the cat wouldn't eat it
review/text: I was excited to get some new treats for my cat. When I had the package in front of her she was rubbing all aganist it so I was hoping she would like them. I gave one to her whole at first and she ignored it. I thought the treat may be too big for her since they were a bit bigger than silver dollars so I broke it up and put it in her food dish with some of her food. She basically ate all her food but ignored the pieces of the treat.<br /><br />I do like that there is nothing artificial in these treats. The box states that what is contained in the treats include: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove. However, even if it is all natural, if the cat won't eat it, it does me no good.<br /><br />I know all cats and dogs are different so some will like the treats. However for me, I will not be buying these in the future.

review/summary: My Finicky, Older Cat Licks the Bowl Clean When I Give Her This
review/text: This is the first treat I've gotten that says it is for both cats and dogs, so I was a little skeptical at first that my cat, Lily, would like it. She's 15 years old and has become very finicky about what she eats. She now turns up her nose at our Purina dry food, which used to be her favorite. I've been feeding her cans of salmon and gravy (Fancy Feast) but even with that she leaves a lot of leftover salmon pieces in the bowl (!)<br /><br />Discouraged, I had nothing to lose and decided to give her half of a Raw Boost treat to see if she'd like it. The box says you should give your cat only one or 2 treats per 20lbs of the cat's weight. Well, my Lily is a tiny cat and weighs only 5 lbs or so, so imagine my dilemma. Taking the treat out of the package, I was amused at how much the treat resembles a peanut butter cookie. It's soft, however, and easy to tear in half. It feels crumby like a cookie, however, so I decided to break it down into little "crumbs" for Lily to eat. She has problems with digestion and throws up more than the typical cat, so I'm always careful to chop up her food into small, bite-sized pieces.<br /><br />Imagine my relief that Lily loves it! She licked her dish clean and begged for more. I'm going to make a note to buy more.

review/text: My four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them.<br /><br />The treat to human eyes is totally unappealing. Not only are they freeze-dried raw but they look hairy (similar to a dust bunny I would find under the bed). In size, they are the circumference and height of a double-stuffed Oreo cookie. They are also very light and as easy to break up as a wafer.<br /><br />I broke several into smaller bite-sized pieces and left them out overnight.  One of my cats looked like he was going to take a bite but eventually walked away. The other three smelled the pieces and left without even trying them.<br /><br />The box of the Chicken Formula Raw Boost Bites claims these treats are for cats and dogs and are made of chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, etc.  Each large piece is 23 calories and they recommend 1 to 2 pieces per 20 pounds of body weight.  However, since my four cats won't eat them, I'm going to throw out all this goodness to the wildlife.  Maybe some critter will eat it.

review/summary: My dog **LOVED** them!
review/text: I used to feed my pets a raw diet (now I feed Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula) so I was pleasantly surprised to see a commercial product even MENTIONING raw feeding on the label. The fact that it's made here in the USA is another huge plus in its favor.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure what to make of these, they look....weird. Like space food or something. My dog heard the package rustling though and immediately ran over to see what I had. When I held a piece out to her she was reluctant; she sniffed it thoroughly and acted like she wasn't going to eat it. No surprise there, she likes very few treats. I haven't had much luck testing out pet products on her, as she is so picky. (You wouldn't think a mutt who ate trash for months as a stray would be this picky but she is) She decided though that she wanted this treat: she snapped it out of my hand and ran behind the couch to eat it, so that no one could even *think* of taking it from her. Normally she just takes her favorite treat a few feet away from me, so the fact that she ran and hid to eat this means a lot.<br /><br />My elderly (15 year old) cat even showed an interest in these, which is not normal for her in the least. I haven't seen her accept a treat in YEARS.<br /><br />My pets' enthusiasm for this treat puts it on my recommend and buy list!

review/text: I was pleased with the smell of the product, it smelled like actual food. I crumbled one piece and added warm water for my cats. They were happy to lap up the resulting gravy, but we're not at all interested in chunks of the product itself. I will keep experimenting, as there is interest there. All in all, I am pleased. Cats can be notoriously picky.

review/summary: Most of My Furry Children Liked Them, But Not All of Them
review/text: I have six cats an am constantly trying different treats. I try to make sure that they get the healthiest of all foods but this is not always an option. Most treats on the market are glorified potato chips for cats.<br /><br />The first think I noticed is these treats smell. Not horribly, but you can tell there is real food in them. They are a 1 � in circular biscuit. The perfect size for a dog, but I have to break it into six pieces for my cats. When breaking the biscuit up, it tends to crumble.<br /><br />Of the five cats that eat treats, four were right there begging for them. When I put the treat pieces down one wolfed it down right away, two sniffed them thoroughly then ate them, and the fourth walked away without eating it. I gave another piece to the fifth cat. After sniffing it, he ate the treat. I tried a second time and the same cat refused to eat the treat but the other three wolfed theirs down and tried to fight over the one that was left on the floor. They seem to be a big hit among the furry children.<br /><br />The first thing that I'm concerned about is the universal cat/dog treat. I was always under the impression that there is a reason why we have both cat and dog food. Both animals have different nutritional needs so they need to be fed separate foods. I'm a little leery of a product that is advertising as a meal for both animals.<br /><br />The Amazon Product page advertises these as a meal, treat, or food topper. The Nature's Variety website says that these are specifically treats. Please make sure you don't feed these as food. Also, make sure to adjust the food so you are not feeding too many calories to your pet.<br /><br />Finally, the box is huge, but the bag inside is small. It looks like there are only 16 biscuits in the bag. Having that in mind, you are paying almost eleven dollars (as of 8/3/12) for a box. To me, that is way too much to spend on treats.<br /><br />Over all, I do think they are a good treat for pets. There are a lot of healthy ingredients and are a big hit at my house. Honestly I will not be buying these anytime because of the cost of them.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Not Suitable For Cats
review/text: I selected these to feed to my cats.  Because amazon didn't list the ingredients I had little to go on.  I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried "raw" chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of "treats" that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br /><br />These "bites" are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br /><br />The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.  They were a tad more enthusiastic although they appreciated having the biscuits broken into bits too despite their bone crunching swallowing rodents whole abilities.  They struggled with the bites just as much as the indoor kitties.<br /><br />The bites seem more suitable for a dog.  Dogs aren't known to do a lot of chewing & are not usually as fussy as a cat.  I doubt a spongy dry biscuit would matter to an animal that tends to wolf things down within a gulp or two.<br /><br />Even though this is a product I'm not likely to buy in the future, I do not feel it deserves less than 3 stars when I think of all the disgusting garbage that is on store shelves for us to buy & poison our pets with.<br /><br />Ingredients as per the box:<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkin seeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flax seeds, Montomrillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols (note: probable GMO ingredient)with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin (note: this is being promoted as a prebiotic for fiber & digestive health.  There is evidence that inulin may not be safe for the digestive system.  It's safety is questionable.  I avoid it.), Sage, Clove.

review/summary: Maggie Sez "More!"
review/text: Maggie went nuts over these Instinct Raw Boost Bites, and she is a very finicky cat. Liddy was mildly interested, with a nibble here and a nibble there, and Frankie is just peculiar; she will only eat her dull kibble food. The list of ingredients on the box of these freeze dried treats looks mighty fine, with everything from chicken to ground flaxseeds and broccoli. Each treat is a 1 � inch round, with the slight consistency and look of a shortbread cookie, and has a fairly decent smell for the human nose. You can easily break them into 4 or more pieces for your cat.<br /><br />These round treats are for both dogs and cats, and are estimated as 1 or 2 for every 20 lbs. of weight. At the rate Maggie would like to eat these, she'd have to let out the buttons in her fur jacket. It's nice though that I've found something she likes, and that it's such a healthy treat. Thank you Nature's Variety for making a treat made of good, natural food for our fussy fur friends. Packaging is good, with a clear resealable bag inside the cardboard display box.

review/summary: Two out of three cats say NO.
review/text: Was it the sound of the plastic bag or the smell? Anyway, two of my cats came running when I opened the package. These things are WAY too big for cats, so I broke off pieces for each of them. The girl ate a piece after much pawing, but would not eat a second small piece. The boy sniffed and sniffed and pawed and pawed, but wouldn't eat a bit, and both of them left. Then our third cat walked in, obviously intrigued by the smell. He ate the others' leftovers and looked around for more. So, I guess that's about a 33 percent acceptance rate.<br /><br />Besides being way too big for cats, these things look... weird is the nicest word I can think of. They look like hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes. They even have weird hair-like things sticking out of them.<br /><br />The ingredients include pumpkin seeds, apples, carrots, squash, flax seeds, broccoli, and more plant products. Cats eat meat. And I really have to wonder what function another ingredient, "Montmorillonite Clay" (a.k.a. Fullers Earth) serves.<br /><br />These are sized for a medium to large dog (following the directions, an average cat should get less than half a "cookie" per day--if they even want one), and it seems to me the ingredients are more suited for dogs as well...if you are OK with the clay.

review/summary: Weird
review/text: I don't really know what to make of these treats.  I was first drawn to them because of the claim they were for both cats and dogs and since it is something of an extra special treat it's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.  But I was not impressed on any level.  Lets be honest, we all by these over priced pet treats for ourselves and not the pets.  If you honestly wanted to make your pet ecstatic you would go to the butcher shop, get tub of chicken livers or giblets, cook them up and have very happy pets.  For me this product is outrageously expensive, has an offensive smell and a texture of sawdust.<br /><br />The makers are trying to draw you in with this idea of it being "Raw" but do you want to feed a pet, or better yet even handle a product where the main ingredient is chicken if it actually is raw?  Though it doesn't say so on the package I don't think this item is actually freeze dried raw meat, but instead is supposed to appeal to the human's desire to feed their pet something that's healthy, i.e. raw diet for dogs.  But I see nothing in this item to make it any healthier than many other pet treats that are much cheaper in price.  I was also a little shocked at some of the health claims made on the package too.  Apparently, "Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidents of ear infections and healthier teeth & gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experienced."  I have to call B.S. on that claim.<br /><br />The only real positive thing I can say about this product is that on one cat loved it.  My dog and other cat ate it, but weren't crazy about it.<br /><br />2 stars.

review/text: it's just too small to scoop, I thought the packaging would make dispensing easier - but for me it's more difficult. The cans are about twice the size of pringle cans, it's difficult to get my hand inside to dip the portion out. I probably will just go back to the bag.

review/summary: Purina needs to take the wheat out of their items!
review/text: For those who really watch what their cats are eating, or whose cats<br />have allergies, we need to know the ingredients before feeding it to our pets.<br /><br />I looked up the list of ingredients (never listed on Amazon!), and have pasted it here.<br />There are many things that can affect the health of cats negatively. Purina seems to be just<br />a profit-geared-only company anymore, stretching food with all kinds of fillers that are not<br />good for cats.<br /><br />Water sufficient for processing,<br />turkey,<br />liver,<br />wheat gluten,<br />meat by-products,<br />corn starch-modified,<br />cheese (source of cheddar cheese),<br />artificial and natural flavors,<br />salt,<br />sodium caseinate,<br />calcium phosphate,<br />soy protein concentrate,<br />soybean oil,<br />potassium chloride,<br />added color,<br />dried whey,<br />taurine,<br />sodium tripolyphosphate,<br />choline chloride,<br />Vitamin E supplement,<br />thiamine mononitrate,<br />zinc sulfate,<br />ferrous sulfate,<br />niacin,<br />sorbic acid (a preservative),<br />calcium pantothenate,<br />Vitamin A supplement,<br />menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity),<br />copper sulfate,<br />manganese sulfate,<br />pyridoxine hydrochloride,<br />riboflavin supplement,<br />Vitamin B-12 supplement,<br />biotin,<br />folic acid,<br />Vitamin D-3 supplement,<br />potassium iodide.<br />A-4689<br />Manufactured by: Nestl&eacute; Purina PetCare Company, St. Louis, MO 63164 USA<br />Pro Plan Adult Cat Turkey & Cheddar Cheese Entr&eacute;e In Gravy is formulated to meet<br />the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance of adult cats.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />You'll have to make your own decision based on your cat's health, but I have to pass on this one.<br />If the liver (can affect diabetic cats greatly), wheat, corn, food dye and soy out of it, I might<br />give it a try.

review/summary: Big Disappointment
review/text: I was very disappointed in this purchase. From the picture shown I thought I would get several different Disney dispensers. I received 10 Mickey Mouse and two Daisy Duck. Since my daughter has these two already I wasted my money, $20 plus S&H. I will say it is more my resonsibility than anyone else. The seller had a disclaimer stating that the 12 dispensers were bundled and therefore contents could not be guaranteed. But 10 of one and 2 of another. I think that all Pez dispensers that come in bulk without a specified assortment should be avoided.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I guess I should have read closer that they don't guarantee all the characters, but our box contained all Mickeys, one Donald, one Goofy and two Daisys, no Pluto or Minnie who is my daughter's favorite.  You are better off going to a store so you can pick the ones you want, the little money saved was not worth the disappointment.

review/summary: A healthy treat for Charly
review/text: I am very particular about what I feed my 7 pound Maltese and generally don't give him commercially made food or treats after so many pet food scares.  However, these are made with "real" food, and I would feel safe eating them myself (although I don't!).  Charly likes them and I feel good giving them to him.  They're a bit bigger than I need for my little guy, so I break them up a bit.  They break easily enough that I can give him 1/4 to 1/2 at a time as a treat.

review/summary: very good, YUM
review/text: I have a particularly picky dog but he loves these.  They are a good size (even for my 100 pounder) as they aren't miniscule, but I can give him two or three and not feel like he is getting overfed with treats.  So hey, they're gluten free too!

review/summary: My bichon loves HALO food, but not this one...
review/text: I was surprised to see the package is small.  But since my dog eats the salmon and chicken dry dog food from the HALO brand for years, and he loves it, so I was going to give a try for the dog treats.  For some reason, he didn't want to eat it at all - probably it doesn't have a strong dog food/chicken smell?  But I'm sure they made it with good ingredients - I can see the oats in the biscuits.  I wish they could improve the flavor a bit to attract the dogs more - since I have seen other reviewer having similar comments.

review/text: My "kids" have a problem with a lot of the things that are in dog food, so I have been trying to find the best food available for them that doesn't have a lot of bad stuff in it.  This is the first food/treat I have found that fits the bill and they love it!  It is all made from human food, so a human could actually eat it if they had a weird urge!  ha  It's all good for them, and it even smells good for them!
