review/summary: Rawhide Rolls
review/text: I have seen 9 dogs chew these rawhides.  They all love them, and most of them are clean.  However, one of these dogs will rip any toy up.  She is the type of dog that might pull them apart and leave pieces on the floor.  These dogs never left a piece behind.  Every now and then I will see another dog with it in pieces but it isn't very common and they always clean it up.  They don't leave any of it behind.<br /><br />The only time I ever saw one as dangerous for the dog is my english mastiff had it all slobbery and it unrolled.  He wasn't smart enough to realize that he couldn't have half of it down his throat and still be chewing on the other half.  I just pulled it out and threw it away.  I still give them to him and we only had a problem that one time.  It has saved us from many dog problems.  They are happy to chew on these and know they are for them.  We tried to have them laying around for them all the time so when they feel the urge to chew, they go for their own toy.  I think they are great for puppies to save your own stuff.  Adults love them also.<br /><br />The product itself is wonderful.  I was buying them for almost $11 at SAMs (15 pack) and I can't bring myself to buy them on amazon because of the price as it is double.  I buy a lot of things through Amazon, but this isn't a product I intend to buy from Amazon.  If you are really interested in these rawhide rolls, put it in a search engine and see what you can find.  I have seen a lot of them for $14.99.  I only searched for them because I couldn't find them at Sams last time I was there but if I have to go somewhere else to get them, it won't be amazon.<br /><br />Either way, the product is great.  I first bought them for the dogs that like to chew on things, it turned out that the ones who don't usually chew on things like them too.<br /><br />My dad has border collies for working cattle, one of them had pretty bad plaque build up and the vet thought he needed to be put to sleep to clean it off.  Something happened and he didn't get in when he was supposed to. I gave some of these rawhide rolls to him, he didn't need anything more.  After awhile of chewing on them, he was cleaned up.<br /><br />If Amazon gets more reasonable, I would definitely be willing to buy them through Amazon.  I will keep using this product for my dogs, and after I gave them to my parents dogs, they decided they were a GOOD TO HAVE product too.

review/summary: Good price but bones break off a lot of shards
review/text: Ordered these for our German Shepherd.  The price was really good for the number you get.  When she gets chewing them however, lots of sharp bone shards break off.  This wouldn't bother me except that she immediately swallows them.  We've bought other brands that didn't seem to break as much.

review/summary: Rawhide Rolls
review/text: I like this product because it is priced well and does not leave a mess. It is also from free range cattle so there is a different aroma to the chew sticks. The smell get my dogs excited and it's not obnoxious or overwhelming, it's subtle, pleasant, and fades after a few hours. I think it's a wonderful product for pets who get into trouble while you are gone. It keeps them occupied and your shoes & furniture safe!

review/summary: Fair price, but not great taste.
review/text: I shop, shop, and shop around some more before buying almost anything. While these retriever rolls are marked at a fair price, the value isn't really there. None of our three dogs have finished a single roll. When they are given a roll, they enjoy it for about 15 minutes, never to be seen again. However, when they are given a Cadet roll, they will gnaw on it until it is gone. Clearly, my dogs prefer the taste of Cadet.

review/text: This flavoring tastes pretty darn good to me!  I mix it with stevia in my AM iced espresso with cream and it is very close to an iced starbucks caramel macchiato.<br /><br />A little bit goes a LONG way and be careful of the coloring, it will take a bit of scrubbing to get spills off white.<br /><br />Also, I add a few drops to the vanilla extract when I bake and it really adds a great depth of flavor!

review/summary: Americans beware, curious labeling
review/text: the product is listed as a 150g 6-pack.<br />Traditionally, when US companies do a bundle-pack they list the size of the individuals...so a 6 pack of canned soda would be a 12oz 6-pack, we would never see that listed as a 72oz 6-pack<br /><br />I foolishly assumed I was getting a real bargain, 6 150g bags, for about $8!<br />Oh so wrong. It's a 6-pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL<br /><br />So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.<br /><br />The chips themselves were good, though! I only took stars off for the somewhat deceptive descriotion and the fact it took a couple of weeks for them to arrive.

I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.

They love the souffles' and basically, most of the rest of them but these florentines, well, I can put them in the mix about once a month and that's all they'll eat them.  Don't know why - they like most of the other Fancy Feast varieties.  I think maybe they may be a little too upper class for my Persians!  I do recommend them though because of their high nutritional value and more natural contents.

review/summary: My moment of Zen
review/text: I have always loved the flavor of peaches.  Maybe it's because there was a peach tree in my grandmother's back yard and the taste of peaches takes me back to the warm and cozy feelings of childhood memories.  Sipping this wonderfully peachy tea makes me think of simpler, less complicated times and let's me know that, at least for the moment, all is well.  The peach flavor is natural and true and the zing that's added by the hint of ginger compliments the peach flavor perfectly.  And it's calorie and caffeine free!  What more could you want?

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: This tea is delicious.  It has mild ginger notes and bright peach notes, all over the smooth black tea flavor.  Of course, the version with caffeine also tastes delicious, but if you need a caffeine-free tea this is a great choice.  The price per teabag works out to be about 30 cents a bag.  You can use a bag twice if you are thrifty.  I have trouble finding this tea in stores so I am happy it is offered here.

review/text: As advertised, all seven seeds arrived in tact and all 7 germinated.  Six months in, all seven are still alive.<br /><br />Know what you're getting into when you buy Voodoo Lily seeds.  These plants come from the same genus as the Titan Arum, the Corpse Flower, and like the Titan, will produce a fowl smelling bloom.  Fortunately, the plant will not bloom for several years and in the mean time will reliably produce healthy waxy foliage that have a unique look whether potted or planted outdoors.  As they are altogether fun and easy to grow, I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I had just finished a package of Boyer Brothers vanilla (that company is long gone, but it had been in my freezer for a very long time), and it was fantastic.  I know this is a different company, but I was hoping there would be similarity.  You can't taste the vanilla at all, and the coffee flavor is not good.  I'm not a coffee expert, so please forgive the vague description.  I found it bitter, even when I used less and set the machine to "regular" instead of "bold."  Boyer's Butterscotch was great, so I'll be going back to that.

review/summary: Dentyne is better than Trident
review/text: I chew gum daily. I used to be a fan of Trident but then they started getting rid of their regular gum and started selling more expensive, more fruity gum (Dentyne has been doing this too). The problem is the flavor did not last long at all on the fruity gums. Dentyne's gum lasts a VERY long time. I started buying this online a few months ago because this specific type of gum in the store was always unavailable. I really think Dentyne and Trident are forcing people to buy the more expensive, fruity gum that doesn't last by cutting back on this regular gum in the stores. At first buying this bulk purchase was about the same price as buying a bunch at the store but I recently went to the store and the 3-count multi-packs are over $3. So the bulk purchase on Amazon is currently a way better price but I hope it doesn't go up. It hasn't gone up since the beginning of 2011 as far as I know. I need gum that lasts while I'm working out or out and about it. I get a clean feel as well after chewing.

review/summary: Wonderful, delicate Rosemary flavor in a Bold Parmesan Crisp!
review/text: Have tried both the Rosemary-flavored and the Italian Herb-flavored Parmesan Crisps.  Definitely prefer the Rosemary!  The Italian Herb-flavored variety is a little "busier" to my taste.  Although I haven't tried them with a glass of wine, I'm sure they would be a BIG hit at a party where wine is served.  I enjoy them all by themselves, slowly savoring the flavor, chewing small bites to make them last longer!  Also, it's possible the batch of Italian Herb-flavored Parmesan crisps I received might be a little stale, affecting my enjoyment of them, as opposed to what seemed like a fresher batch of Rosemary-flavored Parmesan Crisps.  At any rate, my first choice is the Rosemary-flavored Parmesan Crisps!

You can frost German Chocolate cakes, but we also now add a container to boxed brownie mix to make a gooey 9x13 treat.  We also add a container to a butter pecan boxed cake mix to make a bundt cake that is so elegant and tasty.  You can find recipes everywhere for those two desserts and they are SO worth trying!<br /><br />This 8-pack is a little pricey, but if you live out in the country or can't find this frosting in your store it is worth buying here.  (Also, if you don't have Amazon Prime, get it for bulkier items like this that are otherwise too expensive to ship.)

review/summary: Where's the Kona?
review/text: I've been drinking my coffee black for 30 years. I've had 100 percent Kona coffee and know how it tastes. Unfortunately, it's quite expensive and not easy to get where I live. That's why I buy Archer Farms Kona blend when I grind my own beans. It's not too pricey, yet it delivers some of that great Kona flavor.<br /><br />I looked forward to trying Tully's Kona blend in my new Keurig B60. Don't get me wrong; this coffee's good. But if there's any Kona in it, I sure can't taste it. Although Keurig's website says all Kona blend K-cups contain at least 10 percent Kona, there's nothing on the Tully's box confirming this.<br /><br />If you want a good cup of coffee, Tully's Kona Blend delivers. If you expect to actually taste any Kona coffee, don't bother.

I generally drink it with skim milk and no sugar, although I'm sure that it would taste  fine black or sweetened if one prefers.  Of course, personal preferences vary, but if you're looking for an excellent K-cup coffee that suits your taste this one is at least worth a try.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious cup of coffee
review/text: I got a Keurig machine from my sons for Christmas and have been busy trying different k-cup flavors. Out of the regular coffee type offerings this has to be my favorite so far. This is a medium type roast but with a very rich and satisfying flavor, I am addicted to it. One of the best cups of coffee I've ever had anywhere.<br /><br />Some other customers have been debating how much Kona coffee is in this blend and I can't really say since I don't know how exactly Kona coffee is supposed to taste, but this particular blend with whatever is in it, is a winner. Honestly, if this came from a store I'd be stopping there regularly to get their coffee and amazingly enough I can just go home and make a cup whenever I want to!<br /><br />I will be buying this product again and again. I won't even be in the mood for coffee and then I'll remember that I have some of these k-cups left and I'll have to go make one because I won't be able to get it out of my head once I've thought of it. I rarely ever leave a 5 star review but Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend deserved one.

review/summary: Good Coffee - Bad Experience
review/text: This coffee has excellent flavor. The only trouble with these cups: the plastic on the cups is thicker than other brands. You must press firmly when placing them in the machine to make sure the bottom of the cup is punctured, before closing. If you do not, you will have a mess. The machine backs up with grounds and spits out grounds and little water. I tried another brand just to make sure my machine wasn't broke. The other brand, I placed in the maker and closed the lid. I did not press to seat it on the bottom needle. It worked perfectly by just closing the machine. I tried the Tully's and it ran everywhere if not pressed down firmly on the cup before brewing. Just a word of caution, but good tasting coffee.

review/summary: inconsistency
review/text: Like the little girl with a curl, when the Kona is good it's good, but when it is not, it's bitter.  There's no way of telling from one k-cup to another.  I hope the problem is Tully's and not the Keurig's.  I'll be trying Timothy's Kona next; my wife likes their decaf Colombian.

review/summary: Coffee great! k-cup cheap causing grounds
review/text: I love Tully's Kona Blend.  It's my favorite over all other k-cup coffee.  Unfortunately, the k-cup packaging is so cheap in the Keurig machines that I get grounds in almost every cup.  Wish they would improve the cups so I can return to the best ever coffee. I would rate them a 5+ as the flavor is perfectly bold with little acidity.

review/summary: A little.. TOO good.
review/text: So, normally I don't like "Kona Blends" because there's VERY little Kona taste. Here, that's not the case. You can REALLY taste the Kona in the Tully's Blend. I sent it to my parents when they first bought a keurig, and when I went to visit them, I couldn't stop drinking it. I was addicted to this coffee--I had to send them another box when I left because I depleated their supply. The BAD news is, I couldn't find this in non-keurig form (I don't have a Kuerig), which for me, is bad news indeed. :) I'll keep looking, though!

review/summary: The best kona blend in a k-cup
review/text: If you love kona coffee as much as I do this is the stuff to buy. Sure it's only 10% kona, but you can't buy 100% kona in a k-cup. Besides, it would cost at least 4 times this much.<br /><br />This is a very smooth cup of coffee, a light to medium brew with low acidity and no after taste. Much better than coffee peoples kona blend which tastes burnt and too strong IMO.<br /><br />Edit 4/8:<br />If you can get this here for 48 cents a cup or cheaper it's a decent deal. If not go to green mountains site.

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.
