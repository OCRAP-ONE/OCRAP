review/summary: A delightful combination
review/text: I've never been a fan of kiwi & strawberry together, but I think Switch got it right by combining fruit juice with carbonation.  I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this - I don't think you'll regret it.

review/summary: Much too sweet
review/text: I didn't care for Kiwi Berry Switch. It was very sweet and not refreshing at all. Also, at 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can, it actually contains a lot more calories than regular soda. I know it is all natural and doesn't have HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup), and I appreciate that, but it also doesn't have much actual kiwi or berry juices. The drink is VERY sweet, but sweeter than 100% fruit juice, sweeter even than your average can of soda. I can't say I would ever buy this product or recommend it to anyone else. There are better natural sodas on the market, as well as better 100% natural juices.

review/summary: Good Every Once in a While, but Not Often
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good, but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting.

This is carbonated, I think it would be even better if is wasn't but this product's time has come.<br />I am fed up with the over-sweet juices with aftertaste that make it obvious they are not really natural.

review/text: This is a refreshing, tasty, sweet drink, and a nice change from soda.<br />The strawberry/kiwi mix has great taste, and would be terrific on a hot day. I was surprised by the intensity of the flavor, and did not expect the sweetness.<br />My personal preference, though, is for non-carbonated drinks, and I would have preferred it without carbonation.<br />It is also quite high in calories at 135 calories for 8.3 ounces, which is fairly hefty.<br />I believe that this is a healthier, better tasting summer drink, which has a much more natural and fresher taste than colas do, and I believe that most people will really love it.

review/summary: Lightly carbonated and sweet
review/text: This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.  I enjoyed this flavor more because the sweetness was not overpowering and the carbonation remained light so I didn't feel like I wanted to drink a glass of water immediately after.  It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again.

review/summary: Sickening sweet
review/text: This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a "diet" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option.

review/summary: Refreshing  Switch Kiwi Berry not too tart, more sweet
review/text: IF, I repeat IF you are just looking for an all fruit carbonated replacement for soda.....this would fit the bill to a "T"!<br /><br />We split the can (from Vine) 4 ways , so this is a "family" review.<br />My boys, ages 10-16 all liked it, I myself ALWAYS cut soda/fruit drinks w/ a bit of water or soda water, & liked this one just fine following my usual diluting!  Many people remark regarding the calories, but they are no different from any other 100% fruit juice & better for you than soda! Yes it is a bit pricey but it seems to be about average in comparison to similar beverages sold in individual portions..............you are paying for CONVENIENCE!  IF you want to save money just but a fruit concentrate & seltzer/soda water & mix up your own blend (like we do!) I did not have any on hand but a splash of fresh lemon or lime wedge would be Delish with this drink! We sampled it ice cold, don't know if that makes a difference, but if I was offered this again I would definitely grab it up! YUM

review/summary: Surprisingly GOOD!
review/text: Think kiddie juice box with a kick - plus surprisingly flavorful. That basically describes this interesting drink. The cans are 8.3ozs, slim and perfect for toting along. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives. This is definitely a good alternative for kids' lunch boxes.<br />Flavor-wise, you definitely can taste the kiwi fruit and strawberry. Considering that most "fruit" drinks taste like syrup water, it was nice to have something actually NATURALLY flavored and carbonated so my kids' think they are getting "soda"when in reality they are getting something infinitely better.

Even though the Kiwi Berry drink says 100% juice and 0% added sugar it is way too sweet.  The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can won't be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.  The cute can and unique drink combination doesn't make up for the sweet/tart taste, small skinny can and high price.  Save your money, drink water.

review/summary: My Favorite Switch Drink So Far, But I Haven't Tried the Grape Yet
review/text: My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me of nothing that I had every tasted before. I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: "juice, bubbles and Vitamin C"
review/text: The product description says it's "just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C." Doesn't that sound good? I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.<br /><br />The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.<br /><br />The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.<br /><br />I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. You'll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009

review/summary: Perfect Blend of Flavor, Healthy Components
review/text: Switch Kiwi Berry is the perfect blend of tangy, tart, and sweet, with a delicious dose of kiwi flavor and subdued berry taste.<br /><br />This drink is bubbly, but better than a soda because:  1 - it is clean, not sticky, 2 - it is 100% fruit juice, 3 - there is no added sugar, 4 - there is no added anything else that is bad.<br /><br />This is a healthy drink, but it could trick us into believing it is bad.  I have only good things to say about Switch drinks, and can't think of one bad thing about it.<br /><br />This drink would be a perfect substitute for soda with whatever you would normally drink soda with, such as:  sandwich and chips, pizza, tacos, grapes and cheese and crackers, nachos.

review/text: Pleasant mixture of fruit tastes and the level of carbonation is refreshing.<br /><br />However, I found--particularly in the initial tastes-- the drink to be too sweet. You may well enjoy it, though, since I prefer carbonated fruit drinks more on the citrus/sour end.<br /><br />The over-sweetness isn't accomplished with added sugar, or non-sugar additives; the sweetness comes from the apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the top two non-water ingredients.

review/summary: different than colas
review/text: The kiwi/berry soda drink was tasty.  I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.  The effervescence was perfect....again, not so intense as the other sodas.  The cans are small(only 8.3 oz.), but adequate for a small thirst.  The idea of healthy 100% fruit juices combined with a slight carbonation is fine for children and adults alike.  Probably the only downside is the price per can compared to those very popular, but ultra-sugary or fake sugar colas and other canned soft drinks....but, you getting a far better product.

review/summary: Not worth the money, not my favorite flavor
review/text: I've tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn't enjoy this flavor I didn't find it as refreshing as the others.<br /><br />I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.<br /><br />However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it's too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity. Not worth it. :(

review/summary: Great healthy alternative to soda
review/text: It's exactly what it claims to be: carbonated juice. Imagine mixing 2 parts snapple with 1 part seltzer. It's a lot like that, but simpler.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely juicy, not sugary like soda. But, it's not very complex. Think juice box. Kiwi is the primary flavor. I can hardly taste any strawberry. It tasted more like grape and maybe a hint raspberry.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent alternative to soda. It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non-natural ingredient is ascorbic acid AKA Vitamin C as a preservative. In fact, I would recommend they add a little more Vitamin C to give it more tart. As is, it contains 100% DV of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I'd say its worth buying. Its a refreshing drink that doesn't leave you feeling guilty or crashing from a sugar high later. Just don't get in the habit of expecting the flavor as labeled.

review/summary: Great drink, healthier than sodas
review/text: I like the fact that this drink has none of the additives that you typically find in supermarket junk drinks such as high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors or flavor enhancers, magnesium sulphate, fake colors, etc. It tastes good. There is also an abundance of Vitamin C.<br /><br />But for health watches note it still packs a modest wallop of calories (135 cal) from its 33g of sugars, albeit natural-not bad, but if you are on a calorie restricted diet or in physical training, you will want to watch it. If you sit back and pop these all day you will still get fat. But this would be a great drink for active folks. Personally, I would drink this after a tough mountain bike ride or long distance run.<br /><br />The level of carbonation is pretty high, so it has a fizzy texture.

review/summary: very good soda .. its something different and worth trying
review/text: I have always been somewhat of a soda aficionado since the days of Pepsi, Dr pepper etc. My grandparents owned a little corner grocery store so I'd get to try some of the new sodas that came out.  I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit "misleading" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that. I personally prefer a fruited flavored carbonated beverage anyhow over say a plain cola type flavored one. I thought this was a change from the regular diet Pepsi and diet sierra mist i am used to drinking .I would pick these up if i seen them in a market or on here someday.  Only con I can really think of at the moment for a case off here its 22 bucks that is kinda steep for the economy were living in right now but if they sold them individual it be easier on the pocket book or pick one up in a store now and then when I see it. I really enjoyed the blends of the fruit flavor and the carbonation, like I mentioned it was really good and something different. I would definitely try this again.

review/summary: more sugar water!
review/text: what can i say that will actually be published about this splendid drink. It is carbonated sugar water. As per usuall the grape, apple juice content seems to always dominate in fruit drinks (unless they're suppose to taste like grapes or apples). The calories and carbs only seems high but in reality compared to a regular soda drink it is much worse since the quantity is greatly reduced in these drinks (Switch brand can 8.3oz regular can 12oz). They however make no pretensions of being a health drink with the exception of their pure juice declaration. All in all nothing shocking here, especially as we grow used to paying a lot for a little in todays economy.

review/summary: Healthy juicy soda alternative
review/text: When I first took a sip it is a shock to the taste buds as this is 100% fruit juice with carbonation.  I liked it chilled and it did taste like a soda from the bubbles yet not as sweet (syrupy) as a soda since there is NO added sugar. It is a healthy alternative to sodas and my kids loved it too. This was a great flavor since we love strawberry and the kiwi flavor added a twist. Genius product!

review/summary: The Kiwi is a bit overpowering.
review/text: This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis.

review/summary: Switch Carbonated Juice Drink
review/text: This is an Amazon Vines review of Switch Carbonated Juice Drink.  The flavor I received was Kiwi Berry and the can is 8.3 fluid ounces.<br /><br />I seldom drink sodas, not really caring for sugary drinks.  So when I saw the Switch 100% Carbonated Juice offered I wanted to try it.  The flavor I tried had a good tasting Kiwi flavor, was not sugary, and had a nice carbonation to it that I really enjoyed.  The refreshing drink has just 135 calories and only 15 mgs of salt, so as I drank it, I did not feel like I was drinking an unhealthy sugary beverage.<br /><br />I think this product is a great substitute for soda, provides a nice "pick me up," and is a much healthier product for one to drink than many sodas or other types of drinks that have added sugar, corn syrup, or some type of preservative.<br /><br />I enjoyed this drink and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a healthy and refreshing 100% juice drink.

review/text: I don't read every label on every drink or food I consume. I understand the switch philosophy and can appreciate the idea. I must say that if you are really health conscious and want to consume what's good for your body then you would stick with mostly filtered water and natural 100% juices that are fresh that day. With that being said I do know that everyone in my family liked the switch drink and this particular flavor (kiwi berry). I now see switch in supermarkets and have purchased a few  single cans at lunch on occasion. I don't see myself purchasing in bulk however, as they are kind of expensive.

review/summary: Not what I grew up on
review/text: As a kid I grew up picking and eating my own oranges, mangoes, bananas, watermelon other tropical fruits.  I know what 100% natural fruit juice tastes like and Switch kiwi berry does not taste like it is a product of 100% natural fruit juice.  This product like its watermelon strawberry cousin does not taste natural.  If kiwi flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a berry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some kiwi and pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.  Blend and then pour in a nice ice cold glass and enjoy!  Now this is 100% naturally good for you.  Nice try Switch - but I'd rather switch.

review/summary: The true un-soda
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure kiwi and strawberry juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst.

review/text: I've tried three flavors of this product so far:  Black Cherry, Watermelon Strawberry, and Kiwi Berry.  My favorite so far is Kiwi Berry that I thought was very good.  Watermelon Strawberry was second, and Black Cherry was a distant third.<br /><br />This product has a lot going for it, in my opinion.  100% fruit juice, so healthier than soda, but with added carbonation to make it different than just plain juice.  To me, the amount of carbonation was just right - I was able to drink it quickly and found it very refreshing.  The serving size is good, too.<br /><br />I do wish that it was available in larger sizes, even if someone didn't want to drink it all at once.<br /><br />My rating for the flavors, based solely on my personal opinion, is:<br />Kiwi Berry:  5 stars - would buy again<br />Watermelon Strawberry:  4 stars - would drink again, but probably won't buy again<br />Black Cherry:  3 stars - would drink again if very thirsty, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it

review/summary: Apple, Grape and a touch of Kiwi-Berry
review/text: This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion ("No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely "natural" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.

review/summary: Overly sweet and too expensive
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry is 8.3 ounces and has 135 calories, 15 mg of Sodium, 34 g of carbs (11% of daily value), 33 g of sugar and oh yeah 100% of your Vitamin C daily value. Mind you, a 12 oz can of Coke has 140 calories, 50mg of Sodium, 39g of carbs and 39g of sugar. So apart from the no sugar added, preservatives and all the added artifial stuff, there is not much of a difference in nutrition between these two products. Need the Vitamin C? Drink orange juice. Yes, the Switch may be a tad healthier but it is still a can of empty calories. Moreover, a can of this may not be enough for most people, so double the calories if you decide to drink two.<br /><br />As for taste, it is too sweet. I agree with the reviewer that said that this tasted like apple juice. It does. It tastes like over sweetened apple juice. There is a slight (very slight) hink of kiwi and none of berries. The sweetness is too strong at first but it does grow on you.<br /><br />This soda has way too much sugar, almost as much as a regular can of soda, and it tastes like it. It is too sweet for my taste. Frankly, giving the calories for this small can, it is not worth it. Now, I would like to try the Diet version if there was one.<br /><br />As for price, each can is about a dollar. Way too expensive. This is like paying $1 for each of those small Coke cans (the 8 oz small cans). Would you pay a dollar for one of those? Neither would I.

It has in it the following in this order: 100%juice sparkling water, apple,grape,kiwi,acerola cherry,raspberry and strawberry. The raspberry adds a little more zing then the other flavors but they are all really excellent. You can taste a little of all the fruits in this drink but the raspberry, strawberry and kiwi jump out the most. I would recommend this to anyone. Would make a great mixed drink but it's so good you probably won't get that far. Really good stuff!

I think they could reduce the fruit juice content about 1/3 and it would still be very tasty and have less sugar.<br /><br />Still for me this would rate 5 stars except for the price, at almost $1 per can unfortunately I don't think I would buy it very often.

review/text: The Switch in Kiwi Berry is quite tasty-  it's very berry but not quite kiwi...The kiwi is very subdued, seems like it enhances the tartness of the berry but doesn't quite warrant "kiwi" in the flavor title....<br /><br />The Switch is a good replacement for traditional sugar/corn syrup laden sodas...It is not necessarily lower in carbs, as the sweetness comes from the juices...For me, as a diabetic, I would use these instead of coke or juice boxes when treating a hypoglycemic episode... My child does not like anything "sparkling" but if I had kids who liked soda, I would probably try to move them over to something like this (actually, probably to water or sparkling water with a splash of juice) for special occasions...<br /><br />The flavor is very sweet (even though it is "natural" from the juices) and very tasty... The carbonation is light and sparkling- the flavor and carbonation reminded me of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider, but a little more fun...

review/text: Overall, I found Switch Kiwi Berry to be tasty.  I do think that perhaps they could dilute it a bit with more carbonated water, as the flavor seems pretty concentrated.  This would probably cut down on the calories and add to the company's bottom line too, as water is cheaper than fruit juice.<br /><br />I also think that the underlying apple juice flavor is bit too pronounced.  I'd like to taste a bit more of the berry and/or kiwi versus apple.  But it is nice to see a carbonated beverage that's made from natural ingredients.  Overall, I do recommend this product, although they could likely improve it with a few tweaks.

review/text: The Switch is apparently supposed to be a substitute for soda, with fizz but without corn syrup or added sugar, just juice.  However, the product, billed as "Kiwi Berry", has 135 calories in 8 ounces--more than one would get in soda--and is in fact mostly highly caloric apple and grape juice, for the sweetness, with kiwi and berries later in the ingredient list.  Yes, it is tasty, but a more healthy alternative would be club soda (or water, if you can do without the carbonation) with some juice added.

They were refreshing and because they did not add any sugar we could fool ourselves into thinking they were healthy (they are healthier...)<br /><br />When we saw Switch, we thought we might be getting even more of the same in new flavors.  Unfortunately, these are more syrupy than the Izzy's.  At least for adults, the are less crisp and refreshing.  However, kids would of course prefer these as they are sweeter.<br /><br />We also tried Watermelon/Strawberry and we liked the Kiwi Berry better.  The watermelon/Strawberry had a much more Jolly Rancher like taste. I think we are going to stick to our Izzy's I think.

review/summary: A Switch for the better?
review/text: I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of "junk" food in our home, including sodas, so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it "I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them, and don't expect it to be a great, healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs/sugar.

review/summary: The Switch Kiwi Berry
review/text: I've read a few reviews for this product complaining that it's too sweet to drink truthfully. I'm a soda drinker but I usually stay away from fruit sodas as they do tend to be sweeter to taste than say a cola or root beer. To me though The Switch billed as a healthier alternative to soda had a less sugary taste compared to something like Fanta or the like that was perfectly fine I suppose if it truthfully was healthier than soda. Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product, the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice. Then again if you really must having something billed as a healthy alternative to soda then its not bad I suppose just not something I'd be interested in personally.

review/summary: Great taste, but a little too sweet
review/text: This is a great tasting product, to be sure, and I if I were a soft drink person in general, I would likely choose this over any of the leading sodas on the market. However, while there is "no sugar added," it still tastes very much like candy. The black cherry version of "The Switch" is much less cloying in my opinion.<br />If you like sweet beverages, you'll love this, and the fact that it is all natural, is, of course, something to consider. This is a good choice for dessert, I suppose. There are apple, grape, kiwi, raspberry, strawberry and acerola juices in this drink, all of which combine for a nice flavor.

review/summary: Switch Beverages Have Good Flavor
review/text: I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans.

review/summary: Guilt Free Flavor!!  (With no Soybean con attached!!)
review/text: The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. "100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want."<br /><br />2. "Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION."<br /><br />3. The logo has "THE" placed upside-down and reversed, atop "Switch," with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: "100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)"<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts

review/summary: A very good thing - in a too-small package.
review/text: When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to "make the switch" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price.

review/summary: Tastes like a cheap lollipop.
review/text: What is supposed to be the purpose of this soda? "100% juice"--but not 100% of what's on the front of the label. Kiwi, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates are lesser ingredients; apple and grape juice are in the majority. And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all.

review/summary: Would be better without the vitamin c
review/text: The flavor is pretty good.  It's sweet, tart, and tangy.  The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.<br /><br />The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3 - $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to bring the price down.<br /><br />If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.  You can mix your own for a lot less and not have the vitamin c aftertaste.

review/summary: Very tastey
review/text: I don't often drink soda for a couple reasons...  it's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors (and the diet stuff has even worse stuff.)  With that said:  this stuff is good.<br /><br />It doesn't leave that weird aftertaste in your mouth, or that sticky slime in the back of the throat (or is that just me?), or BURN going down.  It tastes "fresh," for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink - not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)<br /><br />All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a "cleaner" flavor that the sugary/corn-syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.  A strawberry (or kiwi) may taste sweet when eaten whole, but the juice by itself really isn't sweet enough to be passed off as "juice," except by fanatics.)<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a good tasting natural soda.  I liked it enough to want to try out the other flavors...

This is no better then drinking a soda filled with corn syrup because of the amount of calories and carbs it contains. It's all sugar and it shows not only going in but around the mid section if you pounded these things for a few months straight.<br /><br />Pass.

review/text: It certainly served as a wonderfully refreshing break on a hot day. I enjoyed the taste a great deal, which is rare for drinks with no added sugar. It had just the right amount of sweetness, and overall it tasted a bit like a lollipop - tart, sweet, and sour. I don't necessarily believe that a quick ingestion of lots of Vitamin C makes you feel better by any mechanism other than a placebo, but needless to say this drink has this vitamin in excess, which certainly doesn't hurt. 130 cals is a bit much if you're trying to limit your caloric intake, but then again it would hardly be organic if it had artificial sweeteners and 5% juice. Good stuff.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: I like the concept of these natural, carbonated juice beverages and I really liked the black cherry flavor.  But the Kiwi Berry flavor was too sweet for me.  While the ingredients are only juice and carbonated water, I think that not enough water was added to reconstitute the juice to a good balance.  With 33 grams of sugar in the 8.3 ounce bottle, despite being natural, there is still a lot of sweetness here.

It is all natural, but it almost had an herb flavor, like I think of ginseng or something, though it was not included in the ingredients. The carbonation was about right and the flavor is sweet. I couldn't really distinguish the kiwi very strongly, and I wish I had been able to. It's not a bad drink and it is definitely better than many other options out there, but it's not one I'd seek out specifically, probably only buying if it were on sale.

review/summary: At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For
review/text: UPDATE: April 3, 2009<br />I "ordered" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: "A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE." Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be "healthy." Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The "diet" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of "off the diet."  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a "wolf in lamb's clothing" for those who consider themselves "heath conscious."<br /><br />The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:<br /><br />"The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]"<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as "Carb" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?

review/text: This switch kiwi berry tasts like the Red-Bull energy drink...bit of sour and sweet but not too much sparkling gas. The overall taste is not bad (I like it), but I could not taste the kiwi or berry. If you are looking for kiwi or berry taste, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The label says no suger added, but the ingredient table shows 33g sugar? I guess the sugar all comes from the 100% juice itself. So much suger level is such a small can. That's kind of high...<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste and I think it's an enjoyable drink. But I won't recommend it due to the high suger level.

review/text: This carbonated blend of juices is a refreshing drink.  The kiwi and strawberry flavors come through more distinctly, and when drinking while eating, it is the strawberry flavor that dominates.  Because Switch is not as carbonated as soda, it does not need to have added sugar, a definite plus.  The lower carbonation also makes it easier to drink.  I am now intrigued to try the other flavors that Switch makes.

review/summary: Serviceable Substitute For Unhealthy Sodas
review/text: ***<br />The Switch claims to be an alternative to unhealthy sodas, and it is that--it is much healthy than most of the commercial versions out there. It does provide 100% of the day's vitamin C and does contain only fruit juice concentrates, no added sugars, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and no gluten.<br /><br />However...it is cloyingly sweet--a great taste of kiwi and strawberries--but way too sweet for me. The Switch also provides a huge sugar hit via the fructose in the highly concentrated juices and has 135 calories in only 8.3 fluid ounces. Of 34 grams of carbohydrates, 33 are from sugar.<br /><br />I don't carbo load, so it doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'd rather eat the real fruit and get the fiber and other ingredients, or else have a less sweet drink. I tried using it as a concentrate and mixing 1 part soda to 3 parts water, which made it drinkable for me; although this worked well, I'd still probably stick with other beverages.<br /><br />Recommended, only if you want to ease your way off of unhealthy sodas and like very sweet drinks.<br />***

review/summary: Flavorful and Refreshing
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit beverage is certainly different than what one expects to get out of a carbonated drink. Because it is 100% fruit juice, as opposed to fruit flavored, it is much more refreshing than the typical fruit flavored sparkling beverage. At 135 calories and 34 grams of carbohydrates - 33 grams of sugar - it might be a little heavy for the health or weight conscious. The only other drawback might be that the carbonation flattens out the depth of the flavor just a little. Nonetheless, Switch is a tasty and refreshing carbonated fruit beverage.

review/summary: Switch Kiwi Berry
review/text: "The Switch" reminds me a lot of carbonated apple cider. It has a carbonated sweet taste (with no sugar added, no preservatives according to the label). The label states that it has 100% Juice. To me it tastes light, on the diluted side, and very similar in taste to the apple cider bottle you serve kids for thanksgiving instead of real champagne. There is a slightly detectable taste of strawberry and maybe kiwi.<br /><br />Pros:<br />100% Vitamin C<br />Low Sodium of 15mg<br />Tastes good if you like the light carbonated Perrier-Like Taste.<br />Fat: 0mg<br /><br />Cons:<br />33g of sugar (although it says no sugar added)<br />34g of carbs - too much carbs if you're trying to cut down on carbs<br /><br />Conclusion: Keep in mind that this review reflects my personal opinion of the product beside the facts listed on the can. I personally prefer less carbonated fruit drinks with a stronger taste rather than the very light taste of this product. it is 135 calories for 8.3 fl oz. You also feel you need a glass of water to wash out the after taste. Overall, it tastes good and I can recommend it to anyone who's not trying to cut down on the amount of daily carbs or sugar intakes.

review/summary: Healthy perhaps, but expensive
review/text: Switched Kiwi Berry is fairly good soft drink; strongly berry-flavored with a light hint of kiwi. Nutritionally, the drink contains more sugar and calories than an equivalent 8 oz serving of soda or iced tea, but these seem in-line with other juice beverages. This drink makes me curious why Snapple didn't branch into carbonated fruit beverages, but perhaps the reason may have something to do with cost. It is difficult to select this beverage when it costs two to three times more than soda or canned iced tea; however, I would buy a case of mixed flavors, if such an SKU became available, for entertaining purposes.

review/summary: Like a cross between a soda and a juice box...
review/text: Switch certainly lives up to its name - it is definitely a switch from your normal drinks. Packaged like an energy drink, the Kiwi Berry Switch almost has the texture of a soda, and almost tastes like a sweetened fruit juice. Its a little of both, and actually manages to pull it off.<br /><br />Some people might find the drink a bit too sweet, but I found that the excessive sweetness wasn't accompanied by a lingering aftertaste, or a sticky, sugary residue that just makes you thirstier. It actually is quite refreshing, which is remarkable for a drink which almost tastes like liquid candy.<br /><br />The kiwi part of this kiwi berry drink it almost nonexistent, but the berry flavor almost makes you forget this. The size of the can is the perfect portion size for a drink of this nature; you wouldn't want to drink too much of this in one sitting. But the serving size is perfect for a taste of something sweet and refreshing.

review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry is an excellent product that far exceeded my expectations.  I'm not a fan of the kiwi-strawberry combo that when attempted with artificial flavors comes of as borderline toxic, but The Switch succeeds where others fail, and without the need for artificial flavors or unnecessary additives.<br />I  had my doubts about this product, primarily because there are so many new "craft" sodas on the market.  These "craft" sodas seem to be the  non-alcoholic equivalent of the micro-brew craze that seems to be leveling off.<br />The fact that the product is actually fruit juice, gives me high-hopes that the corn syrup and chemically dependant soda industry can innovate with solid and natural products.<br />The small size is also a benefit, in that it's adequate for this type of beverage.  We've become a society of excess, and sodas, colas and other soft-drinks have not been immune,  The Switch brings us back to the days of reasonable and healthy serving sizes and hopefully consumers will take note.<br />An all-around excellent product that I will be looking for in stores.

It has to be loaded, considering the 135 calories (at a little over 8 oz), and the 33g (!!!) of sugar.  I did like the sweet/tart taste which reminded me of the candy with the same name.  I also liked the fact that it's carbonated, but not too noticeable because of the sweet/tart taste.<br /><br />The pros of the Switch Juice are:<br />No Sugar Added<br />No Corn Syrup<br />No Preservatives<br />No Artificial Colors<br />100% Pure Juice<br />All Natural<br /><br />The cons:<br />The price per can (considering 8.3oz size)<br />The calorie load<br />The sugar content<br /><br />So, if you like juice and are looking for something to drink after a long workout, this one is a good choice.  You get energy and great taste in a somewhat small can.  Gatorade is much cheaper and a better choice for quenching thirst.

review/text: The Switch is a 100% juice carbonated beverage in an 8oz can. So, it's not really a soda because its not in a 12oz can. It's not an energy drink, which is what you usually see in these small cans. It's all fruit juice which means it is all natural and better for you than those so called fruit drinks with tons of sugar and preservatives. It tastes good, but not great, and the carbonation definitely gives it a kick. At about a dollar a can, I don't know if its worth the price for me to buy any more, but it does taste good. Perhaps pick some up in a smaller size before buying 24 cans. My kids liked the taste at first, but soon tired of the carbonation.

It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12-year-old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry juice concentrates reconstitued with filtered, sparkling water. It's all natural though they have added vitamin C so that it provides 100% RDA. A most excellent drink I'll continue buying for a very long time.

review/text: Most of the carbonated juice drinks I've tried have either been far too sweet, far too carbonated, or just plain nasty.  So I tried The Switch with more than a little trepidation.  But this is not like any other carbonated juice I've ever had - it's actually good.<br /><br />First thing that hits you when you open the can is the scent -- it actually smells like fruit!  I know that may seem like a "DUH!" moment, but trust me, I've had some that didn't smell anything like the fruit they allegedly had in them.  The Switch is lightly carbonated; one thing I really hate is when the carbonation overpowers the drink, but The Switch doesn't do that at all.<br /><br />Since there's no added sugar in this drink, the sweet comes from the fruit.  That means it's not sickeningly sweet when you drink it, but it's also not bitter.  There did seem to be more strawberry than kiwi in the drink, but it was very good; a welcome change from typical juice or soda.

At 135 calories per can, it's slightly higher in carbs than an average soda.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because although it is refreshingly free of high fructose corn syrup, it claims to be "all natural" -- not sure what's natural about juice concentrate. And, like regular soda, it is chock full of "empty" carbs -- like eating raw sugar.

review/text: These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was very happy and surprised to even see Kiwi and Strawberry listed. Even though the Strawberry is listed last. Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This sparkling juice did not have an identifiable taste of kiwi or strawberry. You could tell this was a mix of berries that blended the sweet with the tart for a refreshing drink. So it lives up to its name for it is called Kiwi Berry, not Kiwi Strawberry. So I was satisfied with its flavor. I liked the drink and would have more. But for my money I would rather by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories.

review/text: I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.<br /><br />Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.<br /><br />Not very good.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: This fizzy fruity soda tastes great and has no added sugars (including all the hidden ones). Tastes great, but for those who think this is a lo-cal drink, nope: 135 cal per can. Has added Vitamin C (100% RDA). Like most fruit mixes main juice is apple/grape, but kiwi, acerola (a wild cherry fruit), strawberry, and raspberry are listed in the ingredients. I thought you could taste flavors beyond the apple/grape combo as well.

review/summary: No sugar but awfully sweet-and not in a good way
review/text: First off, ordered 2 different types of these Switch drinks and they all literally have the same ingredients, albeit 1 or 2 slight differences. They both begin with : 'Filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates'... What? Not to mention, the first 2 main ingredients are apple and grape-both not the 'flavour' I ordered. Anyway, I rarely read labels to begin with, but for something supposedly 100% juice, I was curious...<br /><br />Ok, now for the taste, or lack thereof. It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full-blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldn't even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. That's all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink.

review/summary: GREAT HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE TO REGULAR SODA!
review/text: This is a great alternative to regular soda in the sense that aside from being carbonated just like a regular soda, it contains vitamins and no added sugar making it really a healthy alternative. Its sparkling appearance also adds to the attraction to this juice. The only downside I can think of for this is it is expensive. Other than that its very satisfying.
