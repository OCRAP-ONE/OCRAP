review/summary: An OK treat
review/text: It was an OK treat, kinda tasted like Cracker Jack, but I would prefer Cracker Jack or just plain popcorn. I did think it was a little too sweet for me, but the portion was small enough so not to bother me too much. At 130 calories for a 1.06 ounce package, that was OK, but as I said, I would rather just plain popcorn, with probably less calories for the same size portion.

review/summary: 3-1/2 stars: mixed reviews from a single family
review/text: In general, I love chocolate drizzled on caramel corn. However, I do not love everybody's chocolate caramel corn. Sometimes it's too sweet. Sometimes the caramel is too sticky. Striking the right balance can be a challenge. I was very excited to try another version of chocolate caramel corn, especially one easily purchased at a local grocery store (instead of a specialty shop) and I was particularly excited because this one looked like it would have just the right amount of chocolate so that it wouldn't be overpowering.<br /><br />As soon as my kids came home from school (I have almost 12 yr. old boy/girl twins), we immediately dove right into a single bag of the popcorn. Sadly, my daughter and I only ate a few pieces before declaring it just "okay" with a slight aftertaste, I think from the caramel. My son, however, really, really liked it and gobbled the rest up, then asked if he could bring the rest in his lunches. He said he'd give it 4 stars, but my daughter and I would only give it 2-1/2 stars for taste. Due to some other positive factors about the popcorn (which I will explain below), I decided on an average of 3-1/2 stars.  I do think there will definitely be people out there like my son, who don't notice any kind of aftertaste at all and will love it.<br /><br />There are 5 snack-sized bags of popcorn in each box (1.06 oz) and each bag is 130 calories, with 3 grams of fat (2.5 g of that is saturated). With caramel and chocolate on it, I figured I'd be lucky if there were 6 pieces of popcorn in the bag, so I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice size serving. Given the sweetness of the corn, and the fact that it's definitely NOT healthy popcorn, it's enough. (Out of the first 4 ingredients listed on the package, 3 of them are sweeteners- brown sugar, sugar and corn syrup. Interestingly enough, popcorn is the 2nd ingredient, not the first.)<br /><br />The popcorn has a nice texture and consistency and the caramel does not stick in your teeth (a definite plus in my book). The amount of chocolate on the popcorn is good, not too much and not too little.<br /><br />Overall, I think many people will find this a nice snack.

review/summary: So tasty!
review/text: I'm oftentimes disappointed by diet food desserts.  Usually they taste a little bit off, probably due to using a sugar substitute.  These were delicious!  All of the great taste of caramel popcorn with a little bit of chocolate mixed in.  Mmmm.  Really easy to just pop a bag in my lunch and it seemed like the perfect amount of popcorn to eat for one sitting.  I crave something sweet at the end of a meal and these were very satisfying.

review/summary: Sweet, not salty
review/text: At 130 calories, this is a nice little snack when you crave something sweet. Although it's not really healthy, there's a lot of sugar in each bag; the popcorn does a good job of fulfilling the craving, without going overboard. I really like that each bag is portion controlled so you don't find yourself absently eating more than you intended. I personally thought they were a bit too sweet, but my daughter and husband loved them so that's a matter of personal preference. I'd definitely toss a bag into a lunch box for an occasional afternoon treat, but I think the price point is a bit high for what you get.

review/summary: Yummy and low calorie
review/text: I remember SnackWells from the early 90s. The SnackWells division of Nabisco was one of the first to come out with fat free and low calorie versions of unhealthy snacks, such as fudge covered marshmellow cookies.  Unfortunately the taste of the cookie was not that great.  SnackWells has struck gold with the small, low calorie (only 130 per pouch) packs of fudge drizzled caramel popcorn.  I was pleasantly pleased with the taste of the popcorn-it was fresh, and the caramel/chocolate on the popcorn was very flavorful.  I had one for lunch as a desert, and I decided to see if my kids would enjoy these low calorie snacks in their lunchbox in school.  Both my kids loved them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the box held more of the pouches-they are expensive for what you end up getting.  There are only 5 130 calorie pouches in a box.

review/summary: Good - Cracker Jacks with a drizzle of chocolate
review/text: These were pretty good.  They reminded me of Cracker Jacks with chocolate drizzled over the top.  You get a decent helping per package.  They have about 130 calories, and 3 grams of fat.  That isn't too bad for a treat, although after I was done eating them, I just wasn't satisfied.  That quickly lead me to see some of the things that I could have had instead, like 2 chewy chips ahoy cookies, or part of a snickers (although way more fat in one of those), or a three muskateers.  If it were me I probably would have chosen the 2 cookies, or 1/2 of the muskateers instead; but left the snickers because of the fat.<br /><br />Truth be told however, I would probably just eat them all :)<br /><br />All in all, this was a yummy treat, and I would chose to buy them at a good price.  Keep in mind that they probably aren't a super "healthy" treat, they are definitely still a treat.

review/summary: Actually... these aren't bad
review/text: "Reduced fat" food is something I pretty much never eat. If I don't want to get a bunch of empty calories from some sugary thing, I just don't eat it. The diet versions invariably taste like cardboard, and who wants that instead of sugary treats? I only ate these because of the Vine program, and I have to say, I was shocked by how much I liked them.<br /><br />First, they actually taste like caramel corn, which was quite a treat. The chocolate drizzle is really not that noticeable, but that's not a huge problem unless you're buying this specifically because of the chocolate (and you probably aren't, right?). Second, the portion size is remarkably large. How they give you this much food for 130 calories I do not understand. The little pouch must have had 20-30 pieces of popcorn in it. As a little after-work snack, there was almost too much here. That's not a bad problem to have!<br /><br />Overall, very pleasantly surprised. If this is your kind of thing, or even if it isn't, you may want to check it out. This is an intriguing product.

review/summary: WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!
review/text: As a lover of caramel popcorn I looked forward to trying this product with the added "benefit" of chocolate.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  The alleged caramel coating had no flavor- none at all.  The chocolate was only marginally better- if I really concentrated I could discern a mild chocolate taste, but none from the caramel.  On the positive side, the popcorn flavor came through loud and clear.  I did not snack well on this product!

review/summary: Tasty but too Sweet
review/text: With a name like Snackwell's ("well" underlined for emphasis), the line of products tries to advertise itself as a healthy snack. This snack's box draws attention to the fact that a serving contains only 130 calories. Despite the convenient portion-controlling packages, do not mistake this product for a healthy treat. A company will often market foods as low in fat or calories, but while these foods contain fewer calories, they compensate for the loss of delicious fatty ingredients by containing excessive amounts of sugar. The Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, for example, contains 18 grams of sugar per serving! Although tasty, the popcorn is overly sweet and thus tolerable in only small amounts.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I'm a big fan of popcorn, both coated and naked, and I've always enjoyed Snack Well's treats.  In this case, they missed the mark.  The best thing about this product is that the packets are measured so you're reasonably sure your calorie count is accurate.  The popcorn itself is nicely done, light and fluffy with enough snap to be satisfying.  But the coating, which should give a sweet-salty zip to the corn, falls flat.  Not quite enough of anything and too much of whatever leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />This isn't a terrible choice of snack food, and kids probably won't complain.  Only picky adults are likely to decide that the taste doesn't warrant the caloric hit that could better be achieved with something tastier.  Plain popcorn would do the trick.

review/text: After trying one piece of this Snackwell Fudge Dizzle Caramel Popcorn, I about chocked to death it was so sweet.<br /><br />You definitely won't want to even eat one 1.6 ounce portion, which is 130 calories.  The box is 5.3 ounces total, with 5-1.06 ounce packs.<br /><br />If you really have a sweet tooth and eat this, you should be more than satisfied with just eating the one pack, you won't need to go over the 130 calories.<br /><br />I don't have an aversion to sweet things, but this is way beyond sweet!<br /><br />For me personally, it's just too hard to enjoy something that is so sickeningly sweet, so that it makes you choke on the first bite!

review/summary: Popcorn Caramel & Chocolate Fix all in one
review/text: I don't usually go for the portion control snacks that have become so prevalent on the supermarket shelves these days but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  The Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn has taken three of my guilty pleasures (popcorn, caramel & fudge) and put them all into one 130 calorie pack.  The sugar may be a little on the high side if you're a member of the snack police but if you stick to the one bag rule I'm sure you come out ahead.<br /><br />The pack portion size contains enough to get you over that afternoon slump or to enjoy at the movies without feeling guilty.  The taste is really very good with none of that "pretend food" taste you get in many of the healthy food choices.<br /><br />I think the cost is a little more than I'd spend on a regular basis but as a special treat I'll probably buy it again.

review/summary: Overpriced Junk Food
review/text: I just tried the Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn for the first time, and was not impressed at all. You get 130 calories for a small serving. The taste is nothing special, and is not as tasty as a box of Cracker Jacks. It is loaded with sugar and the price for for you get, it ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and stick with nutritional snacks. They are much less expensive, less calories, more nutritious, and better tasting. Just because a product is marketed as nutritious or low calorie, doesn't make it so. Read the fine print and be smart. This is a product you should pass on...If you get the craving for popcorn, make it yourself. You will save a bundle of money and it will be better tasting and more nutritious! Pass on this product unless you are a junk food junky with money to spare!

review/summary: Delicious and Satisfying!
review/text: If you have a sweet tooth and would like to indulge without getting into a huge amount of trouble, this might be just the thing.<br /><br />I am usually not too pleased with the SnackWell line of reduced or limited calorie snacks as the taste is often ersatz and the portion size pathetically stingy. However, these little (1.06 oz) packs of caramel popcorn drizzled in chocolate are quite delicious and the serving is just generous enough to leave one satisfied. The best part is that each pack is only 130 calories! Who can feel guilty about that?<br /><br />Each box contains six packs of popcorn. Each pack contains 30 grams of popcorn which is approximately two good handfuls. The popcorn is decent sized, fresh and crunchy. A thin layer of caramel and a drizzle of chocolate coats each piece. The taste is sweet/salty/chocolate/caramel/chewy/yum.<br /><br />How healthy a snack is this? Not great but not that bad either. The ingredient list has some good or natural items including brown sugar, popcorn, sugar, cocoa powder, skim milk and vanilla extract, but then starts veering off into junk-food-land with palm oil, whey powder, soybean oil, soy lecithin. Salt is the tenth listed item and for popcorn that is quite impressive! One warning is that this product contains both milk and soy.<br /><br />I was quite pleasantly surprised by this product and I would definitely purchase it!<br /><br />Check out my photographs to see what the caramel corn and the portion looks like.

review/summary: Painful Pleasure
review/text: I originally wrote a positive review of this Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn -- until I was awakened in the middle of the night by an extreme attack of heartburn, of the kind I usually experience when I have eaten something that doesn't agree with my cholesterol medication (generic Zocor, or simvastatin).<br /><br />To be sure that this popcorn caused this reaction, I kept my diet the same a second day but refrained from eating any of the Snackwell Popcorn.  Result: NO heartburn -- I slept like a baby.<br /><br />Usually butter is the culprit when my cholesterol pills go to work, but I don't see butter listed in the ingredients on the popcorn package.  Nabisco also claims that this popcorn has NO cholesterol.<br /><br />Well, I don't know what to think, but I would suggest that folks suffering from high cholesterol -- or anyone taking cholesterol medication like simvastatin -- approach this product with extreme caution.  If you experience similar reactions from your cholesterol meds to foods you shouldn't be having, try a single-serving pack of this popcorn before you buy a box and see how you feel.<br /><br />Those who have no problems with cholesterol, however, may like the flavor of this Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, which is tasty, if pricey at around a buck per ounce of popcorn.  I myself threw out the remaining four packs in the six-pack box -- the pain of eating these far outweighed the pleasure.

review/summary: Sweet Snack!
review/text: Wow, this little snack really packs a sweet punch!  I picked up my first package and thought for sure I'd be disappointed in how small the serving was and not satisfied by the snack.  Boy was I wrong!  I found I ate it rather slowly and instead of the bag being empty before I was done, it seemed I was done before the bag was empty.  This isn't a snack I see myself consuming on a regular basis, but for times when my sweet tooth is raging, this is a good choice to satisfy that sweet tooth while remaining well within my calorie range for the day.<br /><br />I think the size of each individual pack could be reduced (maybe down to an even 100-calories) as that would make it a better size snack.  I also got a couple really hard bites in the first bag I had (though the next bag was fine).  The price is also pretty steep.<br /><br />I don't see the nutrition information on the product page, so I thought I'd throw it in here.  This is what is printed on the individual bag I have sitting in front of me.  I give no guarantees as to it's accuracy beyond that......<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 pack (30 g)<br />Calories:  130<br />Total Fat: 3 g<br />Sat. Fat:  2.5 g<br />Trans Fat: 0 g<br />Poly.

I am not sure why so many people could not taste the chocolate fudge or caramel, as I could taste both. However, what was overwhelming to me was the immediate sugar overload. Having 18 grams of sugar in a 1.06 oz snack package is atrocious; that is nearly 50% of what you find in a 12 oz bottle of cola.  For a product that is supposed to primarily be popcorn, this one is far off base.<br /><br />Despite the overly sweet flavor and non-nutritional punch of sugar, overall it tasted pretty good. I am not too fond of overly sweet products, though, and would not purchase on my own and certainly not at the price I noted while writing the review. Those who love Cracker Jacks would probably enjoy it but only if it can be found at a more reasonable price.

review/summary: It's all sugar, baby!
review/text: Check out the first four ingredients on these snacks:  Brown sugar, popcorn, sugar, corn syrup.  That's a lot of sugar!  It's a little disconcerting that the popcorn is not the first ingredient.  These popcorn snacks are very sweet, of course, reminiscent of Screaming Yellow Zonkers.  They have no caramel flavor, which is a problem since the Snackwell's are supposed to be caramel popcorn.  The chocolate drizzle is nice, I like chocolate paired with salty-sweet.  The sugary glaze is so sweet that the chocolate actually cuts the sweetness!  The popcorn itself imparts almost no flavor at all, it's just a flavorless foundation.  The popcorn is nice and crunchy and with a good mouthfeel, though, not stale or chewy like other pre-packaged popcorn can be.  There are 130 calories and only 3 grams of fat, which is pretty darn good for a sweet snack of this size, but there are 24 grams of carbs, almost all of it sugar, if you're concerned about such things.

review/summary: Nice dessert snack
review/text: In my opinion, desserts should not be made to be healthy, because doing so generally makes them into something that isn't a very good dessert.  If you need healthy, I understand, but don't eat desserts.  Still, this dessert snack manages to find a reasonable balance between healthy and satisfying.<br /><br />They are sweet.  Brown sugar is the first ingredient; it also contains sugar (presumably white) and corn syrup.  The fudge drizzle is made from cocoa instead of regular chocolate, probably as a concession to calories, but it does add chocolatey taste.<br /><br />The box has five packets of this snack, each packet having 130 calories.  If calories are important to you, this is a great way of letting you know how much is one serving.  Also handy for putting into lunch bags, of course.<br /><br />I have had much richer caramel corn.  It often has a thicker glaze, and the caramel is often made with butter.  But that caramel is not made to put a limit on calories, as this one does.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with the snack.  It is sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, gives me a taste of chocolate, and does not make me feel deprived.  The packet has enough to satisfy, and keeps me from eating too much at once.

review/summary: Tasty, yes ... but a waste of space
review/text: Esssentially, this is a Cracker Jacks rip off with some chocolate thrown in. To my taste, after a few pieces the added chocolate made them a bit too rich.<br /><br />Cracker Jacks, while also completely lacking any nutritional value, are at least a bit less expensive and 10 calories less per serving. (Plus you get a really cheap, unentertaining, and useless toy with Cracker Jacks).<br /><br />For the price and the calories, you'd be much better off to eat an apple. An apple is filling, and contains fiber and other nutritional elements. For that matter, you'd be better off to just eat lightly buttered popcorn. You can eat a LOT more popcorn for the same calories, and really popcorn is more satisfying as a snack, as it doesn't have all the sugar to keep you thirsty that this snack does. Of course that depends on how heavily you salt it too.<br /><br />I tried a bag of these as a filler snack when I was feeling hungry a couple of hours after lunch. Ten minutes later, I was just as hungry again. Since almost all of the calories in this snack come from sugar, that was no shock to me. LOL<br /><br />If you are underweight and looking to spend better than a dollar a pop for a VERY small bag of candy popcorn to smear directly on to your hips, this is your baby. However, the product otherwise is a slap in the face of the better eating habits many of us would prefer to embrace.

It does have quite a bit of sugar in it, so if that is something you are trying to avoid, this wouldn't be your best option. It comes in a very small package so not a very large serving. You might be tempted to eat 2-3 bags before you were satisfied. On the other hand its a good snack size to fit in a lunch bag.

review/text: The snacks themselves are delicious.  There's a good mix of the chocolate and caramel flavors along with the salty popcorn.  The packets in the box are a pretty good size for a satisfying snack, or at least they were for me.  The chocolate fudge was the most prominent flavor for me.  The clusters were crunchy without being crumbly.  So it didn't make a mess.  I suppose if you left the box or a packet in the sun or near something hot the fudge would melt a bit and stick together or the inside of the bag, but when the item arrive that had not happened.  So shipping wise it appears to be well handled before it gets to the customer.<br /><br />At the time I'm writing this review, Amazon is selling a 6 box pack for $30.50 (which would mean free shipping).  Each box has 6 packets for a total of 36 packets at roughly $0.85 per packet.  That's a pretty good per unit prices if you ask me.

review/text: What could be better? Caramel corn drizzled with chocolate. YUM!<br /><br />This comes packaged in individual servings each totaling 130 calories.  If you can stick to just ONE pouch, you have more self control than I do.  It satisfies my cravings for crunchy sweet and chocolate all in one snack.<br /><br />Now, if I can just train myself to eat only one package!

review/text: "Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn" really sound pretty good.  In execution these are kind of like a cross between the chocolate and caramel popcorns the Boy Scouts sell every year.  Not bad but not great.  They come in handy packets to take on the go.  They aren't a show stopper but they aren't too bad either.

review/summary: Thank goodness for portion control
review/text: It's a good thing these Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn bits are packaged in a portion control pack- otherwise you'd eat the whole box at one sitting.  My family is a big fan of Crunch N Munch which we can barely keep around when we get it.  This goes Crunch N Munch one better in that the caramel clusters of popcorn are lightly drizzled with a rich chocolate coating.  Much better than the milk chocolate than you'd find on your typical candy bar.  So, go ahead and grab a box. But, make sure you tell yourself you're only going to have one package when  you go to get them from the pantry.

review/text: For low-calorie candied popcorn, you really can't beat the price, but, really, it's quite a hefty price tag.<br /><br />The chocolate and sugar seem to be of good quality, and the popcorn itself was great, with a bare minimum number of shells and no old maids.<br /><br />My family will continue to make our own candy corn, but might consider a box of this stuff for the next long car trip.

review/text: I really liked these.  The caramel corn was rather light and airy, not as heavy as some other caramel corns can be.  The chocolate drizzle wasn't overwhelming and served more as an added flavor.  Not overly sweet.  Somewhat sticky, altho I didn't have any problems with the popcorn melting together in the unopened packages.  These are perfect when I'm at work and want to munch on something that's sweet but not heavy or overwhelming (altho I will say, I tend to eat 2 packages at a time, which defeats the purpose of the 130 calories packs!) I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a sweet tooth looking for a tasty snack that's not high in calories!

review/summary: Decent, but would be better without the cheap "fudge"
review/text: Maybe I'm a simpleton, but I like caramel popcorn. The popcorn in these snack packs is actually quite good, and they do a nice job finding a way to avoid packing a bunch of kernels in each pack; you're not paying for a bunch of duds at the bottom. The only reason I can't rate this higher is that the chocolate used is of such low quality that you can taste how bad it is even though it's a small proportion of the snack. They probably thought they could get away with using cheap chocolate because it's mostly caramel and popcorn, but they went too far.

review/text: Another great Snackwells product, fresh tasting, fudge drizzle is outstanding (not too overpowering and not too bland, just perfect). The caramel popcorn is also tender and sweet.  The only problem (like most Snackwell products) is that you'll probably end up eating a lot more low calorie packs than your diet might allow, making this tasty treat not so low calorie!  But if you have the willpower, this is a great snaking option for the sweet tooth.

review/summary: 130 calorie snack that does the trick!
review/text: I happen to like the prepackaged snacks so that I'm not inclined to overindulge in any one item.  One package of Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn will leave you satisified. You won't feel as though you were a deprived dieter. Instead, you will feel like you treated yourself to a tasty snack. For those watching carbs, this is rather high for one snack - 25 carbs.  My son loves Dale and Thomas Choc. Drizzle Popcorn and he loves this! I think that alone says alot! This item got 4 stars instead of 5 for the cost per package compared to other single package snacks.

One co-worker and I laughed that if you make the portion size small enough you can have anything be a 100 calorie snack - even popcorn that is covered in sugar and then drizzled in chocolate.<br /><br />Since I love sugar one little pouch didn't do much for me as a snack -- it just made me want to eat another, and another and another.  I think that might defeat the benefits of putting it in little pouches.<br /><br />All and all it was a tastey little treat.

review/summary: Great little snack!
review/text: Like another reviewer, I ordered this for my wife.  We've both been counting calories for several weeks now and are always on the lookout for a low(er) calorie snack.  So, having no prior experience with the Snackwell brand, I ordered these to give to my wife as a little treat with her lunch.<br /><br />Her reaction?  She loves them!  They taste great and she loves that they come in a 130-calorie pack (it's easy to calculate into her daily log).  Of course, her one complaint is that it's a little small, but what do you expect for 130 calories?<br /><br />I'd like to state that I know this isn't a health or diet food--from a nutritional standpoint, it has too much sugar and is basically a waste of calories.  But when you're on a diet, the occasional luxury goes a long way in being able to maintain your willpower, and this is a great tasting snack that won't bust your calorie count.  Although at the current price per pack, it might bust your bank account.

Not to mention that I'm limited to scarfing down no more than 130 calories per pack!!

review/text: These snacks are basically caramel popcorn, with chocolate swirled on top. It's a nice combination, and there's just enough chocolate so it doesn't overpower the caramel popcorn. The box comes with 6 packs, and each pack is just about the right size for a snack. The only thing that's annoying is there are often little crumbs leftover in the pack. Nothing too serious, but be careful not to spill the pack while you're eating.

review/summary: Tasty but not much in each package
review/text: This is promoted as a tasty, relatively low calorie snack, and that is true.  But it gets most of its low calorie effect by having very little of the popcorn in each packet.  I found that I was never satisfied with only one, but that I needed two to feel like I'd had any kind of snack.<br /><br />If, however, you are content with a snack that has very little in way of bulk, or are dieting and want to keep things to very tiny portions, then this just might be for you.  I think most snackers are going to find they need two packages, but perhaps I only speak for myself.

review/summary: Very delicious!  Not at all nutritious!
review/text: OK, here's the bottom line.  These are a snack, loaded with sugar.  They are not meant as a "healthy snack" and I am rating the product as such.<br /><br />The product is packaged as a six pack, each containing 1.06 ounces of the popcorn.  One package is 130 calories, 25 of which are from fat.  Total fat content is 3 grams, 2.5 of which is saturated fat. The ingredient list is brown sugar, popcorn, sugar, corn syrup, palm and/or palm kernel oil, skim milk, cocoa, whey powder, salt, soybean oil, soy lecithin, and vanilla extract.  Essentially, lots and lots of sugar.<br /><br />OK, so its not a health snack.  That said, on to the taste.  I would not describe these as tasting too much like Cracker Jacks, but more like the drizzled popcorn you would find at Dale and Thomas Popcorn. The popcorn is not as dense like you might expect from something like Cracker Jack's heavier coating.  The overall coating is somewhat lighter, with a decent drizzling of "fudge" coating.<br /><br />The snack is delicious and a one ounce bag goes quickly. The bags are small though, so price-wise, these are expensive compared to regular popcorn.  They aren't any worse than buying any other "gourmet popcorn" though.<br /><br />Now for those who are just looking to jazz up their popcorn when sitting down to watch a movie with the family, but want to save some money and/or control ingredients, another option is to pop some regular popcorn and then drizzle your own home-made syrup on it.....anything from bottled syrup to melted brown, maple syrup, honey, etc.<br /><br />All in all, this is a tasty treat!

review/text: I don't normally like super sweet snacks, but this was delectable. I could taste all of the flavors in the pack. The chocolate is rich, the caramel was sweet, and then it also has a hint of savoriness.<br /><br />Each pack is individually packed. It can get a little messy, though, eating it, because the milk chocolate melts quickly in the warmer weather. I enjoyed this mostly with milk, because it helped offset some of the sweetness.<br /><br />I didn't find a lot of "unpopped" pieces like I normally would with popcorn products. However, I think this would taste better as a rice cracker type of snack.

review/text: I like popcorn and I like chocolate.  So, these Snackwell's fit my bill.  The funny thing about "low calorie packs" is that is really just about portion control.  Cut a donut into 4 pieces, put each piece in an individual bag and congratulations you have snackpacks!<br /><br />I did find these Snackwell's tasty though and so did my wife.<br /><br /> On the plus side:  To me they really taste sort of like Cracker Jacks with some chocolate on top which turns out to be a very good combo.  The small bag size is a plus by preventing me from zoning out in front of the TV and finishing a giant bag before it's too late to notice.<br /><br /> On the minus side:  The bags are small relative to the price you pay.  They are not that nutritional, the "snackwell" label could give you a false sense of healthiness that is only being mitigated by small bag size.<br /><br />Overall, a good item to reach for occasionally from the snack menu - 4 stars.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good...
review/text: Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is surprisingly good. The popcorn is a delicious combination of salty and sweet. The package size is convent for a lunch bag or in backpack on a day hike. The snack is more sugar (18g) than I normally like in a 130 calorie snack, but what do you expect when "Fudge Drizzle Caramel" is in the name.<br /><br />Package Nutritional Facts:<br />Calories 130<br />  Calories from Fat 25<br />Total Fat 3g<br />  Saturated Fat 2.5g<br />Sodium 190mg<br />Potassium 30mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 24g<br />  Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />  Sugars 18g<br />Protein 1g

review/summary: They taste like Cracker Jack with chocolate on them
review/text: And that can't really be bad, can it? This is definitely on the much, much sweeter side. I'm convinced that I have diabetes after consuming a box of this stuff. BUT, like all Snackwell items, they go for portion control by putting them in relatively small pouches. Overall, they taste great and make a good snack to toss in your back pack before a long day. Will definitely pick up another box...or three.

review/summary: Better Than You're Expecting
review/text: I had the opportunity to try these out, and I was impressed.  I was expecting something dry and stale, or overly sweet like Cracker Jacks, and I was wrong.<br /><br />Each box (and you get six) contains 5 little packs.  Each pack is a good serving size and doesn't overwhelm you or leave unsatisfied. The individual packs are sealed like bags of chips.<br /><br />The taste, and most impressively the freshness, was great.  They weren't too sweet, and the salty balance from the popcorn made it a real treat.<br /><br />I'll say this again: these are nothing like Cracker Jacks, or similar "caramel popcorn" candies. They're 100x better.  Yum!

review/summary: Satisfying and tasty
review/text: This is a very tasty low-fat snack - it's light but pleasantly sweetened with caramel and choocolate drizzle, so it tastes decadent without being heavy.  I'd compare it favorably with just about any other sweetened popcorn snack I've eaten, in fact I'd daresay it may become one of my favorites - very satisfying for just 130 calories.  Although these small "portion control" packs are, like most products of their kind, quite expensive by the ounce, they are a good incentive not to over-snack - finish the pack and you're done.  At least theoretically.

I like to give them as gifts. And with the many flavors and the perfect potful size makes it a very easy gift idea.<br /><br />I got it in excellent condition. I used the Subscribe and Save and saved 15% off the price, which made it only $10. And for 12oz. of good tasting coffee, it's a bargin. I'm very happy with my order.

Each section of the bars are individual pieces themselves imprinted with the product's winged creature. Made to easily break into individual rows or pieces.<br /><br />Outer appearance of the wrapper is nice. Though those who have a distinct taste for white-chocolate will notice the more mellow factor of this product.

review/summary: Kikkoman Wakame Soup
review/text: I really like this soup. It's simple to make, just add boiling water, give it a stir, and let it sit for a few minutes.<br /><br />It's also very tasty. It has a fish broth, but to me it doesn't really taste fishy, just slightly salty. If you don't like the salt taste, you can make it less intense by adding more water, which is what I do. The seaweed in this soup has a nice texture, it's not rubbery or anything like that. Just pleasant. The smell might remind you of the sea, but I don't think that's a big surprise. Once you taste it, you get over the smell.<br /><br />It's also conveniant, because I can usually find this soup in the Asian foods aisle of almost any grocery store.

You can add thinly sliced sauteed beef and a small pinch of dried chili flakes to this soup to change it up, but it's perfect just the way it is.<br /><br />If you can visualize yourself taking a long deep breath of ocean air, the briney parfume filling your nasal cavity is the best way to describe your overall taste experience. Plus, it has just the right amount of soft, thin seaweed pieces.<br /><br />My four year old son loves it, he'll ask for two servings when I make it.<br /><br />"Kikkoman Instant Wakame Soup Is A Winner!"

review/text: I love tortilla chips as a snack. But they need a dip to live up to their full snack potential! There are a lot of bland dips/salsas out there that do not satisfy me very much. But this product does the job!<br /><br />The fact that "habanero" is in the product name should be a hint. This is not so hot, though, that it really burns and becomes unplesant. The heat is enjoyable without being overwhelming. Couled with mango, the taste is fresh and fruity. This is one of the favorite dips for my chips.

review/summary: Best. Salsa. Ever
review/text: I lived on this stuff in college and can still put away half a jar in one sitting. I love chips and salsa but I'm also kind of picky about it but this stuff is like a magical song and dance in your mouth. The consistency is perfect, mostly "sauce" with enough chunks and goodies to keep it from being a hot sauce. The heat is perfect, definitely hot, especially if you don't eat/like spicy food, but it's not so spicy that it takes away from the food you put it on. The flavor is, well see above about magical song and dance.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I can't buy this stuff in gallon jugs. Also these prices are twice as much as in your local grocery store. If you're having trouble finding it check Winco, if you have those around. I guess then this review is for the actual product, 5+ stars, not the amazon listing, 1 star for exorbitant prices.

review/text: I've always been a fan of Mango Habanero wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The combination of intense heat with a little bit of sweetness works very well.  Well this salsa is definitely just as good.  It tastes great with chips or on top of Mexican food.  It definitely has a kick though (officially they call it "Medium Hot").  My wife is a huge spice addict and she says this is the best salsa she's ever had in her life.

review/text: Definitely one of the better salsas I've found at the store (nothing beats homemade, though). So many supermarket salsas are labeled "medium" and "hot" but are actually mild and gross. This one has some bite! Not as sweet as I'd expect or prefer a mango salsa to be, but stirring in 1 tablespoon of agave nectar after opening does the trick. Try it!

review/text: I'm familiar with Mario Camacho olives, but hadn't tried their cocktail onions until I bought these.  These are very small jars, which I didn't notice until they arrived, but they are very good quality.  They're crispy and crunchy and have just the right amount of vinegar and salt in the brine.  The onions themselves are small, like what you'd put in a martini, not the bigger ones you sometimes see in salad bars.<br /><br />If it hadn't been for Amazon's free Supersaver shipping I probably wouldn't have purchased these, but 12 little jars will last us a long time.  And they are shelf stable so we don't have to rush to eat them before they expire.

As the other poster said, the flavor is good, but doesn't last long and then the gum is very hard.  It's because of the size, this is typical of small gumballs and if I'd known, I wouldn't have purchased these.

review/summary: Finickiest Feline Loves this Stuff
review/text: I have never had or seen a cat as picky as my current cat is.  He will not touch any moist food, fresh food, milk.  I have found only 2 dry foods he will eat (Science Diet and now Bench & Fields Holistic Brand) and in his 8 years I have tried every organic cat treat I could find.  He used to love the Bench & Fields Cat Treats until they changed the formula about three or so years back and he won't touch them.<br /><br />I stumbled upon these Bonita Tuna Flakes while browsing Amazon and saw great comments and bought a small pouch to give it a try.  I put a pinch down in front of my cat and he gave me a look like "What the heck is this?"  I was bummed to think there is yet another treat he won't touch.  But after he sniffed it and looked at it for a few minutes, he finally gave it a try.  That was it.  He is INSANE for this stuff.  I give it to him around the same time every day and he starts pacing and giving me this pathetic meow like he is dying every evening until I declare "Time for treats!" and it is all I can do to get the container open and pull out a pinch, because he is literally shaking in excitement to get his "fix."<br /><br />I like this brand in the big plastic container, because I don't have to reorder so much and I can always have an extra container on standby so I don't run out.  It's a little pricey, but for me it is totally worth it, since I have had no luck with any other cat treats before.  And I can't foresee any issue of a "change of formula" happening like with Bench & Fields.  These are flakes of tuna and should always be the same.  So now I have a treat that my cat will enjoy for the rest of his pampered finicky life.

review/summary: Very cute
review/text: Ordered for goody bags for a safari themed party.  Not one cookie was broken--awesome!--but only a kid would willingly eat these.  It's a basic cookie with that bland "pure sugar" frosting.  So I took off one star for the less than stellar taste, but all the kids loved them.

review/summary: Great Honey Sticks!
review/text: These are the greats treat.  My grandkids enjoy them as well as my daughters and myself.  I haven't had them pop at the wrong end for me, if anything, they are sometimes hard to open. I find that if I put one end in my mouth and squeeze the other end in my hand, and I bite down perpendicular to the seam in my mouth, it pops open for me. This is excellent quality honey.  When I want something sweet after a meal, before bed, or at the office, I have one or two of these. I carry them in my purse and my lunch sack. My grandson takes them to school in his lunch box. Honey is pure and so good for you.  I used them for my sore throat also. I didn't cure me of bronchitis or sinusitis, but soothed my sore throat from coughing!  I highly recommend subscribing to this item!

review/text: So delicious! Honey sticks in general are a bit more expensive than I thought, and these are no exception. But they are very delicious and worth it.<br /><br />Despite the price. Fast shipping. Nicely packaged, and ridiculously addictive ^_^

review/text: These honey sticks are just as I remember them from my childhood.  Sweet and delicious.  The quality of the honey is great, and none of the sticks had leaked when I opened the containers.  I also appreciate the functional jars, which fit neatly into my cupboard.  Highly recommended item!

review/summary: Great lunch box item!
review/text: I bought these for my preschooler and my kindergartner.  They love them in their lunch boxes.  The only thing I don't like about them is that they are supposed to "pop" open at the end with a little bit of pressure, but several times, especially with my preschooler, they have "popped" open at the WRONG end.  What a mess!  Otherwise, these are GREAT...especially when the kids are coughing.

review/summary: The PERFECT Honey
review/text: This honey is absolutely superb, especially if you get bored and need something to nosh on. I also found these nicely packaged honey stix to be absolutely convenient for when I'm at school. They're a quick pick me up after hours of being in lecture classes. They're the best form of sugar you can get, since honey is already pre-digested I also love the "pop" in your mouth. The best method to open these babies beside ravenously tearing into them, is to bend the straw, stick both ends in your mouth and gently bite down- the popping sensation is the best part! The ooze of honey is just perfect. I've had over 20 stix today, and I don't regret it! Great for dieting, too! Low in calories, and chock full of energy! :)

review/summary: These are awsome!!!  A Staple in My Kitchen!!!
review/text: I drink a lot of tea with honey.  I snip the tips of the honey stix (which is really a straw filled with honey), then insert into the cup and stir.  This provides the perfect amount without adding a spoon or making a mess of sticky honey.  Also good for keeping in my purse for low blood sugar problems.  The honey does not go bad if it left in my purse for weeks or months, doesn't crush, and takes up little room.  The taste is wonderful- very smooth and sweet!  I keep a pull-up dispenser of these(like the ones that hold regular straws but smaller) on my counter all the time.  Why didn't anyone think of this sooner?

review/text: almost a cinnamon taste to them, but that is the clover.  the honey is clean and almost clear. it is sweet and genuine. 4g of carbs per stick (beats glucose tabs if you are a diabetic) and kids love them! a bit costly.

review/summary: great for what I use it for
review/text: Occasionally I like to have tea with honey, but not often. While this is expensive in comparison to a jar of honey, over time honey crystalizes and is hard to use. One of these packs of honey will last me two years. In that same time, I'd go through 5 or 6 bears.<br /><br />The honey quality and flavor is quite reasonable.

review/summary: Non-Messy Honey - Excellent
review/text: The honey is sweet.  One stick is just the precise amount for teas, hot cererals, plain yogurt and for a snack.<br />Great for kids. Will definitely order more once supply is finished. Honey sticks and a box or two of tea would make a nice gift. Seller and product are highly recommended.

review/text: This is a good product. The honey tastes great, and it's very convenient and non-messy. My local TeaVana store was trying to sell this to me for twice the price as Amazon, so I'm pretty sure this is a good buy.

review/summary: Good if you know how to open it :)
review/text: If you have problems opening it, here is a way: fold the stick in half and put both ends in your mouth. Then simply squish the other end. One of the sides in your mouth will open and you have no problem with messy hands :) Enjoy!

review/summary: Very convenient
review/text: I love honey, but it can be messy. I keep this jar at work, and if I want honey in my tea I just use one of these straws, no fuss no muss. Sometimes I eat it straight from the straw, just like at the country fair. Beware if you are used to sticking one in your mouth and popping it open with your teeth. The seal is weird on these, so that sometimes it squirts out the other side. You need to use scissors, that's why I took one star off.
