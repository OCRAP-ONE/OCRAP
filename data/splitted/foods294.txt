review/text: I do not like to chew gum and can't chew it too long without getting tmj symptoms, new gums have flavors that last well beyond my tolerance. This gum is harder to chew, but somehow I don't get tmj symptoms. I like the way it makes my teeth feel like they've been polished! I buy it in bulk and leave it my car.

review/summary: Just like Municipal Stadium
review/text: I've been using this mustard on just about anything possible for longer than I can remember, even after moving away from Northeast Ohio more than 16 years ago.  I always have at least a couple of bottles of this on hand and even a few friends that have never been to the Cleveland area have converted and begun buying Stadium Mustard.

review/text: Stadium Mustard is to mustard what bacon is to cured meats.  It turns your food into a mustard delivery device.  It's not overbearing, or overly spicy...just the right combination of flavors to enhance your meal.  It's impossible to get at local stores, so I bought a case.  I gave a few to family members & friends, and they keep asking for more.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Stadium Mustard brings back memories of going to Cleveland Stadium on the lake, and having hot dogs and Stadium Mustard while watching the Cleveland Indians play ball.  My father took me to those games all the way up from Columbus, and I remember squirting the Stadium Mustard the full length of those juicy hot dogs!  Never have had better hot dogs and mustard anywhere else!

review/summary: My new favorite flavor!
review/text: This is my new favorite flavor in The Simply Bar! The peanut butter is very subtle but makes for a nice balance between the PB and Cocoa flavors.  I find it hard to control myself and only eat one of these, and my husband is going through them like they're candy!<br /><br />If you haven't tried The Simply Bar (in any flavor) yet, you MUST try it. You'll be hooked!  These bars are low in calories and fat but high in protein. The other bonus is that they are milk and gluten-free, if you happen to have food sensitivities like I do. My other protein bars are so high in calories that I can only eat 1/2 of the bar at a time, but with these, I get the whole bar without the guilt! Plus, The Simply Bar gives me twice as much protein than my other protein bars. The other thing that I like is the fact that the ingredients list isn't a mile long with stuff that I don't even recognize. These are made with very few ingredients, all healthy.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: High protein for so few calories... awesome! But this is not without the compromises you would expect. Simply put, the taste isn't great and can be pretty dry (the later is pretty much remedied with a glass of water though). It tastes like unsweetened chocolate mostly. Let me say that it's not terrible at all. I could tollerate it but a for a few more calories I'm more than happy to get a bar that I don't have to "tolerate" at every bite. It's up to you then to decide what you want out of your protein bar.

review/summary: Great protein snack bar
review/text: I bought these based on the recommendation in the "Carb Sensitivity Program" book and I really enjoy them.  I gave these bars 5 stars because they taste really good, the protein and fiber counts are high and the carb, fat and calorie counts are low.  These are a perfect pre-workout snack.  I will say this though, out of the flavors I have tried, I actually like this one the least.  I much prefer the Lemon Coconut and the Cinnamon Pecan.<br /><br />The texture is similar to a rice crispy treat and they are not overly sweet.  I love that they do not have any sugar alcohol in them and that all of their ingredients are "whole".  There isn't an ingredient that I cannot pronounce.  The downside, just eating one is a challenge!

I didn't expect for them to taste so delicious because they looked kinda weird but oh my god they are the best tasting bars out there.

review/summary: My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs!
review/text: I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Yellow Corn, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Pork Meal, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Beet Pulp, Anchovy & Sardine Meal, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Wheat Germ Meal, Potassium Chloride, Carrots, Peas, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.)  26%<br /><br />Crude Fat (min.)  12%<br /><br />Crude Fiber (max.)  3.00%<br /><br />Moisture  (max.)  10.00%<br /><br />Calcium (min.)  1.00%<br /><br />Phosphorus (min.)  0.080%<br /><br />Vitamin A  (min.)  22,000 IU/kg<br /><br />Vitamin E  (min.)  165 IU/kg<br /><br />Ascorbic Acid (min.)  30 mg/kg<br />(Vitamin C)*<br /><br />Omega 6 Fatty (min.)  2.40%<br />Acids *<br /><br />Omega 3 Fatty (min.)  0.60%<br />Acids*<br /><br />Glucosamine  (min.)  340 mg/kg<br />Hydrochloride<br /><br />Total Lactic Acid  (min.)  100,000,000<br />Microrganisms*<br /><br />(Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium in equal amounts)<br />*Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles<br />Eagle Pack Senior Adult Dog Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance.<br /><br />FEEDING GUIDELINES (from the website):<br /><br />Transitioning to Eagle Pack�<br />It is important to slowly transition your dog from his/her current diet as it takes a few days for the body to adapt to the new nutrient levels.

Keep a clean bowl of fresh water available at all times.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: My two senior dogs absolutely love this food.  They were in good condition before, but are now in excellent condition.  My 15 year old mini poodle had a "gas" problem, but that was all.  His blood work showed an elevated liver count.<br /><br />My 9 year old standard poodle had soft stool, was lethargic and was generally just off.  The vet could find nothing wrong.  She recommended a food change to a "senior" food.<br /><br />We have completed our first full 30 lb bag and what a difference.  No more gas in Gizmo and the Standard Poodle, Clio, is acting very active and young again.  Her stool is also firm again.<br /><br />I am now going to be a regular customer as my vet likes the results also.

review/text: I ordered from this seller for the 1st time and I was definitely disappointed.  The dog food bag was very shabby looking and it only had 4 months before it expired.  That concerned me.  I contacted the seller and he replaced it with another, but the expiration date was exactly the same on the second bag.  I returned the second bag and I'm waiting for a credit on my account.  I would not order this item from this seller again. This item was ordered from Wag.com, not Amazon.

review/text: The product deserves 5 stars, Amazon's packaging deserves 0 stars. Amazon ships sturdy books with more protective packaging than these delicate biscuits had (they were in a cardboard sleeve).  Instead of getting a box of six biscuits, I got a box of crumbs. I wish I were exaggerating, but not one biscuit was even half intact. This was a complete waste of money, and a complete disappointment. I'll buy Viennese Whirls again, but not from Amazon.

Also I was under the illusion that I was getting more than one box of 6 biscuits for $9.99. The Term 6 pack is misleading. 1 box of 6 tiny & stale biscuits is what it should say.<br /><br />I'll never buy food off Amazon again, there's just no quality control!

review/text: Just received my first order of these yesterday and and they taste amazing! Granted, they are not soaked in oil, but you could easily fork over more than $50 for a similar quantity of these if you were to get them in those little olive oil-containing bottles you find at the supermarket.<br /><br />I used them for a recipe of Chicken Milano (I simmered them in a heavy cream and chicken broth mixture for 10-15 mins) and I didn't even have to soak them beforehand. They easily absorbed the moisture and the consistency was perfect.<br /><br />And did I mention they taste really fresh?<br /><br />So, to review: great taste + great price + great freshness = 5 stars

review/text: These tomatoes are very dry when compared to store bought dried tomatoes. I tried to soften them by placing in a jar of olive oil but even after weeks they continue to have a very tough, leathery texture. The only way I can use them is to cut them into very fine pieces (a very tedious task without a blender).  Disappointing as I had plans for many dishes, now I have 3 pounds that will need to be ground up for any use.

review/summary: Buyer Beware: This product contains SULFUR DIOXIDE!
review/text: Searching for the best sun-dried tomatoes is always a frustrating one because I am looking for a non sulfur dioxide product with nice flavor and affordability. These are affordable and mind you I read as much as I could including the labels and all the reviews but there was no mention of sulfur dioxide as an ingredient in this particular product. So I bought it with confidence thinking that although it was not organic, it was free of sulfur dioxide. Yesterday I opened it up to make some salad dressing for my raw dishes only to realize by just watching the color of the product alone that it had some additive which the ingredient list confirmed. I can't return the product so now I am stuck with 3 lbs of unsatisfactory product and I still have to go buy additional product that is sulfur free!<br />Roland your company needs to indicate in the description that it's sun-dried product contains sulfur dioxide, health is a big concern so  you don't want to be responsible for any kind of customer health issues from this product.<br />Buyer beware!

review/text: These tomatoes seem very soft for dried tomatoes, which is great! They are also very flavorful. I've been using them in a coconut curry and I don't even bother soaking them to soften them, I just throw 5 of them (five halves) in the vita-mix with everything but the coconut milk, blend for a minute and then simmer together with the coconut milk. Delicious! I originally purchased these because I had some raw food recipes that called for quite a bit of dried tomatoes and these seem nearly perfect for that (the thing that makes them less than perfect to me is that they aren't organic) but 3 pounds is still so much I gave one bag to my boyfriend who thinks I'm weird for giving him a pound of dried tomatoes but once I give him the coconut curry recipe he'll be thanking me.<br /><br />Oh, and the bags zip lock shut after they're opened, which is a nice touch.

review/summary: Sun Dried Tomatoes - 1 Lb bags
review/text: These were very nice. I saw other reviews about the flavor being off. I was very happy with the flavor. There are two types of sundried tomatoes. Dried and smoked. These are dried. This gives a medium color and flavor. for those who want the dark or almost black color and a strong flavor. Use the smoked kind. I found these to be very nice.<br /> I was cooking a Sundried Tomatoe Chicken (breast meat chuncks), with diced onion,fine diced bell pepper and crushed garlic paste(on the pan seered chicked). I used kitchen sizzors, and cut these into very small diced chuncks. I would recomend slow cooking these (simmer all  ingrediants in water ) or cook the day before and reheat for serving. That brings out the full flavor of the tomatoes (and garlic). it also gives the chicken that light red tomatoe color as the flavor soaks in. Just serve over white rice and it is very Yunny. It is the sundried tomatoes color and flavor,that make this something very special.<br /> I have served this recipe to Caterers & 5-star chefs, and they were very impressed, as the flavor and color is unlike any other combination.  Several asked for my recipe.<br />Chef Duke - Hollywood CA

review/text: I had hoped to save some money on our coffee fetish of drinking only Peruvian grown beans by subscribing to Amazon's program for getting one 5 pound bag of Peruvian beans every two months but two of three bags of beans were so stale I had to throw them out. When this last bag arrived and I opened it, I knew right away it was bad. It smelled like plastic instead of the wonderful aroma of fresh roasted coffee beans, and the beans look stale. So I have cancelled my subscription and will go back to ordering our beans from our local organic food buying club through UNFI. This was an expensive trial, having gotten $100 worth of worthless beans.

review/summary: THE BEST all natural bar I've had!
review/text: Finally, a really tasty bar thats all natural and does not have soy or artificial stuff in it plus it's high in fiber! I am always looking for a bar to carry in my bag when I'm out in the field and just need something to keep me going but I don't want something I feel guilty about eating. No bar can replace a good healthy meal but sometimes you just need something to hold you over. The battle is always coming across bars that taste awful, have the texture of wall plaster or have artificial sweetener and flavorings, soy or too much sugar etc. but here is one I feel good about eating. It has a moist but firm texture and tastes mostly of cocoa with a bit of cinnamon with a very satisfying texture of whole oats, nuts and raisins but is not too sweet. I like these bars far better then any other brand I've tried. They taste like something I would make myself. I can't wait to try the other flavors but I would buy the oatmeal raisin again for sure. I really like this product and it doesn't put me in a sugar crash. THANKS EAT.THINK Smile, great product!<br /><br />All bars are a bit of a trade off depending on your personal needs. Some are looking for high protein low carb bars, this is not one of them. Some don't like artificial bars, some no fat, some want a meal replacement etc..

There is a definite oatmeal, and small amount of raisin taste, and not too sweet.

review/summary: Mediocre taste with a gritty texture.
review/text: These oatmeal raisin bars are purported to be healthy nutrition bars. There is really nothing healthy or nutritious about these "Eat Think Smile" bars. They are high in calories (200), fat (8g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either. The claim is that because they contain cocoa (chocolate) they are good for you because chocolate is supposed to be an antioxidant. That is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven. The only ingredients that might be healthy are the raisins and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog's Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these "Eat Think Smile" bars. The claim is that these bars are a smart choice! If you are starving and only alternative is eating dirt, the dirt might be a healthier choice actually. I really dislike companies that create this kind of ridiculous untrue hype about any product.<br /><br />These "Eat Think Smile" bars are basically cookies and that would be ok if they tasted good but they don't. They have a gritty texture and taste overly sweet. If you are looking for a great tasting real nutrition bar, then check out the Zone nutrition bars or the Kellog's Fiber Plus bars.<br /><br />If you like gritty cookies with a very hard chocolate taste, very sweet and really nothing nutritious in them, then you might like these bars.<br />If on the other hand you are serious about health and nutrition, then there are a lot of better choices that taste much better.

review/text: The chocolate taste is definitely there, along with the oatmeal and raisin. The raisin taste is less noticeable, so the overall flavor is quite bland with the bitterness of dark chocolate/cocoa. Some people might like these semi non-sweet taste, but I really dislike the weird chocolate taste and the aftertaste of slight bitterness. It's not dry at all, but mostly chewy.<br /><br />All in all, I would not buy this product at all simply based on the taste. I would rather eat other nutritional bars, such as Cliffs, Lara, and  granola bars.

review/summary: Have a glass of milk or water handy
review/text: My palate tends to be open to health foods and I really like the flavor of the Oatmeal Raisin bars. Their texture is not as dry as the Cranberry Orange bars, but it is still dry enough to require having a drink at hand<br /><br />Flavor analysis: The cinnamon dominates in a pleasant way. It is not as hidden by the cocoa or whole grain flours as in the Orange Cranberry bars. I enjoy this flavor more than the Orange Cranberry, which is a switch for me.<br /><br />Texture: Best described as slightly powdery.<br /><br />Miscellaneous: These could actually do with a little less sweetener. They seem sweeter than the Orange Cranberry.<br /><br />Final Analysis: I can deal with the texture, but if I want a healthy snack, I would prefer that I didn't get that sugar rush feel. They are a decent size and have only 200 calories. That was a nice surprise. Even though the cocoa powder doesn't quite dominate in these bars, it is the second contender in flavor and think it would be better to market them as "Oatmeal Raisin Cocoa" bars.

review/summary: Lots of calories, lots of carbs, not much protein
review/text: I ordered a box of these Oatmeal Raisin as well as well as the Orange Cranberry flavored bars through the Amazon Vine program. Frankly, I cannot think of why anyone would buy these alleged "health" bars. Each of these bars are 200 calories, have 7 grams of fat, 10 mg of cholesterol a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrate and only four grams of protein. Also, based upon a 2,000 calorie per day diet they don't provide any Vitamin A, or Vitamin C, 4% of the recommended Calcium, 8% of the Iron, 6% of Thiamin and 10% of Magnesium. At the time of this writing, this Oatmeal Raisin Flavor bar was not yet available for sale but different flavored 12 packs of this same brand of bar sells for around $19. Not only do these bars fall short from a true health standpoint but they're not very good tasting either. They're not terrible but the consumer would definitely want to have it with coffee or tea. As a stand alone bar it's got kind of a chalky texture. There are so many truly healthy and good tasting bars on the market that I don't see this brand becoming a favorite in many households; certainly not in ours. I would have been mad if I had actually paid for these bars.

review/text: I really enjoyed these and was surprised at how much they remind me of a "normal" chocolate-oatmeal-raisin cookie. But I don't really feel they should be called nutrition bars, as while they have 28% RDA of dietary fiber per bar, they have only 4g of protein, 4% RDA of calcium and 8% RDA of iron, and that's it; no other vitamins/minerals. When I hear "nutrition bar" I'm expecting a bit more than that. Even so, they are tasty and filling and only 200 calories per bar so I'll buy some from time to time for those "rushed mornings" when a decent breakfast is impossible.

review/summary: Second best bar I've had out of many
review/text: I've been on a real Bar-kick recently, mostly for a quick breakfast on the way out to door as I'm always at least 15 minutes late to work but don't want to skip breakfast.  I started with Cliff bars but those got old.  Then I moved on to Larabars, which are good and come in some interesting flavours, but after eating them for a few weeks I decided they were too sweet for anything more than occasional consumption.<br /><br />My favorite, to date, are the 18 Rabbits Bars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV0M2E">18 Rabbits Haute Diggity Date, Organic Granola Bar, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, which are awesome.<br /><br />However, these Eat Think Smile bars were a big surprise ... so far I'd give them the silver medal behind 18 Rabbits, and will keep buying them just to keep some variety.<br /><br />What do I like about these bars?  Let me think about what I like about them ... first, they don't taste like a typical health food bar - while the box says oatmeal raisin, to me they taste more like a brownie (not quite as good as a real brownie but pretty close for a packaged bar).  The second think I really like about these bars is unlike a lot of the bars out there which are too sugary, these are just sweet enough without being sweet but more importantly their carbohydrate content comes from DIETARY FIBER.  28% DV of Dietary Fiber people.  Do you realize like 75% of Americans don't get enough Fiber in their diets?  Hello?<br /><br />So I recommend these and will keep purchasing them myself even though I got this box for free via the Vine program.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this informative review.

review/summary: A Relatively Healthy Treat
review/text: Eat. Think. Smile's Oatmeal Raisin bars are a nice alternative to a mid-day candy bar. While perhaps not as tasty as something dipped in chocolate, the Eat. Think. Smile bars are baked and are relatively low in fat (7g, and only 1g saturated fat) although somewhat high in carbohydrates (34g) They also contain CocoaOne, which is described as "a unique blend of African cocoa and a premium Meso-American variety known ads Lavado," supposedly a natural antioxident.<br /><br />Taste-wise, the Eat. Think. Smile bars taste much like a Cliff bar, and have the same shape and texture. The Eat Think Smile bars have a softer texture, and are more crumbly than a Cliff bar.<br />The oatmeal raisin taste is pleasant and not at all overwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, I liked these bars. While not a replacement for a good breakfast or healthy lunch, these bars are perfect for that time of the day when you want a little snack, but don't necessarily want all of the fat and extras in a typical candy bar.

review/summary: Great low calorie snack to tide you over hunger urges in between meals
review/text: The Eat Think Smile Baked Nutrition Bar, Oatmeal Raisin, is a great low calorie nutrition bar/snack to tide you over hunger urges in between regular meals. At 1.8-ounce/200 calorie per bar, it is packed with different vitamins, minerals and fiber, from Vitamin A to Zinc, to supplement your daily nutritional requirements. Fiber content is around 7g per bar. I used mine basically as a pre-workout energy supplement to get that much needed energy to give you a push in your workouts. Be forewarned though that each bar has 200 calories, so if you stuff yourself up with 3 or more of this bar, for those of you that watches their caloric intake, this pretty much accelerates it, so moderation is the key when eating it. Just enough to tide you over those regular, more nutritious on time meals. A great snack, just don't over do it.

review/summary: Good for Breakfast or a snack
review/text: A recent news story noted that Americans are skipping the traditional sit down breakfast for more on-the-go choices. Nuts, snack bars, etc. This is a perfect way to get healthful nutrition and a filling meal or snack on the go. It's a great blend of grans, raisins, and cocoa. It is a filling snack that will give you hours of energy. It tastes good, and not like the cardboard competitors. It also travels well, not melting or turning to mush as you go about your day.<br /><br />Very tasty. I keep a few in my car, and in my office desk.

review/summary: Pretty Yummy
review/text: I enjoyed this nutrition bar, it tastes like a rich chocolate oatmeal raisin cookie. I found it to be very flavorful and the taste of rich cocoa really stood out for me. I think this is a good choice for a breakfast bar for those on the go. Of course I love nutrition bars and one concern I have is that people not use to nutrition bars may find this one a little dry, I also wish the bar was more moist and chewy. But I still enjoyed the flavor and ate them all. The bar is 200 calories, low in sodium 230mg has 34gm of carbohydrates and an excellent 7 grams of fiber. The bar only has 4gm of protein and I like to see them with at least 15 grams of protein. So with that said if it meets your nutritional guidelines I would recommend it.

review/summary: 25% of Your Daily Fiber in a Healthy Snack
review/text: Containing about 25% of the recommended daily intake of fiber, these bars are a fairly tasty way of obtaining it. However, don't expect an oatmeal raisin cookie type snack or a Larabar type snack either. It's dryer (meaning less fat/oil) than many snacks. It's also baked so it doesn't come across as a raw product either. The taste is pleasant and a bit more complex especially with the cocoa powder than many snacks. Finally, it's not an addictive snack which is good in that you won't be tempted to finish a box of these in three days. More health food than candy.

review/summary: Interesting Variation on a Snack...
review/text: "Eat, Think, Smile" is offering a new and interesting variation on the standard granola br, a baked nutrition bar with all natural ingredients and an added dose of cocoa flavor.  The cocoa is a natural antioxidant (who knew?), but it provides a nice finishing touch to the granola bar, like having cocoa sprinkled on top of your latte coffee.  The granola bar itself is oatmeal raisin, with a nice chewy texture.  This reviewer liked the taste.<br /><br />The oatmeal raisin bar with cocoa comes one to a foil packet, rated at 200 calories each.  The bars are available in boxes of twelve.  Recommended as something a little different in a familiar snack.

review/summary: I Like Them
review/text: I love oatmeal and raisin anything, so I was really looking forward to trying these.  I wasn't disappointed.  The taste is a little more chocolatey than I prefer, but they're still good.  If you're looking for a yummy, thick oatmeal and raisin cookie snack, this is NOT it.  The taste of the oatmeal/raisins is fairly muted.  But if you're looking for something different (as well as healthy), and if the idea of a little chocolate mixed in with your oatmeal sounds good, give these a try.

review/summary: Like the Convenience, But Not So Much the Taste
review/text: I have eaten about 100 different type of food bars over the years since I don't always have time for breakfast or to leave work for lunch so when I saw these I wanted to try them out.  The picture on the box makes them look almost like a no bake cookie with lots of big oats and texture, but when I had my first one I was a bit disappointed since it was really more like a chocolate flavored sugar cookie with almost no texture.  The actual taste is mainly just a chocolate taste and the oatmeal and raisin might just barely come through on some bites.  I don't hate them, but they are certainly not my top pick.

review/summary: Forget the Name.  Remember the Taste.
review/text: Don't the name throw you.  "Eat. Think. Smile" isn't the easiest brand to remember, but their baked nutrition bars are certainly memorable in terms of taste.  I tried two varieties through the Amazon Vine Program, Oatmeal Raisin and Orange Cranberry, and I loved them both.  The bars are soft, chewy, sweet without being sugary, and decently sized (a little bigger than a Clif Bar, perfect for a between meal snack or a before-exercise pick-me-up).  Best of all, they were satisfying without being too filling.  I was a little doubtful about how the addition of cocoa would affect the flavors, but as it turned out, the cocoa was only detectable as a pleasant undertone and didn't overpower the Oatmeal Raisin or Orange Cranberry.<br /><br />When deciding whether or not to recommend a food item I have sampled for free, I always ask myself, "Would I actually pay for this product?"  In the case of "Eat. Think. Smile" nutrition bars, my answer was a resounding "Yes.  I prefer these to some of the other bars I buy at the store."  Therefore, I am pleased to be able to recommend them to you.  Eat.  Think.  Smile.  And enjoy.

review/summary: Four and a half stars for this nutrition bar
review/text: There must be a million energy bars on the market, so what distinguishes this Eat/Think/Smile nutrition bar from its competitors? A not-too-sweet taste, for one thing.<br /><br />As they say in the ads, the idea of a granola bar or an energy bar is to put good food stuffs in a convenient and tasty bar.  This ETS (I'm already tired of typing in the full name!) bar is no different.  What I like about it is that it has a solidly-good taste that means you're not going to chow down on it, but you're going to savor it, and take a few minutes to get through it.  And that's a good thing as I'm concerned.<br /><br />I not claiming it's going to change my like, but these are handy to stuff in the day pack for a trip to the mountains or the coast, and can be relied upon to get some good ingredients into your system.<br /><br />Recommended, if for nothing more than the taste.  I'll try another box soon.  They are healthier than Girl Scout cookies, my go-to food in March.

While it's a good taste, it's just simply not that filling.  The consistency is very light.  The light and airy taste doesn't leave me very satisfied after I've eaten it -- I want more substance.

review/summary: Great bar - high price!
review/text: These bars are GREAT!  Very tasty. No high fructose corn syrup.  I bought them for my toddler-age sons, both of whom really liked similar bars from Gerber and NutriGrain.  I was really shocked and disappointed to learn that those bars had high fructose corn syrup, though. (Seriously? A bar specifically for BABIES has HFCS?!)  So I opted for these.  They LOVE them, and so do I.  But I get them for 2.79/box locally. Even the most expensive grocery store around has them for 3.29/box.  I'm all for convenience, but we go through way too many boxes of these for it to be worth paying an extra fifty cents or a dollar (or more - price seems to vary by flavor here) more per box.

review/text: I'm becoming a big fan of Kashi for my family and these cereal bars are great!  (And the apple ones, too.)  My 20 month old has severe food allergies and kashi bars are one of the only easy things she can have for breakfast (meaning, if she doesn't have a kashi bar, I'll be whipping something up from scratch... and 20 month olds tend to like breakfast sooner rather than much later).  So for our family, these are a staple.<br /><br />Also, given that we live in the country, these are not available to us locally, so being able to buy them via amazon's subscription makes it VERY helpful for our family.  (Unless amazon runs out and it takes them a month to get them in stock and delivered which kind of defeats to point of a subscription... *ahem*...  amazon, you might want to work on that.)<br /><br />Overall though, I'd recommend these!  I love how healthy they are.  I love how they have wholesome ingredients (that my daughter isn't allergic to).  And I love that they have all that and still taste good!  Thanks, Kashi!

review/text: I love most of the kashi products but I've now tried these and the cherry vanilla bars...the texture is a little off putting to me, almost like mushy graham cracker but with a less appealing taste (than graham) the fruit filling is almost bitter tasting to me (and yes these do have a lower sugar count, but I still don't want to eat bitter fruit) On a more important note, my boyfriend had one of these every day for about 5 days when he connected that they were giving him an upset stomach) now that could be an individual problem, perhaps something in them he is slightly allergic to, but he hasn't mentioned any of the other kashi products disturbing him. That being said, if you have a lot of food allergies I'd probably stay away from these, they aren't especially tasty and really they don't serve that much nutritional purpose anyhow...you'd be better served to eat some real strawberries.

At the price I got through Amazon, I'm able to do that without hurting the bank.  Wish they would come out with more fruit flavors! (On a side note because I was dairy free for a year when my son was a baby & allergic to dairy... these are dairy free!)

review/summary: Good, but seem dry
review/text: They're good breakfast/snack bars... but they're very dry compared to the blackberry flavor. I probably won't be purchasing the strawberry again.

review/summary: Great healthy cereal bars!
review/text: I love how these bars are so delicious and can be a quick breakfast or light snack. I am glad that Kashi has NO high frutose corn syrup in their products! It is hard to find healthy foods and snacks without corn syrup in it! I can't wait to try the other flavors offered.

review/summary: Great for Fiber and a quick healthy snack
review/text: I try to eat two of these per day, they are great for adding fiber to your diet and I really enjoy the taste.  I've only tried the strawberry flavor.  I subscribed to this item via Amazon prime.

review/summary: Better tasting, better for you
review/text: I love all of the Kashi bars, from the granola nut type to these more breakfast type.  The flavors are really good and I really enjoy having choices that are different from the run of the mill chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry, blueberry that are so common in all of the other bars.  The pumpkin is one of my favorite and I love how the strawberry tastes more like the real thing than what seems more like a mere flavor in the other brands.

review/summary: YUCK!!!
review/text: I love most of the Kashi products I've tried. This was low in sugar which is great right BUT when my kids tried it and refused to finish it I tried it and I now know why. It tastes horrible....it has a very weird funny taste to it.

review/summary: Perfect for a fast breakfast
review/text: Slightly more than 100 calories and packed with some fruit and whole grains, this makes for a great breakfast when you have very little time.  My son, Hubby and I like eating these quickly in the morning before rushing off to work.  They're easy to eat and yummy and make very little mess.  The only thing that would make me love them better is if they were organic.

review/summary: over price
review/text: SHAN spices are sold all over the country from 84c to 99c per pack at your local indian and Pakistani grocery stores.<br />This guy is just rip off and no justification for the over charge. Amazon should be aware of it. As Amazon is a good place to shop and I<br />do my shopping at Amazon and find prices very resonable.

review/summary: Good mix if you don't have time or ingredients for homemade
review/text: We like this mix when time is shorter or I don't have everything I need for chicken curry made from scratch.  It is a hot mix, but with Shan spice mixes you can use what you like, so if you're leery of the heat, I would suggest just using 1/4-1/2 a packet first. If you want it hotter next time, increase the amount.  I'm surprised at the price for this - we get these mixes locally for 99 cents a box.  Might want to check with the seller what quantity this price is for.

review/text: I love dark chocolate covered cranberries, and these were the worst I've ever had.  The chocolate was poor quality and tasted dry and waxy.  They are not "melt in you mouth" enjoyable as they should be.  Very disappointing.

review/summary: Non-Vegans Praise Mrs. Mays
review/text: I am sorry to hear the person before me was unsatisfied due to the food's origin, but for those of you that are looking at this as a care-free non-vegan, snacker.... MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THEM (even my most vegan one who probably didn't do proper research..or did and didn't care enough to write a review about China and confront the company)! They taste great, fit into a bag on the go, and are much healthier to snack on at work than our usual vending machine goods. So whether it comes from an organic farm in the country or a NYC sewer... they taste awesome! I feel bad for the other person who is going to miss out on the yummy goodness of this snack....

review/summary: Tastes Great but  Made in China
review/text: Heads up to all of you out there who love Mrs. Mays.  I too love their products and was a regular customer. I liked the simplicity of ingredients, the fact that most of them were "organic" and that they were Vegan. I purchased a case of various items from them directly, and imagine my surprise when I noticed the box they arrived in said "A Product of China." I emailed them and they confirmed that their product is indeed produced in China. Having traveled in China, and, based on recent problems related to products made in China, I am no longer buying Mrs. Mays. How anyrhinf grown there could be described as "organic" strikes me as disingenous at best. The energy required to ship the product back to the US also strikes me as wasteful. I no longer purchase their product. When they produce their products with locally grown, organic ingredients, I'll be back!

review/summary: can form part of a breakfast; cheaper elsewhere
review/text: These breakfast biscuits/cookies come in three flavors - oat, blueberry, and apple cinnamon.  Each wrapped container contains four biscuits/cookies that are generously sized and oval shaped.  The golden oat flavor reminded me of a graham cracker that had been paired with oats.  The flavor was pleasant with a slightly sweet component.  I think the product is best when paired with tea and a piece of fruit.<br /><br />I did not experience increased energy and when eaten alone the product did not keep me full very long.  When paired with a banana or apple and some almonds, I could see these cookies being used as part of a quick breakfast.<br /><br />The product has a good bit of fat and sugar.  As the product's nutritional profile is not presently listed, here is an abbreviated listing of one serving's nutrition:<br /><br />Serving size: 1 package (four biscuits)<br />230 calories<br />8 grams of fat<br />.5 grams of saturated fat<br />2.5 grams of polyunsaturated fat<br />5 grams of monosaturated fat<br />220 mg. of sodium<br />85 mg of potassium<br />35 grams of carbohydrates<br />3 grams of dietary fiber<br />11 grams of sugar<br />4 grams of protein<br /><br />Ingredients:  whole grain blend (rolled oats, rye flakes), enriched flour [wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate (vitamin b1), riboflavin (vitamin b2), folic acid], high oleic canola oil, sugar, evaporated cane sugar, whole grain wheat flour, malt syrup (from corn and barley), invert sugar, baking soda, salt, soy lecithin, disodium pyrophosphate, datem, ferric orthophosphate (iron), niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin b6), riboflavin (vitamin b2), thiamin mononitrate (vitamin b1).<br /><br />At present, these breakfast biscuits are definitely cheaper in grocery stores and Kraft has been issuing many dollar off coupons so check your local circular.<br /><br />Allergy info:  this product contains wheat and soy.
