review/text: Just received my Mocha Esspresso click yesterday. Love it. Although the protein is lower and the carbs are higher that I like I generally just make a 1/2 serving and add a little non-fat milk and protein powder, yummmy!

review/summary: Very good shake
review/text: I love coffee flavored drinks, and was looking for a shake to drink after an intense workout, this is great. It mixes well with my shaker bottle, no clumps..I usually add skim milk to it. I am pleased with the taste...be warned though, it is a strong coffee flavor for cappucino lovers.

review/summary: Great After a Workout
review/text: After a friend sent me some samples of Click, I fell in love.  It is great as a quick, low-cal but filling breakfast or as a recovery drink after exercising.  The caffeine gives me a nice little boost as well.  Click only takes a minute to mix up and is delicious.  The Vanilla Latte Flavor is my favorite to drink cold over ice.  The best part-Amazon's subscription delivery makes sure I never run out!

review/summary: Click-tastic!!
review/text: So, I am always on the lookout for a good quality, tasty protein as a person who had weight loss surgery 1.5 years ago.  Thanks to MeltingMama, I found Click about a year ago.  Click (in either flavor!) is a flavorful, healthy protein source that keeps me going through long shifts at work or when I just need an energy burst.  I can honestly say that I have found no other product that does this much for me and doesn't break the bank!  I am thrilled that the peeps at Click added the Vanilla Latte flavor.  As much as I liked the original Mocha flavor, I LOVE the Vanilla Latte flavor that much more.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  :)

review/summary: great taste but high carbs
review/text: Most protein drinks make me gag but the Click drinks taste great, and I think the Vanilla Latte flavor is not as cloyingly sweet as the Mocha. I still have to doctor it for flavor, as I find I have to do for all protein drinks, but that's me.<br /><br />I usually blend them with a small amount of NF milk, a big spoonful of NF yogurt, water, and a chunk - about 1/4-1/3 - of banana...fantastic taste, better than a Starbucks Frappuccino. But, darn, the high carbs :-( Carbs derail my weight loss and I can't "spend" that many carbs to get the amount of protein Click contains. If you don't care about the carb content, drink away. If you do, there is another great protein drink (no caffeine kick, which can be good or bad, though you can always make it with coffee): Great Protein at [...] low carbs, low sugars, high protein, and I can actually drink it.

review/summary: Honestly, If you like coffee and need more protein, this is it
review/text: I don't write too many reviews, but after trying Click I thought I would share a review in the hopes that it sways some people to try it. I first must admit I'm a 20-something guy who has tried a number of protein products in my day, some good, most bad to terrible. My personal favorite is muscle milk light due to its flavor and ease of mixing. After trying Click, I can't imagine a better protein drink early in the morning. The flavor is excellent (I prefer Vanilla Latte over Mocha personally) and it mixes with ease. Great in water or milk. Recently I've been blending it in the morning with Almond Milk and a few ice cubes and it's awesome. I usually don't like Vanilla Latte drinks at Starbucks because the vanilla is overpowering but not with this mix.  It's really not even accurate to call it "Vanilla Latte". I think its just an improved Mocha flavor, which is what I'd prefer. 15 grams of protein in the morning helps curb your appetite and its also low in sugar in fat which is usually a problem with protein drinks.  Biggest problem I can find is that Click is clearly being marketed towards women given the bright pink/purple canister and female stick figure on the label.  Honestly, this is a product that both health conscience men and women should be happy to use in the morning. Right now I don't know another company that is offering a product like this (Muscle Milk has a coffee flavor but it's not as good) and given how important breakfast is to a healthy diet and a weight loss plan, Click is a great addition to your pantry. The price is fair, especially since you'll get a discount through Amazon.  If your interested in losing weight, give Click a try. It's less than you'll pay for a week of bagels and coffee at Starbucks and a whole lot healthier for you.

review/summary: Tastes Great and is helping me lose lots of weight!
review/text: Love the taste, first off!  I have only tried the vanilla flavor and it has been wonderful.  The idea behind me taking this protein drink is actually two-fold.  The first is to not eliminate but lower my coffee drinking addiciton (i.e. starbucks use ot be a morning ritual!) and also because it has some calories but not too many, I've been using it as a meal replacement for breakfast time.  I'm trying to lose weight, and this is helping me get closer to my goal weight.<br /><br />Since each serving is only 100 calories, you should be prepared for that you will feel hungry about an hour after you drink it.  I started taking Yohimbine Powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XOUOA4">5 Grams Yohimbine HCL 99% Bulk Powder</a> shortly after starting to drink these shakes, and if you are trying to cut back on calories, I highly recommend some kind of natural appetite suppressant, you have no idea the difference it makes, basically a life-saver for me as I'm what you would call a snacker of snacks!<br /><br />I know some other reviewers have said that stiring the mix works for them but I'm sorry if you really want to enjoy this shake, you need a blender, plain and simple.  I could sit there in my kitchen and stir for an hour and it still won't taste nearly as good compared to blending it for thirty seconds.

review/summary: Subtly Sweet Vanilla with a KICK.
review/text: Vanilla is close to the top of the list of my favorite flavors -- my fave protein supplements have been mostly vanilla based.  Add espresso to that, this HAS to be a winner.  I got my hands on an advance sample of CLICK Vanilla Latte.  And, completely ignoring the fact that my espresso machine is dead, this was the perfect day to try it out.<br /><br />As with any CLICK protein flavor - the suggested method of serving is to add the protein powder to 12-14 ounces of water, and mix well either cold, or warm it up.  I added 14 ounces of steaming water from my hot tap on the water dispenser.<br /><br />It was lighter in color than the Mocha Flavored CLICK, more like a cappuccino.  It even frothed, but that could have been from the psycho blending I do to it.  It definitely tastes like a vanilla latte, perhaps not the way I order it (Hi there extra shots!) but very taste-friendly to the espresso virgin.<br /><br /> The verdict.  HELL YES.  Thank you CLICK, I loves it.<br /><br />Product - CLICK Espresso Protein Powder Vanilla Latte Flavor<br />Price - Amazon varies.<br />Via - Amazon<br />Pros - 15 grams of ass kicking protein that you could never guess was a protein drink.<br />Cons - Not as strong as it's big sister.<br />Rating - Pouchworthy, MM.

review/text: Very nice tasting protein powder. Tastes like a nice iced coffee. Doesn't dissolve completely, though. I mixed mine well, and it was still a little clumpy. Not enough to ruin the drink, but enough to get a couple surprises of powder.<br /><br />One thing I don't like is the amount of carbs. 12 grams is a lot when you're only getting 15 grams of protein. I do like that's it's low in calories, though. One of the lowest I've seen, and for a decent sized shake.

review/text: I've just finished my first container of CLICK (mocha). I make mine in the blender every morning.  Blending ensures creamy texture and no undissolved globs.  I make mine with half water and half skim-milk.  It has replaced morning coffee for me.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty, easy, and fast way to get some protein and caffeine at the same time.  Please try from a blender if you've had bad luck with getting drinks like this to have the right texture.  I'm awaiting my second container from Amazon.<br />As a side note: I have mixed it in part with Slim-Fast powder as a way to increase the vitamins and nutritional value when I felt I needed more calories. Keep an eye on the carbs, though.<br />This is a great product I plan to continue using.

(You know I don't just throw that out there, I am a tough cookie.)<br /><br />For the sake of a simple review, I tasted it AS THE PACKAGE DIRECTED and it was just perfect.<br /><br />I prepared it cold, and look, I sucked this down, and then I cleaned the bathroom in a single bound, I did!<br /><br />As a hot drink, it's also delightful - you literally just mix it as you would any hot powdered drink like a cocoa.  I highly suggest a whisk, and do it well, and you get the best results.  This mix really has a smooth mocha flavor.<br /><br />I've been drinking it hot in my morning cappuccino - I whisk one or two scoop into some hot water to mix, then a shot of espresso and then top it off with steamed unsweetened soy milk, and it makes an AMAZING morning cup.<br /><br />I've already thrown it into protein shake concoctions in the blender, and it's OMG!? DELICIOUS with blended ice and additional flavors.  (THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS HERE PEOPLE!)<br /><br />The nutrition:<br /><br />  * 2 scoops contain:<br />  * 120 calories<br />  * 1.5 grams of fat<br />  * 115 mg sodium<br />  * 290 mg potassium<br />  * 12 carbohydrate<br />  * 1 fiber<br />  * 7 sugar (fructose)<br />  * 15 protein<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with Click Protein.  There is NO telltale protein-y taste, you that icky tongue-feel and after taste you might get with other protein products?  I don't know how it's possible, but it's true - you cannot tell that this is a protein drink by any stretch.<br /><br />Add that to the fact that it contains my two main food groups, espresso and chocolate?  It's a clear winner, and my new thing.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Wow. WOW! So Good!
review/text: This is, so far, my very favorite protein shake.<br /><br />If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!<br /><br />Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!<br /><br />As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, "Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink."  I fully recommend this to anyone!!<br /><br />Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: I live off this stuff!!!
review/text: I've tried many protein powders, shots, and suppliments over the last 4 years.  I finally decided that a coffee flavor was the only one I could enjoy.  I used Whey Gourmet Artic Cappuccino Frappe but had to add ice, vanilla almond milk, extra instant coffee, and even a splash of creamer to get the desired "fresh from starbucks" flavor.  That's a lot of additional cost and calories.  I decided to give Click a try and purchased both the Mocha and the Vanilla Latte.  I'm hooked on the Vanilla Latte.  The Mocha was too sweet and heavy feeling for me, but my husband loved it.<br /><br />I use a Magic Bullet...load the cup with ice and WATER (yes, just water) to 1 inch from top, add my two scoops of Click, and blend.  If it's a special day, a dash of caramel sugar free syrup or spritz of whipped cream.  Seriously, everyone thinks I've got Starbucks.  It keeps me full until lunch!  If I'm feeling especially snackish in the evening, I'll have another to feel full until bedtime.  Seriously, sweet and satisfying for this few calories????  It can't be beat!!!

review/summary: Really Yummy...taste like the "mocha java lite frappucino"  that I get at Starbucks
review/text: This was surprisingly nummsy. I followed the directions (first for the larger quantity of water) and was less than thrilled. Then I did it with the lower recommended amount of water and it was great. Try the lower amount first. And ice. Shake well.<br /><br />I shook it in a blender ball bottle for the 60 seconds...and I had no powder blobs or residue. It was really delicious. Nice smell. Very chocolatey. The espresso portion is very coffee-ey, but it does have that "instant coffee" sort of taste.<br /><br />If you like mocha javas, this is a really good protein shake to try. It's got some nice nutritionals. I'm not happy about the fructose (I'll admit it, I'd rather have sucralose and not deal with fructose or sucrose), but I'm happy to add this to my protein shake snack arsenal that keeps my hunger at bay between meals and that I can use pre and post workouts.<br /><br />Really  yum!

I just placed an order for both the Vanilla Latte and Mocha flavors, as CLICK has become a part of my daily routine. I drink CLICK as a recovery drink after my training runs, as well as on my rest days for a pick-me-up in the morning. CLICK has a great taste, not the chalky taste you get from most protein drinks.

review/summary: The only protein drink II make sure I don't run out of!
review/text: I LOVE my CLICK in the morning... I buy both and I have both on subscription orders through Amazon --I can't run out!  My day just doesn't start out right unless I "click" first!  I have been drinking the Mocha flavor for the past year and couldn't wait for the vanilla to be released, I just knew I was going to love it.  I was right, it's yummy! I love it more than the mocha flavor, it seems smoother and it doesn't have as strong of coffee taste to it either.  I love the smell of the vanilla when you open the canister, but thankfully it does NOT have an overpowering sweet vanilla taste to it.  I actually prefer my Click Vanilla Latte to the "[...]" v. latte--it's great.  I am so thankful for both Click products, it helps me get my daily protein requirements each day, it has helped me reach my weight loss goals, and it gives me a little kick of energy in the afternoons when I need it and I don't know what I would do without it to start my mornings.  Do yourself a favor and Click!<br /><br />p.s. I wish Amazon sold the "CLICK" shaker cup --it's my favorite shaker cup too but I don't want to pay the S & H to get another one -that makes it too expensive!  Although if I lost mine I would probably break down and buy it anyway...

I do appreciate the scoop on this one much more than the mocha as it actually measures about half the serving size with one scoop.<br /><br />My only complaint is the amount of carbs. Not sure if that's something that can be helped. I do drink this and the mocha every single day :)

review/text: I drink a shake every morning! I look forward to it EVERY DAY - no joke - I've always preferred iced coffee so I have mine cold (it's making my mouth water now!)<br /><br />Click protein is a PERFECT way for BARIATRIC patients to supplement their daily protein. I especially love Click because I was a DIE HARD STARBUKS customer - knew my regular crew, could pull up to the drive through and when they heard my voice they knew what to make!<br /><br />I make my shakes with milk or water -whatever I'm in the mood for (the milk helps boost the protein) and I use a Blender Ball bottle (this powder is super fine so you don't necessarily have to have a blender bottle, it just makes it easier).<br /><br />Not only has my energy level improved, my hair and skin are FABULOUS and I can enjoy breakfast every morning knowing there's nothing that's going to upset my stomach. I've SAVED MONEY TOO - I've said good bye to Starbucks. The espresso boost in Click satisfies my coffee fix and I never tire of it.<br /><br />It is HANDS DOWN THE BEST PROTEIN DRINK I HAVE EVER HAD (and honey...I have tried them all!)

review/text: I don't usually like protein drinks, but this is a great idea - the coffee flavor gets rid of any flavor from the protein. It's only 2 Weight Watcher's points.  I put it in a plastic cup and use the hand blender to whip it up, then add ice, and it's a nice, happy pick me up in the morning. I am not good about sitting down for breakfast; at least this way I get a good dose of protein and caffeine first thing in the morning!

review/summary: Makes awesome Frappucinos!
review/text: I don't like straight coffee, but I love to use this Click to make high-protein frappucinos.  I use 1 1/2 scoops of Click and a full scoop of a GNC brand of plain chocolate protein powder.  I have frappucinos 2-3 times a week in the morning.  The caffeine really boosts my energy. I can tell the difference in energy/hyperness between the days I have Click and don't have it. I was hesitant to buy this at first because I don't like coffee, but it's just perfect the way I make it!  I've had Gastric Bypass surgery which is one reason I need to get in my protein. This is an easy and tasty way to do it.  I'm going to sign up for Amazon's automatic shipment soon so I can get it cheaper and keep it coming. Don't want to be without it.

review/summary: Best protein drink ever!
review/text: I have tried many (and I do mean many) protein drinks and I must say that CLICK is far above any of the others. What's not to like? Mixes quickly and easily (a common flaw with other powdered protein drinks). Low calories (120). Zero saturated fat. Negligible sodium (105mg). Low carbs (12g). Decent protein (15g). All of this with a 31g/2 scoop serving.  And, most importantly, superb taste PLUS a caffeine kick for workout momentum. You just cannot lose with CLICK, whether it's the Mocha or newest Vanilla Latte flavor. I must sound like a sales rep for this product, but in reality, I am just a regular guy at the gym who enjoys lifting weights and fat-burn cardio. I simply do not have enough superlatives to describe how much I like and enjoy this one-drink-does-it-all product. As far as I'm concerned, it is not only the best of the best, but the only protein drink I need or will ever want!

review/summary: And I don't even like Vanilla . . .
review/text: I don't like vanilla as a stand alone flavor. Usually, it is just a pale imitation of the rich smoothness of a real vanilla bean.  I have been loving on the Mocha Espresso flavor CLICK for at least a year now and was excited at the thought of another flavor.  I didn't think Vanilla Latte could measure up to the Mocha and boy, was I wrong.  The vanilla is a sweet smooth flavor with a hint of caramel in the background. It is not the cloying fake vanilla and sweetness overload I have experienced with other vanilla flavored proteins.  It dissolves perfectly, has caffeine, and doesn't have that offensive sour protein shake smell, either.  Mocha Espresso and Vanilla Latte are a winning twosome and I look forward to enjoying them both for a very long time.

review/summary: My &lt;3 goes Clicky Click with Vanilla
review/text: I be so clickin'!! Just moments ago, a knock at my door, my heart skips a beat - my order of the New Vanilla Click JUST ARRIVED.  I prefer to make it with a cup of milk, 1 scoop of click (half serving) shake and drink.<br /><br /> Oh so good - but lets doctor it some more to see what taste sensation I can create.  So I added  1 click scoop, 1 cup milk, (some plain vanilla whey protein to increase my protein intake and keep sugars stabilized longer)  then a 1/2 cup of my decaf espresso cold brewed coffee I keep handy in the fridge, a couple of ice cubes, shake some more. OH - it was heavenly.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the mocha - however typically I'm more of a coffee flavor girl, and pure vanilla go together better on my palette.  I love chocolate, love coffee - together not so much my thing. The Mocha Click though works well together, and I have enjoyed it but wished for a more coffee flavor Click.<br /><br />The vanilla click is just that  - it's a richer coffee flavor, stronger but in a good way. For me I find the vanilla click is just smoother - in taste.<br /><br />Now my heart goes clicky Click every single morning.

review/text: I've been using Click off and on since I had RNY surgery on March 4 2009. Think I had my first shake sometime in April. I started out with 1 scoop because I really noticed the coffee buzz. Now I have the shake about 3-4 times a week usually in the morning. Mixed with water, ice, and a little sugar free syrup is my favorite way to have it. I was glad to get set up on autoship because of the price break. My husband loves this shake too and makes a double batch for us so we can start the morning off with a lot of energy. I've not yet tried the vanilla but am looking forward to that. If you like coffee, chocolate, and need protein - click is a good choice. I love how this stuff tastes!

review/summary: Delicious, healthy hot or cold  protein espresso drink
review/text: Very pleased with Click beverage. I make the peppermint mocha version<br />with a touch of whipped cream. You can do cold or hot drinks.<br />The result is rich, delicious and filling.<br /><br />Be sure to follow directions on mixing. This is not something you scoop into a mug<br />and add warm milk to and stir. It will clump and taste terrible. It has to be<br />shaken first in a sealed container.

review/summary: Freakin' awesome.
review/text: This is seriously the best tasting protein drink I have had, hands down (and I have tried a LOT of them).  I can't recommend it enough.  It's got a very nice strong coffee flavor (if it's too strong for you, just add more water or milk) and gives a nice little caffeine punch - great alternative to the vending machine for the afternoon blahs.  The Blender Bottle makes it perfectly.  Having tried a single serve sample, I am now buying two canisters...one to keep at home, and one to keep in my desk at work.

review/text: The words 'protein drink' don't generally conjure up images of something that is both delicious and good for you, but this product is great! It doesn't have the smell of other powders, you know the smell...yuck. But this makes a wonderful drink, and it doesn't taste like any of the other dozens and dozens of sub-par powders. JUST TRY IT! If you love coffee, you'll love CLICK!

review/summary: THE BEST PROTEIN DRINK EVER!!!
review/text: as a post-bariatric surgery patient-protein is key to my success.  i have tried several different drinks w/ a variety of content & taste and Click is by far the best i have experienced.  i admit i am addicted, i keep it on hand both the canisters and the individual packs for traveling.  i refuse to be without it.  i order 2 canisters at a time and when i get down to one-i order 2 more-that way i never run out.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: I had Gastric Bypass surgery a year ago and have lost a substantial amount of weight.  I am constantly searching for yummy, protein rich foods that will satisfy my new stomach.  CLICK is the best morning additive for my diet.  It is not only rich in protein and low in calories, but it is also very delicious.  I compare it to a Starbucks mocha latte.  I even added a little cinnamon and made it a cinnamon mocha latte.  I've been drinking this in the mornings instead of breakfast.  I highly recommend this beverage to other GB patients and others that like an added boost in the morning.

review/text: I'm addicted too. I mix one scoop of Click, one scoop of chocolate protein powder, about 1 1/2 cups of milk and fill the blender the rest of the way with crushed ice. The consistency is thick and icy.  The click dramatically improves the chocolate powder alone, and the chocolate protein powder brings up the amount of protein. I can't go back to any other protein combination. This is by far my favorite.

review/text: I was so happy someone in my gastric bypass support group told us about Click. I missed my morning coffee simply because I felt I needed to be nourishing my body with something like water or a protein drink. Thank goodness I have found an alternative to coffee--great flavor with added protein. Taste better than a Cafe Mocha from the "other" place. Yummy! I always order two at a time so I can keep one at work and one at home.

review/summary: non refundable-waste of money and scam
review/text: I was happy to find a high protein chocolate beverage that I could take to work every morning instead of coffee.  I ordered 2 cans.  It arrived on time.  I followed direction to prepare a cup of chocolate.  The powder was very hard to dissolve.  After I worked on it using an electric mixer (since manual mixing failed, I thought to myself that is great, I can do that, no problem.  Time to taste the drink.  It tasted horrible.  The sweetness is artificial and chemical.  So I turned to the label to read ingredients.  Far from being all natural.  I dumped the drink in the sink and I was amazed that all the protein was at the bottom of the cup.  I went on line to return the product.  I was shocked to find out it was not returnable.  So I decided to write this review to help others not fall in the same trap.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

review/text: Bought vanilla and chocolate for myself and daughter since so many good reviews.  It was so bad we could not get it down.  Tried adding milk etc, hot or cold. Could not do it.  Took it to work, no one there would drink it either.  We made some in a french press coffee pot trying to get rid of chunks that do not mix in even with blender.  Left it  over the weekend and Monday when we went to clean it the product had seperated. Into three different colored layers, all solid with texture of styrofoam and the smell was beyond words. Scary to think of it turning to a solid form and forming bowel obstruction. Would rate it lower than one star if I could.

review/text: I really wanted to like this one-stop-shop for my morning run out the door. However, the taste is getting in the way. I prefer making a similar mixture with a packet of Instant Breakfast mix (no sugar), a half packet of Via (your choice of brew) and a half scoop of premium Chocolate or Vanilla Whey protein powder. You end up with something better tasting, higher in protein and lighter on the e-wallet.

review/text: I tried the click espresso mocha flavor after reading all the rave review on the gastric bypass boards. I thought it would be great, I LOVE my mochas!! First I made it hot with just water (followed the directions to a 't' and measured everything out), horrible... terrible smell and taste, couldn't even drink it, I have to dump it down the sink. I thought, well... maybe I am just not preparing it right so I made a cold one.. yucky too. Blended with milk... a little better but still had a fake coffee flavor with tons of artificial sweetner and the funky protein taste. I've tried really hard to make it taste good to me but It's horrible in my opinion. I really really wanted it to be good... mocha and protein, it would have been so nice.

review/summary: Nasty!!!!
review/text: This is the nastiest protein shake I have ever tasted and I have tried plenty! I could not even swallow it because it was so nasty. It does not mix smoothly using a blender bottle or a blender. It might make a decent java shake if you mixed it into ice cream but that kind of defeats the point of having a protein shake!

review/summary: Gritty, not so good tasting.
review/text: I tried this both hot & cold.  The only way it was even close to being drinkable was to put alot of ice in it.  Not matter how I tried it, I could never get it to be smooth, always gritty or chunky.

review/summary: Make sure you like the taste of Sucralose!
review/text: While Fructose is the main sweetener used,they also decided to throw Sucralose in the mix.Big mistake!.Why they would want to use an artificial sweetener with potential safety concerns beats me.This product would have tasted great with just more Fructose(or plain Sugar) than that horrible metallic tasing Sucralose.Just make sure you like Sucralose before you buy this.Next time I'll make sure I read the ingredient label more closely......

review/summary: Ugh.
review/text: Urg.  This stuff was just nasty.  I made it with water.  Then I put the jar in the kitchen at my office hoping somebody would take it.  Maybe it would have been a little better with milk, but it still would have been a mess of undissolved clumps of bad-tasting stuff.  I have the Blender Bottle (the one with the little whisk-ball), and I shook it for a long time, and then I shook it some more, but it never dissolved.  Nevertheless, dissolved or not, I didn't like the taste.  Love Andrew Lessman's "Secure" protein drink, but that isn't available on Amazon.

review/summary: Complete CRAP nutritionally!! Buyer beware
review/text: Ok, for starters I have personally spoken to the guy that owns this company and had asked him about some nutrition information about his product. Needless to say I was treated like a 2nd class citizen and was told not to call him and bother him any more! WHAT?!?!?!?! I did further research and many of the ingredients in this product are NO BETTER than a FRAPACHINO from STARBUCKS! I train for fitness/figure competitions and can tell you first had this product is full of crap ingredients. Save your money and the deciet and go to Starbucks, at least you know what you are getting there and WITH A SMILE! :-)

review/summary: The BEST, By Far!
review/text: Nothing--and I mean nothing--compares to Click. The creater of this product is a genius-espresso AND protein? And chocolate? Wow.<br /><br />Don't buy this expecting it to taste like a SBux iced mocha, cuz it really doesn't compare. However, for what it is (a bona fide protein shake) Click is a darn close second.<br /><br />I haven't tried it hot yet (you kidding me? It's 110 in the shade where I live!), but I mix it with cold water when I'm looking for "iced coffee" and skim milk/couple of ice cubes when I want a meal replacement (around 30 grams of protein/280 calories when made with 14oz of skim milk). It is tasty either way. Click mixes very well in those blender bottles (with the little metal whisk ball). I've never had issues with clumpy shakes.<br /><br />I am waiting on delivery of the new Vanilla Latte flavor, but I bet it's just as good.

review/summary: Delish!!
review/text: I HATE powder protein mixes and I LOVE coffee. Well, let me tell you I was in HEAVEN when I discovered this amazing product!! I have never tasted anything so delicious let alone it being a protein drink. I had gastric bypass in July of 09 and wish I found this mix so much sooner. I can not get enough of it. I look forward to it every morning. I like it both hot and cold! It give me that "ahhhhh good morning" feeling that I used to get from my first cup of coffee every morning. I recently signed up for the auto ship because I never want to run out of this heavenly nectar! If you have been on the fence about this product don't wait any longer!

review/summary: Just as good as hot chocolate
review/text: I usually put a tablespoon of powdered hot chocolate in my morning coffee.  A friend gave me a sample of this and now I use it instead.  You do have to occasionally stir the coffee a little more to keep it from settling on the bottom of the cup but, it is better for me then old Swiss Miss.

review/summary: Bye-Bye, my local coffee shop...
review/text: My sister turned me on to this protein drink two weekends ago. I am an excessive coffee-drinker. It's my vice. I love espresso drinks and coffee. And spend far too much $ at my local coffee shop I have frequented for 10 years. Usually the first thing in the a.m. on my list is to brew a pot of coffee and mix a soy protein shake from GNC. But not here lately. Now first thing I do after my feet hit the floor is to pour 10 oz of milk into the handy shaker and mix 2 scoops of Click, shake it up and voila. It's delicious! (Did I mention I no longer brew coffee in the a.m.?)<br />Another important factor for me is that I don't eat meat. I am a Pescetarian. So, as a rule, I don't get enough protein in my diet. That's probably one of the reasons I drink so much coffee, is because my energy wanes during the day. I used to get a stomach ache daily that I just sort of got used to - was it too much coffee on an empty stomach or the soy in the protein shake from GNC?? Who knows.<br />What I do know is that today, for example, I drank two Click shakes back to back with my supplements I take every a.m. (Omega 3, multi, Acai, B complex...) and I feel great. No stomach ache, no jitters, energetic and content.<br />I would highly recommend this product. I've just ordered two more canisters! Enjoy!

review/summary: Not just for protein drinkers...
review/text: This makes a excellent cup of iced coffee or frappuccino... (the hot coffee is ok too). Milk is already an ingredient, so just add water if you're watching carbs.  Also try one scoop Click and one scoop of your regular vanilla protein mix in the drink or frappuccino if you want a lighter taste and less carbs.<br /><br />I've used it in the morning when I don't have time to brew coffee (or eat) and have to run out the door. It's actually a good post- exercise recovery with the carbs and protein if you want to switch your mixes up.  Plus to me it's kind of like a guiltless pleasure for those days you just don't feel like downing a protein drink.<br /><br />At my house a McDonald's Frappe/Starbucks Frappuccino drinker and the kids both love it!
