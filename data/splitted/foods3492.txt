review/summary: Lichee Black Tea
review/text: I've been a bit fan of lychee/lichee fruit ever since I tried some a couple years ago at a buffet. It's very hard and expensive to find the real fruit anywhere. I'm also a big tea drinker, so I was excited to find this. I expected the high price tag, but I knocked it down to four stars because the box came pretty banged up so I was disappointed. For expensive tea I was hoping the box would be in better shape. Other than that, it tastes very good and while the flavor of lychee could be stronger, it's still delicious and I'd recommend it. I just have to try not to drink it all too fast!

review/text: I love this for making sweet tea. It is great as a hot tea too! No extra sweetner needed either - it doesn't have any bitter taste to it. My father introduced me to it, but when he moved he couldn't find a store that carried it, so I ordered it for him from Amazon! He was so greatful, he loves this tea!

review/summary: Barry's is a true Irish tea blend - don't expect anything else
review/text: Needless to say, not all black teas are the same.  Barry's is a very strong Irish blend, and is meant to be drank with lots of milk and sugar.  The previous reviewer, who calls him/herself a 'tea snob,' seems to have hoped Barry's would be like all the other "black teas" he/she likes, and has rated Barry's so low because it tastes different. If you like a very strong Irish Breakfast-style tea, strong and with lots of tanin, then you'll like Barry's. If not, stay away.  And I disagree - it is very consistent in flavor from bag to bag.  Maybe you are not preparing it consistently?<br /><br />I am not even saying Barry's is my favorite Irish blend - Lyon's is also very good - but it's unfair to rate it so low because you were uninformed about how it is _supposed_ to taste.  In the future, I suggest you stick with Red Rose, if that's what you know you like.

review/summary: great full bodied tea!
review/text: Not too strong and definitely not too weak. This is a great full bodied black tea. Nobody blends tea like the Irish and English and this barry's Tea is no exception. As Americans we access to American versions of "Irish Breakfast tea" or "English Breakfast Tea" but they all pale in comparrison to the real thing off the boat. So if you love real tea and know the different betwwen the American made "teas" and the best in the world then Barry's is the way to go. This Classic Blend and their other offering the Gold Blend are both amazing.

review/summary: A big disappointment
review/text: Admittedly, I am a tea snob. However, one thing I have learned is that price and quality don't always go hand in hand.  (My favorite earl grey costs $1.97 a box at Target;  I pay $25 for a small tin of my favorite fruit flavored tea at Dean and Deluca's.)  I was very excited to try Barry's Tea after I heard about it from a friend who heard about this tea while traveling in Ireland.  I was even more excited to find that it was fairly inexpensive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for my taste, Barry's is a huge disappointment.  No matter how little or how long I brew it, the flavor never tastes "just right."  I find it's either too weak or too strong and needs a good amount of sweetener and milk to make it somewhat enjoyable.  I also discovered after several tests that one teabag will taste differently than another.  (Something I have NEVER found in any other brand of tea I've brewed.)<br /><br />If you are looking for an excellent plain black tea, I would suggest Yorkshire Gold (found at World Market and some speciality tea shops that sell products from England) or Tazo's "Awake."  In fact, I even like good old Red Rose if I'm in a pinch.

review/summary: Safety instructions
review/text: All NovoAndina Products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />NovoAndina products do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All our Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store NovoAndina products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Our teas are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

Got no answer so I went out on a limp an got the PRIVATE RESERVE novoandina.. There were no instructions on how to use the tea.. I just guessed.. it didnt make my mouth numbed an it took several bags to get a good tea look an taste..I could tell that my heart picked up a faster pace about 20 to 30 minutes after I drank a large glass.. I also added sugar to it to make it easier to drink..The tea taste like grass an even smelled like grass .. Over experence is just ok for me..Next time im going a different route..

review/text: As ridiculous as this may be, coca leaf tea is illegal in the United States. If you don't believe me, just call up the local drug enforcement people. It is actually illegal in most countries in the world. The Bolivian government is trying to get the help of the United Nations to change these idiotic laws. From all I have read coca leaf tea is completely safe, non addictive, and quite tasty, though I will have to go to Bolivia to see for myself because it is a felony in my State (and the other 49) and I have no desire to ever set foot in a prison. This is just as idiotic as hemp being illegal to grow in the U.S. even though it was a major crop for most of the country's history. It is the idiotic laws that weaken the other laws of a nation.

review/text: I went browsing thru Publix's Greenwise organic section for a whole grain cereal that wasn't too heavy in both flavor and bulk.<br /><br />I bought their corn free recipe in the tall 10.4 oz size.  This is an excellent cereal.  This is not your kids cheeros!<br /><br />This is a favorful, light, crunching, and fresh whole grain cereal.  It is made of oats and barley with a touch of honey, and a hit of almond flavor.<br /><br />I give this cereal a 5/5 for flavor, 5/5 for freshness, 5/5 for Earth conscious packaging (100% recycled paperboard), and 5/5 for maintaining organic integrity.  They also particpate in the Box Top for Education program.<br /><br />A serving size is 1 cup with 110 cal, 1 g fat, 170 mg sodium, 75 mg potassium, 25 g carbs, 7 g sugar,  15 g other carbs, and 2 g protein.<br /><br />Although the cereal is low in sugar (7 g) and contains 3 g of fiber, diabetics should take note of the nutrition label before consuming.  Namely, 25 g carbs and 15 other carbs which equals 40 g carbs per 1 cup serving.<br /><br />The cereal does not have adequate daily allowances and vitamins but I don't buy it for that, I mainly buy it for its organic qualities, delightful flavor, and whole grain texture.<br /><br />I didn't give them a perfect score because the packaging size does not match up with their other packages in that this box is taller than their other cereals but it only holds 10 oz, whereas their raisin bran packing is smaller but holds 14 oz.  This gives the impression that you are actually getting more for your money, but you are actually getting less.

review/summary: Lovely Lemon Ginger Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

Since purchasing this product, I learned that I am gluten intolerant, and the taco sauce contains "modified food starch" which is a nonspecific ingredient that can be derived from innumerable sources, and may contain gluten.  As a result, I cannot eat this product anymore.  I would advise the manufacturer to be more specific in their labeling as to the starch origin, and better yet, to standardize on a starch (corn, rice, potato, etc.) that does not contain gluten.

review/summary: Love this Apricot Almond bar
review/text: KIND makes some great tasting fruit and nut bars. This flavor is my favorite because the apricot mixed with the coconut flavor is hard to beat. That's what I taste when I eat this, apricot, coconut, and some almond. It's not a dry bar, it's got some chewy gooey to it, which I also enjoy. Overall probably my fav fruit and nut bar.

review/summary: KIND
review/text: Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot. The coconut and almond bars were chewy and crunchy with just a hint of sweetness and they were filling. One bar and I was ready to go for the morning! Mr. MVP had one KIND bar and a yogurt and a piece of fruit and he was on his way. Our supermarket had them for $1.50 per bar so $1.20 per bar is a decent price!

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I was given one of these bars by a friend and began ordering them by the box the next day!  I have an extremely sensitive stomach, and they are a great source of energy for me.  Eating one at the first pangs of hunger buys me a hour before I need a real meal, which is a life saver.  I have taken them on road trips and camping, and they are great there as well.  I love the fact they aren't covered in chocolate, as I'm not a fan of using candy for food.  The fact that they are gluten free means I can bring a box for celiac friends without concern, also a big plus.  I only wish I could buy them locally, but the Amazon subscription is almost as good.

review/summary: sooo good and no guilt -- what could be better?
review/text: I love these bars and even eat them once in a while as a substitute breakfast with yogurt.  They are so good, and not fattening and make a great on-the-go snack in the car or on the plane.  I have tried many other bars, but none even come close.  Every time I give one to a friend, they are hooked.  My 3-year old grandson loves them too, and I feel good that he asks for them as they have no artificial anything and aren't that high in carbs.  The deal on Amazon is the best with automatic shipping.  In most places they cost $2.00 or more each.  In bulk on Amazon they are $1.50 with no shipping charge.  This one is my favorite flavor, but I like most of the others almost as much.  So, happiness in a bar. . .

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: So, there must be some mommies out there like me who buy these bars for kids but won't eat them yourselves? You pop them in the lunch box together with the fruit in the bid to get them to stay off the junk food in school? Most of the time, these bars turn out to be a complete waste cos the kids will tell you that they are the worst thing ever. And you are wracked with guilt thinking you've scarred them for life. But then, you do it again anyway. And so, one day, I tried 1 of these bars and when I asked how it was - the answer surprised me. "They're delicious, Mom. Really yummy" I was stunned. A nut bar that passes the test. I'm so glad there's Amazon. I bought 2 packs - one fruit and nut and another variety pack. She loves all that she's tried so far.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I took a couple to the office. One day, in hunger, I finally opened one. And Oh. I. see. They're good. Really good. They're crunchy without being hard, a little sticky without being too sweet, a good mix of textures without them sticking to the space between your teeth. And at the end of the bar, you feel something in your tummy. Not full exactly but at least it does the job to stave off the hunger pangs.<br /><br />I'm now looking at other flavours to buy because this is going to be the Snack Of Choice 2012 for this household at least!

review/summary: First found this product at a food store in Lake Tahoe!  Thought they were great!
review/text: Fruit Nuts....what more can one ask for!  An excellent product. The product does not have all the additives that some bars do. I would recommend trying it.  And to get your best deal money wise, at least in my state, it is better to buy it in the 12 pack.  So far I have found Amazon has the best price for this product.

review/summary: Taste Great, but very stale.
review/text: I have enjoyed these KIND bars before.  I ordered this variety along with the Cherry dark chocolate Cashew.  The Cherry bars were very fresh, however, the Peanut Dark chocolate were extremely stale/hard.  I haven't had time to send them back and probably won't bother.  From now on, I will just buy them at my local Wegmans.  This was very dissapointing.

review/summary: Nut about Kind Fruit and Nut Delight
review/text: I received a box of Kind Fruit and Nut delight for Christmas.  I tried it for the first time and it was so good, such a delightful and fulfilling taste that is both good and good for me.  I like the fact that it is all natural, no funny taste and no yacky after taste.  You can actually taste the fruits in each bar. I have a sweet tooth and Kind bar satisfies my craving.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat sensibly and indulgent at the same time.

review/summary: Really tasty- a good substitute for higher calorie treats
review/text: I got these because I love pecan pie, but I'm a diabetic, so need to watch the carb counts on EVERYTHING.  These work.  They're not low carb- but they're not bad- 180 calories and 23 grams of carbs. The flavor is really good-and takes the edge off of the pecan pie cravings :)  Good buy, and arrived very quickly.

review/summary: KINDness never tasted so good
review/text: my husband and i are fans of the kind bars as a quick snack or the like. we know they can be a little more than other bars and maybe not as uber healthy as some would prefer BUT... these bars are wonderful! they are nutritious and delicious and filling. they don't taste like anything else out there either and i mean that in the best way. when i want a sweet treat i am more than satisfied with the apple cinnamon pecan (my new fave) or the dark chocolate sesame. better than reaching for an average, preservative & sugar loaded candy bar. way more satisfying in every way. i just ordered 2 more boxes of 2 different flavors. we can't wait to try them!

review/text: Finally, a nutritious snack that actually tastes good! I normally don't like apricots but this bar is not overpowered by the fruit.  It's the right combination of almond and apricot flavors so that it's not overly sweet or nutty.  I do wish it were a bit bigger in portion.  It doesn't feel like a meal replacement but definitely a good snack. Even if you're not a big apricot fan, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  The monthly delivery service also provides a nice little discount!

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I am allergic to wheat and hypoglycemic, so finding a wheat free, low glycemic snack bar sounded too good to be true.  Happily, it wasn't!  Every Kind bar I have tried has been delicious, and it makes a good "on the go" snack to keep in my purse.  It's also great to pack when I travel, since it is really hard to avoid wheat when I am eating out, and due to the hypoglycemia I have to eat meals on a regular schedule. I love the fact that Kind bars are made from real ingredients - the list of ingredient is short and I can pronounce everything on the label because it's the type of stuff I have in my pantry.  I ordered one box to try them out, then a few more to keep on hand, and now I have just subscribed for monthly delivery.  I highly recommend these bars!!

review/text: While visiting with my sister I was given the opportunity to try a Kind Bar.  I hesitated because let's admit, anything that comes in bar form and is good for you has GOT to taste terrible!  Well, now I know differently.  These are delicious!  My brother-in-law is diabetic and can eat these bars.  I find eating one between meals curbs my appetite.  They are crunchy, fruity and just plain delicious.  Haven't been able to find these in our area stores so I order Kind bars through Amazon and I'm pleased with how quickly and safely they arrive.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to find an enjoyable way to have a snack between meals and that's good for them, too.

review/text: These are really tasty, that's a fact.  Because they're made of fruit, nuts, and puffed rice, they're also reasonably healthy, making them a reliable snack.  I only wish these babies had a bit less sugar, therein allowing me to eat them more often than I currently allow myself to.  Of course, I'm sure that would mess up the flavor and make them an entirely different bar, so that's not really a possibility.)<br /><br />Overall, an excellent portable snack, with plenty of healthy fats and deliciousness.

review/summary: Satisfying & Delicious
review/text: These bars had a generous amount of nuts and the right balance of fruit without the overly sweet filling I dislike in other brands.  The result is a bar with enough protein to satisfy and just enough sweetness to give a little pep--a great bar for the grab-and-go breakfast with my coffee or for the 3 PM slump at work. The bars come in at 180 calories, which is just about right for a snack that also delivers protein, but maybe on the high end of snack portions for those watching calories. However, this is a nice sized bar; it doesn't feel like a tiny portion. This will become a regular addition to my pantry.

review/summary: Likely the best nut bar I've ever tasted
review/text: I had purchased these when they were about $15.50 for a box of 12 and although that is a bit pricey compared to a box of bars you can get from any other brand, it's much cheaper compared to the $3.29 that I had paid for just one bar at the airport and much better tasting than the rest of the nut bars produced by other companies out there!  Right before I was going on a transpacific flight, I wanted to get some snacks to hold me over so this was one of the items I bought at SFO.  As soon as I took the first bite, I remember thinking how good these were and knew that I had to buy these, once I got back to the states.  I ordered the Almond & Coconut ones and they are awesome!  One look at the ingredients and that tells you how there's nothing but all natural stuff in here and the taste is truly delicious!  Personally, I don't think there is a better tasting bar out there than this - it is so far THE best I've tried!

review/text: I purchased Almond/Apricot and Almond/Coconut and they are both delicious!<br /><br />These bars are made mostly out of almonds and other nuts, held together by sweet syrup (not too sweet).<br />Both have a hint of coconut flavor (Almond/Coconut has a slightly stronger coconut flavor). The apricot adds a bit of tang to the flavor, which I really enjoyed. I liked Almond/Apricot slightly better for this burst of tartness.<br /><br />Each bar is individually wrapped, long and slim, and easy to slip into a purse and bring along when you need a bit of pick-me-up on the go.<br /><br />I highly recommend these bars!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo with the wrapper off with one bite taken, so you can see the texture of the bar inside the wrapper.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
