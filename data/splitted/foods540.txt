review/summary: Since rice is my primary grain, I fell in love with RiceSelect
review/text: I have 3 different types of RiceSelect rice on subscription to be delivered automatically because I use so much of it. This rice is really versatile, I know my cookbook says to use it in puddings but if I cook it on 'Sushi' setting in my fuzzy logic machine it makes a great tasting white rice, fluffy and kind of chewy. Consistency just right.

review/text: Was my first time purchasing this rice. I thought the jars would be bigger but then again I'm used to shopping at those big club stores. lol . I made some Mexican Rice Pudding with this rice and it came out so smooth and creamy. Just excellent. I was overall satisfied with my purchase. Was delivered quickly.

review/summary: Love that risotto
review/text: I made my first risotto just a few months ago. I searched allrecipes.com and tried the "Gourmet mushroom risotto"--and became addicted! Even though there are only two of us for meals, I have made the full 6 servings recipe, so that I can munch away at this treat for a few days.<br /><br />I have not tried other Arborio rice, so I can't make any comparisons. But the RiceSelect version produces a tasty dish. I know that one must be patient in making risotto and not go to another room to watch television. But if you stay with the dish and nurture it, the patience is well rewarded.<br /><br />The mushroom version goes as follows. Warm some chicken broth. In a saucepan, heat mushrooms in olive oil. Cook until soft and remove mushrooms and their liquid. Stir some shallots into a skillet and cook a minute or so. Then add the Arborio rice, stirring it to coat with the oil until it takes on a golden color. Pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is absorbed. Then, stir in chicken broth in three different stages, stirring until absorbed. Remove the rice from the heat, stir in mushrooms and liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan cheese and, if you wish, season with salt and pepper. The end result is yummy and kicks up a meal considerably as a side dish.<br /><br />In fact, writing about this recipe, I think I'll make some risotto with dinner tonight!<br /><br />Anyhow, this Arborio rice makes excellent risotto.

review/summary: Risotto instead of potatoes
review/text: This rice makes up into perfectly decent risotto when you follow package directions. This is not an Italian rice, it is an Italian-style rice, that has cooking properties similar to Arborio rice. The jar is big, and you get 4 of the big jars, so plan to eat a lot of rice. I'm hoping to experiment and find some new ways to cook the basic product so I can have more variety than I get from small variations in the cheese and vegetables that I mix in. Judging from posted recipes, everyone goes to the same variations (parmesan/asiago/romano with asparagus/spinach).  Makes a meal with a breast from a little roast chicken from the grocery store.

review/summary: This food saved my cat
review/text: My cat couldn't keep food down and went from 10 lbs to 6 in a short period of time despite lots of vet visits and a $600 endoscopy. He seemed to be slipping away. After reading about possible food allergies and the fact that cats don't need any carbohydrates since they are obligate carnivores, I examined a lot of cat-food labels at my local super pet store, looking for an all-meat food. This is the only one I found. My cat immediately began gaining weight and has been completely healthy since he started eating it about six weeks ago. He has remained slim, active and playful. I wish more people would realize that carbohydrates aren't good for cats! And since it's canned, he gets the moisture he needs.

review/text: This one is a hard review to write because my cats love the food and I do think it is a top quality one, but I won't be buying it from Amazon again.  Don't get me wrong, I have done business with Amazon for over 2 decades and the very few problems that have come up, have always been solved to my satisfaction. To order this product though you have to do business with Pet Food Direct and that is what I will not do again.  I had a problem with this order and I talked to 3 different people at PFD, one of which was a supervisor, and none of them would help me.  They were terrible to deal with and all I got from them was to send it back at my own expense when I got it and they would refund my purchase price minus the shipping.  I then talked to customer service at Amazon, who never disappoints, and they made it right for me.  When you talk to them, they really want to help you and are so friendly!  NOT so at Pet Food Direct...at all!  I wish Amazon would start selling this with the super saver shipping, but until they do I will be buying more by taking a drive to Petsmart.  Sorry.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: After much research, I finally settled on a cat food brand and by Nature is it! My cats love this food (almost every flavor...) and have been doing great on it. My over wieght boy has slimmed down quite a bit since switching him to only wet food and this brand (mostly, I also feed them some EVO cans as well). One of my favorite things about it is that it doesn't contain any grains, not even rice, and is relatively inexpensive for a quality brand. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to feed their cats a great diet, but don't have the time or money to feed raw.

Ever since the gluten scare I've been pretty diligent about reading ingredients.

review/summary: Stella is happy
review/text: I have two cats, My orange baby will eat anything- white bread, cheese, pretzels, chips etc.  We don't like him to eat all this garbage but he is kind of a ninja about it, opening up cabinets and grabbing what he wants.  The one thing he won't eat is natural and organic cat food without byproduct.  We had to give the crazy expensive wellness food away to a friend since he wouldn't eat it and would just meow at the stop of his lungs that he hated it.<br /><br />My other cat a tabby won't eat wet food, she hates it.  She makes my orange cat eat it out of her bowl before she touches her dry food I mix it with.<br /><br />This food changed everything.  We were given a can of this to try, and my tabby wouldn't let the orange one near her bowl, and went back 3 times to eat more and bury her food.  The orange one loves it, even though it doesn't have any garbage in it.<br /><br />We found a winner.

review/summary: Excellent cat food
review/text: Like another reviewer said, this cat food literally saved our pet's life. He couldn't keep any type of food down but was always starving. He would gobble down whole cans of food and then immediately throw it back up. The vet's only recommendation was to keep switching to different brands of food -- at no time did he tell us to avoid the filler that most manufacturers add to their food. After a little searching on the internet, I saw that perhaps it was the additional ingredients which may be the cause of his upset stomach. By Nature was the only brand at PetSmart that had such a high content of natural ingredients, both in the dry and canned food; it doesn't contain corn, wheat or soy. He's been eating By Nature for 2 weeks now, is looking much better and has gained back some of his weight. Yes, it's more expensive than the other brands but it's well worth it for a happy, healthy cat.

review/text: I wish I could give 6 out of 5 stars !  With so many choices, I gave two leaves and a bud - a try.  Judging by the package outside, it's like a regular brown box, no fancy tin.  But, the tea is individually wrapped in some soft satin materials and you can see the little tea leaves.  Then, each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness !!  I was blown away by the packaging already at this point.  Then the tasting began, it's such a smooth, delicate tea - I can't describe how nice it is but I quit the cheap lipton or any other brand.  This is the tea for me.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Two Leaves and a Bud.  They make a beautiful English Breakfast Tea and many others.  I ordered this giant box of White Tea being a Tea lover and especially a White and Green Tea lover.  The idea of Rose Pedals in my Tea was also enticing and I dreamed about early mornings on my deck, sipping White Peony Tea with Angels flying and Songbirds singing.  Not really. But I did have high hopes for this Tea and I was let down.  The leaves are too small, the Tea goes bitter quickly and it's hard to brew as the bag won't immerse easily in the water.  Try Mighty Leaf Teas for real White and Green Teas.  They are almost unmatched in quality.  For more reviews please visit my blog [...]

Those sausages have about half the sodium of regular sausage, and this chutney is low sodium, so the combination is one a person on a lo-so diet can eat - and yet, it's so full of flavor, that people who aren't on such a diet won't have anything to complain about. The chutney also tastes good with turkey breast, or mixed with plain rice. I use this chutney for even more things than I use salsa for!

review/text: My family loves rice.  I discovered this blend at one of our local groceries, but they are not consistent in stocking it.  It sells out quickly and then may not reappear for weeks.  And it is the only store in town that carries it.  I was thrilled with the opportunity to buy it by the case online.  The price is very competitive with the local grocery, and shipping was fast.  This is easily one of the best rice blends I have found.  And it is NOT seasoned, so you do not have to contend with high sodium content or other problems. You make it the way you want it--cook it in broth, add vegetables & herbs and some diced chicken or leftover beef for a quick skillet meal that is head & shoulders above a boxed skillet dinner. We all really love this rice--the blends of rice give it a nice texture and taste and it is so much healthier than white rice, yet it cooks as quickly.  Try this one--you will like it!

review/summary: THE rice alternative
review/text: An Amazon Friend reviewed the Texmati White Rice recently. Today when I took this out of its spot, I thought: People should know how good this Royal Blend white, brown, wild, and red rice really is.<br /><br />Here I am on a two-fold mission: one, to explain this lovely blend and two, to suggest other uses for the empty container. How I found this rice is maybe unusual. When I am normal, I zip through the grocery store, attending business, then I'm out of there. When I am depressed, I spend two hours in the store. I look at everything. I imagine my life another way. With this rice, I thought, how exotic could I make a meal for a small dinner party? I thought of Royal Blend served in little white ceramic Chinese rice bowls I bought in San Francisco. Set the bowl right on the plate. I have colorful plates that I mix-match for fun and variety. Serve with grilled salmon fillets. Get out a vegetable cookbook for ideas there.Everything has to be fun and cheerful. This rice certainly is colorful and fun to eat. Its slightly nutty taste and hint of crunchiness would wow the taste buds and complement the salmon.<br /><br />Cooking this rice also saves time. Mix the water, rice, butter, and seasonings all together, then cook 15 minutes as opposed to 20 for white. Besides, Royal Blend contains no fat, just a touch of sodium, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of protein, and one gram of fiber, making this hands down a superior product of rice.<br /><br />The second point is the availability of the containers. Once the rice is gone, I wash the container then use it to hold my various varieties of dried beans. The plastic jars look identical and neat all lining the counter top. Add attractiveness to the look.<br /><br />Royal Blend costs a little more, but aren't you worth it?

And when you finish off the rice, you have a nice container for nuts or other dry ingredients for the pantry. This is a terrific blend of rice.

This rice is excellent in a variety of dishes and is priced nicely too, at least compared to the alternatives in our local grocery store. My favorite recipe: Cook with some added bouillion or real chicken stock, add 1 to 2 tsp butter, add some dry or chopped onion, sage, basil, oregano and whatever else you feel like and cook as normal (15 to 20 minutes).

review/text: I am not the kind of guy who writes reviews about rice.<br /><br />Yet I felt compelled to get online and tell the world about how AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS this stuff is.<br /><br />I had just purchased a cheap rice cooker, and so I was browsing the grocery shelves to find a rice that looked interesting. This one, with its blend of grains, fit the bill. I made it yesterday with water, some butter, minced garlic, and a dash of salt. The result was FANTASTIC. Seriously, this is probably the best rice I've ever had.<br /><br />Tonight I used a half tablespoon of olive oil instead of the butter, and the rice came out just as good. Seriously folks, this stuff is amazing. It has a soft texture that almost seems to melt in my mouth. It has a slightly nutty flavor and it almost reminds me of popcorn.<br /><br />Both last night and tonight, I had planned to dice up some chicken and put it in the rice, but after taking just one sample bite of the rice, I couldn't wait for the chicken. This is the kind of rice I would expect to find at a chic 4-star restaurant.<br /><br />Folks, I cannot get over how amazing this rice is. GET IT. You won't be sorry.

review/text: I will continue to keep RiceSelect on hand. This rice doesn't get pasty and stick together. The packaging keeps the rice fresh after opening so you don't have to transfer it to another container. The perfect side dish. Plus it cooks quickly. I plan to try the other RiceSelect blends offered.

review/summary: Great Rice Blend
review/text: I have actually ordered two cases of this twice, and will probably order another two cases some time soon. It is the only quick cooking rice blend that includes wild, red and brown rice. It is very tasty, easy to make, and I make it often.<br /><br />I do not follow their cooking directions, however. I brown the rice mixture in butter before adding the water.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it does contain white rice. I would prefer not to eat white rice. I would like it even better if it were organic.

review/summary: Royal Blend is Healthy and Tasty
review/text: I found this rice once at a supermarket but after several months they never seemed to carry it anymore.<br /><br />The rice is healthier than white rice and even if you follow the simple instructions on the package it is quite delicious.  I eat it several nights a week.  It goes great with chicken and steamed vegetables for a healthy dinner.  There are no additives, just an assortment of different rice.  It also has an interesting texture, not too crunchy, but not mushy like white rice.<br /><br />For a healthy solution to side dishes with MSG like rice-a-roni or even semolina pasta, this is the best I've found!

We purchased one package of this rice at our local grocery because it looked interesting.  It's pretty much the only rice we purchase now.  It's become so popular that we have difficulty finding it on the grocery shelves.  We started rationing how often we used the rice, until I found it on Amazon.com.  Now I can have this amazing rice as often as I want!

The perfect combination of white, brown, red and wild rice--much less expensive than straight wild rice.  I like to put a tablespoon or two of butter and some quality chicken boullion in the water when I make it.  There's a nice nutty quality to the taste.  Tastes great in soups, too.  I originally bought it at the grocery store but have been having trouble finding this particular blend, except on Amazon.

review/summary: Not the real thing in my opinion
review/text: I recently bought RiceSelect's whole wheat orzo and I decided to order some RiceSelect royal blend at the same time. The orzo is pretty good, but the rice, oh, the rice, what a terrible disappointment. I was surprised to see that the directions call for such a short cooking time, and sure enough, it did cook that fast. That might sound like a good thing, but the rice came out quite mushy. Looking more closely at the uncooked product, it sure looks to me like it has been processed in some way prior to packaging (maybe it has been parboiled then dried?). In any case, I'm so disappointed by this rice I'm going to give it away to a food bank and just go back to buying rice at my local health food store.<br /><br />If I'm right about the processing of this rice, it should be noted in the product info, and it isn't. If I had bought this locally I would be returning the 3 unopened jars, but it just seems like too much hassle to worry about and I'm sure the food bank will be happy to have it.<br /><br />I have bought literally hundreds of items from Amazon, and this is the first one I've felt compelled to comment on. I absolutely love Amazon, but this product is a total bust.

review/summary: Wonderful cat food
review/text: My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition. After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat. The old cat would eat anything. The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food. He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat. That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list. The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives. The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it. When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione. I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health. The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses. Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion. (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite. I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion. Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients. No by-products here! It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it. He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it. I've tried every single flavor of the "in gravy" flavors (I haven't tried the "in gelee" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this. There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it. There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition. I'm sold!

Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the "Gelee" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the "Gravy" flavors.

review/summary: I love coconut
review/text: I grew up in Hawaii and often ate coconut in many forms--fresh out of the shell (yes, I laughed at Tom Hanks' inability to open a coconut in "Cast Away"--I could have told him to look for the soft spot near the top), in baked goods, as haupia (a Hawaiian coconut dessert), and of course in pina coladas. Now living on the East Coast, I became disgusted with the overly-sugary, fake-tasting coconut flakes found in typical grocery stores, so I was delighted to find this product. I mix these coconut flakes with some of the coconut milk powder and warm water, and after letting the flakes soak for a few minutes, I eat the mixture straight out of the bowl. It tastes almost like fresh coconut this way. I will eventually get around to using these flakes in baked goods, but it's so good plain that I'm reluctant to mix it with anything else.<br /><br />i will definitely order more when I finish my current supply.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: This is a really great product. First, the selection of mushrooms is excellent and includes a lot of exotic varieties, including the Wood Ear, that are not available to most Americans across this country. Secondly, the packaging is good because it is plastic, easily recyclable, and one can simply re-hydrate ALL the mushrooms in a single container and then use what one wants, save the rest in the refrigerator AND use the reserved liquid in some sort of other dish (I like to use it in a Ragu sauce with mushrooms to enhance the flavor).<br /><br />As for the complaint that it is "from China", every country has different levels of production and quality. There are clothes "Made in the USA" that are made in sweatshops. And the same goes for China. There are different qualities of product and production. Moreover, since I have a Ph.D. from UCLA on US-China relations, am a 5th generation American but am always considered a "foreigner," and have traveled extensively all over this globe including all around China, I know a little bit about this.<br /><br />Finally, this is a product that is both from China/Chile, so perhaps those who are against products from China (which includes high-end clothing designers and purveyors of other products) might take comfort in that.

review/summary: The Gold Standard for Pumpkin Pie!
review/text: The best, most delicious and totally consistant pumpkin pies are made from Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin.<br /><br />A single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9" pie (4 cup volume) or two shallow 9" pies (2 cup volume). If you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical.<br /><br />This is what comes in the can: 100% pure pumpkin....which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin. Nothing else, so salt, no preservatives.  The pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can, should you so desire.<br /><br />The pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can. I've tried other, fancier, more complicated recipies over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because, to me, this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like. You get a fragrant and flavorful pie with an excellent texture. The recipe calls for sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. I add 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper. Also, I like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate texture.<br /><br />The recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40-50 minutes at 350. I cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Also, I find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough. Don't overbake! If a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie, its done.<br /><br />On average, this 15 oz can should be about two dollars and fifty cents at a supermarket.<br /><br />One last thing, if you remove the label from the can, you will find other recipies and helpful tips printed on the other side. Its a total win-win!

review/summary: Terrific Product!!!
review/text: I give my dog a tablespoon of canned pumpkin daily to aid his digestive system but he sees it as the best treat! Libby's uses a variety of pumpkin that seems to have more fiber, less water, than other kinds of canned pumpkin. The difference in pumpkin variety, at least for my pup, makes a HUGE difference between it helping his tummy & adding to the problem. He only seems to benefit from the Libby's pumpkin, the other makes his diarrhea worse.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving a little canned pumpkin daily if your dog suffers w/ food allergies &/or digestive troubles - unusually it can help both constipation & diarrhea depending on what they're suffering with. Canned pumpkin can also help dogs who have have trouble w/ congested anal glands have fewer problems &/or lengthen the amount of time between needing them expressed.<br /><br />It's ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO TALK W/ YOUR VET BEFORE adding anything to your dog's diet to be sure it's the right thing for your dog - ALWAYS check w/ your vet first. Be advised that feeding too much, depending on your dog's needs, can cause diarrhea to be worse OR it could cause constipation. Talk to your vet FIRST & be sure to ask the appropriate amount & way to feed to your dog. The size of the dog is important to how much to give them daily, as is the state of their tummy. My dog is 55 lbs, has food allergies, & a tendency towards diarrhea & a tablespoon a day is enough to keep the balance for his tummy issues... enough to prevent diarrhea but not so much as to cause constipation. I give it to him off of a spoon, as a treat, but you can mix it w/ their kibble if they're an especially sloppy eater!<br /><br />Pumpkin, as well as sweet potato, is a terrific treat for dogs w/ food allergies. But again, check w/ your vet first!

And I have noticed how over the years that Libbys Pumpkin has become less and less dense, no doubt to keep the pricing and profit margins at a certain point.  The problem is that I have to adjust my recipes so that the mix isn't so liquid.  I have also complained to Libbys to no avail -- they simply issue the typical corporate lie as if they're responding to a first time user.

review/summary: RECIPE IS ON THE CAN!
review/text: I finally ordered Amy Sedaris' entertaining book after reading that her recipe for pumpkin pie is the one on the can!<br /><br />It's really easy.  I didn't have evaporated milk or I didn't want to look for it and made the recipe with just the eggs and spices.  One hundred percent pumpkin puree is a great idea!  Last month, purveyors in "aristocratic" New York were selling pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving for $50 each.  Considering how many Manhattanites and Brooklynites are originally out of towners who are not unfamiliar with canned food, I'm really amazed at how many rich people there are in New York City who are comfortable paying these prices.  We finally landed a perfectly acceptable 5-inch pie from Whole Foods supermarket that we didn't even finish - the price was $5.99.<br /><br />Some people may find this recipe too strongly spiced.  Wolfgang Puck's recipe is basically less of the spices and more eggs and milk to the same amount of pumpkin puree so that means one is at liberty to adjust the measurements as one pleases.

Of course, as I said, she's old,  will be 22 come this June 2012.<br /><br />=(^..^)=  +  >&lt;}}}*> = &lt;3<br /><br />They are educational to my little grandchildren too, in learning colors and counting for the youngest, and for adding and subtracting for the older one who attends school<br /><br />Pepperidge Farms Goldfish are always the best but I love and agree with what my youngest granddaughter had to say:<br /><br />"Grandma, how come no more colors? That's all the colors? This makes me sad."<br /><br />:(<br /><br />Yup, I agree - it would be nice and more fun if there were more colors! If M&M's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TV8NR2">M&M - Milk Chocolate, 56 oz bag</a> can come up with a world of colors why not Pepperidge Farms Goldfish too? That's a wonderful idea!

review/summary: Plump and Tasty .... But Took Two Shipping Tries to Get it Right
review/text: My son (toddler) is obsessed with blueberries. They're his favorite snack. Fresh can be very expensive in winter--and less than tasty.<br /><br />I usually like organic, but many of the organic dried blueberry options are dry and super tiny. (Probably because organic blueberries tend to be smaller to start with.) They're also quite expensive, especially at the rate we go through them.<br /><br />For the price, and based on the positive reviews, I decided to give these a try. The first batch I got from Amazon was terrible. Dry, small little husks. I was upset since, even these these are a good bulk value, $50 is far from chump change, especially for a grocery item. But Amazon stepped up, assuring me it wasn't a systemic problem and sent me a new batch ASAP.<br /><br />They were right. Night and day. (I must have originally got an old unit or something.) They're large plump and great in baked goods. (I have a "blueberry cream" cookie recipe that uses dried fruit and these are spectacular there.) They taste like blueberries--which is a good thing--and are good enough to eat out of hand. Home run on the second try.<br /><br />The company does offer an organic version--for twice the price, on their company website--and maybe I'll give those a go next time, funds permitting. (I like to buy organic and support the concept but, ouch, $$$.)

review/summary: Great with everything- can't beat the price!
review/text: I've been buying dried blueberries from the grocery store for ages, and struggled everytime I had to buy a tiny bag that only lasted 2 days. I went online to see if I could find them in bulk, and low and behold...! I use these on everything: Spinach salads, cereal, yogurt, trail mix, even just to snack on plain. These blueberries are acutally better than the ones I was buying before, because they don't have High Fructose Corn Syrup. Sugar is actually healthier and tastes better. I will buy these again and again.

review/summary: Too much sugar!
review/text: Too bad they don't have a sugar-free option.  They taste like raisins with all the sugar.  Good perhaps with breakfast food but not so much for a snack.

review/summary: Traverse Dried Blueberries
review/text: These blueberries are delicious.  I just wish they sold an alternate version without sugar or oil.  Blueberries shouldn't need sugar or, at least, I prefer them that way.<br />Shipping time was reasonably quick.  It seemed slow to me just because I was anxious to get them!<br />Reasonable price, too.

review/summary: Yummy, chewy blueberry goodness...
review/text: I love blueberries so I was really looking forward to trying these...wow, am I glad I did! The 4 lbs. of dried fruit is packaged in a sealed plastic bag that is tucked inside the cardboard box shown in the picture...once opened, the bag fits nicely inside a one gallon zip lock bag for storage. About the size of small raisins, these dark blue fragrant gems are sweet, chewy, and full of mouth watering blueberry flavor. So far I've mixed them into hot oatmeal and yogurt and, of course, eaten them straight from the bag. Fresh blueberries are still my favorite but these will definitely satisfy me when I can't go pick my own. The subscribe & save price is very fair and worth every penny. Yummmm!

review/summary: These blueberries are FULL of flavor!
review/text: We are licensed Home Bakers in Vermont and people think we bake with FRESH blueberries...that is how good these blueberries are! When we explain that we bake with dried blueberries they are astounded. Traverse Bay blueberries have minimal processing and since we do not use any preservatives or anything artificial in our baking we appreciate that ! Just note these blueberries are NOT small as some blueberries are that are grown in other parts of the country.

review/text: Most of the blueberries are juicy but some where dry and hard to chew. This was my 1st order w/Traverse Bay and I don't think I'd reorder. I've bought better dries blueberries else where.

review/summary: Small berries, way to much oil used to prevent caking.
review/text: I have been eating dried blueberries for years.  I mostly buy them from the grocer in smaller portion bags.  I thought I was getting a deal buying these.<br /><br />The blue berries in this pack are very small, yes blue berries are small berries but the berries used by Traverse are extremely small compared to other brands.  The size of the berries was not my main issue with the content of the package I bought.  All berries come with a small amount of oil added to prevent caking.  Traverse uses way to much oil to the point where the flavor of the berries is effected by it.<br /><br />These berries did not taste like the blue berries I had purchased before, all I could taste was the oil.  The berries resembled and tatsed like dried and oiled olives except much smaller.  I did not enjoy them and if I did not toss out the packaging I would of returned them.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a different brand, if not then buy the smaller package first as so you can make sure you like them before spending $50+ dollars on the larger package such as this one.

review/summary: blueberry raisins
review/text: I had my first shipping error in many, many Amazon orders.  I explained my time problem and they fixed it with a next day delivery, Kudos there.  These blueberries are pretty sweet, very much like a raisin with a blueberry aftertaste. Like some raisins, you also have noticeable seeds. I think they are a bit pricey for the pleasure.  I have yet to cook with them.  If you are debating between the Traverse Bay blueberries and the cherries, I would recommend you go with the cherries.
