It is made in Beverly Hills California vs the other is made in Franklin Park, IL.  The London Kettle is crispy  and crunchy  the Gary Poppins not so much.

review/summary: Pricing
review/text: The cookies come in a timely manner and are packaged very well.  I send to my Grandmother who loves them.  As you know, they are not stocking in grocery stores anymore (only gas stations and vending like this product is intended for).  It costs $20 something for 24 cookies ordering this way.  I understand making profit, but the suppliers price is less that $44 per 72 count.  Usually about $32/72.  I know this is a place to make a profit and I commend them for doing so...but this is a very high margin.<br /><br />Other than the price, the cookies are great.  Grandma has gained 13 very needed pounds.

review/text: I've been drinking Barry's Tea from Ireland over the past many years, and thought I'd give this PG Tips stuff a try as it's a bit less expensive and from the same neck of the woods where they like their tea a little on the stronger side.  I was disappointed.  This is a weak, uninspiring drink.  The flavors are mild and the tannins are not notable.  I wouldn't buy this tea again.  If you like stronger tea, try Barry's or Tazo Awake.

review/text: I ordered this tea for a change and, indeed, it is! The tea is much stronger and not as smooth as I am accustomed to drinking. It takes barely a few seconds to steep before turning bitterly strong. I like the concept of the triangle bags but they have torn and leaked out tea a few times. It is a bargain tea and good for those who enjoy a strong, robust flavor...just a little too much for my tastes.

review/summary: Not Strong Enough!!! Lacks Full Flavors & Sophistication
review/text: Ok, I've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970's... before that iced tea...<br /><br />Amazon did sell this at an excellent price 'IF' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date... expiration in 2013 for best flavor (bought in August 2011).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is too weak & too smooth... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10-11oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes! I recommend Lifeboat Tea (also from UK) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors.<br /><br />If you don't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication, then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking... good for a tea party... to eat little cakes & scones with it. Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea... that's my perfect cuppa tea...<br /><br />If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste, then please comment to this post... and Thanks!!!

review/text: I bought a box of PG Tips at Meijer grocery yesterday. I just finished making a pitcher of iced tea using their loose tea, and it is totally gaggable. I used a Hamilton Beach electric iced tea maker that normally turns out good tea. I must have used too much, used 3 Tablespoons of the loose tea and brewed using normal amount of ice in the pitcher. It is reddish looking and has a cloudy mess at the base of the pitcher. Bitter, and awful. I will try again using less tea but I don't expect to like the taste of this stuff at any strength.

review/summary: A fine and sturdy everyday tea
review/text: This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive "fannings" or "dust," remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.

review/text: I come from a family of tea drinkers. My parents were tea drinkers, my aunts and uncles were tea drinkers. My daughter caught the bug and she is tea drinker. I've tasted many different teas, but this is by far the best. The flavor is strong, the color is gorgeous. It goes extremely well by itself, as well as sweetened with honey or just plain sugar. It tastes great with key lime juice and honey. It is my favorite with milk and sugar/honey. You've got to try it to believe it. By comparison, American favorite Lipton comes through as bland and somewhat tasteless, or worse - tasting like the tea bag...<br /><br />I highly recommed PG Tips to any serious tea drinker.

review/summary: Our favorite everday tea!
review/text: We drink this tea quite often, and really enjoy it. While not a connoisseur's tea by any means, it makes a good, strong, "cuppa char" to go with your breakfast, sammie, or cookies. I prefer the large pyramidal bags over regular bags, too, as they seem to improve brewing of the tea and are easier to fish out before pouring. The price here at Amazon is much, much better than at the stores, too--about 1/2 the typical grocery store price per bag!<br /><br />It does help if you know how to make tea, as making it incorrectly may result in a bitter, unpleasant brew. The key things to remember are: always prewarm your pot, use BOILING water (not just hot), and let it steep at least 3 minutes. As these are a bit larger than some teabags, I usually allow about 1-2 bags for each 2 cups or 1 mug of tea, plus an extra bag, "for the pot" so to speak. So in our 4-cup teapot, I will use about 4-5 bags, depending on how strong I want it. Milk (better than cream) will help cut the tannin, if your tea is too potent; lemon helps as well--but don't use milk and lemon together! ;)

review/summary: The best black tea going
review/text: I discovered - no, I was introduced to - PG Tips when I was in London over two decades ago. I would stuff boxes of it into my suitcases when I visited London and would ask friends to do the same if they were traveling. So I was THRILLED to find PG on Amazon. PG Tips makes the best pot of black tea that you can get from tea bags. One bag is a bit too much for a cup or mug - it's best to use a small teapot. I use two teabags in a 4-cup pot, and have my wonderful satisfying cup(s) of tea in the morning. During summer I turn the rest of the pot into iced tea. And the tea as offered on Amazon is the best price I've found, too.

review/summary: PG Tips Black Tea
review/text: PG Tips Black Tea ia an excellent tea, weather loose or Pyramid Tea bags.Good Strong tea,nice flavor wheather you drink it black or with cream & sugar. I prefer this tea with half & half & sugar allthough  at times I drink it straight up. I recomment it highly & it is one of the best English teas. The closest American tea I can compare to is Lipton. If you enjoy Lipton, you will love PG.When I Have time to relax I use PG loose tea. When pressed for time I use Tea bags. I enjoy PG tea and I am sure many of you who try it will agree. The Pyramid tea bags are much better than regular tea bags. I give it five stars.PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)

review/summary: Second best, but still good
review/text: True tea is loose, not enclosed in prim little pyramids: it sticks to the bottom of your mug, where you can read that you are fated to drink ever more of it.<br />But not if you were an Amazon subscriber: they removed it from subscription sale: who knows why? I have my dark suspicions though, stirred by a lot of tea<br />drinking. Loose tea is more economical, better quality, and makes it easier to gauge your required dose. One tea bag's a bit weak, two's a bit strong...<br />Still, that's what we'll have to go with, as the price of loose PG Tips tea went through the roof.

review/text: I bought this because I really missed having a nice "cuppa" after leaving England. My local Ralph's grocery store sells PG Tips in 80-count boxes but it's much too expensive, and I go through these boxes fairly quickly.<br />So I tried drinking Lipton tea but it wasn't cutting it for me because the flavor is too weak.<br />PG Tips is very strong and has a nice, rich flavor. A bit stronger than Tetley, in my opinion. I'm very glad that I can have a nice cuppa away from England.

I have tried lipton, tetley, salada, bigelow, stash, and twinings black tea. I ordered this online because I wanted to try it. I have to say this is by far my favorite conventional supermarket black tea that is sold! Liption is commom here, but I find it to be too bitter, tetley is alright. I wish they sold it in the US. :( It has a great rich yet clean and smooth taste to it which I just love. I'll be ordering this again!

I usually drink more green tea than black, but I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of this.  I'm glad I gave it a go when it went up as one of amazon's goldbox deals.

Do not buy boxes that are too large for your consumption habits.  We have purchased the larger boxes in the past and by the time we reached the bottom, the tea was losing its potency.  These 80-bag boxes are perfect for us. Each lasts for about a month or two.

review/summary: Great every day tea
review/text: This is a great, refreshing tea that you could use every day.  It's not so strong that it would overpower you.  I use this tea with a little sugar.  With other teas, sometimes I like to put in two tea bags so that the flavor is more potent.  I don't advise doing that with this tea.  It has a subtle almost bitter flavor that's nice when you use one.  With two, it feels far too strong.<br /><br />I typically don't buy black tea like this.  I usually buy flavored black tea (artificial or natural).  I always fear plain black tea will taste bland like Lipton.  I tried another UK tea and it did taste like Lipton.  This doesn't taste as bland as that.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite every day teas.  My other favorite is Marketspice cinnamon orange tea.  Unlike this tea, it is very strong.  I enjoy both at different times.

Not big deal I thought until I opened the box. I ended up with only about 38 tea bags out of the 80 that weren't completely sealed bags so not sure why that had happened to most of the bags. The other 3 boxes don't appear to have any loose tea on the outside.

review/summary: Rather Good!
review/text: My wife and I were shopping at a nearby "Fresh and Easy" grocery store and she spotted PG Tips black tea on the shelves in the beverage isle. She has lived in London and recognized it immediately as one of the top British teas. She says that she seldom has seen it in America, but there it was. Well, "Fresh and Easy" is a British company, so it figures. Of course, we had to pick up an 80-bag box.<br /><br />My wife loves this stuff and I'd have to rate it rather good. I might add that I much prefer coffee as a beverage but I enjoy tea now and then. I must admit that this tea is much more robust than that with which I'm familiar, mainly Lipton. My wife loathes Lipton, and after trying this tea I can see a substantial difference. Lipton now tastes like slightly flavored hot water to me whereas PG has a good robust flavor. Most certainly, I won't drink Lipton again with a choice of tea like PG Tips around.<br /><br />We also like the little pyramid tea bag. I think it contains much more tea than the conventional flat paper bag, and perhaps that in itself promotes the more robust flavor. In any case, this is most certainly an excellent tea and we'll eventually be back for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: My New Favorite Tea
review/text: Having grown up in Australia and then moving to the USA to live, I have long missed a good cup of (hot) tea.  But no more!  I found PG Tips here at Amazon a while ago and I have been buying them ever since.<br /><br />This is a strong Orange Pekoe tea (basic, medium-grade black tea), much stronger than anything I have found at retail in the US grocery stores.  It *will* stain your pot or cups over time, but as many tea drinkers will tell you, this just makes for a better cup of tea.  If this becomes unsightly, I take a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FOPT2Y">Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Cleaning Pads, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> to the inside of the cup to remove the stain.  According to the box, PG Tips is a British blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan teas.<br /><br />The pyramid shaped bag allows for more water flow and better steeping, which means more tea flavor from each bag.  Make sure you boil your water to a rolling boil and steep for at least three minutes for maximum flavor (as with most black teas, longer steep times will result in a bitter taste because the release of tannic acid).  I like to drink mine hot with a splash of milk, at all times of the day.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: PG Tips! Shouldn't the British know best?
review/text: I have been an iced tea drinker all my life, but also enjoy herbal, Green, & Chai teas as well. For my iced tea, however, I was raised on Lipton instant :1/3 tea, 2/3 sugar per 2 quarts water, but evolved to Lipton tea bags, then Luzianne tea bags. (I was very happy with my Luzianne... although hard to find locally) Amazon offered the PG Tips on a 'Lightning Deal' at an unbelievable price, so I purchased them. Well... I have 4 huge boxes of Luzianne bags sitting in my pantry that will be given to my mother, as I will NEVER give up the PG Tips! After drinking this tea all year, sweetened of course, I realize the British truly do know their tea. I use LESS bags to brew my tea, as they are a stronger blend, & I haven't yet had the problem of the tea going "sour", even when accidentally left on the kitchen counter for 2 days. Now... If I could ONLY get that British accent down!

review/summary: PG Tips Tea: Mum knows best
review/text: My English mother-in-law came to visit us in 1968 and, wisely, brought along her favourite brand of tea, PG Tips. So, it's been our house tea ever since, improved only by my spouse's collection of seven or more tea pots collected over time. According to my missus, the key to taste is PG Tips, warming the teapot, using the same water to warm cups or mugs, add BOILING water to the pot from an electric kettle and a few minutes of steeping time. We take our tea with milk and sugar. Lemons are for G&T, which is a different drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JLY">PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 80-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: I've tried PG Tips in the regular tea bag (think Lipton or Tetley sized bags) and found it to be very refreshing and bold in flavor.  Tbe pyramid bags are pretty easy to handle and they are easily removed by fingers when steeping is complete.  Just to warn, the pyramid bags to allow a lot more surface contact between the hot water and ground tea, so don't keep the bag in a mug of water for more than a minute or two, or else the tea will become quite bitter and too strong.

There are no tabs, which may bother those who are finicky about touching the tea-bag, but the lack of paper tabs makes for less waste.

review/summary: sold at first sip
review/text: I've been a tea drinker all my life, starting with pedestrian old Lipton, but when I was introduced to PG Tips a few years ago, it became the premier tea in my kitchen. It says something that I first tried it in a British tea shop which happens to be in the American Midwest; the British certainly know their tea, and drinking this tea sitting in that shop made me feel like I was in London. PG Tips is a middling strong tea, robust and full-bodied and very flavourful. It is recommended by a British acquaintance who is a tea fanatic that you do not steep this tea too long, and do not squeeze the bag out into your cup, as it coarsens the flavour. Overall my favourite imported British tea.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the taste - but seems a little pricey for what you get
review/text: First the good news: My cats (all 7 of them) absolutely love this food.  2 of our most finicky will eat almost nothing else, but they gobble this down.  Clearly this is a good-tasting food.<br /><br />Now the bad news: Seems very expensive for what you get.  A look at the ingredient list reveals by-products and several grain fillers such as wheat gluten that you don't usually find in a so-called "premium" food.  Not sure why exactly it is so expensive.  They also do not even make this available in a 5.5 or 6 oz can, only the 3 oz size - so for multiple cat households the cost of these little cans  can really add up in a hurry.<br /><br />So bottom line, it is definitely a good-tasting food and if your cats are picky eaters it is worth a try.  However, the high cost and lack of a larger can option makes this a tough sell.  I am trying to find a better/more economical food that all of my cats will like, so I can transition them off this.

review/text: I am always on the lookout for a good chamomile tea. If the box has been sitting on the shelf too long, the tea inside can develop a musty flavor. Gevalia comes in handy, since it's mail order, it tends to be delivered much more fresh. Even when fresh, however, some tea blenders insist on blending the chamomile with herbs that tart the taste up a little too much for me. This blend has some soy lecithin in it, which I'm not 100% crazy about, but oh my, does it ever taste good. Put a little honey in it and it's like drinking a sugar cookie. I'm still looking for the chamomile tea that will hit my sweet spot for both flavor and ingredients, but in the meantime I am very much going to be enjoying this blend.

review/text: For some reason, sometimes I can find certain McCormick seasonings in stock, and sometimes I can't.  (I am referring to the spice and seasoning packs, not the individual spices.)  Anyway, I tried this a few weeks back and LOVED it, but haven't found it since.<br /><br />A few changes: Cannelli beans were very expensive at my supermarket, so I used a different kind of white bean.  Maybe Navy beans, but I am not sure.  I also used ground chicken rather than the chopped-up chicken breast called for in the directions.  So much easier.  And I browned the meat in olive oil, which I much prefer over veggie oil.  Also, as I recall, I had to add extra liquid later, so next time I would NOT drain the beans.  And be sure to add the tomatoes.<br /><br />I did find this product a bit too spicy for me.  Next time, I'll just use 3/4 of the package.  But, other than that, loved it!  Not greasy at all.<br /><br />I hope the seller I've selected hurries with my order, LOL.
