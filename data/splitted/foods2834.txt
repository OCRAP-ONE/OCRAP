review/summary: Maggie Wholesale 96 Pack Noodles
review/text: Day:1 Hmm, I was excited on seeing Amzn.com's offer which pretty much dwarfs the price I pay for noodles at the Indian grocery store...when the box came, I ripped it open to taste the noodles hoping that the taste would be great... hmm not quite.. it had a stale smell, not intolerable, but recognizable.<br /><br />Day:2 I ate two packs and did not get the flavor... something fishy..<br /><br />Day:3 I decided that I am not going to return a 96 pack (rather 94 now) box and decided to stock the noodles in my shelf. Suddenly my eyes fell on the expiry date, it was February 2011.. and what date is it today? August 2011..<br /><br />The idea is not about being able to return products, but to make sure the products are good in the first place.. think about the effort I have to put in now to return it... why does this happen? Is Amazon not reading reviews? Are people who pack the noodles not literate enough to read the expiry date? I am disappointed.

review/summary: An Ode to the Drink of the Gods...
review/text: This Mango Nectar is perfection! It deserves the highest praise, and I feel compelled to be the one to give it.<br /><br />First, it must be understood that this is a true delicacy and thus it is to be sipped and savored slowly, not gulped down indiscriminately like a can of coke. If you really want to get the most out of this true little slice of heaven, you have to address it unhurriedly , preferably with your eyes closed. It is best served refrigerated and I like to drink it straight out of the can, because even the can feels good, with its slim line and nice heft. It's actually quite a bit heavier than one expects... So, can or glass, take a sip and gently roll it around on your tongue, like you would a fine wine. Feel the thick richness of the nectar, dancing its dance of subtle, rich flavors in the hiddenmost recesses of your taste glands. Remember to breath gently through your mouth and nose too, to get the full effect of the subtle hues of this amazing fruit's aromas. Notice the tiniest little hint of bitterness - it really rounds out the "feel" of the mango. It no doubt comes from the pulp and, without it, this juice would not be nearly as delectable as it is.<br /><br />Does this sound like poetry to you? Perhaps it seems like it is a somewhat overdone description of a product that is, after all, "only a fruit juice", right? Well, I invite you to try it yourself and see if it is not deserving of every accolade I have ascribed to it and many others I may have missed.<br /><br />I am having one now and I must add, though it is probably fairly obvious, I feel it enhances my imagination and my creativity too... :)

review/text: I was excited to order these based on the reviews and expected a gourmet delight.  I poured it into a heavy cut glass and prepared to enjoy.  Yuck!  Thin, almost no taste at all.  It tasted like a lightly flavored water.<br /><br />I adore juice nectars.  I always sip, not drink them.  This is  a complete waste of my dollars.  It hardly even tastes like a juice of kind any of fruit.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will never order this brand again.  YUCK!!!

review/summary: Average for a Lavazza, good by other standards
review/text: I would rate the Gran Riserva below Lavazza's Tierra! and Super Crema for sure. It isn't as flavorful as the Crema e Aroma, but is less acidic. I like(d) it better than the Qualita Oro, which is priced outrageously. For the price, the Gran Riserva also offers less value than the Pienaroma. I don't remember the Gran Riserva's characteristics that well - so it wasn't memorable, I guess. :-) Nothing much wrong with it, either. My expectations must have been high because it's called "Gran Riserva".<br /><br />If it was on sale, I would buy it. It's probably better than most other espresso beans; it is - after all - a Lavazza.

review/text: I love these chips, the flavor is wonderful, not extremely spicy but has a bit of a bite to them.  I was hesitant to try them, my kids liked them, but once I did, I was addicted!  Great on the go snack, I love that they are individually packaged and they are all the same flavor.  I haven't found this flavor packaged in small bags by itself. It usually is with other flavors and this is the one flavor all of us like the best.  I'll keep on buying them!

review/summary: Delicious tasting chips
review/text: These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right "kick", and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.<br /><br />Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon for 64 1.5-Ounce bags is more expensive. You are paying for the convenience of a single serving size.

I haven't bought them through Amazon but I have bought a lot of other products and I have not had any problems.

review/summary: Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique
review/text: I spotted this exquisite treat at a local gourmet food store and had to give them a try. Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique. And now I can't find them locally anymore, so glad to see them here.<br /><br />St. Dalfour raisins are not at all like the regular raisins, which are packed dry. These are moist! And tender and truly delightful. The sole ingredient listed on the label is: raisins. No preservatives.<br /><br />These raisins are vacuum packed in glass jars and remain moist and plump. I don't know how St. Dalfour achieves this, but the resulting product is simply delectable. I have also tried their raisin and cranberry mix, which is also excellent.<br /><br />A tasty treat right off the jar, but even better in desserts (ricotta torte, pear and raisin crumble, clafouti, bread pudding).<br /><br />Made in France.

review/text: I've been looking for a horseradish product that really attacks your naval cavity (the kind where you can barely keep your eyes open).  In recent years it seems I've either developed a bit of a tolerance or maybe most horseradish has been watered down.  I bought a bottle of Inglehoffer horseradish and it really packs the kick with a very little amount.  Very good.<br /><br />For a bit of honesty, my wife does not seem to think it's as strong as I do, so individual results may vary.  That's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

I don't know what kind of cast-iron stomachs they have, but too much of this sauce at a time will take your breath away. I mix it with some sour cream to weaken the bite a little. It's good stuff, but it's not mild in the least.

Amazon has a better price than our store, too, plus the only 2 stores that sell these in my area are 30 mins away.  Love Amazon for saving me the gas and delivering to my house!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: My daughter currently does not want to eat fruit. I think it has to do with the texture or something. So in order to ensure that she does get her vitamins I give her these as a snack. I think they are all great and that it's a shame that they are not all available for subscribe and save anymore.

review/text: My son absolutely loves these, and we still buy Ella's kitchen products occasionally for some variety, but other brands such as Happy Baby provide the same quality organic products for a much lower cost. Ella's Kitchen has an excellent product, and we love everything we've every tried from them, but I just cannot justify the significant difference in cost. They are just SO much more expensive than other brands of really good organic baby food!

These aren't available in all stores yet, so subscribing keeps them on-hand at all times.

She would take a slurp, pause, and say, "YUMMM!" It's not always easy to have organic vegetables and fruits always at the ready, and I think that these are a great way to fit them in when you can't make all your baby's food yourself. Plus, they taste great!

review/summary: Delicious, Healthy, Easy for Kids to Open Snack!
review/text: My kids have tried all of the Ella's Kitchen "smoothies" and love them.  (By the way, they make baby food ones, too.)  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full.  Or any on-the-go mom.  We brought these on a 4-day roadtrip and they were a lifesaver!  Everytime our kiddos got hungry, we'd hand them back one of these.  They could open and close them themselves, it was a very healthy snack, and it was not at all messy.  Ella's Kitchen pouches are notably easier than most squeezable fruits we've tried and we've pretty much tried them all--the tops are nice and big and easy for even toddlers to unscrew and screw back on. This one is a mix of currants, blueberries, bananas, and apples.  The other flavors are The Green One, The Yellow One, and the Red One. So yummy!

review/text: This is my daughter's favorite Ella's fruit flavor.  Not only do they come in smoothie fruit for toddlers and bigger kids (and grown-ups, wink-wink), but they come in baby food, too!  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full. Or for an on-the-go family.  We used these during a long, 4-day road trip we took.  When my youngest got hungry, I could just lean back and hand him one of these.  He was 3, could unscrew the lid himself, and it was a healthy, non-messy snack.  I highly recommend!

I recommend them for adults and toddlers alike!

Good organic fruit, and good pricing on Amazon. Definitely a perfect option when homemade purees or fresh fruit is not a good option.

review/summary: One of the best baby foods for 6 month+
review/text: I love Ella's because there are so many great mixes of fruits and vegetables for my baby to try.  The best way to prevent a picky eater in the toddler years is to give a wide variety of flavors and textures when they're still babies.  I love all the pouches, because I don't want to get jars with BPA in the lining of the lid and I also don't have time to make baby food either.  Ella's says they hope to introduce recyclable packaging in the next year or two, but that right now, this is the best way to protect the foods that are made without preservatives.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a different flavor profile to introduce to their little one.  '

We have tried other brands of convenient pounches and they are NOT the same, she will throw the other pouches on the floor.  When she sees Ella's at the store, she wants them right then.  As soon as I open it, she eats it up and asks for more.  She is small for her age, so I encourage her to eat these as much as she wants.  So glad I found these on Amazon, the price is so much better.  In the stores they average $1.50 - $1.79 each.

review/text: "The Red One", organic baby food "smoothie"<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other "bagged" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz).

Will definitely buy more of these to have on hand for snacking on the road this summer, otherwise I will just buy the organic fruit and make it myself at home.  I tasted it too and it was delicious!  No GMO's and no pesticides, that sealed the deal for me.

review/summary: tasty, healthy snack
review/text: I prefer to stick with organic versions of the "dirty dozen" in produce (which, sadly, includes most berries), but I also try to follow my pediatrician's advice to have my son "eat the rainbow" each day. That gets tough, especially when we get into fall/winter, when fresh fruits and veggies are fewer and far between. Organic berries (like the strawberries and raspberries in this product) are expensive, hard to find, and definitely out of season right now here in NY. Enter Ella's Red One Smoothie Fruits. These pouches are great to have around as an option to round out my toddler's colorful fruit intake for the day. Not to mention, they're delicious - think applesauce, with sweet berries added for extra flavor and flair! And they're ideal when we're on the go. With a few of these tossed into my diaper bag, I always have something healthy and organic on hand for him to enjoy. They're even a nice snack for me when I find myself a bit low on energy when we're out and about. The crushed fruit inside these pouches is smooth (almost baby food consistency), so it slurps up through the straw-like top easily. Once I've unscrewed the cap, my 17 month old can eat this entirely without my help, leaving my hands free to get stuff done. Sweet!

review/summary: My current favorite food product
review/text: My little one eats very few purees nowadays.  He likes feeding himself.  However, these smoothies are good for both Baby and Momma.  a) The flavor is FANTASTIC with organic goodness bursting at the seams of your taste buds.  b)  I love, love, LOVE this pouch.  During a feeding, I normally start by squeezing a biteful at a time into a spoon for my little one.  No mess and resealable if he decides he only wants 1/3 of the container.  I've also found that after a while, my little one likes to hold the pouch and slowly squirt it into his mouth.  Once again, no mess for me to clean up, and Little Guy is very pleased at the food and being able to feed himself.<br />Fabulous product indeed.

review/text: My 9 month old daughter loves these! She'll sometimes reject food if she's having tummy troubles or cutting a tooth, so I turn to these on those days. I never have problems getting her to eat them, I feel like she's getting great quality food, and they mix well with cereal. I also love the packaging because it's much easier to throw in my purse than a jar of food!

review/text: We are addicted to these and always have a stash in the house. This (and other flavors) have become our go-to snack. I like them because both my four year old and 16 month old can feed themselves without the mess, so it's perfect for when we are out or on travel. In addition, all this is is pureed fruit - no added sugars, no preservatives, nothing. It's a snack I am happy to give to my kids. We take them everywhere - in the car, to the beach, to the zoo, sometimes I pack them in my son's lunch for school, etc. And they're a great snack for the parents as well... We will continue to purchase these for years I am sure.

review/summary: Delicious, Tasty and Healthy for my Little One!
review/text: My 20 month old loves fruits and vegetables! When I say he loves them, I mean he would pick them over his other snacks. So I don't complain when he asks for them either. We have a cupboard filled with these healthy snack pouches just on hand when we run out of his veggies and fruits. We take them along wherever we go. These come in very handy!<br /><br />We used another brand before this one (Plum Organics) but although tasty, they were more runny in consistency. I find that Ella's taste more natural as if they were truly mashed with a fork. Another reviewer thought that Ella's was more sugary but I don't agree. I think its because Ella's is more firmer than the Plum Organics, which tastes a little water down.<br /><br />My son loves these and doesn't even mind having some of the Stage 1 for babies! I gave this product 5 stars because it tastes good, its packaged nice, they come in different combinations and it healthy!

I was looking for a healthier alternative to most snacks I find at the store, I was told this resembles applesauce and to try it. It's has a pleasant applesauce feel, and taste good to boot.

I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving. This stays down but is beginning to cause some indigestion at times. I'm not saying it would cause you guys to reflux or anything of that sort, but it was really acidic and caused me to choke.

Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in, and need to retrain your stomach and intestines. Just be careful, some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />P.S.

review/summary: HUGE Package and a Good Value
review/text: I was taken aback when I opened the door and had a box from Amazon that measures 3'2" x 11.5" x 3.5"!! I had no idea how much kombu you get in 35 ounces (1 kg), until I saw this package. The actual package from Emerald Cove is 17" x 6.5" x 3" of 100% kombu. It will last for years if packaged correctly away from moisture.<br /><br />This package has 250 servings using a 1" x 4" piece. I am very happy because I pay almost $7 for a small 2.5 ounce package at my local natural foods store. I use kombu as a flavor additive in soups and stews, and for its rich sea mineral content of potassium, iodine and calcium -- unlike any other food. It does contain MSG naturally found in the sea, which enhances any food. Cooking with kombu doesn't add a fishy or seafood taste in the food - at all. It's surprising.<br /><br />The quality looks good for how I use it (which isn't for kelp salad). I'm very pleased with this purchase.

review/text: My husband and I love Emerald Cove sushi nori.  We eat it as a snack and digestion settler often (about 1 sheet a day each).  My husband steals out of my hand the first sheet I take, so I always have to go back for another.  He prefers its sweet toastiness greatly over the raw sushi nori.  Also, the price is excellent compared to the smaller pack prices or store-front shop prices.<br /><br />My only beef is that it comes from China, and I am concerned about the environmental quality during the growing process.  No guarantee there, though EC is a known brand.

review/summary: GREAT product at an affordable price!
review/text: Contrary to what the sugar industry would love us to believe, fructose is a MUCH healthier sweetener than sucrose (white table sugar, evaporated cane juice).  It is NOT the same as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS, by the way, has nearly the same molecular structure as sucrose at right around 50% glucose to 50% fructose ... so all of the health hazards announced with HFCS apply to sucrose as well ... this applies even the sneaky "evaporated cane juice", which tries to come off as a healthier sugar alternative). Glucose hits the bloodstream fast and hard, causing blood sugar to rise to very unhealthy levels, which then forces the body to release chemicals (insulin, adrenaline, etc) in order to try and bring blood sugar levels back to normal (this reaction is what causes "sugar highs and lows".  On the flip side, fructose sweeteners are processed by the organs and enter the blood stream slowly and steadily, as needed.  The ONLY time fructose carries health risks is when it's combined in the diet with the HEALTH-DESTRUCTIVE sweetener; sucrose! If you eliminate sucrose (common table sugar/evaporated cane juice) from your diet and replace it with a 100% fructose sweetener (fructose, agave nectar, fruit, fruit juice), you will get to enjoy MANY health benefits, some of which are: stable glucose levels, more balanced energy levels, lower cholesterol, cancer fighter (rather than being a cancer promoter like sucrose), etc.  I speak from the experience of many ... myself and my family included! My husband, prior to switching completely to fructose and staying completely away from sucrose, had type II diabetes, high cholesterol and his triglycerides were through the roof (over 900!!).  He was on medication for his diabetes, but didn't want to take Lipitor. Less than a year after we were married and he was completely away from sucrose, he was able to go off of his diabetes medication and his cholesterol and triglycerides were so low, his doctor stated "you just took one foot out of the grave and now have the cholesterol of a fit teen" Of course, common sense tells us that *all* sweets, even healthy sweets, need to be consumed in moderation ... too much of a good thing is still too much!<br />So don't buy into the fears that the sugar industry PAYS BIG BUCKS to breed ... buy into your health and enjoy this wonderful sweetener! It tastes like sugar and can be used just like sugar in recipes (you use about 25% less, so it's easier on the calories as well).

If you are following the Sugarbusters diet or diabetic in general - this will cause a sugar level issue - from the corn (starch converting to sugar) and the fructose together! Big problem!  There is nothing in online description to indicate this difference.  Found it on side panel of product when received.  The "100% granules" is misleading too - making it look like a natural product - it is not derived from 100% fruit sugar.  Do not buy if you are following a low-glycemic index diet.  Coordinating with Amazon to return.

review/summary: Very dangerous - research before you think about buying
review/text: I finally put pieces together -- why fructose had disappeared off any store shelves and I had to order it here, and also why they're having to advertise it on TV to try to turn back public perception.<br /><br />Fructose, and high-fructose corn syrup are proving to be very dangerous, causing many disruptive health problems. It's processed differently in the body than sucrose -- yes, our bodies CAN tell the difference -- and while they used to think that was good, they're now finding many ways in which it is bad.<br /><br />This is not returnable, so when I received my (2nd) order, I dumped it in the dumpster. It caused "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", intense intestinal swelling and distress, highly-elevated blood pressure, and other problems that indicate these warnings were getting more serious.<br /><br />If this is from corn and not fruit, it's even more dangerous. (Thank you, reviewer "Debe".) Really check this out through Google, etc., before considering adding it into your life.

review/summary: magnesium powder drink
review/text: This drink is easy to mix, tastes good and is very effective.  I was able to go off my current medication for irretable bowel syndrome and the leg cramps I have at night are gone.
