review/text: I've been using Gloria Jean's Coffees ever since I purchased the Keurig Brewer a year ago....her coffee is the best.  Have tried other brands to my dis-satisfaction. G.Jean's French Vanilla Supreme has a more distinct flavor as well as her Hazelnut flavor. They are my favorites by far. A better value as well as the quality of the coffee. I highly recommend Gloria Jean's Coffee...this sounds like a commercial:)

review/text: I was expecting this coffee to have a stronger vanilla taste - to taste more like a French Vanilla cappuccino.  I could barely taste the vanilla.  I added a little white chocolate syrup and it helped bring out the vanilla flavor a little more.  If you want a definite vanilla flavor I would suggest passing on this one.  Luckily I tried one from a variety pack I got with our machine before I opened the whole box I bought.  I will be returning the box.

review/text: This k-cup gives off a fine smell while brewing and tastes OK to me.  Unfortunately, due to the affect on our coffee pot while brewing, I cannot give this more than 1 star.  Every single time I brew one of these specific cups the machine displays "de-scale" plus clogs up and will not let the water run through the k-cup.  When this happens coffee comes out the top and makes a mess.

The flavored coffee's are a wonderful addition to the world. I could not live with out them. I have found that a splash of flavored cream is a very nice coffee house touch, without leaving the house, add some ice and waalah. Iced Coffee. I can't believe I am even the person endorsing this but yes it is me and yes I will continue to buy them.

My only gripes are in the packaging -- there are no larger bags (if you want more, you must buy a 12-pack case), and that each bag is more thick than necessary creating more garbage.  If you live in a progressive city, it may be recyclable, but I don't, unfortunately.  Otherwise it makes a healthy fruit snack and even a dessert.  It's one of my favourites, overall.

review/text: Got 8 cans all together however 5 of them were smashed to kingdom come. Possibly rejects from whatever store or company they came from. Luckily I know about Amazons great customer service and they were happy to make things right. They offered to send a replacement but since they were out of stock, they ended up giving me a full refund. I buy tons of things from Amazon and usually have a pleasant out come. However sometimes there are some blunders. Fortunately I know I can always contact Amazon and they will always make things right. Thanks Amazon! I &lt;3 thee.<br /><br />Now on the product itself. I have used many times. great for making all kinds of desserts. It is regular sweetened condensed milk. Not Dulce De Leche as pictured. However you can make your own Dulce De Leche by following the steps below.<br /><br />The product gets 5 stars because I like it. However because most of the order was damaged and useless I give it 3 stars. Confusing? Maybe but that's my story err rating and I'm sticking to it. ;)<br /><br />Dulce De Leche<br /><br />1 - 14 oz can of Sweetened Condensed Milk<br /><br />Fill a large stockpot with cold water. Remove the label from the can of milk, and do not open the can. Place the can in the center of the pot; be sure that the water completely covers the can.<br /><br />CAUTION: The can becomes pressurized when cooking, so for safety reasons, don't allow the water to boil vigorously. Simmer gently for about 1 1/2-2 hours for runny Dulce de Leche, or up to 4 hours for more solid consistency, adding more water, as necessary, when the water level decreases.<br /><br />Remove the can with tongs, and cool 15-20 minutes. Carefully pierce the top with a can opener. The tan or brown caramel will ooze slightly from the can when opening. Transfer to an air-tight container, with the lid off, to cool completely. Store refrigerated for up to two weeks.

review/summary: sugary residue in bottom of can
review/text: My order of these cans arrived in mint condition.  The issue I have with La Lechera sweetened condensed milk is that there is crunchy sugar that settles in the can.  This is the only brand of the canned milk that Amz was selling in bulk with Prime shipping, so I'll take it.  I use it for coffee.<br /><br />Also, I reported to Amazon that the photo with this product shows dulce de leche, which is an entirely different product.  They didn't change the pic, which makes me think they may be discontinuing the product.  Hope they find a replacement.  By the way, what I received was sweetened condensed milk, per the description, so all is well.

review/summary: Sweet Dairy Whey the secret to great gluten free bread
review/text: Bob's Red Mill sells another essential ingredient to perfect gluten free bread. Sweet dairy whey is essential for a successful loaf of gluten free bread -- it gives the bread that bouncy, supple texture that reminds you of real bread. There isn't much else to say about this product except, use it in your next gluten free bread recipe!

review/text: I'm not going to debate the merits of carob soy milk itself. You're probably on this web page because you know what it is and want to buy it. My only hesitation was whether this all would work out without any hassle. I've ordered twice--each time one box with 27 juice-box sized containers of soy milk--and it has worked without a hitch. It's cheaper than the store, and the post office brings it right to your door. What's not to like!

review/text: With Amazon's Subscribe & Save option these are well below $1 per package!  I am able to make 1/2 of the packet if I don't need the whole thing.  Just mix it with water in the pan and whisk while it comes to the boil and simmer for only one minute and I had tasty vegan gravy!  It was perfect on my Edward & Sons organic, vegan, gluten free Instant mashed potatoes!  What could be easier or better?<br /><br />They also have a good looking recipe on the back of the packet for a lentil loaf that I plan on trying.<br /><br />Now I can't wait to try Roads End Organic's Savory Herb and Shiitake Mushroom varieties!

review/text: I subscribe to the Road's End gravy packets because they are a great way to make a satisfying backpacking or camping meal - I can sautee up some fresh or re-hydrated veggies, add some gravy and eat them on top of instant mashed potatoes for a rich, filling meal.  The flavor is great & you don't have to use the whole pack - just roll down the top and save some for later.<br /><br />These gravy packets also make an excellent binder, to replace the UBI (you know - Campbell's cream of mushroom) in dishes like broccoli rice casserole (throw in a little Daiya cheese!).

review/text: I enjoyed and plan to buy more of this product.  So far I've only tried the savory herb.  Cooking it is simple and it thickens to a perfect consistency.  For me the flavor is too subtle so I have to use it along with other seasonings plus olive oil and yeast flakes.  Leftover gravy turns watery but is still useable depending on what you are putting it on.

review/text: The fact that it is organic is why I purchased it. The taste is somewhat bland, but the real kicker is that it is LOADED with commercial salt....not sea salt mind you.<br /><br />One serving (there are 4 per package) has 230mg! I don't eat that much commercial, overly processed, white table salt in a month! In fact, I get my Himalayan pink crystal salt from Amazon....and this stuff not only tastes great, it is a wonderful food for the body.<br /><br />Serves me right for not checking closer into the ingredients.

I don;t always want to take time/effort, so on those times I use these mixes.

review/text: Make no mistake about it - these truffles are utterly delicious.  Because my diet is free of things like cane sugar, gluten, grain, eggs (I could go on), I long since forgot about how blissful something chocolately and a little sweet can be.<br /><br />These truffles are made with cacao, coco butter, and agave.  They are sweet but not too sweet.  The peppermint is just enough to feel in my nose.  The consistency is creamy and dense.  The label says one serving is two truffles, but I have been very happy with 1/4 to 1/2 of one truffle at a time.  They are rich.<br /><br />The ingredient list was short enough to inspire me to duplicate the product at home.  I've gotten pretty close, and making them at home is far less expensive.  If it weren't for the price, I would give these five stars.

review/summary: good cereal but has box design flaws
review/text: I keep buying this cereal, and then wondering if I should buy it again, only because I absolutely HATE the design of the box.  If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy.

review/text: I really love Earths Best, and have used only EB to feed my little one.  This cereal is great, except I would switch back to plain flavor after this box is done.  The banana flavor had a weird smell to it when mixed with the formula (similac alimentum), and also if you're giving it in every bottle, then it can constipate your baby.  So as for EB regular cereal we LOVE it, but the banana flavor not so much.

review/text: The actual cereal is fine, but why on Earth do I need individual packets of it?  I thought I was buying the large box (like the one I bought at Whole Foods).  Instead it was 12 boxes containing individual packets of cereal.  Obviously I should have read the description more closely, but I'm sleep deprived.  The carbon footprint on this is just insane!

review/summary: Desparate for Chocolate Egg Cream
review/text: This is the ONLY chocolate syrup with which to make a chocolate egg cream, and living in Anguilla, I can't get it unless someone brings or sends it to me. So I spent the money and bought six bottles. But it is too expensive. The price should be no more than US$4.00/20 oz. bottle. I won't buy more from this seller until the price goes way down.<br /><br />Packaging was very good, speed of delivery was very good.

review/summary: The Real Deal for Chocolate Egg Creams
review/text: New Yorkers will know what a Chocolate Egg Cream is: No Egg, no cream, really an Ice Cream Soda without the ice cream. This is the traditional chocolate syrup to use in a Chocolate Egg Cream. The only way to get the authentic taste. There are cheaper sources on the Web for this product.

review/summary: Surprising chocolate flavor
review/text: What a surprise!  Was given a gift of one bottle recently.  Fantastic chocolate flavor.  Great on ice cream.  It is thinner than you might expect but don't let that fool you.  Very complex flavor and very chocolate good taste.  I'm a chocoholic and this satisfies.<br /><br />We also topped chocolate mousse with a bit of u-bet and it was terrific.  Still experimenting on other desserts but so far it is a keeper.<br /><br />A friend is visiting and she flipped too.  She wants to order a case!

review/summary: It's Kosher, Organic, and Minimally Packaged with Awesome Flavor!
review/text: I have tried many a rooibois, and this one tops the list. It's kosher, certified organic, packaged with an extremely minimal amount of non-recyclable material and the best-tasting of the rooibois teas in teabags I have found anywhere. The only way to improve upon this is to buy it in bulk, directly from the africanredteacompany itself in Los Angeles. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great Container!
review/text: My baby has been getting rice cereal in her bottle since 3 1/2 months of age due to acid reflux. The added rice cereal helps keep her food down and adds calories to her diet. Now, at 8 months, she stil gets cereal in her bottle, but also with her solids.<br /><br />The container is perfect!! The boxes are a total mess, the tubs are much cleaner, and a fresher product as it is vacuum packed. I still buy the boxes if they are on sale, but I just pour it in the cans. So much easier. I use a measuring spoon and just leave it in the can. So convenient!!

review/text: Excellent Jerky! Just as flavorful as any other Jerky without all the Preservatives.  It's well worth the extra cost to get an all natural beef jerky that actually tastes better than the major brands without MSG, Nitrates, etc... I highly recommend it if your a Jerky fan like me..

review/text: 10 pounds of jelly beans is a huge amount, so this is a pretty good deal. As has been the case for some time, Jelly Belly just nails the flavors of their beans. This one tastes exactly like a root beer, very delicious, I reccommend! Also check out the other root beer flavored cnady sold at Amazon.

review/text: I work with fondant a lot and I use to buy just white then color it, but that takes a lot of time, is messy, and the colors always turn out different. I discovered Fondarific and I love it!! They have tons of different colors and different flavors. This is a perfect red color! It takes tons of dye to get a true perfect red color and this gives me that perfect color without using a whole bottle of red dye. I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses red fondant often.

review/summary: Bad Quality
review/text: I bought the product and several flavor extracts from their actual website.  I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same frustrations for lack of information.  The extracts I received are so far off from the intended flavors that I doubt the solution's even edible.  The site claims natural flavors.  These were destroying all my senses.  Let's start with the vanilla, probably the most common extract people use.  Their excuse was every company has different flavors.  I've shopped for vanilla extracts from so many<br />different companies, natural, imitation, etc.  The faerie finest one I got was WORSE than the WORST POSSIBLE IMITATION vanilla.  I<br />called them to explain and ask for a refund.  I can understand where shipping cannot be reimbursed for those who mis-<br />ordered.  Unfortunately the INFLATED shipping costs cannot be reimbursed even if you're extremely unsatisfied with the<br />products, even though I was willing to ship it back to them out of my own pocket.  So the products I got will be going<br />into the garbage.  This has destroyed my confidence in shopping with them.  BE VERY WARY!! I don't want someone else to<br />have to go through the same frustrations I did.  I know it's cheap and very tempting, but for me, it was still a WASTE OF MONEY because the products I received are COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.

review/summary: Bad tasting
review/text: When I first opened the bottle it smelled medicinal. I added it to some iced tea and it tasted just like it smelled, very medicinal and only a trace of fruit flaver. I ordered 2 other flavors and they're the same. I gave it an extra star because service is good, but I can't recommend the extract.

review/text: I own a candy and fudge shop at a tourist location. We make our own homemade fudge and we use these extracts and flavorings.  Our customers absolutely LOVE our fudge, and come from all over the country to get it. Locals drive over an hour just to come get our fudge.  I wouldn't use any other extracts - these work perfect for what we make.  We consistently use the raspberry and strawberry flavors, and they are great.

review/text: I liked the price of this extract and champagne flavoring is not the easiest to find.  I opened the bottle.. and it smelled off- kind of sickly sweet and medicinal.  The taste was incredibly far from any champagne flavoring I have ever tried- disgusting.  Don't waste your money-

review/summary: OMG!! Is this ever good!
review/text: A pouch of Taco Bell Taco Seasoning will transform a pound or so of ground beef or turkey into the best burgers you ever tasted in your life! (Great with browned onions on top!) No need for ketchup or mustand -- they are just amazing on their own!<br /><br />I also use it for a fabulous taco salad dip. Mix it with whipped cream cheese and low-fat sour cream. On the bottom of a serving bowl I spread no-fat refried beans (the regular kind contains lard!!) Over the beans I spread the taco-cream mix, and on top of that I generously sprinkle sliced black olives, diced tomato, shredded lettiuce, shredded low-fat or fat-free cheddar. Put out whatever chips you like to go with it, and it is great!<br /><br />This is an excellent product with lots of versatility. It tastes wonderful, so use your imagination and come up with your own origianl recipes!

review/summary: summertime and taco salad
review/text: I bought this on sale cheaper than I could buy at the dollar store. And, no tax or shipping. I use a lot of this in the summer for my taco salad.<br />1 Pk of soften cream cheese mixed with 1 Pk of taco seasoning. Spread thin on a large plate and top with lots of lettuce, shredded cheese, finely chopped onions, sliced black olives, and salsa. Serve with taco chips for scooping. It's great for a crowd and is always a hit.

review/text: We currently don't live close to a Taco Bell.  I bought this seasoning in an effort to try and capture that Taco Bell taste in my own Tacos.  This definitely did the trick.  It's fast.  It's easy.  My husband immediately commented how amazing dinner smelled.  I highly recommend this seasoning.  I like to keep my cabinents stocked.  This is also more cost effective than going out to eat every night.

Great for soft tacos,taco salads or just crunchy tacos.........Recommend 5/5 stars. Taco bell taste at home...How delicious!
