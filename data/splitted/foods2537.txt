review/summary: Love the Sweetener but NOT the Price. Suggest: Simpler packaging.
review/text: A friend recommended this natural sweetener. It is as described. I don't taste an aftertaste.<br /><br />However, I had to be careful opening packets, due to the product "caking" or hardening slightly inside the pack. I almost lost half the pack when this initially happened; and at the price I paid for it, I was not happy.<br /><br />The main issue I have with Swerve is the price. It's very expensive, compared to other sweeteners! I think that the fancy packaging is nice but I wish they would have chosen simpler, more economical packaging to make the cost more consumer-friendly. I actually limit how much I use because of the price. Something I never have to do with other (albeit unappealing) sugar substitutes.<br /><br />If the price were lower, I would have bought more packages and tried the confectioner's version, too. I would also buy it often -to bake with, without breaking the bank. If you are the maker of this great product, please consider this review. Simpler packaging is better; then, one day it might appear in natural groceries and supermarkets everywhere.<br /><br />Update: As much as I like this product, I can't bring myself to buy more of it, due to the high cost in comparison with other natural sweeteners. 12.99 + 5.45 shipping = almost $20 for 1 lb of Swerve. Yikes!

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: At last a sweetener with hardly any of that nasty aftertaste! There is a very slight aftertaste but not the same as the others.  (It is acceptable in my opinion!) Sweetens like sugar, only slightly sweeter, so don't use quite as much.  This Swerve product is too expensive, which is my only real complaint, which is why I rated 4 stars and not 5.

review/text: I was excited to try this product with it's claims of no after taste. Thought i might not have to use as much either, as erythritol, to get same sweet taste. Seemed about the same, as far as how much i has to use to make my tea as sweet as i like it. Maybe I have way different tastbuds than the other reviewers but i did find that it has an aftertaste compared to just plain old erythritol. I will def go back to using that and sorry I wasted $12.99 plus $4.99(!!!!!!) shipping to try this. The granules were all caked together as well, while straight erythritol is not.

review/summary: Great Treats for Training and Interactive Toys
review/text: These treats are fantastic not only for training, but for most interactive toys. A lot of interactive toys have size constraints, and larger treats won't fit. These fit in just about every (I say "just about" because I'm sure there's a toy out there somewhere that won't work) interactive toy there is.<br /><br />They're on the small side, so they will work well for most puppies too.<br /><br />We buy every flavor for our three dogs, and they seem to like the Cheddar and Liver flavors the best.<br /><br />I would note these treats would probably be categorized as "mid-value". They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them. However, if you're working with a fearful dog (which tend to be too anxious to take any sort of treat outside of meat or cheese), these may not work. Every dog is different, and you would have to see what your dog likes in stressful situations.<br /><br />Two of our three dogs have sensitive stomachs, and they have had no problems with these (any flavor).

review/summary: A good little nugget
review/text: Fact: your dog loves cheese.<br />Fact: your dog probably shouldn't eat as much cheese as he would like to.<br />Fact: you would like your dog to do absurdly adorable things on command, but there's gotta be something in it for him.<br />Result: buy a cheese treat that won't result in your dog weighing more than you do!<br /><br />These are high-quality on the ingredients/flavor side, and they don't crumble easily while still being chewy.  They're bigger than some other training treats, so I break them in half for medium/small breeds.  I do this with my thumbnail, which is not too hard to do (though it does result in my thumb being licked to death on occasion).<br /><br />With dogs who are fans of cheese (of which there are many), this often proves an acceptable substitute.  The strong smokey cheddar aroma really gets them going.  You can tell there's real cheese in here.  A few dogs prefer real meat, and don't get as excited about these.  It's all about knowing your dog and his tastes.  If you find pieces of cheddar or colby cheese go over really big with your canine, then these will be a big hit during training sessions.  If chicken and jerky is more how he rolls, these may not excite him as much.<br /><br />Buying 2 bags at once, while a bargain, is a big gamble.  My advice is to take a piece of real human cheese to your dog (a smallish one) and see what he does.  These treats truly are analogous to cheese.

review/summary: Stinky (good for the dog), but not sticky (good for me)
review/text: This is not the highest value treat for my dog; cheese and chicken will forever be favorites. But...these are much cleaner (no greasy fingers) and more convenient. Of the pre-prepared treats (we have tried a variety, but Zukes was one we used a lot), these are the best. Some of the Zukes "soft" treats are like little pebbles, but every bag of the Trickys have been very soft and easy to break apart.<br /><br />The scent is strong for the cheddar, which I think is part of the reason Piper likes them so much; though, you may want to go for the liver flavor if you are looking for a more discreet treat.<br /><br />My only problem is the same one I have had with all pre-prepared treats: they are too big! Each treat is only slightly larger than a pea, but I have a small dog, so I have to at least break them in half so he doesn't fill up. I wish they came in different sizes, because I would love one that is about 1/4 the size of these.

review/text: Been taking Stevia in the Raw for over 3 months believing it would be healthier for me considering diabetes runs in my family.  Well foolish me got sucker by Stevia in the Raw.  In small print the word DEXTROSE.  What is Dextrose?  Is a HIGH Glycemic Index, fast absorbing carbohydrate derived from corn.  Percentage of Corn - Genetically Modified. And how about the HIGH GLYCEMIC INDEX, not good for diabetics.  Definately not purchasing this again.  Also from what've read Truvia is no better - alcohol sugars.  Guess back to the drawing board.  Hopefully I can find a product that only has STEVIA and no other ingredrients.

review/summary: You'll need 3 or more packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.
review/text: First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase "You get what you pay for" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like the same company's SUGAR in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't "in the raw". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose.<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled "raw" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it. Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself "raw" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think "Woo Hoo! I get more for less!" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter. I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too. Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.

review/summary: Poor Quality COntrol
review/text: Stevia based sweeteners have now proliferated like dandelions. This product was available locally and was on sale so I tried it.<br /><br />Their quality control is abysmal. At times it takes one package to sweeten tea or hot cereal. Then there are other times when it takes three packets to achieve the same sweetness. Same beverage and same hot cereal but some packets just don't have the same amount of the Stevia extract in them.<br /><br />A second problem is that this product tends to clump. It will dissolve OK but the clumping is quite noticable. I would recommend that you look at the reviews and then select some other Stevia based sweetener. I WOULD NOT buy this product again.

review/summary: The best of the faux "stevia" products (Truvia, PureVia).
review/text: I've never had any problems with Stevia Extract In The Raw except for the fact that I found out that the product is actually yet another fake "stevia" product comprising mostly of corn sugar with a little dash of stevia extract thrown in so the makers can legally call it a stevia product. I have gone back to the tried and true Stevita Supreme brand stevia powder. Four boxes of Stevita Supreme bought on here (shipping included) was about the same price that I would pay for buying four boxes of Stevia Extract In The Raw at my local Kroger, and the Stevita Brand is actually a better product. If you want REAL stevia, go with Stevita Supreme. Stevia Extract In Thr Raw is the best of the faux "stevia" products you see in the stores and hasn't given me the gastrointestinal side effects that Truvia and PureVia give me.

review/summary: A Good Supermarket Product Worth Trying
review/text: I recently tried Stevia In The Raw because I found it at my local Supermarket at a more reasonable price than my favorite NuNaturals NuStevia brand.  It isn't as sweet as NuStevia, but I don't feel the need to use more than 2 packets for my tea or coffee.  It doesn't leave an after taste, unlike PureVia, and Truvia takes more to sweeten the way I like.  I like the fact that it's easier to buy locally; it keeps me from buying the artificial sweeteners carried by most Supermarket stores, (when I can't get to a natural foods store).  I am on my 4th box, and I have not found any problem with clumping as some of the other reviewers have; I live in a humid climate, (sea level), we have a lot of moisture problems here.  If you can't buy Stevia products locally, it's nice to know Amazon carries it.  I hope this review helps you decide.

review/summary: It's not real sugar so what's the problem?!
review/text: I'm reading all these reviews and I feel like I needed to add something in here. Who are you people who are making these cups of coffee and adding 3 or 4 fake sugar packets in them?! Are you adding some Coffee mate creamer with hydrogenated soybean oil in it too?! I mean REALLY, I don't get it. If you WANT the SUGAR in your coffee than add REAL SUGAR. 1 teaspoon of sugar is only 15 calories. You can burn that off by making your eyeballs move across the screen to read this!!<br /><br />I've used this product for a quite a while now, always bought it at the grocery store- which for here in town it runs about $3.50/50 packet box. Sometimes I can get it on sale for $2.78 and I stock up- so I'm not sure why the price here on Amazon is so high.  This is a great alternative to all the chemical sweeteners on the market. I am totally against aspartame, splenda, nutrasweet, sweet & low, and all the others. The sugar alcohols make you have loose stools, and your body does not know how to even process the artificial sugars. If you are going to be using this product and STILL using those "other" products (remember they are HIDDEN in HUNDREDS of foods out there!!! it's CHEAPER to use a chemical than a REAL food product like sugar) you are definately going to "notice" the taste because those other chemicals you are still eating are labratory tested and made to SPECIFICALLY "excite" your tastebuds.<br /><br />If you have finally made the decision to cut all that processed GARBAGE out of your diet and focus on using WHOLE foods you will LOVE this product. I try not to eat foods that require an ingredient list. However, I do like to bake and make homemade lemonaide with lots of sugar. I have found that 2 QTS water + 1 C lemon juice + 8 packets of Stevia in the Raw makes the best lemonaide. I like the acidity of it so I like how it tastes. I also have used these packets in conjunction with real sugar in a few recipies. I will substitute out maybe 1/4 - 1/3 of the sugar for Stevia in the raw packets and had great results! I go by 24 packets = 1 cup of sugar, so do the math and try it in your next recipe and see what you think. Definately would not substitute out more than 1/3rd of the called for sugar in the recipe though or your baked goods will not rise properly.<br /><br />I hope that this review will help someone. Like I said before, if you've committed to a lifestyle change you will not notice the aftertaste, but if you are still eating those foods with hidden sucralose and aspartame you definitely will. BIG difference with sucROse and sucRALose. Do yourself a favor and invest time in researching this for your health. :)

review/summary: Dangerous, do not give to kids!
review/text: I started buying these candies recently because my dentist told me to stop chewing gum. I usually have one driving home from work. The other day I was waiting for my husband to go out to dinner and I was starving so I had three. Big mistake. The third one burnt my tongue. Literally took the skin off. My tongue bled while I slept that night, I woke up with a throat coated with blood. Then it scabbed over and now the scabs are slowly peeling away, so I have dead skin kind of hanging off the middle of my tongue that I am afraid to remove because I don't want to start bleeding again.<br /><br />I've never in my life had this happen with any other candy. I recommend staying away from these!!!!

review/summary: Great Soup Starter...
review/text: ...virus and flu have been rampant here since the SPRING. The homefront grew tired of the old Chicken Noodle Soup standby. I needed something I could use to add fresh or frozen veggies and leftovers to make something quick and nutritious. This also is great for making soup from "almost" scratch. It's good as a veggie broth. It really comes in handy to cook rice instead of using salt for flavoring.<br /><br />Although a good product the pricing makes a BIG difference,I got it for 26 bucks.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 STARS due to it's high sodium content, it is a bit salty - 1 teaspoon = 41% of your DAILY salt intake.  The two pack will hold me over for awhile.

I have yet to find a hot cocoa that we even like.  My kids actually dislike the flavor of the Swiss Miss.  When I tasted, I thought we bought the sugar free by mistake, but no - it stinks.  I wasted several k cups attempting to see if the size of the cup mattered.  Yuck.  We will just go back to packets and hot water for cocoa.  Someone has to break the hot cocoa barrier for k cups.

review/summary: Why buy it when it's so easy to make yourself?
review/text: Never thought I would see people actually buying simple syrup. They're paying $7 for sugar water.<br /><br />For $7 you can go out and buy yourself 15+ pounds of sugar and get water for free out of the tap and have all you'll ever need. Pour two parts water in a pot for every one part granulated sugar. Turn the pot on medium and stir until the sugar is dissolved, which takes maybe a few minutes if you're making a large batch. Wait for it to cool, then pour it into the container of your choice. It keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator as long as it is tightly capped.

review/summary: Good Quality, Best Deal
review/text: I searched online for some good quality Pu-Erh tea and sifted through a large number of sites.  They varied much in price and ease of ordering.  Usually the best deals required me buy in larger bulk than I wanted to and to trust some site with my credit card that I did not want to risk.  I usually prefer to order through Amazon these days, because my transaction feels more secure and I can buy from many companies while only entrusting my card to one company.  2 pounds is an amazingly large amount of tea and was competitive with the price per a pound of bigger bulk orders.  It will last me a long time.  The Pu-Erh tea from this company is fermented, as far as I can tell, by the traditional method, but is somewhat younger than some of the more aged versions that I encountered online and the more aged version that I got from the local Asian market here.  That the version is less aged is admitted to in the company description of their own product.  I like this kind of full disclosure (I also found the company to be prompt in their delivery, even with super saver shipping, which can sometimes be slower than the usual paid standard delivery, they were about medium speed, not the fastest, but within 10 days).<br /><br />I mainly got the Pu-Erh tea because of its reputation as a "chi tonic".  I did find this version to preserve what I feel are the medicinal properties that I valued and therefore it compares favorably to the more aged versions.  I can feel what I call the "chi effect" after drinking a cup, feeling some subtle energies move more easily through my body and my sinuses passages open more to allow deeper breathing.  I found a bonus with Pu-Erh tea that I am gently losing some pounds and moving toward by ideal weight more easily.  I found that this weight loss effect was mentioned in some write ups about Pu-Erh tea on the internet, but I generally did not give this kind of assertion any strong belief or disbelief.  Happy to say, this one seems to really work for me in this regard.  I have been focusing on a diet to help me move toward my ideal weight already, but found the progress slower.  After taking Pu-Erh tea about 3 times a day, the pounds are coming off and staying off (about one pound every one or two weeks).  I am sure part of the results is due to my diet and also to "Kapha Tea" (Ginger, Clove, Dill Seed, and Fenugreek, roughly equal amounts with one tablespoon in two cups of water, lightening up on the cloves if too strong) by Patti Garland (a more detailed recipe can be found online by putting the name of the tea into a search engine and finding the Aryurvedic chef mentioned).  But I did not make easy and consistent progress before Pu-Erh was added.  I sweeten my tea with some drops of Stevia, an extract of a leaf that tastes a little like anise or a mild licorice.  I like this better than the artificial sweeteners that I suspect are brain excito-toxins or the variations of white sugar which put a load on our insulin.<br /><br />Just as an FYI to those who are interested in getting similar results, I drank a cup or two of Pu-Erh tea in the morning, before eating anything and would wait until it moved through my system (going to the bathroom) before eating any food.  My diet is vegan, relatively free of processed food, fried food, grain, sugar, and flour products, and gluten free, with an emphasis on leafy greens, especially kale, baby bok choy, and collards, with organic firm non-GMO tofu, garbanzos, pinto beans, black beans, and peas as my protein sources.  I am not saying that the same diet would work for anyone else, but I though giving some sense of my diet may help others to decide what might work for them.  I found it was also important to identify "addictive foods" and avoid them.  I do not mean the usual kind of addictions, but the kinds with "brain hijackers" that induce a craving to have more, most of them have a lot of salt, sugar, and/or starch and the worse seem to have MSG (which can be disguised as natural flavor, autolyzed yeast, or hydrolyzed vegetable protein, many companies are clearly mentioning when they do not have it on their labels), and all of them are processed foods.  I have actually been noticing the "hijack effect" and it is even keyed into the advertisements.  It is like we are trained to want them, both by pictures and chemistry.  It was a shock to notice how well they worked on me until I noticed what was going on.  It think it is easier for any diet to work once this is noticed.  It requires a little discipline to resist, but not too much.

review/summary: Love it or hate it
review/text: Pu'Erh tea is one of those things that you either love or hate. It has an earthy, peat-moss sort of flavor due to its oxidation and fermentation. While it certainly seems like tea, there is no other tea that it tastes like, just like bleu cheese does not taste like milk. One reason why it is so expensive it that it is processed and aged by people who have specialized knowledge and training. Again, in this regard, pu'erh tea is like the product of a skilled vintner, which does not necessarily mean that everyone will prefer the aged Cabernet over Welch's grape juice. Because it is both a unique taste and quite expensive, I would recommend trying a small sample first before diving in to the 2-pound bag.<br />This particular product is a fine example of pu'erh, however, and is delicately earthy without tasting like compost.<br />I find it is excellent when mixed with other flavors, such as cardamom and Chinese Five Spices (available at most supermarkets and other places where spices are sold), making a fine spiced tea beverage. This pu'erh also goes well when mixed with peppermint and cinnamon.

I brew it hot for the first two times and a cold final brew, and the cold brew is the best! You get three steeps out of this tea and I think the second and the third are the best, so make sure you tap into that.<br /><br />I recommend trying a high quality chocolate (a little goes a long way) with this tea, delicious + the health benefits.<br /><br />Last thing I'll say is that you can drink this tea all day, hungry, full etc... and it won't give you stomach aches (or at least that's the case for me), which isn't the case for any other tea.

review/summary: Healthy Cooking
review/text: I use this brand of olive oil when I'm cooking, as it's the healthiest oil to use, period. Olive oil is monounsaturated fat, which contains fewer hydrogen atoms than saturated fats. Hydrogen atoms are responsible for fats becoming solid at room temperature. Since we often have to line our cooking pans with something in order to effectively cook, olive oil is my oil of choice. Olive oil can help reduce the LDL or "bad" cholesterol in our blood, as long as we're using it in place of saturated fats. Using Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a guilt-free way to cook. Also try this olive oil for dipping (along with cracked black pepper) with Italian breads, or anything else that suits your taste.

review/text: I have used extra virgin olive oil for years and bertolli is my favorite. I am a vegeterian and use it regularly in my cooking for making stews and in virtually any recipe that calls for oil. I add a few drops while cooking brown rice not only to prevent the grains from sticking together but also to reduce the tendency of sediments to form under the rice cooker cover which may block the steam vent. It is particularly great for making salad dressing. It has a peculiar friuty taste.<br /><br />Note that you may get a better deal at your local walmart or Kroger unless you're lucky to cash it when amazon offers it directly. It is a little expensive to buy it from the marketplace sellers at the current listed price of $26.88 plus shipping.

I actually purchased 18 boxes (3 cases), 6 each of the 3 flavors and I had to open all 18 boxes to just get enough "whole" crackers for my guests (8 people) for Thanksgiving appetizers.  I could only get about 6-8 crackers per box that were not broken literally into crumbs.  I did, however, contact the factory and they were very apologetic and said they will address the problem and offered to send me additional boxes.  Hopefully these will arrive in better condition and they will get the problem resolved, because I would love to keep purchasing these crackers.

They also pack smaller individual bags in one box, so you don't have to try to finish one big bag all at once.  They seem to stay fresh and crunchy for quite some time after the bag has been opened, and the taste doesn't seem to change much, either.

review/text: I just got these crackers in a sample pack from blissmobox and WOW they are really really good. I don't like rye flavor so I thought I wouldn't like these but my husband said I had to try them and he was right, I don't taste the rye hardly at all and they are really tasty. I plan on buying them off Amazon now.

review/text: I love rye.  Several years ago I always purchased rye crackers in a grocery store and they were discontinued.  I thought these might be similar and they are not.  They do not even taste like rye.  Also they are very very hard.  Do not waste your money.  I am giving them away or throwing the other boxes out.

review/summary: Tasty, fresh, and convenient!
review/text: A lot of gluten-free baked goods and snack bars are just awful, but not these!  These are the best I've tasted, hands down.<br />My favorite is the cranberry cookie... sooooo good.  All three varieties are moist and taste very fresh and wholesome.  The seller is very sweet, and included a handwritten note and a few bonuses:  Free snack bars to try!  The chocolate Bar is simply to die for.  I am back today to order more cookies, AND some Bars.<br /><br />Not only am I thrilled to find high quality and GOOD TASTING gluten-free treats, I appreciate the company's personal service, and their commitment to using only high-quality ingredients and treating them gently besides.  This is good food made by real people.  I'll be buying these again and again.

review/summary: Defective!
review/text: I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.

Try Superior Nut thru Amazon instead; they packed them right and it arrived perfect!

review/text: This is a spicy dal, a mixture of black gram lentils and red kidney beans. It's a good quick meal heated up and served on rice. It's fairly spicy--not overbearingly so, but spicy enough for some heat.<br /><br />The first time I had Dal Makhani was in Mumbai at a very fine restaurant and they cooked it in a tandoor where it took on the most intense smoky flavor. I toss in a few drops of liquid smoke to remind me of that incredible dal.<br /><br />Nice for camping trips. A bag of boil-in rice, and you have a decent quick meal.<br /><br />UPDATE: Someone pointed out that you cannot see the nutritional label here, so I've copied the ingredients:<br /> Tomato, black gram, water, onions, red kidney beans, hydrog. veg oil from sunflower, rice bran, soybean, palm and sesame, butter, milk, bengal gram dal, green chili, garlic, green gram, ginger, red chili, cumin, coriander, and fenugreek.

review/text: I can't praise the Solid Gold products enough! My dogs love all of the Solid Gold products. A couple of years ago, I switched to Solid Gold Hund-n-Flocken because of allergy problems my shepherds had. The dogs had previously been on Science diet for years - but I wanted an organic food that was corn free. I tried many organic dog foods - but the dogs would not even touch the food, until I found Hund-n-Flocken. The dogs love it and their allergies have greatly decreased (ear infections, itching, etc.) since they have been on the food.

review/text: I have 2 dogs a Jack Russel and a Puggle, Both of them developed serious diarrhea on another food.<br />I like to think I take exceptional care of my dogs and the vet agrees (I have the fittest puggle she sees), So when we starting having the issues the vet asked what I was feeding them. After close inspection of the ingredients I was horrified.<br />Not only did I have to look up most ingredients due to purposefully misleading names but on the top was corn many grains and chicken meals, and even though it said meat was the first ingredient Ive found that the way they legally can claim that is that is by taking the weight of the meat when hydrated but of course its 80% water so the real meat content was likely at the bottom of the list.<br />After starting this food the dogs LOVE it and its healthy, stools went from nasty smelly black to a tan color much like the food. My Jack Russel has also been much more agreeable due to not being in discomfort and he has also put on more weight in muscle even though Im busier and they get slightly less exercise than in the past.

review/text: Been buying roasted beans from this company for several years so have a great deal of trust in the quality. The Nicaraguan SHG beans roast up beautifully with normal chaffing. The flavors are subtle so don't expect to be bowled over by the boldness. It's great either by itself as a well-balanced cup or mixed with a bolder bean for a totally different taste. I like mixing with a Rwanda or Sumatra bean or just experimenting with multiple combos. Can't go wrong with this one!

review/summary: Perfect size, convenient
review/text: For 90 calories, this bar is super convenient and the perfect size to keep in the glove box, purse or cooler for a quick snack to carry me over between meals....not too filling, but again, it's perfect to hold me off for an hour till the next 'real' meal.

review/summary: Great for a snack
review/text: These are a great little snack. It's sweet and portion size, plus low in calories. Unfortunately I discovered (after buying 12 boxes) that the mysterious asthma/allergy problems were due to these little snacks. Other than that, I love... loved them. I'm not trying to lose weight or anything, so I don't know if they really help that or not, but when it comes to wanting a sweet without paying the consequences in calories, these are definitely great.

review/summary: Delicious, Healthy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY Better than Nutrisystem
review/text: I spent a great deal of money on NutriSystem to try and lose weight.  Unfortunately, the taste was not worth the money.  These bars offered a great alternative - less fat, less calories and GREAT taste.<br />These are definitely going on my Amazon subscription list.

review/summary: Great Little Snack...But only on sale!
review/text: In my opinion these are better tasting than your average "100 calorie pack" and ten less cals. They remind me of rice crispy treats, with a little more body and a little less crunch. The drizzle on top adds a nice flavor note. At regular Amazon price they're quite pricey.

review/summary: Avoid like the plague
review/text: I tried one of these for breakfast one morning and my stomach regretted it a mere 2 hours later. This food is literally indigestible and is extrenely dangerous if you're at work and away from home while suddenly having to deal with an unexpected case of indigestion. Avoid at all costs.

review/summary: Mild chocolate and coffee flavor
review/text: I am crazy about chocolate and raspberry, so this really appealed to me.  (I even put fat free chocolate milk in my regular decaf in the AM.)  This coffee has a milder chocolate flavor than that does.  I also like a very strong coffee, and this is milder than that which is why I gave it 4 stars.  If you want a somewhat mild coffee and somewhat mild chocolate raspberry flavor than this is for you.

review/summary: Rich Flavor, Low Calories
review/text: Lately I've been really getting into espresso, and this small espresso-based energy drink comes as close to the taste of the real thing as is possible for a drink of this kind. It's very light (only 10g of sugars, no fat, no dairy and only 50 calories), and it's very bitter as compared to some other similar beverages. For instance, the 6.5 ounce can of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI">Starbucks DoubleShot</a> contains 17g of sugar, 6g of fat, and 140 calories. Even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W4AF3G">Starbucks Doubleshot Light</a> has 6g of sugar, 4g of fat and 70 calories. In terms of caffeine per serving, illy's espresso drink has about 155 mg as opposed to 130 for the Sturbucks drinks.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you want a strong, light, European-style espresso drink than illy's issimo is a great choice. However, if you enjoy smoother, more filling taste then check out the Starbucks' DoubleShots.

review/summary: illy issimo caff&egrave;
review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/summary: excellent choice
review/text: This isn't really an "energy drink" per se as it contains no guarana, ginseng, b-vitamins, etc.  It's a cold coffee beverage, best savored over ice (not chugged quickly from the can).<br />But as long as it's very cold, it's great.  Just enough sweetness, and a quality espresso flavor.  My favorite of the refrigerated options.

review/text: Great taste even though quite salty which is easily fixed by....take some buds out of the main jar and put into another container (jar) without the brine. Then add distilled water enough to cover the buds. Put a lid on the container. Keep refridgerated of course.<br />In a few days the extra salt will leach out into the distilled water making a less salty brine and less salty capers. They still taste great. (btw the very salty brine keeps the capers fresh longer anyway so it ends up a bonus.) I always keep them refridgerated after opening.
