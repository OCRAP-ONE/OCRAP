review/text: Sure these tea bags dont come with a string on them but that cuts cost and its more eco friendly. I use a spoon to dig them out and to mix with some milk and sugar, ice for a tasty drink. The taste reminds me of grass jelly which I love so its a no brainer that this is my favorite tea drink.

review/text: Superb tea at a fantastic price. My only complaint *used* to be that once you remove the cellophane wrapper, the box is not sealed. But now the tea comes packed in a ziplock bag to keep it fresh. And they didn't even change the price!<br /><br />In the morning and evening I drink it with milk and sugar, like a latte. At work I drink it with sugar, no milk.<br />Has a rich red color and an excellent taste that does not become bitter if it steeps a long time.

review/summary: Very good quality for the price
review/text: I use a very large mug for tea, and after reading some reviews I worried that using two bags would offset the low price. There is no need for two bags. Red tea doesn't contains the tannins that cause bitterness if left to brew too long, so it's fine to leave the bag in the cup. I feel it's perfectly full flavored.<br />I really appreciate Davidsons commitment to organic farming methods, and that is another reason I will continue to buy this tea.

Not only did the first two orders not arrive (one somehow got lost in the mail, and the other was damaged during shipping, which they never notified me about; I found out by calling Amazon several weeks later), but for the third order, they sent me Earl Grey tea, instead of Rooibos tea. I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it, so I kept it, but the people who process these orders seriously need to get their act together.

review/summary: Needs some doctoring, but makes a good couple of meals
review/text: For the price I paid (with Subscribe & Save and another discount), I'm pretty happy with my order of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317H994">Tiger Tiger Black Bean Sauce with Cantonese Fried Brown Rice , 19.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (FAR happier than with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317F5KO">Tiger Tiger Sweet & Sour with Cantonese Fried Brown Rice, 19.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>, which has a thin sauce that I've not yet been able to doctor to my taste, though it seems to get a bit better if the leftovers sit in the fridge for a couple of days, and the all-vegetable version was much better than my second attempt that included shrimp).<br /><br />In addition to the sauteed thinly sliced chicken breast, garlic, grated fresh ginger, onions, carrots, broccoli, sweet peppers, and cherry tomatoes which I prepared before adding the sauce, I found that I needed to add a pinch of brown sugar, a few shakes of toasted sesame oil, and some hot pepper (I used ground cayenne) in order to brighten up the flavor.<br /><br />With those additions (the fresh gingerroot, sesame oil, and cayenne, at least, seem particularly necessary to me -- I wouldn't want to try to make this dish without having those, or similar spices/condiments, available), I was very happy with the dinner and with the lunches I got from the leftovers.  In fact, my co-workers seemed quite envious of my leftovers when I heated them in the microwave.<br /><br />[update:  "BETTER WITH BULGOKI"<br /><br />I discovered by accident that this product tastes best when made with bulgoki (Korean barbecued beef).  I had some wafer-thin slices of round steak in a bulgoki marinade that had been in the fridge for two days and needed to be cooked, so -- lacking time for anything more elaborate -- I tossed the marinated beef in a sautee pan and added the usual fresh vegetables and extra garlic and gingerroot, followed by the black bean sauce.  Except for being a little on the salty side (I'd omit or greatly reduce the soy sauce in my bulgoki marinade next time, since there's more than a little salt in the black bean sauce already), it tasted great. Weird as it might seem, I think I'll use Korean marinades on any meat I use in cooking up the remaining boxes of this product.]

It adds some sodium but if youre drinking the recommended water a day that should not bother you. I get it on Amazon cause the prices are much less and most times I get my Prime Status so it comes fast. If you use it alot, get the 16oz can.  Open it only to show a few holes.  Going from the smaller can to this one, if you open too much you get a lot!!<br /><br />I mix it into my normal SHAKE/BAKE seasoning for an extra kick.  The perfect way to get breaded chicken with NO fat.

review/summary: Outrageously good!
review/text: This is a first-rate proprietary blend of spices with well-balanced flavors. In my opinion, it is by far the best and most versatile spice blend in my over-stocked pantry. Slap Ya Mama is spicy hot but not overwhelmingly so and you can adjust the heat by modulating the amount used.  I have been using this blend for awhile now but still keep finding more and more delicious applications for it.  It can be used (lightly) to enhance rice, vegetables, or some awesome scrambled eggs; (a bit heavier) for Cajun grilled catfish or to amp-up a soup or stew; and (liberally) on barbecued meats.  You can even sprinkle it in olive oil as a dipping spice for fresh bread. Go ahead and give it a try -- bet you'll be really glad you did.

review/summary: Stay Away
review/text: I have done my share of reading on this topic and like to think that I provide my pets with not only somewhat healthy, but also palatable food. There are pros and cons to be said about all the brands. With this in mind I feed my dog and cat the Wellness Core brand dry food, but tend to switch between the "better" quality canned ones (depending whats on sale). For the most part I've been happy with with the brands I've tried, i.e. Natural Balance,Solid Gold,  Wellness, Merrick, Innova, etc.<br /><br />Open a can of any of the afore mentioned brands, and they won't have that generic pet food smell, i.e. nonspecific and overprocessed. The food made by these companies actually looks like food, not processed mush.Hence the prices they charge.<br /><br />I thought that Science Diet fell into this same category...WRONG!!<br />Opened the first can and immediately got hit with the smell of ....goodness knows what. The food itself was a solid gelatinous mass that I had difficulty mixing..since i add only a small amount of wet food each night, one can lasts a few days. After a day or 2 in the refrigerator, the gelatin type substance only congealed more. This food very obviously contains a great deal of fillers, and yes my pets ate it..but this could be applied to anything not nailed down, so this was no shock.<br /><br />These reviews are highly subjective, and i hesitate to bad mouth something this strongly, but first and foremost I want others to know what theyre getting. The worst part is that the price is not that different from what I'd consider quality brands..

review/summary: my dogs love it
review/text: So I agree with the first reviewer in the consistency of this product. Its not chunks of meat or veggies but rather a potted meat type goo. But I am able to cut it up in little chunks and my dogs LOVE it. Which surprised me as they turn their noses up to so much (I have 4 dogs.) Like Iams as an example; my dogs hate the stuff but others swear by it.<br /><br />The light formula is great as it helps maintain and even reduce weight which is very important if you have small dogs, of which I have 3. The other is a boxer and he loves this stuff too. I mix it with dry - well, not mix really, but rather put both wet and dry in the same bowl for each dog so I am able to measure how much they each get. When I took them off this and opted instead for a more affordable regular wet food, the weight came back which is not good, especially for my little chihuahua.<br /><br />Every review should be taken with a grain of salt. Is this the dog food for you? Maybe - just buy a couple cans and try it. How else will you know?

review/text: I purchased the Bellagio dried Espresso to make desserts....chocolate espresso cookies, etc. I decided to try it first as per the instructions, for a cup of espresso. It was pretty good! It reminds me of the Starbucks single cup instant. I've had two cups so far and enjoyed both. I think I might just use it when I want a strong, fairly good flavored cup of coffee in the afternoon, when making a full pot is too much trouble and drinking a regular instant is out of the question. This espresso powder does not have that instant flavor so common among the store brands. And even at the price I paid, its far less than the one dollar per cup of Starbucks instant.

review/summary: Very good for instant, and not too salty!
review/text: Albeit it's not as good as homemade miso, I find this to be the best instant miso I've tried.  Personally, I don't like super-salty food, so I was thrilled to find the reduced-sodium kind.  This soup is flavorful, and, as another reviewer mentioned, it tastes even better with some dried seaweed added to it.  I use Annie Chun's dried seaweed snacks in the sesame flavor: I rip the snacks into 2 or 3 large pieces, throw it in the bowl with the seasoning, and add hot water - voila!  That also helps for those of you who might like a saltier soup because the seaweed snacks have sea salt sprinkled on them.  If I'm feeling adventurous and have more time, I'll take extra-firm tofu cubes, sear them in a pan with a little olive oil and a bit of the seasoning from the packet, add them to the soup after slightly browned and crispy, and let the soup sit for a bit so the tofu absorbs the flavor.  It's healthy and filling without the parched-tongue after-effect that happens with many super-salty instant miso soups.  I love this stuff!

review/summary: Go for the Real Thing
review/text: Originally I had bought the "full-sodium" Miso-Cup soup packets that contained 690 mg of sodium and it tastes identical to what you would get at a restaurant.  When I saw the reduced sodium packets, I was excited because Im always looking for more healthy alternatives.  This Miso Cup reduced sodium is disgusting.  It not only has no flavor but the bits of soy and whatever else is in there, doesn't get soft and just floats at the top of the soup like rocks.  Now, I have a huge box of these soup packets and am not really sure what to do with them. I've tried preparing it different ways, but still haven't been able to finish a single cup of it.  My advise? Go for the full-sodium Miso-Cup.  Yeah, it has more sodium, but it tastes great and is high in protein, vitamins and minerals.

review/text: After following the rather simple instructions (add one packet to 8oz of hot water and stir), I was extremely disappointed. The soup produced tastes and looks nothing like miso soup. Now I'm stuck with 47 more packets I have no intention of eating.<br /><br />Trust me, just buy another brand. This one is horrible.

review/summary: A Variety of two but.....
review/text: I have purchased several different types of Nature Valley Granola bars<br />especially for my college aged kids. I was rather disappointed at this selection as there were only two varieties in the box  Oatmeal Raisin and Chocolate Chunk.<br />The Oatmeal Raisin bars were fine but the Chocolate Chunk in several of the bars had only ONE chunk and at most two. I do not know if this was a manufacturing error on Nature Valley's part or if they had to cut back but the kids were not thrilled.<br />The product description did not specify the varieties I would be receiving but I did not mind as we generally have enjoyed all of Nature Valley's varieties we were just disappointed in the nearly non-existent chocolate chunks.

review/text: This is a high quality product with an excellent price.  It has a wonderful, smoked flavor and tastes very fresh.  We liked it so much that we purchased another for a friend's birthday. It makes a wonderful gift.  The only thing I would suggest to improve upon, is to perhaps have 2 separately wrapped package, since the larger size requires the salmon to be eaten within a few days.  It's so delicious that you want to savor it for a while, yet 24 oz. is quite a bit.  I highly recommend this product and will be ordering it again.

review/text: The description for the item reads "... Large arrangement measures approximately 24"H x 16"L ..."  The item I received is nowhere near that size.  In fact it's smaller than what the product description describes as a "small" arrangement (20"H x 14"L).  At $94.99 it's a rip off.  More expensive than a dozen roses (it only contains 8).  Combine this with the fact that it arrived a day late and I had to call 1-800-Flowers and spend 20 minutes on the phone to find out where it was.  It's the last time I do business with them.

review/text: This halvah is from the old New York City days.<br /><br />The package dripped oil.  I didn't care.  It was a glut of halvah.  I didn't care.  My arteries crackled as I cackled.  I didn't care. (They are using some partially hydrogenated oils now unfortunately.  But death comes to all of us, so eat.)<br /><br />This stuff, if you like it, is so addictive, you can use it for a tranquilizer.  I used to buy this brand by the chunk in New York at the deli counter of the supermarket.  It still tastes the same.<br /><br />The price is definitely right.<br /><br />It was great.  Amazon, you little devil, what did you do with my waisteline, or shouldn't we mention that?<br /><br />Counting calories?  Lock the stuff away and only allow one really caring friend to feed it to you at decent intervals.  Otherwise, chomp on!  It really doesn't get much better than this.

Well you might be thinking the problem is that two flavors that taste good individually do not taste good together.  That's not it at all.  The Thyme must get burnt in the process of making the bar because it is awful.  My fiance and I were shocked by how bad it tastes.  Like burnt plant, not chocolate.  Avoid.

review/summary: Really Surprisingly Good Baked P-Chips! MMmm!
review/text: I'd pretty much given up on baked potato chips cause I hate that funky texture that, for instance, the Lays one has.<br /><br />Since I really love the organic Kettle Chips in chipotle flavor, I decided to give these a go. I got the lightly salted first, and the texture was great. They were very nearly like regular. (A very minimal difference). Crispy, potato-y. Nice.<br /><br />I then ordered these, and I love them. Much tastier than the somewhat bland "lightly salted" regular ones. They're sweet and smoky. A very nice barbecue flavor, I have to admit.<br /><br />I really hope they make the chipotle flavor in baked (and organic). I'd buy those in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So, for folks looking for a non-fried potato chip alternative (great for brown bagging lunch, four servings to a bag makes them more economical), I recommend the Kettle Bakes. Very good product.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: The BEST! Kettle Baked Cheddar Chips
review/text: My husband and I went to Kauai  in Feb. of this year and we tried these chips for the first time. And my husband started a saying then "an opened bag of these chips is and empty bag of these chips"  and once we came home we could not find them anywhere. No store around our town of Grand Junction Colorado carried the baked cheddar chips. So I looked to Amazon and there they were. So now we have them available and we will order more. Yesterday we had sandwiches for lunch and as my husband ate the last few chips and crumpled the bag up he said" an opened bag of chips is an empty bag and he laughed. They really are good tasting chips whether a person is watching their calorie intake or not. We will buy them again!

review/summary: Fantastic ! Best baked potato chip ever.
review/text: These potato chips are absolutely the best baked potato chip I have ever tried.  They are so good that my husband and son will also eat them.  In fact, my college-aged son says he prefers these over the greasy regular potato chip.  With 65% less fat and baked, they are a healthy alternative to regular potato chips.  We got the lightly salted because husband is watching his blood pressure and these are perfect with just a touch of sea salt on them.  Sodium is lower than Lays baked and the taste is much better.  These look and taste like real potato chips, unlike Lays Baked which don't even look real.  Highly recommend these.

review/text: I have been a fan of the Kettle Bakes for a long time now.  They truly are the best chips available anywhere.  In my opinion they are far better in every way than any brand of fried potato chips, not counting Fritos, which aren't potato chips anyway.  I don't see how they could really be improved.  The crunch is fantastic, the flavor is fantastic, and you sacrifice nothing but greasy fingers!  I have tried every flavor, and my favorite is definitely the Aged White Cheddar, but you won't see me turn my back from the BBQ, or the Lightly Salted.  The Salt and Pepper flavor is a bit peppery, so if you like that then you'll like them, and I even eat them sometimes.  The Salt and Vinegar doesn't work for me, but then I'm not a fan of vinegar potato chips anyway.<br /><br />Just buy these, please, any flavor that tickles your fancy.<br />And then you can thank me later.<br />=)

If this matters to you like it matters to me, stipulate that you receive the Lightly Salted version ONLY.

I was going to have them delivered every six months.  When I got my first order I got seasalted chips instead of lightly.  I called about it and they put through another order at no charge to me.  Second order again wrong chips.  So I called and cancelled automatic delivery.  The chips are good except they are a little too hard and hard on my gums.  Also too salty for me.  The above should have read (lightly salted)<br /><br />I have to admit though that I do like the chips because they are lower fat and may order again.  I just wish I could have gotten lightly salted ones.  "Thank you.  Irene Zalonski (zalonski @sbcglobal.net)

review/text: We are always searching for low fat, lower calorie snack foods to satisfy our strong snacking needs. These chips are one of the best we have ever found. They are delicious and satisfying and have only 120 calories per serving. They are terribly expensive at our local supermarkets, but  Amazon offers a great price!

review/summary: not too salty and not greasy
review/text: If you're a big potato chip fan, you might find these a little unusual because they are baked.  I personally am not big on the greasiness that most potato chips have, so I actually prefer a baked chip like this.  I also like that these chips have a little less salt than most chips, so the potato flavor really comes through.<br /><br />Let's face it:  a potato chip is never going to be a truly healthy snack.  Even without the extra fat that comes from frying and without the excess salt, a chip is still a bunch of simple carbohydrates.  If you can control yourself and not scarf down bags at a time, however, this is a reasonable indulgence to add to your diet on occasion.

review/text: These chips are great and so is the price! Other low calorie potato chips are made from a potato batter and usually have added sugar. These are real chips that taste great. Bet you can't eat just one.

review/summary: Way Better than Baked Lays
review/text: I am so impressed with these chips, especially compared to the other brand of baked chips I've tried. The texture is very similar to the original kettle chips, plus there is a little fiber in each serving which is nice to see in a snack. I will certainly buy again!

review/summary: Disappointed with Freshness Date
review/text: My husband and I are on Weight Watchers and eat these chips frequently because they are much lower in fat than regular chips. One serving is equal to 2 Weight Watchers points (old point system). It seems that the local stores are always out of them so I ordered through Amazon, but was disappointed in the freshness date. All 15 bags had a freshness date of August 11, which was much too close to the date ordered. The ones I bought at the grocery store in June had a freshness date of October. Although we eat these almost daily, we won't be able to consume 15 bags by August 11, and did not want to be bothered with the hassle of returning them.

review/summary: Best. Baked. Chips. Ever.
review/text: These chips are amazing.  Though baked (i.e., much healthier than regular chips), they have a great and thick crunch to them.  The ingredients list is also pleasantly short:  potatoes, safflower/sunflower oil, and sea salt.  It's rare to find such a high-quality pre-packaged product these days.  Only real negative is price, but buying on Amazon helps in that regard.

review/summary: Buy These Chips -- They're Excellent
review/text: Kettle brand Baked Potato Chips are the best baked chips I have ever eaten.  They are real sliced potatoes (unlike some brands that are "compressed" chips).  They only have 3g of fat and 135mg of sea salt per 1 oz. serving but you can't tell that by their taste.  I have trouble finding them in my local stores, so this is a great way to buy them at an excellent price and keep extra bags on hand.

review/summary: Good flavor without the guilt
review/text: These chips have some of the best barbecue flavor of any chip without all the grease. The texture is a little hard, so sometimes if I get a thick chip it hurts my teeth. But the taste is worth it!  The irregularity of the size and shape of the chips tells you that they're real, not something created in a lab. Plus through Amazon I save almost 50% off the grocery store price!<br /><br />I just wish Amazon carried the baked salt and vinegar flavor. It exists, but is not easy to find. I manage to snag some every few months or so but at almost $4 a bag I can't really stock up the way I could if they were available through Amazon.

review/summary: So delicious!
review/text: Yum, yum, yum! These baked chips are so delicious I keep forgetting they're baked. They taste like thick fried kettle chips. My husband prefers lightly salted chips, and he was thrilled with these. We only have a couple bags left and will order more when they go on sale again. My only complaint is that they're a tad pricey.<br /><br />In case you're wondering how big a 4 oz bag of chips is, the bags are in-between the larger bags you usually find at the supermarket and the small individual serving bags you might get at a sub shop. The nutritional info says each bag contains four servings. Well, of course, that depends on your appetite and restraint, but I'd say it's more like a two-serving bag.  :)<br /><br />I received the chips on August 30, and the expiration date is December 14... So I wouldn't order these if you don't think you'll eat them within a few months. Not a problem in our house!

review/summary: Baked, and not faked!
review/text: Well, baked potato chips have finally gone mainstream after years of being some obscure brand in the store that you bring home and just try to eat while they crumble in your hand and taste bland while they're doing it.<br /><br />Now some of the big national snack companies have "baked" chips, but why are they shaped like hexagons?  Some of those baked chips from national manufacturers look like the result of some mad scientist experiment.<br /><br />Not these!  These look like somebody sliced up potato and baked it in such a way that they still hold their structural integrity when the process is complete.  They're crispy just like traditional potato chips and the seasoning is balanced just right.  Once I get through this box I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: delicious and nutritious!
review/text: Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the "bad stuff" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality. Moreover, in cutting out the fat, almost every snack adds artificial sweeteners, fillers, preservatives, or fat substitutes, nearly all of which can be health concerns for consumers. (For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips. Even better, the BBQ flavor is really great in these chips, ensuring that your snack is really satisfying and truly filling your cravings. I love the fact that more salty snack options are appearing on the market, and I hope that Kettle continues its trend of producing simple, healthy, and absolutely tasty products. I guarantee that chip lovers will not be disappointed by this yummy offering...

review/text: It is unusual to find the perfect snack food that dazzles bag after bag.  They are almost addicting which is a good thing in this case.  I feel it is safe and not going to do too much damage to the health conscience system.  More to it than a baked potato but almost halfway healthy.  The flavor of course and the crunch texture make this chip a rare masterpiece of monstrous culinary excellence.  Good job there Northwest.  Wish I could find a life coach that was this good.
