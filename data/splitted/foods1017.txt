review/summary: Exactly what I needed
review/text: I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/summary: AESTHETICALLY PLEASING~~~~SPRINKLES!
review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: Cats Like Just Fine/Not Too Expensive
review/text: I have four cats, two of whom were introduced into the household about six months ago. In an attempt to keep everyone happy and healthy when then my 2 new kittens arrived, I had advanced to a more expensive canned food which the kitties are served at their evening meal. Yep! Everyone was fat and sassy. But my Kitty bills were going over the top.<br />Then reality set in. In addition to more wet food, I was purchasing more dry food and more litter AND spending a lot more time cleaning up cat hair. I could afford 4 cats, just not four cats who thought they were living at the Ritz! So, I decided to look through the Fancy Feast line up so that I could find wet food that these spoiled kitties liked but was not priced like Filet Fignon.<br />So I tried Tender Beef and Liver Feast. Yum, Yum. Nobody seemed to notice that their rations were cheaper. What did they know? It just tasted Good!!!<br />All four dived right in and ate. I was very pleased. So, instead of paying over $20 for a 24 pack of 3 oz cans, I was now paying about $14.00. Those savings add up!<br />So here we are...5 happy campers at my house. That includes the 4 kitties and me. I have found several other Fancy Feast Brands which cost little, but are up to snuff in the eating department: There is Beef and Giblets in gravy.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CIFZG">Fancy Feast Sliced Beef & Giblets Feast in Gravy Canned Cat Food</a> There is a Fancy Feast Trout.Turkey and Giblets took the place of a Turkey and rice mix.(Cats cannot digest carbohydrates anyway. It is just a fancy come on to keep the owners happy).<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FTJ0YC">Fancy Feast Cat Food Multipack, Grilled Chicken, 2.25-Pound (Pack of 2)</a>Grilled Chicken passed muster. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P03AOC">Fancy Feast Grilled Turkey and Gilbets Feast Cat Food, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a><br />I continue to work on bringing the cost down and have been really plased by the quality of Fancy Feast. Of course the fact that I can sign up for Subscribe and Save and do not have to lug the cans home from the store is a huge plus! But Tender Beef and Liver was the first flavor I tried as I started cutting costs, so I just wanted to let everyone know, that it can be done more cheaply while maintaining a happy kitty home. HOORAH. I certainly recommend this!!!

review/summary: Pretty good so far with slight modification
review/text: I bought this dispenser to replace a Bags om Board bone dispenser which worked great until it fell off my leash and I lost it. The problem with the bone dispenser was the plastic ring that attached it to the leash popped open and the bone dispenser fell off the leash without me knowing it  --and this was after only having it for 2 weeks! I decided to order the white dispenser but wasn't too impressed with the plastic zip tie that attached it to the leash either-- as another reviewer pointed out, the end of the plastic tie irritated my hand, the tie itself couldn't be readjusted once you attached it, and I was afraid the plastic tie would eventually break off and I'd lose this dispenser too. So I removed the plastic tie and substituted a metal key ring to attach  the dispenser to my leash and so far so good! The bags are great, the metal key ring securely attaches the dispenser to my leash yet I can easily detach the key ring from my leash if I want to, and I have no problem getting the dispenser open. It's too bad the company doesn't use metal key rings instead of the cheap plastic rings and plastic zip ties-- if they did, I'd give this product a 5 instead of a 4.

review/summary: Accessorize your dog's leash!
review/text: I was skeptical and at first didn't like the bulkiness of the Bags-On-Board holder attached to my dog's leash.  But once I got used to having the holder and bags in it...it's great.  No more stuffing my pockets with large shopping bags, no more searching in garbage cans for discarded cups or bags to pick up dog poo with...I always have bags with me.  Only down side is being able to find affordable refills...which was no problem on Amazon!  I order the 120 bag refill for $6.30 (so far) and have plenty!<br /><br />The only down side to the style I have is that it is attached with an electrical zip tie and the end scratches my hand occasionally.  Bags-On-Board now offers a retractable leash with the bag holder built in...but I'm not sure of the quality of the leash or the sizes (animal weight) that it comes in.

review/summary: Very sturdy, but hard to open
review/text: A agree with the 1 star review posted in 2008 that this dispenser is difficult to open. I also do not like that the attachment device is a zip tie, which makes it harder to change leashes without modifications by purchaser.<br /><br />But of all the bag dispensers I've owned, this one has stood the test of time. After over a year it is showing no signs of wear or of breaking down.<br /><br />So, if you have strong hands and only ever use one leash.... this is a 5 star choice. But for me there is still room for improvement.

review/summary: Great for kitty litter disposal!
review/text: I used to salvage plastic bags from the grocery stores etc. to dispose of kitty litter waste but recently I have stopped using plastic bags and am using cloth bags for my shopping. I purchased these bags because they are the perfect size for multiple daily waste removal (the litter scoop fits right into the bag) and because they are environmentally friendly. I attached the little dispenser right onto the litter box (it comes with a plastic zip tie) and it is super convenient to have the perfect little sized bags ready to go. I have not had a problem with tearing or holes in the bags and they are easy to tie up after use. Will purchase plenty of refills!

review/summary: Bags On Board Review
review/text: We have always used "Bags on Board" for our pet clean up.  Unfortunately, this time, the container that hangs on the leash broke off and we had to purchase a new one.  I can't say how it happened because my husband was walking the dog.  However, I would not let that keep me from purchasing this product. It is lightweight, easily dispensed and, having them on the leash, makes it so simple to clean up after your dog.  Everyone should be required to carry something as a courtesy to walkers.  You can use other types of plastic bags from groceries or other purchases, but these are the most compact and easiest to carry around and use.

review/summary: Convenient and easy to use
review/text: I bought a bag dispenser before which turned out to be a nuisance to use, and which only took refills from the company who made the dispenser.  Unacceptable.  B on B makes excellent bags and put them in an excellent dispenser.  I find the cap a little hard to get off (note: it pops off, but not easily), but I expect as it ages, that will loosen up a bit.  Perhaps the stiffness is intended to give it a longer useful life.<br /><br />BTW, I don't have a dog.  These are the bags I use for my daily scooping of my cat's litter box.

review/summary: Give this one a wait
review/text: I have two of the fire hydrant versions of this product. As my dog's name is Gunny, I just couldn't resist getting this version. I received it promptly from Amazon, but when I stuck it on the leash, the "tie" wouldn't "lock" in place. So Amazon exchanged it for another one and the same thing is wrong. I have contacted [...] in order to avoid another exchange (guessing this is a batch problem.) They got back to me in less than 12 hours and are sending me a tie. Do order this, but wait until Amazon has sold their existing units off or sent them back. It is very cute, so between that and bagsonboard's great customer service, they do deserve a 5-star. I wish there was more quality control, but most products don't seem to have any these days...

review/text: If you don't have a lot of hand strength it's not the right container to get.  The lid is pretty much impossible to get off if the plastic is cold.  It gets very frustrating to have to wait for someone else to get the lid off for you.  The bags themselves are great though.  I think the bone shaped one might be easier to use and will probably give that one a shot.

review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

review/summary: AESTHETICALLY PLEASING~~~~SPRINKLES!
review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/text: One of the hardest choices we diabetics have to make is what to eat, especially when it comes to dessert. This product provides the base for any number of low/no sugar fillings. I'm very pleased with the taste, price and quality of these pie crusts and would recommend them to anyone watching their sugar intake.

review/text: I love these crusts.  Only caveats are to use them in a timely manner (some of mine got too old and smelled bad; I'm going to try freezing my new ones to see if they stay better).  They do tend to crumble if hit (my current batch seems to have been hit in shipment), but they still taste good.

review/summary: not as advertised
review/text: This is not pie crust. It is soft graham cracker powder in an aluminum pie pan. When the pan cover is removed the soft graham cracker powder falls apart when placing filling in the pan and then trying to remove a portion. I scoop out the powder and place it in a bowl then add some filling and mix it up and serve portions on to a plate. Tastes ok this way. This graham cracker pie crust is NOT firm, hard or sweet like the ones you get in the grocery store. It is a cheap knockoff. Dont buy.

review/summary: Love these for pumpkin cheesecake! (scroll for recipe!)
review/text: I like to keep my carbs down, and with the Fifty50 pie crusts I can do just that.  They taste great!  I make a great pumpkin cheesecake in these shells - no one ever has any idea it's lower carb.  :)  Here's the receipe:<br />-----<br /><br />Gina's Low-Carb Pumpkin Cheesecake<br />(Makes 2 pie shells)<br /><br />1 8oz package of Philadelphia cream cheese (Neufchatel)<br />1/3 cup plus 1.5t Truvia (20 packets or use Truvia spoonable)<br />1/3 cup Daisy light sour cream<br />2 large eggs<br />2 egg whites from large eggs<br />1t pure vanilla extract<br />2/3c canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling; ingredients should just say "pumpkin")<br />1/2t ground cinnamon<br />1/4t ground nutmeg<br />1/4t ground ginger<br />1/8t ground cloves<br />(or substitute all of the above spices for 1T Pumpkin Pie Spice)<br />1/4t salt<br />1c plus 2T Whole Milk Ricotta<br />Toasted pecans for garnish<br />2 Fifty50 graham cracker crust shells<br /><br />Preheat oven to 325 with a rack in the lower third of the oven.<br /><br />Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and Truvia on medium for several minutes until it is completely smooth and well blended.  Add the sour cream, eggs, egg whites, and vanilla.  Mix for 2-3 minutes longer to blend well.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Add the pumpkin, spices, and salt and mix for 1 minute longer.  Add the ricotta and mix until just incorporated.<br /><br />Pour the batter into the pie shells and bake for 50-60 minutes until the cheesecake jiggles only slightly in the center when you gently shake the crust.  If the cheesecake browns too quickly or begins to crack, tent a piece of foil over the top, without touching the filling for the remaining baking time.<br /><br />Transfer the pies to a wire rack to cool for 1 hour.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.<br /><br />Just before serving, garnish with toasted pecans.  Refrigerate any leftovers tightly covered for up to 3 days.<br /><br />Approximate nutritional facts (per 1/8 slice of pie):<br />284 calories<br />18g total fat<br />12g total carbs (net)<br />8.5g total protein

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/text: Delicious. Tasty. Smooth. These are just a few words that come to mind when I think of guava paste.<br /><br />Now, I'm not the type to eat guava. On the whole, I hate guava - I just can't stand them - but guava paste, and particularly guava paste by Goya, is something I find myself craving a lot. When it finally became an impossibility to find in the stores - looking for over a year without seeing any puts it firmly in that category - I turned to the only place that has never let me down before, the internet, and specifically Amazon.com. That wonderful first bite, with just the right amount of "guava-grittiness" to have a perfect texture in the otherwise silken paste, helped to soothe my craving... at least until my guava paste ran out.

review/text: I have two kitties that LOVE shrimp, and I usually buy them the teeny tiny salad shrimp when I can find it, but I keep a stock of this just in case I can't.  They also like all the other flavors of the Appetizers.  Apparently guar gum is something all cats like, and this has a lot of it.  I also mix these in with foods they're not 100% fond of but are good for them.  I totally spoil my kitties.  It's the best way to maintain my inner grin.<br /><br />I wish amazon sold a variety pack.  I'd buy tons more of it because I consciously try to avoid food preferences with my kitties.  I don't want them to ONLY like chicken or only like shrimp, etc...  So far I've been very successful with that, but it means that I end up buying only one flavor here and then going to the local store to buy the other flavors.

review/summary: SOME OF MY CATS LIKE; SOME DO NOT
review/text: I have four indoor cats and one feral who resides outside; however, the feral has eaten the leftovers from the indoor kitties for so long and now the indoor kitties eat SO MUCH, that feral kitty generally gets totally fresh "out of the container" food, so is now a kitty "rated voter" on cat foods just like the indoor kitties are...at least most of the time. Occasionally, when the 4 other cats are EXTREMELY divided in their opinion, Feral Kitty gets only three quarters of a vote. This has happened on this product, so I had to explain the situation in much more detail than I normally do. So I have 5 who vote on new foods and do so by eating, or not eating, the product.<br /><br />Of my 5 cats, 2 of them always eat this...Feral Kitty aka Yellow Kitty and Mercy...who is only one year old. One eats some of it each time it is offerred...Trinity, the wise old male.  One picks at it every time...Wisdom...guess the name tells that story. And one will not eat it at all...Gabriella who is the Head female...and also the one with the most Sensitive Tummy.<br /><br />The voting on this product seems a bit "loaded" because the feral kitty is one of the "always" eaters and though, he has learned to turn his nose up and walk away, he still eats things the others will not touch. So, I count him at about 3/4ths of a vote on something like this where the others are pretty iffy it about the product. Feral kitty's bottom line is: either eat it or go hunt something else. And the hunting is literal..."Go find yourself a mouse if you are so picky." (I have to quit treating him differently and let his vote stand on its own, yes, I know! If he is a true voter, why do I make excuses for him? I know. I know. I will Not do it again)!!!!<br /><br />So, the kittys have given this only 3 stars. (And if Mom had kept her nose out of it, the vote was probably a 2.5 star...she will learn.)<br /><br />I feed my kittys various others of the Fancy Feast Appetizers, especially the Talapia and the Chicken, and the whole carton immediately disappears and all eat it. So there is something OFF about the Seabass and Shrimp since it gets such mixed reactions from the cats. These are the two they LOVE: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQJSS">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, White Meat Chicken and  Flaked Tuna, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />So, this gets only 3 stars as it is palatable to some and to others "yeech."<br /><br />"Thank you for attending to our odd opinions of human manufactured food"! If "you" out there would notify someone...flash,freeze dried mice are what we are dying to have."  Trinity, Gabriella, Wisdom, Mercy and Yellow Kitty aka Feral Cat. Thank you.

review/text: My picky cat loves these so although they seem a little pricey, I will continue to buy them.  She is so hard to please and it makes meal times much less frustrating when she doesn't sniff and walk away.  I only wish it had the vitamins for a complete meal.  Because of that I only give them to her a couple times a week.  Otherwise, I think she would love these everyday!<br />UPDATE 6-21-2012 Mabel has been eating these but all of a sudden they are making her sick.  Not sure exactly what to think but I won't be serving them anymore.

review/summary: Aunt Gussie's Pecan Meltaways
review/text: I loved the quality and the taste of these cookies. They are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations. To the person that posted a bad review, just a small comment. They are called meltaways because they have real butter, go figure. If you are interested in low fat food, look elsewhere. It like complaining that french fries are fried, or that chocolate is fattening. Just saying.

review/summary: Absolutely loved them!!!
review/text: These were so, so good, and I love that they're made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute (not aspartame or splenda).  I looked at some Atkins peanut butter cups I'd just bought, and they're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies.  I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my "healthy snacks."  And since I'm over 40, size 4, with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what "healthy" is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were "greasy."  Maybe hers were in the heat, and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!

review/summary: Good dessert for someone gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive and diabetic
review/text: My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)

You can DEFINITELY tell the difference in flavor when grinding cinnamon.  IF you want a coarser grind, try Drogheria & Alimentari All Natural Spice Grinder Cinnamon (I initially bought that one, but I personally didn't like the coarse grind.

Really, who doesn't know M&Ms with peanuts?  Pretty, multi-colored candy shells with a layer of chocolate wrapped around a peanut; the Easter edition comes in pastels.  Simplicity is good sometimes.  Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie.  But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one.  Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites!  Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now.  M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl!  Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: This is "restaurant style" salsa, and that's exactly what it is. It's supposed to be "runny" b/c it's "all natural"  and "restaurant style". I usualy make my own salsa with diced tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, fresh lime juice, cumin, etc., but now I only buy this salsa as it's obviously less time consuming. I live in Baltimore, but for some reason can only find it in one Target in the area. If you like your salsa more "natural" and less "paste-like" then this is the salsa for you!

review/text: I really take a shine to these snacks; could be because the last two ingredients are carnauba wax and beeswax. I kid you not. However neither the wax content nor the sweetener content can dissuade me from buying and enjoying these tasty bags of fun.<br />On the plus side the first ingredient is fruit juice and there's that Vitamin C factor. And 80 calories per bag is not bad. I take these to work frequently and share them with my young students who love the shapes, colors, and flavors of these chewy treats. Occasionally I'll buy the cheaper supermarket brand fruit snacks which can't compare to the Scooby-Doo snacks.
