review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: A friend went on a trip to Costa Rica and brought this coffee back with her.  I loved it from the first cup.  I've been a Starbucks fan for a long time, but this coffee is way better than Starbucks.  I just received my first order from Cafe Britt.  It arrived very promptly and in great condition.  If you love coffee, I'd highly recommend giving this coffee a try.

review/summary: Good Tasting Whole Bean Coffee
review/text: I am new to buying whole bean coffee so I am by no means an expert. I can tell you that fresh ground coffee tastes noticeably better than ground coffee from the grocery store. When I first tried this coffee, I thought the flavor was very good but I really did not have much to compare it to. Since I have used this coffee, I have tried Kona coffee from Hawaii and also several coffees from Brazil. I think the Kona coffee tastes the best. I purchased 3 different types of the costa rican coffee and they are very good but the Kona had a smoother,more mellow flavor. The Tres Rios, the Poas volcanic and the Tarrazu are all good and worth trying.

Thank you for the wonderful bean!!

review/summary: Best Kernel Seasons Flavor
review/text: This is the absolute best of the Kernel Seasons popcorn flavors. I have tried probably 10 or 12 flavors and this one is just about perfect if you like something sweet on your popcorn. It's basically sugar with a light vanilla/creme flavor. You can mix it in with your popcorn oil for an even coating, or just dash it on top of your bowl. If you are going to try just a handful of these flavors, make sure you get Kettle Corn.

review/text: This is my sister's favourite candy bar, and I later found out it is also my father-to-be's favourite. I was kind of tired of just randomly surprising her, and buy a bar here and there, as it's kind of expensive, haha. So I looked up bulk ideas and such, found this, here, and totally went for it. She loves it, definitely. This was a very good buy. Nothing wrong, at all, no melting (which I was kind of worried about), nothing. Just great, and they definitely last.

I did a light roast slightly after the second crack and they roasted very even.  Ground, these beans have a very rich aroma with velvety smoothness.  Brewing the beans produced a very light, delicate brew with subtle aromas.  A very good bean and an excellent company to purchase from, all around.

review/summary: Perfect size for baking needs
review/text: I am always pleased when I receive my products from Barry Farm. The products are vacuum-sealed and hence tamper-resistant. If I order more than one product, they are placed in an extra bag to keep them from jostling about in the box. The products are then packed safely-embedded in a cushion of packing peanuts and arrive very quickly after ordering them. I had to order them direct from Barry Farm because sadly Amazon does not ship groceries to FPOs, but I had previously browsed Amazon to find the products I needed. I highly recommend Barry Farm to anyone who is a serious baker and is unable to find gourmet baking items in their area. That was me.

They are delicate and not too sweet with a nutty, slightly floral citrus taste, very subtle. Everyone at the dinner liked them. (Good thing since they are sort of expensive.)<br /><br />However, I was disappointed in the packaging. They used to come in a charming tin. Now the container is thin plastic. I should have guessed.

review/text: I really enjoy the taste of this Simply Organic black pepper; happily I can find this brand on local supermarket shelves. It releases this gorgeous, heady black pepper scent when ground fresh over my recipes - I'd say medium as far as strength, not *too* much bite but definitely makes more of an impression than white or pink peppercorns. Subtle enough not to take over a softly scrambled egg but punchy enough to crust the edge of a filet mignon.<br /><br />I use other brands as well but this is one I definitely would purchase again. Pleased to recommend.

review/summary: Try It With Omaha Steaks...
review/text: I grew up with my father-an excellent chef-using this product on his steaks.  Incidentally he was also Chip Davis' physician so perhaps that is where it originally came from-most likely a gift.  I have looked high and low to find it in stores and only found it once at a Hy-Vee in West Omaha years ago.  I ran out and was thrilled to find it on-line since my Omaha Steaks have not been the calibur of my father's since.  I highly recommend it, and it is particularly good on those thick, corn fed beef steaks.  Season your steaks at least 15-20 minuntes before placing on the grill.  Cook your steak a nice medium to medium well, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Salt with a little twist...
review/text: Well, what can I say?  It's salt. Men have died for it, others have traded for it, and in a time long ago it was used as money.<br /><br /> People drive cars fast on it so what's so special about this one?  It's salt with a touch of garlic, it does wonders for your steaks and burgers, but so does salt and garlic from about any other source.  Maybe what is special about this one is it costs about five times what regular sea salt does? Who Knows?<br /><br />You're gonna have to try it for yourself... I'd buy it again, I think...

review/summary: Great Steak Seasoning!
review/text: Have bought this seasoning for many years since it was originally sold through Mannhiem Steamroller. Originally it was sold by the pound in bulk form. They stopped selling it that way so they could charge more and create wasteful plastic packaging. I bought the seasoning this time as a buy 2 get one free offer and padded the order to make it $25. Highly recommend the seasoning for steak, hamburger, pork, etc. Not an overly overpowering seasoning. My whole family enjoys it!

Try both to see which is your favorite; I don't think you can go wrong with either of these delicious seasonings!

The big disadvantage is the holes in the container for shaking are just too large for the product so I ended up getting out too much of the stuff.  I've now transferred it to a container with smaller holes and after this inconvenience it works much better but is still nothing to get excited about.

review/summary: Not what we expected!
review/text: My wife and I have been looking for a good hot dog chili sauce and trying different brands.  She picked up a couple of cans of this and we had some chili dogs.  This sauce is just sort of flat tasting and bland.  There is no sense of any type of chili spice in it at all.  It looks like it contains finely ground beef in it but it is so bland I looked at the label and saw that there is no meat in the chili sauce.<br /><br />You got it, Texas chili sauce made from soy grits and other ingredients to contain absolutely no trans-fat or cholesterol or meat of any kind.  It is good for your body but not for your taste buds.  If you are looking for a good meat chili sauce for your chili dogs then keep on looking because this is not this one!<br /><br />I actually gave it two stars as we have purchased some other brands that were worse.

review/text: I recently purchased WalMart's Great Value brand hot dog Chili Sauce.  I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it.  I make my own chili but I did not have any frozen and I was really jonesing for a chili dog or two.  I was surprised.  The Great Value stuff was adequate.  Not terribly spicy, but good.<br /><br />I saw this stuff in my local grocery store yesterday and thought, "Texas Pete's?  It has to blow away the Gv stuff!"  I bought it.<br /><br />Well, the taste is terrible.  There is almost no level of spice flavor detectable.  I've compared the ingredient labels and the GV stuff contains "prepared dried beans" and "beef fat", whereas Texas Pete's contain "soy grits" and soybean oil.<br /><br />I was terribly disappointed.

review/summary: The Switch
review/text: This beverage is a excellent blend of fruits with just enough sparkle. I rate the taste and marketing five stars. I was starting to drink pepsi and coke many times throughout the day. Flat drinks become boring fairly quickly and having a can of The Switch easily takes the craving of a soda away. Although this drink does contain a large amount of sugar, it does not contain other harmful ingredients found in coke such as acid. My review does not refelct the price of the beverage. I believe it is overpriced for 8 ounce cans, but some may find with how easy it is to stop drinking soda, the price is suitable. There are many other beverages out there but if you are considering The Switch furit punch flavor, I would highly reccomend it.

review/text: When this item came up on sale and as a suggested item, I was not sure about purchasing a case without having tasted it. Since the description was about it being all<br />natural , but with carbonation, it made me think of the sparkling juice that is sold in a champagne bottle-shaped (usually during the holidays).<br /><br />Since I like that taste, I knew I'd like it, but I was a bit unsure of the flavors..<br />So I ordered the grape and cherry last time and this time I'm trying the punch flavor. I think the punch and grape had a bit stronger flavor than the cherry.<br /><br />Overall, I like the carbonated juice, and the fact that I'm not having a soda (those with phosphoric acid and other preservatives).<br />This would be a good drink for kids instead of soda, as it's all natural

review/summary: they are pretty good
review/text: I thought these smelled and tasted like regular kisses...just a different texture. It is almost like they made them with carbonated milk or something...so you end up with something like porous or whipped chocolate (only on the inside, the outside looks the same as regular ones.) I did think they melted more easily in my mouth, but I ended up almost feeling there was not enough chocolate in my mouth after it did.<br /><br />I think they are taste good enough, but I don't really see the need for shrinking the overall density an already small thing. They may have a better purpose than just eating...maybe on cookies or desserts (where the solid ones are hard to bite through) or after dinner when you just want a little taste of something. They may also be VERY good dropped into a hot drink since the texture would allow them to melt more easily. There isn't much caloric difference (200 calories in 11 of these opposed to 200 calories in 9 regular ones) so if you are thinking you could eat twice as many as these...too bad!! ha ha!! If you ever had a Choco-lite bar in the 1970's, these are just like those!<br /><br />I think I might like these even more if they had a little mint flavor in them, that would make a nice, little, lighter-textured treat.

review/text: I've been a Hershey's kisses fan for years (I even adore their commercials) and although a purist, occasionally try some of the new flavors.  Sure, I understand why they want to expand their market and I appreciate that, but these new aerated kisses?  Don't WASTE your money.  When I saw them in the store I read the description and thought they sounded intriguing, but the first one I put in my mouth tasted like extremely sub-par chocolate (yeah, I know Godiva and other brands but I still like Hershey's-this wasn't even Hershey's typical quality) and for sure-was aerated-and I thought "oh great, now Hershey's has joined the current bandwagon of figuring out how to give the consumer less quantity, less quality, and simultaneously make them think they're getting something special".  They're awful.

review/text: Wow... While I can't profess to be a connoisseur of chocolate, I do consider myself a bonafide chocoholic.  These Dark Angell chocolate bars are absolutely fantastic.  They're not the biggest chocolate bar, so I definitely needed a second.  Will certainly be ordering more, very soon.

review/summary: A piece of heaven in your mouth
review/text: Looking for a delicious treat that doesn't stain your conscience? This is the bar for you. I've just tried this new product, after reading about its supernatural organic and fair trade qualities, and I was delighted to find that the consumption experience was equally pure -- it strikes just the right balance of cruch and decadence, and you can clearly taste the difference in ingredient quality between this and conventional candy bars. I predict this bar will create a big stir as it begins to hit store shelves!

review/summary: licorice is one of the more dominant ingredients in this spice
review/text: If you like licorice, then you'll enjoy this seasoning.  I didn't realize that was one of the ingredients when I purchased this, but that flavor jumps out at you as soon as you open the jar.  I used it for an asian style noodle broth with vegetables and chicken and it came out really well.  This is hard to find in most stores and if you don't want to drive to numerous stores for this spice, just buy it online.

review/summary: looked for this everywhere & finally found it on Amazon
review/text: My husband wanted to make a dish requiring Chinese 5 spice powder. I looked for it at all my local grocery stores: Ralph's, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's.  None of them carried it.  I probably could have gone to an Asian grocery store.  But it was extremely convenient to just buy it here on Amazon and at a good price, too.  Apparently, it is not real Chinese Five Spice Powder if it doesn't specifically have  "Chinese" and "Five" in the title on the label.

review/text: We have tried most of the Virginia peanuts out there and my wife and I agree that these are the best available. They are a perfect match of crunchiness and salt and it's hard not to eat just a handful of them. They're great when watching any type of sports or at any kind of party. You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Like no other canned peanuts
review/text: For those who know peanuts only by consuming cans of Planters or those bags of stale Hoody's at the supermarket, the large and super-crunchy Virginia variety will come as an especial treat.  And Feridies turns out some of the best.  After the local stores stopped carrying the Feridies line a while back, I was delighted to find the nuts available on Amazon.<br /><br />The peanuts in the can I ordered were perfectly fresh, unlike the Feridies redskin Virginia peanuts that I ordered separately at the same time.  I suppose the redskins don't sell as quickly -- so if you want to sample (or replenish your supply of) Virginia peanuts, go for the regular Feridies version.

review/summary: New formula is just fine
review/text: I have used the tropical flavor for the last 11 years. Yes I realize that the formula has changed. Does it taste the same? Close enough for me. Does it taste awful? No it is not awful whatsoever. Is the same performance in this jug? Yes it is. It still delivers a great performance boost. Now I must say, that I have literally never tried any other flavor at all ever. The tropical tastes just as good to me now as it always has. The choice is yours, but I recommend this product with no reservations.<br />BG

review/summary: It Delivers...
review/text: I'm an avid road cyclist and have been using Cytomax for about the past three years. It does appear to make good on its claims of reduction of perceived exertion and longer sustaining of energy levels. I've sufficiently experimented with other products to be able to determine, for me at least, that the benefits obtained from Cytomax are not a placebo effect.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who've stated that the salutary effects of Cytomax tend to be especially noticeable during hot weather.<br /><br />The consensus among several of my fellow local riders is that the Tropical Fruit flavor is by far the most palatable, and I have to agree; I personally noted very little difference in taste when the manufacturer began using Stevia as a sweetener. It's light, and never cloying, even when I increase the concentration a bit for very hot days. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Definitely notice a difference when cycling
review/text: I have only used the tropical fruit, but I absolutely love this flavor! I just started using it in the last couple of weeks, so I cannot attest to the old recipe.  However, performance wise, I start drinking a 1/2 scoop per 12 oz of water (according to the company 1 scoop = approx. 3 TBL) a few hours before I'm going to exercise, and keep up the 1/2 scoop regiment probably every hour before I actually exercise. Usually I don't like to drink any fluids while I'm exercising as it upsets my stomach, but I do take a few sips of this drink during the ride, (for the ride, I do 1 1/2 scoops per 16 oz of water) and I feel it definitely helps my performance.  There were times prior to using Cytomax where I felt completely fatigued at the 13th mile of a 15 mile challenging bike ride. But after I started using this stuff, I felt fine at the 13th mile and even felt like I could another 7 miles.  I've had no stomach issues either.  I do 15 mile moderate and challenging bike rides approximately 5 times a week.

review/summary: Works for a competive cyclist
review/text: I typically ride about 5000 miles a year (would do more but live in New England).  I usually do a handful of pro/am races a summer (I fall into the am category!).  I use Cytomax exclusively.  I've tried others - Hammer, Gatorade, Accelerade, etc, but find Cytomax best for me.  It's easy on my stomach and not and provides the needed energy/electrolytes for long rides.  My personal preference is to do 1 1/2 scoops per water bottle rather than the 2 that they reccomend because 2 scoops makes it too sweet for me.  The deal on Amazon is great for the 4.5 lb container too!

review/summary: CytoMax Rocks
review/text: I have used Cytomax for years and it is a great product.  Re-energizes you quickly and helps sustain you for those long runs.  Pomegranate Berry is a little on the sweet side, but all in all it is a great product.  Purchased as a subscribe and save and it is very well priced.<br /><br />The only negative to Cytomax is it doesn't dissolve well in cold water.  So, mix your drink with tap temperature water and refrigerate ahead of time.  I usually prepare mine immediately after my run so it is always ready.

review/summary: Fresh Apple it Isn't
review/text: The CytoSport energy drink is a helpful sports supplement. It does give a noticeable boost to help power through intense hour long cardio classes such as Spinning, Cardio Kickboxing and Zumba. There has been overall improvement in fitness, performance and an ability to increase workout frequency & time from using this supplement. It definitely helps in post workout recovery, little to no muscle soreness. Beats the muscle burn from Spinning and Kickboxing.<br /><br />I have previously used the Pomegranate flavored powder and it tastes more like 1980's Red Kool Aid punch than Pomegranate.<br /><br />The Fresh Apple flavored Cytomax is supposed to be a green apple flavor. Unfortunately, it tastes strongly of plastic with a hint of green apple. I would return it if I could.<br /><br />Also, if you use a sports bottle that holds 24 oz. count on using two scoops of the powder per bottle fill.<br /><br />The Cytomax works better if you drink a small amount 15 minutes before your workout, as directed.

review/text: "New" cytomax formula doesn't taste quite as good as original, but still not bad.  New formula doesn't mix as well, tends to clump and settle on bottom of bottle.  Requires frequent shaking to adequately mix.  Product does seem to work well for hydration, electrolyte replacement, and lactic adic buffering.

review/summary: Live off of this stuff
review/text: First off, Tangy Orange tastes like sh imho. Tropical Fruit hands down. Lived off this stuff for a little over a year now. Tropical Fruit got me through crazy work. Canvassed door-to-door seven to eight hours a day rain or shine, excessantly drank almost every day for a while, worked out and exercised like a monster or beast, and most recently been working as a server for nonstop four to six hour shifts continually active.<br /><br />This is my recover-all cure-all push-on-all. Co-workers always ask me what the hell I'm drinking, sarcastically joke I'm drinking/taking drugs, but most directly, always tell me to slow down. Without this stuff, I wouldn't be able to be the me I really am, high-energy, high-energy spending, high energy to be calm, and high energy to be active. Friend used to tell me about this stuff way back at least 10 years ago, and now I know what he means. If you have any questions leave me a comment below. -Alvin

review/summary: Experience performance and recovery improvements.
review/text: I used to drink this stuff when I had triple days (3 practice a day for 11 days straight) in college water polo.  I didn't drink this the first year and despite eating enough and drinking lots of water, I was exhausted.  The following year I drank the Cytomax just as directed I noticed my recovery was much improved as way my overall performance.  I don't compete at the same level anymore, but I still notice the benefits in my daily workouts. The taste is great as well when mixed correctly.  Even if it's a little watered down, it still tastes better than water alone.
