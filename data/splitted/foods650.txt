review/summary: Tips on Use
review/text: I ordered these direct from the manufacturer in Spain. They work great in the Nespresso Essenza C91. With this machine you have to stop the water flow, it does not stop automatically. So using these Necaps are easy, you will not get a diluted shot unless you let it run too long and this applies to Nespresso capsules as well. However your shots may come out a little short due to the Necap not holding the same amount of coffee. The Necap will also deform due to the heat from the hot water. This is normal. I like using these very much. Making them is time consuming but then so is going to the Nespresso store to buy originals or going on line. If you want to save money and have time to do this then give them a try.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Pack the coffee in tight using the bottom of an empty Necap. Don't do it so tight that it is like a rock. You also need to use espresso grind coffee. It does not have to be espresso beans, any bean will work but the coffee has to be ground on the finest setting for espresso machines.<br /><br />1. Set out several Necaps<br />2. Use a funnel to fill to top, tap side of funnel to get coffee to go down.<br />3. Use bottom of empty Necap to compact coffee. Press firmly.<br />4. Fill up to top again and compact.<br />5. Put foil on and you are done.<br /><br />You can also reload your Nespresso capsules using aluminum foil as a new cover. Cut the old foil away, rinse, clean out the used grounds, re-pack with new, place foil over and pinch tightly around rim of nespresso capsule, trim excess foil away. These can be used over about 2 times.<br /><br />Remember to run some water through the machine to heat your cup and clean out any left over grinds to get a nice tasting cup of espresso.<br /><br />My coffee makers that I have used are a T Fal drip, several different sized Bialetti Moka Express, an Aeropress, french press, my grandmas old perculator and currently the Nespresso Essenza C91. I have also made cold brewed coffee. All serve there purpose in different ways.

review/summary: Not the best solution
review/text: I recently started using the Nespresso machine and really like the idea of custom filled pods.  These seem to work as advertised, although I am still trying to figure out how much espresso to fill the pods with to get the same rich black espresso as I get from the original pods.  (Currently working on about 5 grams tamped slightly)  I will try to amend this review when I have them perfected, but I completely recommend these pods, if you want to add some lower cost espresso into your life ;-)<br /><br />Just to add to the review, the grind of the espresso is almost as important as the amount.  I played around for a while and got what other reviewers have, weak coffee, slow dribbles... but found that a slightly courser grind with a very light tamping seems to have the best results.  I have a Pixie machine and have found that due to their smaller capacity, these pods work best with a ristretto pull of espresso, meaning that a full cup will be very weak.<br /><br />*** edit ***<br />I have determined that this product isn't worthwhile, even with the increase in nespresso pods' prices.  There simply isn't a way to get enough coffee into these pods to make a decent cup.  If you cram enough coffee in to get a good espresso, the pack is too tight and the water doesn't pass through and you get strong drippings in the cup.  If you have a manual machine, like the Essenza, you can use these well, but expect two pods to make a single shot of espresso.

review/summary: pretty watery but the coffee flavor comes through, ruins foam
review/text: I have the nespresso tassimo machine and I love it. I also love starbuck christmas blend and have missed it since I got my machine. I thought these little caps would do the trick. They kind of work. The resulting coffee is pretty watery- the capsule look like they are not sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the machine, they are shrunken after use- unlike the real nespresso capsules. The coffee that comes out (again I am talking starbuck christmas blend) tastes fine, but is weak in overall strength and looks really watery. PLUS after foaming up my milk and adding it to the coffee- the coffee instanly 'melts/pops' all of the foam. Nespresso must do something to their coffee to make it not do this. I find this a point none of the other reviews touch upon.

review/summary: Compatible - almost...
review/text: I purchased the NeCap Nespresso Compatible Refill Capsules a week after purchasing a Nespresso Citiz with Aeroccino milk heater/frothier. The Nespresso Citiz works flawlessly with Nespresso Capsules. Rich coffee with a beautiful crema. However with NeCap capsules the end result is hit and miss at best. I have tried Gevalia espresso ground espresso roast coffee in the NeCap capsules with poor results. I have tried Illy Espresso grind espresso roast with the NeCap capsules also with poor results. I have tried coffee from a local coffee house, freshly roasted and espresso grind with the NeCap capsules with poor results. I also tried India Black tea from a local India grocery with good results! Go figure.<br /><br />Preparing the NeCap capsules is a tedious process at best. Here are the steps:<br />Separate capsules from one another, this can be difficult as they tend to stick together.<br />Then separate the foil seals from one another, this can be difficult as they also tend to stick together.<br />Fill the capsules, press, then remove excess coffee with out accidentally removing the paper tape that protects the adhesive seal.<br />Sometimes the protective paper tape is not sealed carefully around the adhesive and coffee gets under the paper tape and sticks to the adhesive. Which of course needs to be removed for the foil seal to stick.<br />Assuming all goes well to this point one must then peel the protective tape and carefully align the foil seal over the capsule and seal in place.<br />These steps constitute a time consuming process which is not exactly loads of fun.<br />Lastly you must fit a small black rubber ring to the back of the NeCap capsule.<br /><br />In the box that includes all the bits needed to make a capsule is a note that reads: "Nespresso recently modified their new machines after July/August 2010 in order to prevent the use of compatible capsules. Please use the black rings to attach to the capsule for the proper use for the latest model of Nespresso Machines." Seems it may be time for NeCap to update their products.<br /><br />So the capsules aren't made for current machines and must be modified by the customer. Additionally the NeCap capsules are slightly smaller to avoid patent violation. These factors no doubt explain why some of the NeCap capsules won't insert properly in the Nespresso machine, or just fall through the machine to the catch tray. Lastly the coffee they make is not on par in any way, shape, or form with the capsules you purchase from Nespresso. Additionally I have noticed that the coffee made with the NeCap capsules tends to have grounds in it. Grounds don't bother me but it may others.<br /><br />Just so the readers know, I have filled a total of 43 of the NeCap capsules as of this writing. That was enough for me understand and to work through the process.<br /><br />All in all I will keep the NeCap package I bought and when I have time on my hands fill some with black tea. As for coffee, I prefer to buy from the Nespresso club.<br /><br />Summary: This is not a very well executed/designed product. The end result isn't up to the Nespresso standard. OK for Black India tea.

review/summary: dont use this in the Nespresso Essenza
review/text: Before I bought the Essenza, I saw all of the youtube videos of reusable caps. But I didn't know Nespresso started new technology in mid to late 2010 to defeat the use of refillable capsules.  My Essenza is one of the "new" ones.  These don't work in the Essenzas made in mid to late 2010.

review/summary: using my Illy and so happy!
review/text: It took some experimentation, but much like Keith from NYC, I got my own system down and they work just fine. And all that Illy I bought is not going to waste. I bought it when I was using my Delonghi EC155 - but it went belly up and since it was my second one of the same machine, I bought my Citiz w/ Milk because Ethical had just come out with their capsules (those work fine for me and I like the Cremosa) and I thought I'd give these Ne-caps a shot. (pun intended) So, after watching the videos and trying various ways of tamping, I pretty much gave the tamping up, too, much like Keith did. I have a small coffee spoon, I fill the capsule to over flowing give a light tamp with the back of the spoon, and scrape off the excess with the handle. I do five in the morning (or the night before) for the 3-5 espressos I'll drink throughout the day. From pulling the coffee out to sealing the capsules and putting the coffee away takes less than 2 minutes - and the espresso using my Illy is just great! Every once in awhile I'll have one that does the dribble thing, but hardly ever now that I have my system down. I use them with the little rings for the newer machines. How someone can say that they don't work in their machines is beyond me, I don't think they tried them or they didn't use the ring or they over tamped the capsules.<br /><br />As to cost, yes, each capsule is 20 cents empty, but the Nespresso capsules just jumped up a little over 5% to 60 cents a capsule plus shipping. My espresso needs would be cost prohibitive if I used Nespresso exclusively. I do plan on buying some of the lungo capsules in decaf for my few friends who don't do caffeine, but since I've never had any other than the sample capsules of Nespresso I'm not missing anything and really, it's Illy in my ne-caps...Illy (and the Lavazza when I run out of that) (I may have a problem)

review/summary: Disappointing coffee
review/text: I have to echo a lot of the other reviews:<br /><br />1.  The capsules are about 60% the size of the standard Nespresso capsules, so unless you like your coffee very weak, these Ne-Caps are not for you.  Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the "dirty coffee" problem, this is a Two Star product.

review/summary: Does not work well, more plastic waste
review/text: I tried these on my Pixie machine, and since the capsules are not really made for it but older machines, they don't work well for newer models. The retrofit ring the capsules come with are a cheap band aid. I tried around 20 capsules before giving up. Most of the time there was excessive water flowing into the reservoir due to said incompatibility with the newer machines like my Pixie. I cannot speak for the older models.<br />There is also an environmental issue:<br />Once used, the ne caps are done and go into the garbage -  cutting the lid and using the grind for mulch is a good idea. However reusing them seems pointless and it is harder to separate the plastic from the aluminum left over lid than with the Nespresso type which is all aluminum.<br /><br />The better and much cheaper option: REUSE THE ORIGINAL NESPRESSO CAPSULES<br />I cut open and empty the regular Nespresso capsules to use the grind for mulch, then after washing and drying refill them at least once for another round with my favorite Espresso, crema type. The lid is a simple aluminum foil cut from standard foil roll (you can make multiple lids at the same time by layering foil pieces then cutting the circular lids with a scissor all at once. Make sure the circle is not too big, it should not extend too far up the capsule cone but stay neatly wrapped around the lip. Otherwise it can be leaky). Here a good link<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This means every so often you have to buy new capsules, but refilling them probably cuts the cost per capsule by 50% min. if used 2-3 times.

review/summary: Wouldn't do it again!
review/text: You might think my great expectations for the Ne-Caps are the cause of the lower rating.  With a burr coffee grinder & a wide assortment of coffee beans I enjoyed grinding my own coffee and topping off the Ne-Caps.  It took a bit of time and care but I didn't mind.<br /><br />However, we have a Nespresso Clitiz and the Ne-Caps, even with the fitting rubber band required for this unit are a bit problematic.  They do not easily slide into the the Nespresso compartment.  The coffee is adequate, nothing to write home about.<br /><br />30 Ne-Caps into the process, I'm glad I tried it but won't be doing it again.

review/summary: Not Worth the Money
review/text: I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Pricier Pods
review/text: This product is pretty easy to use, I'd say you can make 10 pods at home in about 10 minutes.  Obviously this takes a little bit of time, you'll need to grind your own bean, fill the pods, undo the adhesive and stick on the foil.  It's really quite easy, it doesn't take any real coordination, and it is even a little bit fun. I would think most people would not care to put in the effort to use this product, but if you get a kick out of getting a better price for something and like working with your hands, this is a nice alternative.  You wont get rich off your savings, and there is a considerable amount of time and effort to make use of these, but it's not nearly as hard as some reviewers say, and the success ratio of each pod is very good.  Once you get the hang of it, you can make pods pretty quickly. Try it if you think it's for you, it does work and tastes great!

review/summary: Good product
review/text: I was skeptical at first, but since I like to drink nespresso (ristretto/arpeggio) as well as coffee from moka I thought I'd try. These capsule are not perfect, but provide a good alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- you can grind the coffee you like (I have used, so far, Illy beans and beans from the KC Roasterie)<br />- coffe has a density and creaminess typical of Italian baristas, you can actually taste the layers of the beans and the (small) crema blends well with the coffee<br />- you can save some money, or get better quality beans for the same price as Nespresso<br /><br />CONS:<br />- it takes a while to practice with these capsules (at least 20)<br />- coffe has still some variability (occasionally it comes out watery, but when it is well done it is way better than Nespresso)<br />- it's a bit messy (so not good for your office machine)<br />- foil does not always seal perfectly<br /><br />With time, I realized that the following steps improve a lot the quality of the espresso you get:<br />1. poor small amounts in your capsule and press heavily each time (secret for a good and rich espresso is how the water goes through the coffee)<br />2. seal tight eliminating as much air as possible<br />3. MAKE A RISTRETTO. If you drink long Nespressos, this is not for you, as the coffee will not be strong enough. The amount of coffee in the cup should be about 1/3 of a small cup with illy logo (yes, very little, that's why it is called espresso).<br /><br />I will buy these products again and try with other beans.  Personally, I often get tired of the fake crema of Nespresso and the limited availability of strong and intense ristretto varieties.

But, by the time I could get to the second carton, mealy worms were hatching.  So two and one half containers are useless and cannot be returned. Buyer beware.

review/summary: Yummy! Incredible with corn pone
review/text: This is the best Hoppin John I've ever had-and I grew up on a farm in the Deep South. A previous reviewer mentioned that he didn't think the can contained enough black-eyed peas and that he also felt it had too much liquid.<br /><br />The cans I've eaten were perfect. There is a fair amount of liquid, but it is very well seasoned and, for me, that is perfect because I eat my Hoppin John with "real" Southern corn pones (Just very good stone ground corn meal, salt, bacon grease and water shaped into pones and baked in a cast iron skillet. No flour or sugar!) and I want that liquid to sop up with the cornbread.<br /><br />Love this.

review/text: These broccoli seeds sprout fine, though the sprouts seem to grow slower/smaller than the more expensive broccoli seeds I've bought through SproutPeople. I usually grow the sprouts for 72-84 hours. With 4 tablespoons of SproutPeople seeds, 3 or 3.5 days's growth will fill about 3/4 of my EasySprout container. With Sprout House seeds, the sprouts fill up only about 50% of the container. Just about all the seeds sprouted, though.

review/summary: Too strong and fragrant
review/text: I sincerely hope this review doesn't confuse the potential buyer, but I found it important enough to write this.<br /><br />If you have had real Tulsi tea, in the sense, if you had a Tulsi plant in your home, and you have made and drunk plenty of tea after crushing and boiling those fresh tulsi leaves in your tea, then this product will likely not be to your liking. It is way too strong/fragrant. So much so that it barely smells like Tulsi (which has a very mild, consistent smell).<br /><br />What I'd like to stress to you at this point is that "way too strong" may exactly be what you love; but I didn't. I'll have to go back to the more expensive Teatulia tea bags for "my" preferred taste.<br /><br />I'll also add that the bag I received says USDA certified organic. Don't think it said that here on the Amazon description.<br /><br />Hope you find your Tulsi tea!!!!

review/text: "Organic" means that something in there was/might be organic.  This claims to be 100% organic.  USDA organic does not mean much any more.  I'm not sure what NDA is.<br /><br />Mine has an expiration date of 11/22/13.  It does not have a picked date. I wish it did.  Normal teas are best no more than a year from the picking date.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting around.<br /><br />It says it is pure leaves but there seems to be some white sticks in the mix.  And it is a mix.  Not many leaves - unlike the picture- more of a crunch.  I have to use my finest filter and some still goes through.  I don't use paper.<br /><br />A pound is a lot of tea.<br /><br />I mix it with my green tea in the am and it keeps me from getting jittery.  Tastes like Tulsi to me but... the real, fresh leaf is very fine indeed.<br /><br />And where is it from?  US, India? Belize?

review/text: I have been searching high and low for a 'good' strawberry syrup to add to my soymilk. One without high fructose or other nasty ingredients. Finally, I have found this wonderful strawberry syrup! It's organic and only has two ingredients! 1. Organic Raw Blue Agave and 2. Organic Strawberry Flavor! For such a simple product, this syrup is exactly what I needed to make my favorite strawberry soymilk. I'm so pleased! It tastes amazing. I personally don't mind there not being a 'pink' color to the milk, as long as it tastes this good. If you are looking for a natural alternative to strawberry syrup for your ice cream, waffles, milk, etc., then I strongly recommend this product! My strawberry syrup is found at last! ^-^

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: My husband loves the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn, but it's hard to find in our area anymore....guess it doesn't sell well due to the calorie content!  I did find it on Amazon, but only in large quantities which isn't what we need. I found this topping on Amazon, and because of the reviews I decided to buy it for him to try.  He loves it!  It smells great, no rancid smell, and he says it's just as good as the stuff that is packaged with the popcorn; may be the same stuff altogether.  It's less expensive to buy this bottle and the regular boxed popcorn, than to purchase the larger quantities of the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn.

review/summary: Finally, good buttery popcorn at home
review/text: I sure like this product, as I've always loved the butter popcorn at the movies, but now I usually wait for movies to come to Blockbuster. I don't like popcorn salt alone, and had looked for a solution to my problem. This is the answer, and it's sure as heck cheaper than the $5 per bag at the cinema.

review/text: This product gives your popcorn the movie theatre butter consistency, but it doesn't seem to have much flavor.  The first time I used it, it seemed a bit grainy.  The next time, I heated it a bit before adding, and the grainyness was gone.<br /><br />I do think I will try something else though, as this was just ok.

review/summary: Better than real butter.
review/text: I read all the reviews on all the butter-type toppings for popcorn, especially for hot air popper popcorn. The real thing does not sit well on air-popped popcorn. I tried sprays (one was pretty good); but, I think this one tastes the best in my humble opinion. I have a heavy hand when it comes to buttering my popcorn. Hot-air-popped popcorn is quite dry and needs some kind of liquid topping to make salt or flavored seasonings stick to it. This is about as close to theater popcorn as you can get. I use the Kernel's Ranch and other flavorings (also from Amazon) and popcorn salt. I am not a once-in-a-while-I-think-I'll-have-some-popcorn-type person...it is more like 5 to 7 times a week for more years than I like to count. I have put it on the automatic delivery schedule of Amazon so I am never without it.  It is great to use on baked potatoes and vegetables to boot. It does have a tendency to get too thick to shake onto the popcorn; but, I just run the hot water on it while the corn is popping and it is great. I think it is because I keep the air conditioning on to around 63 deg. I think it tastes better than butter and hope they never discontinue making it. God bless

review/summary: NO TASTE
review/text: From the reviews I was expecting the quality and taste of the movie theater's popcorn.  It wasn't so with this product unfortunately.  If you don't put salt on the popcorn there's no flavor at all.  I use the coconut popcorn oil and popcorn salt but cannot tell any difference with or without this product.  I asked several local theaters what they really use (and not what this product's makers claim) and they told me they melt Promise margarine for their corn.  Much tastier and a lot less money.  This product is mostly palm and some other kind of oil with artificial butter flavoring that looses its taste on the hot popcorn.  I really did want to like this product and even purchased 2 based on the comments but both are bland and useless (except adding more oil to the popcorn).  I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to seem like a negatron.

review/summary: It's all about flavor.
review/text: Here's how my star rating scale works:  1 = water, 10 = perfect robust butter taste.<br /><br />Would you believe that butter itself, including clarified butter, has very little butter taste?  I rate real butter products a 2.<br />Most microwave popcorn is too buttery to the point of going back down the scale.  I rate their butter taste (if we could extract and bottle their butter flavor)  around a 4 for being far too intense.<br /><br />Wabash Buttery Topping, unfortunately, does taste like butter - meaning it has very little buttery taste.  This is why I have given it the same rating as actual butter.  If you like this product, I recommend making or buying clarified butter instead, to save money, since they taste the same.<br /><br />So my search continues for a good buttery topping.

review/text: When I received the Blue Lotus Chai via Amazon Prime and saw how little the can was, I was skeptical: 100 cups?? And the teeny wooden 1/4-teaspoon measuring spoon was, well, little. But I had my first cup last night and I'm a believer!! I am a chai aficionada who has been making my own chai, trying other chais on the market, and always trying new recipes. This chai captures exactly the right amount of spices to tea. I added 2 percent lactose-free milk and about a teaspoon of volcanic agave, whipped it a bit with my Aerolatte (if you don't have one yet, it's worth the cost), and...pure bliss. Before I went to bed, I bit down on a tiny ball of spice and had a Proustian madeleine moment--transported back to my childhood. Was it the cardamom, the ginger...? This is truly a great blend. Takes up little space and not too much from my tea budget. Oregon scores again by making a supreme product! Thank you so much!!

review/summary: Nice traditional chai
review/text: I got hooked on this chai when I decided to give up coffee.  It still has a little bit of caffeine, but much less than coffee does.  It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.  This stuff tastes "real" and without chemicals or preservatives.

review/summary: THE best chai...and it's instant, unsweetened & all organic!
review/text: This is hands down THE best chai - IF you like your chai spicy (and what's the point if it's not spicy?).  Bonus, it's instant!  Don't be deterred by the price of this small can - you use just 1/8 (yes, that's right...one-eighth) of a teaspoon per cup, add hot water, milk & sweetner and instantly you have a cup of hot, spicy chai goodness.  I LOVE that there is no milk or artificial milk or sweetner of any kind, so I can customize my own cup and don't have to deal with any unwanted goodies.<br /><br />The company seems really conscientious and only uses ORGANIC herbs/spices.  If you go to their website they list each spice detailing the health benefits.  When I gave up coffee I became a chai fanatic and darn near went broke drinking a local brand that comes liquid in bottles (at $10/qt!).  Plus it was sweetened, so I couldn't control the sweetness - pre-sweetened is ALWAYS too sweet for me.  I went online and ordered every unsweetened chai I could find and started brewing my own.  I kept thinking "why doesn't someone take the liquid and dehydrate it"?  This was the only company that did and it just happened that it was the best tasting!  You can buy this in one-pound bags as well, so as soon as I'm finished with my can (which I've had for over a month now), I'll start buying in bulk to fill my cans.  The cans are the perfect size too - they fit easily in your purse for chai-on-the-go.

review/summary: Super Spicy--Just the Way I LIke It
review/text: I love anything to do with tea. But when I'm on the run, or don't want to deal with tea leaves (all my teas are loose, because honestly, it's just better that way), something instant is always a good idea. Since Chai Tea began my love for tea, I began searching for the perfect instant chai. When I found this, I was extremely skeptical. How can this tiny little thing make 100 cups of tea? And the price? Why should I pay that much money for something that might not taste good?<br /><br />Luckily for me, I had just gotten paid the day before. So I bought this on a whim and crossed my fingers.<br /><br />When this arrived, I was so excited that I couldn't help but make a cup right then and there. The tin is very, very small, which deterred me somewhat, but I pressed on. A tiny wooden spoon rests inside the chai (and if you can't find it, try digging it up a little with a toothpick). I took a spoonful of the mix and put it into a 12 oz cup, and added another scoop for good measure. I added a little hot water and some milk and took my first sip. The spices hit me like a train. After swallowing, it leaves a trickle of spice in the back of your throat--something very few chais have managed to do. This chai is very spicy, but not cinnamon spicy like some other chais. The taste is truly organic.<br /><br />If you don't like chai that's loaded with spice, then this tea isn't the one for you. But if you don't like spicy teas, you shouldn't be seeking out traditional chais. This tea most likely won't last me through 100 cups (as I like my tea strong), so I guess 50 will have to do. For $0.34 a cup ($0.16 if you only use one scoopful), you can't really go wrong. I would highly suggest trying this one out.

review/text: I have tried several of the instant chai tea's and this one is the best. I like having the ability to make it as spicy as I want. It has a nice peppery taste. And I REALLY like that it's unsweetend, which is hard to find. The bonus is that the spices are organic! This needs no added sugar or sweetener in my opinion. It's just that good! And 3 ounces of tea doesn't sound like much, but it comes with a cute little wooden scoop to measure with (I use 2 heaping scoopfuls for 16oz) and I've been dipping into it daily for 6 weeks. Just about ready to order a new tin. I like the tin too, as it's cute and I will reuse it in some way. It's delicious iced as well, just adding to a bit of hot water, then add your ice and milk.

review/summary: A little pricy, BUT great for the bold coffee drinker!
review/text: My father is all about blod coffee, especially with the keuring. He drinks about 4 cups a day and before the keuring use to have an espresso maker and make a cup at night. I don't think I've seen a day where he DOESN'T drink coffee lol<br /><br />So when I heard about the Starbucks K-Cups coming out back in late October early November, I knew this was something I wanted to try. But instead of buying a box for myself, when I saw the flavors I knew I rather buy one for my father instead. Well I was skeptical about it after I brought it home, but low and behold he drank every single cup in a week! Beside this brand and the "Rev" bold coffee, I think this is a winner! My father HATES flavored coffee and so it was all about the good taste of something bold.<br /><br />So if you know someone who drinks only blod coffee and maybe also loves Starbucks, but also has a Keuring, get them this coffee! This could actually be cheaper than going to Starbucks. Also Bed, Bath & Beyond sells the cups. If you've got a 20% off coupon, especially around the holidays and can't afford it on Amazon, try there to maybe test run this flavor.

review/summary: Love Sumatra, but if you order Grande...
review/text: Starbucks Sumatra has always been my favorite, so I was excited when the K-cup finally came out. Overall, they did a very good job. But one big caveat: If you get a Tall or Grande at Starbucks, one K-cup is not going to a good substitute. The largest setting on a Keurig platinum is 12oz, which is a Tall in Starbucks lingo. I've enjoyed this at 8oz, but too much of a sacrifice at larger settings. What this means is I typically need 2 K-cups for my morning fix. This can be an issue for any of the bold coffees, but since I've been a Starbucks Sumatra drinker for years, I notice it more---in taste and in my wallet. I'll continue to buy this, but I'm also drinking Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M9ZLEG">Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>It's cheaper and I can use the 10 oz setting.

review/summary: One of the Best Flavors & Smoothness ... Here's Why!
review/text: In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Sumatra Dark - Pike Place + Colombian + French Roast + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian & Sumatra Dark Roast are the Best of the lot and the French Roast is also recommended to try out.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig "Brew" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!

review/text: Took a chance on these. AWFUL! I know Starbucks is known for burnt tasting coffee but this is ridiculous. I actually like their in-store brewed coffees. Never tasted coffee THIS burnt before. Try Green Mountain Barista Prima (French Roast is da bomb!). A gazillion times better this stuff.

review/summary: Great Soup!! Very Versatile.
review/text: Many people, including myself grew up on this soup. It was one of the few vegetables I looked forward to as a kid. This is my favorite vegetable soup, and I pretty much judge all others against it. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find this product in my area. In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it. But after ordering it in bulk, I found a few other uses for it.<br /><br />Normal Use- This soup is great just by itself. Add water and you are good to go. But it is best if you add your own touch to it. I suppose each family has their own way of using it. I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup. Perfect item to have on hand!!!

review/summary: Easy preparation
review/text: Have used the Mrs Grass soup mix for several years, preferring it over other dry mix soup bases because it does not contain rice, which most others seem to include.  We slow cook the soup, adding stew meat and other fresh vegetables to enhance the flavor and nutrional value.  It is very easy to customize the ingredients to suite your own personal preferences.  Left overs are easily refridgerated and can be used by simply reheating.

review/summary: Great soup starter!
review/text: I have used both the Beef and chicken soup mixes from Mrs Grass for years to make a nutritious home made soup. When Walmart stopped carrying it for sale I looked on the 'net to see where I could get it. Amazon has been great to deal with on getting it in bulk packages of 8.<br /><br />My way of making it involves adding 12 cups water, fresh garlic, onions, sliced carrots, celery and beef from either leftover roast/steak or inexpensive beef steak browned (leftover chicken in the chicken soup mix). I also add one can of diced tomatoes with a couple of beef bouillon cubes. In order to have the best taste it needs to simmer on the stove for at least 3 hours.<br /><br />This will make enough to feed a lot of people or by freezing the remains, Dinner for 1 for many nights (3 for me, I am a big eater). Very economical

review/summary: Mrs. Grass Soup Mix
review/text: We love this soup, but it is hard to find in stores. When I saw this item on Amazon for the good price, plus free shipping , just had to get it. We eat a lot of it in the cold months. We cook groundbeef, then add everything in the pouch, and it is wonderful and tasty.

review/summary: Soup Mix
review/text: This soup mix has been sold in stores for many years. When I recently went to the store to buy more, I found it was no longer available. In checking online, I found the soup mix on Amazon. The mix is great - add stew meat, any vegetables, mushrooms, diced tomatoes - whatever you want to add. For two people you get 6 1/2 good tasting meals out of one package. We freeze the leftovers in individual containers. Very economical and good tasting!

review/summary: Souper Product
review/text: My local grocers stopped carrying all soup mixes with dehydrated veggies. I like dehydrated veggies. I prefer the Bear Creek soup mix but noticed that Mrs. Grass, which I like also, was much cheaper. It arrived promptly in a really big box. I have eaten all of them. I will probably order again.

review/text: Easy to make and a filling soup. It is hard to find in any stores in my area so am very happy Amazon has the mix for sale. I can eat the soup even though I am on Weight Watchers! If you want, you can add extra noodles and carrots when extra company arrives! Short time to cook. Love the soup!

review/summary: Finally....SOUP!!
review/text: I was so thrilled to find this soup at a decent price. I look in every grocery and department store I go in but haven't been able to find it for a couple of years. I'm not sure why it is so hard to find because according to the reviews it is a much-loved product. Initially Amazon said it would take 8-10 weeks to ship but as soon as the order was placed they bumped that up & I received it in about a week. We are so happy to have our soup in the house for the winter!
