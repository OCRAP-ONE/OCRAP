review/summary: Good Ginger Beverage
review/text: I've tried an awful lot (and sometimes awful is just the right word) of ginger chews, candies, teas and brews (ginger is great for nausea).  This is the best ginger beverage I've tried yet.  It almost has the same flavor as ginger snaps.  My 4 and 6 year old loved it.

review/summary: Very potent stuff!
review/text: The color of this drink is a dark golden yellow, and the smell is of very potent ginger.  I was hopeful that it would bring the spice that ginger naturally has, and it sure did.  I liked that part of this.  What I did not like was the sugar!  Any great medicinal effects of the ginger (for nausea) would be negated with this sugar.<br />I served it hot, and it was relaxing, like tea, but too sweet in my opinion.  I do not drink sodas or put sugar in my coffee, so maybe I'm just not used to it, but I couldn't finish it because as it cooled, the sweetness seemed to get stronger.<br />Served hot, and in small doses, this could be a nice sweet after dinner drink.  I try to keep the healthy benefits of what I put in my body in mind, and ginger is always at the top of my sensitive-stomach's list, but as far as calming the stomach, it does not do the trick for me.  That sugar just upset it more.

review/summary: Spicy Hot...
review/text: This drink has too much ginger for my taste.  I like ginger just not this much in one drink.  I tried to improve the taste by adding honey and that helped but not enough for me to be able to drink it.  10 minutes after taking a few sips my tongue was still burning from the spices, not the heat.  More lemon might have helped the flavor a bit but the ginger is quite strong.

review/summary: Extremely ginger, with not much lemon
review/text: I personally didn't care much for it, but I can respect it as an interesting ginger beverage. You can make it hot or cold. For me, as a hot drink it was okay, though more ginger than I really needed. As a cold drink, it had a bit of a chemical aftertaste. It claims to be all natural, but it seemed like a taste I associate with artificial sweeteners.

review/text: Coffee, tea, and other hot drinks can be pretty subjective. So, some people may love it. I didn't really like this. I was expecting lemon and ginger. It tasted a lot more like cloves to me. On the other hand, I do believe that my stomach was a little happier after drinking it. I am just not sure it was worth it.<br /><br />This was easy to mix-Just put it in hot water and it all quickly mixed.

review/text: This was easy to dissolve in either cold or hot water.  It's a pretty strong ginger taste, which I like.  If you are a fan of ginger ale or love ginger you will probably enjoy this.  I also get car sick easily and bringing a long water bottle with some of this is a great way to ease my upset stomach.<br /><br />I would recommend to people who enjoy the taste of ginger.  I would also recommend as a great cure for upset stomachs, especially those caused by motion sickness.

review/summary: Not for those who don't like spicy drinks!
review/text: I admit it up front:  I don't like spicy food or spicy drinks.  I hate pepper with a passion as well as other "hot" spices.  I will occasionally drink ginger ale and eat gingersnap cookies, so I thought that I might like this ginger/lemon beverage.  But it had far too much kick to the ginger to suit me.  Those who like ginger and don't mind the spicyness will probably like this.  I even tried it cooled as an iced drink (which I usually prefer) and still hated it.  To be fair, since I knew that I don't like really spicy food or drink, I gave it three stars.  And I think that if they would work on it and tone down the ginger, it could be a good beverage.  But not as it is right now; at least not for me.  Also, if they're going to sell it in America, they'll have to change the instructions to show how much water to add in cups instead of using ml.  I just kept adding water and tasting it until I thought it was about where it was supposed to be, but I had no idea if I was right (and I hated it at every level) about the measurement.

review/summary: Spicy, Sweet and Satisfying
review/text: I enjoy hot ginger drinks and this by far is my most favorite. First, let me say that I don't think this drink is for everyone. I, myself, wouldn't drink this as often as I drink coffee. But if you're ever in the mood for a hot, spicy, yet sweet beverage, I strongly recommend this mix. What's nice about it is that it's not an exotic blend of a variety of flavors; rather it's a simple, straightforward ginger with honey drink. Furthermore, though I don't want to overstate its possible medicinal properties by committing the fallacy of confusing correlation with causation; nevertheless, I drank this when I felt I was coming down with a cold but by the next day I felt much better.<br /><br />I very much encourage you to try this enjoyable and tasty drink.

review/summary: Excellent for Sore Tummies
review/text: Although I like both Lemon and Ginger, this drink arrived when I was having a bout of indigestion. I grew up with older Tantes (aunts) who made their own special teas whenever anyone had a minor health issue. As a child, I was served ginger tea with a doting Tante hovering over me until I was well enough to play.  With that in mind, I made this drink to assist my tummy.<br /><br />It worked very well.  It tasted pretty good, and had a nice bite of ginger that came right through the lemon flavor.  The little packets had just enough powder to make a small cup of "tea," which was just the right amount.<br /><br />My only complaint?  I needs a loving Tante to kiss your forehead to see if you have a fever, and a big hug for afterward , once you're cured. You probably want to drink it for the flavor, though.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: To me this drink mix has a strange too-sweet aftertaste, a little like bubble gum. The ginger is strong, which I like, but I really wish they would have left this unsweetened. The package says it's sweetened with Honey, but then in parenthesis: Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose. I thought that Honey was made up of mainly of Fructose, Glucose and Maltose? Anyway, they are all naturally occurring sweeteners, for what that's worth.<br /><br />I didn't taste the lemon much, just very strong and sweet ginger and that weird aftertaste.

review/summary: Tasty and convenient
review/text: This is an instant sweetened ginger mix that you add hot water to.  It comes packaged in single serving foil wrapped packs.  The ingredients are simple: ginger, honey, glucose, sucrose, and fructose--no colors, preservatives, or artificial flavors.  When added to hot water, the powdered drink mix rapidly dissolves with little or no residue.  The resulting drink is a dark yellowish tan, almost as brown as tea.  The beverage has a pleasant ginger odor, and the taste is strong and sweet, like a strong ginger brew.<br /><br />I first encountered hot ginger drink while travelling in Southeast Asia.  Hot ginger makes an excellent pick-me-up at the end of a day.  It's a great warm-up drink as well as a thirst quencher.  Ginger also has excellent stomach settling qualities--it's been used to fight both sea seasickness and morning sickness as well as help those with the nausea of chronic disease or cancer.  To benefit from its effects though, you need a lot of ginger, and that's what this drink has.  Many ginger teas don't have enough ginger to settle the stomach, but this one does.  The drink mix was formulated for Asian tastes, so some may find it too sweet.  On the other hand, if you like ginger ale or other soft drinks, this drink certainly has less added sugar than them, and with a lot more ginger.

review/summary: Bad Taste During, Horrible Aftertaste That Keeps Going and Going...
review/text: Upon opening the package, you get an immediate pleasing scent of the ginger: this would be a great air freshener for a room at moderate levels.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, the tea tasted just terrible - the ginger and honey / lemon combination are more than just intense, they are so overpowering over the top of each other vs. complimentary, I just couldn't take it past three sips.  There is also a strong taste of something like cayenne pepper that burns the heck out of the back of your throat: in addition to having a bad taste, the cayenne reminds you of it long after you're done with that last swallow.

review/text: I am giving this product 4 stars because it is what it says that it is.  If I was judging it on my personal preference for the combination of ginger and lemon flavor, it would get 1 or 2 stars from me.<br /><br />If you like Ginger and like the strong aftertaste and sensation that drinking ginger gives you, than you will like this product.  The initial lemon ginger flavor is very good, by any standard.  The aftertaste of ginger and the odd, flemy sensation that it leaves in your throat is not appealing to me.

review/summary: Interesting and Different
review/text: You'll probably like this if you like ginger - it does have a strong ginger taste that often lingers afterwards in the form of an aftertaste.  The lemon provides an interesting counterbalance to the ginger - upon first sip it overpowers the ginger but the subtle ginger flavor often comes back as an aftertaste.  Some may prefer the aftertaste and others may not.<br /><br />What I do like is that it is an interesting and different alternative to the more common tea flavors we get in America. It definitely has a very strong Asian smell and taste that will either attract or detract.  I would say it's a matter of taste and to try just one box before buying a group.  My spouse loved the tea but I didn't care for it.

review/summary: A nice alternative to the real deal
review/text: Okay, first a disclaimer...I enjoy authentic, fresh ground ginger root tea with a spot of honey and lemon on a fairly regular basis so perhaps I'm a bit harder critic than average.<br /><br />My hope was to find something that was easy to take along when traveling or during those times when I don't feel like going through the entire process of grinding fresh ginger etc...<br /><br />So, to that extent this is a satisfactory alternative. On the other hand, I wouldn't give up fresh for this alone...that probably goes without saying. So, bottom line is if you are short on time, travel or just want a decent cup of ginger tea, this is a nice alternative to the real deal.

review/text: I'm actually a fan of ginger gum and familiar with the sharp spiciness of ginger, however this was a little much. Based on the warm golden liquid featured in the mug on the box I was actually surprised that the actual color is a deep opaque brown with an extremely pungent smell.<br /><br />As for taste it is sweet yet quite strong. Tho' the taste was not altogether unpleasant my tongue and my throat were burned. Not as in the liquid was too hot but as in it was too spicy for me.<br /><br />People who win chili contests would probably find this refreshing.

review/summary: Good, but not something I'd drink regularly
review/text: Years ago, a friend from India suggested that I mix ginger juice with honey and turmeric and give it to my little girl as a cough remedy.  I found that it worked great, my daughter liked the taste better than cough syrup, and I thought it tasted fantastic.  I thought this drink mix might taste kind of like that, and it does, if you taste the mix straight out of the pouch.  But when I put it in water, I used more water than recommended (after seeing a lot of comments saying that the mix was too strong), and that was a huge mistake.  If anything, it would be best in LESS water than recommended.  It's very tasty, but drinking 8 ounces of prepared drink would just be too much volume for this kind of drink.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this drink mix unless you know that you like strong ginger beverages, because the ginger flavor is very strong and spicy.  It would be great to drink (in small quantities) when you have a cold or have a sore throat.  I wish it was a little sweeter (I ended up adding more sweetener and some lemon juice).<br /><br />A small point: you should be aware that the pouches are very difficult to open because there is no "starter" perforation.  I needed scissors.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad drink.  Just be aware of what you're getting, and start with maybe half a cup of water, then add more if you find that you would prefer something weaker.

But if you're not a big fan of either, maybe getting a package of six boxes at once is not the best idea.

review/summary: Good flavor but pricey
review/text: To people who have not tried ginger tea before, the flavor might be a little strong.  I brew ginger tea from actual ginger so Gold Kili was moderate to me.  I did find it too sweet for my taste.  It contains 3 types of sugars:  fructose, glucose, and sucrose.  For what reason, I don't know.  When I make my own tea, I just use a piece of ginger about the size of half my thumb, 16 oz. of water, which I boil for 10 minutes and let sit for another 5 and all I add is a teaspoon of brown or raw sugar.  Excellent for sore throats.  Although you can get a similar soothing effect from Gold Kili but for nearly $2 a cup, it will burn a hole in your pocket.  If convenience is the only consideration, then this product is okay.  Otherwise, I'll stick to making my own tea.

Every Ginger Tea I try is just weak and with a hint of ginger at best.<br /><br />This "Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix" was just what I was looking for.  It is like liquefied ginger in a cup, with a hint of lemon. Of course this isn't really tea; there is no actual tea leaf in it, but that isn't relevant.  What matters is how good it tastes, and how good it feels on a soar throat.<br /><br />I think this would make great cocktails too.  The ginger flavor is so intense that I know it would mix well.

review/text: I LOVE ginger. It is so good for you. It's supposed to calm a sour stomach. There are lots of good health benefits. But this herbal root also gives you such a hot zing that you feel a little more awake along with bringing joy to your taste buds. That being said, my taste buds found the level of ginger in this beverage to be a little bit much. This would be great for the diehard ginger lover OR fantastic if mixed with fruit or other fruity herbs in hot water. This product could also add zing to your conventional iced tea in the summer. So I would recommend trying it. The fact that it is a powdered compounded product adds ease to mixing it for an instant cuppa lift!

I have this little packet from Amazon and its pretty cold outside and the package does say CAFFEINE FREE and I love ginger and lemon but don't really know if I will love them together.  Maybe I'll make some tonight or last week about 8pm to warm myself up.  Sounded good.<br /><br />I turned over the package to see how much hot water to add and this is what the package says "for hot serving: Pour contents, add hot water (250ml) stir and serve instantly."  I'm not in Europe or Mexico.  Who in the heck in the US cooks by ml's?  I'm assuming its milliliters?  If I hadn't had the internet I wouldn't have known to add a cup of hot water to the powder.<br /><br />Ok, smells nice but a little spicy, take a sip and whew it knocked my head off.  It wasn't spicy like hot pepper spicy but like 180 proof spicy and it burned my throat all the way down.  Can't say that this has any proof liquor in it and it does smell like lemons a little but can't tell you exactly what it does taste like.<br /><br />Would I get it again?  Heck NO.  This stuff was beyond nasty and I can eat or drink just about anything.  But, just to give it the benefit of the doubt I refrigerated it and tasted it the following morning.  Still nasty.<br /><br />And another thing, I'm not really sure if it is caffeine free or not since I didn't go to sleep until 3:30 that am.

review/text: The instructions called for adding 6oz hot water. I added 8oz but still thought the taste was quite strong. You could probably dilute it with 12oz and be fine. Even so it has a strong ginger taste -  much more so than say ginger ale. The lemon gives it a bit of acidity as well. It almost too much. The taste is not bad but there's a lot of it. Wasn't my favorite.

review/summary: Taste Good.
review/text: I received this product free as part of Amazon.com's vine program to generate reviews for new products. Since I have problems with digestion, I am always looking for products that can be good for digestion and this is Ginger which is good for it. OK so what can I tell you, this taste good, I like it. It taste like a ginger tea, it is not bitter but it has a kick so I am surmising it is real ginger. Having said that, I cannot confirm it because they only sent me one packet and thee no info on it, and not a package; So I cannot review whats in it as to how natural it is or not. I don't even know if its real Ginger or flavor. So all I can do hear is tell you it tastes good.

review/summary: 80 calories per cup
review/text: I love this tea or at least I did when I first tried it. It has a very effervescent, gingery kinda taste. Now I think my taste buds have gone numb to the stuff. And it's about 80 calories per cup, which is way too much for a cup of tea...really. So I will probably use it only once in a blue moon. But, no worries, each tea bag is nicely sealed in an aluminum paper-like bag which are all then sealed again in a larger aluminum paper-like bag. I'm tell'in you this stuff could last through the Great Tribulation and still be fresh.

review/summary: Strong Strong Ginger Flavor
review/text: This is an instant powder that you mix with hot water.  The strongest flavor by far is ginger, which has a nice, powerful bite to it.  Behind that, I can taste some lemon and honey flavors, and the aftertaste is mostly lemon and honey.  The lemon and honey has a little bit of an "artificial" taste to it, but not terrible.<br /><br />This would clear your sinuses well, and if a drink made from a lot of ginger and a little lemon and honey sounds good to you, you will probably enjoy it.  Still, I think that I could do better with real ginger (either grated or jarred), lemon juice, and honey.

review/text: I wanted to try this drink mix in club soda rather than as a hot drink.  It did dissolve well into the cold club soda.  I expected the bitter taste of ginger despite that this product is already sweetened.  I did taste just a bit of the lemon flavor.  It is not at all overpowering.  However, I experienced an unexpected and unwanted flavor.  It reminded me of cough syrup and I also experienced a burning sensation in my mouth, throat, and lips.  I chose not to continue drinking this.

review/text: Like most other posters ahead of me, I was struck by just how much ginger there was to taste in this product. After making the drink, the smell was overwhelming but not horrible. The taste wasn't all that pleasant, with the ginger masking the lemon taste. I could detect the lemon when I was making it in the aroma, but none in the taste.<br /><br />I can imagine using this when I am sick, to open my sinuses or help clear my nose and head. But as an everyday drink, no way.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I was a bit skeptical of this Gold Kili lemon & ginger "beverage," but I'm always willing to try out a hot drink which is so easy to make. Upon opening the packet there is a very strong ginger smell, and this translates into a very strong ginger taste. I could really taste the ginger in the back of my throat, and I thought it was actually quite pleasant. I know that If I had a sore throat, it would feel great. The lemon taste comes through too, but not nearly as noticeable as the ginger.<br /><br />This "beverage" is very much like an "instant tea," however it contains no actual tea leaves (thus no caffeine either). It's not as good as a freshly brewed ginger/lemon tea, but it still tastes pretty good. It's also much more convenient. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Healing Ginger Powers Within with a touch of Lemon to Balance in Harmony
review/text: Very Gingery and a snap of Lemon! If you love Ginger, and know its healing powers which sustained within, it is exceptional. Some might find this a little bit too "Sharp" for their taste; but nevertheless, I loved this very much. I can tell very easily that lemongrass was used as I grow lemongrass which is also a healing herb.<br /><br />One may call this "Zippy" and to another too "Strong", however, it is to be sipped slowly, like when I did (see photo) one can always add a little more hot water to weaken it if it is too strong. I prefer mine straight up (no sugar, no milk, just the way they drink it overseas - naturally). It does wonders for sleep, colds, tired and aching body, all the way to being "stressed out".<br /><br />The balance of Ginger and Lemon works in harmony. It is helpful to have soothing acoustic music softly playing (if you are sipping this before bed time) or outside in a serenity garden. Let your mind just relax and become calm, you will feel the effects of the powers of Ginger and Lemon work in you.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this for those who dislikes having to take OTC (over the counter) medications and seeks natural healing powers from the earth. This would be one of the many products available from Gold Kili.

review/summary: Very Strong Ginger Taste with Lemon Undertones
review/text: This product is very easy to make. I just popped some water in the microwave for 2 minutes til it was hot, open up the packet, dropped all the crystals in, and stirred. It was instant hot ginger tea.<br /><br />Taste: My mom makes homemade ginger tea all the time, so I am very used to the strong ginger taste. Homemade or real ginger tea has a spiciness to it, and you will feel the spiciness in your throat. Most commercial ginger tea has the taste without the 'kick' of spiciness. You will experience the 'kick', and its a matter of personal preference if you like the spiciness or not, but fresh ginger is supposed to have this 'kick'.<br /><br />The honey and lemon ingredients fused together and is what gives this beverage its undertone. The amazon page describes this item as a beverage mix, but it takes more like instant tea than anything else.<br /><br />Looks: A yellowish brown, it resembles in terms of look like Lipton lemon tea (mines was darker than the tea pictured on the product picture)<br /><br />The ingredients appear to be 100% natural (there is also a Halal-safe symbol in the back, if it makes any different to anyone. Did not see any Kosher symbols)<br /><br />This product is probably good for the winter cold or flu days, as ginger does have medicinal qualities/benefits. I don't see myself drinking this all the time, just because I prefer Chai tea instead.

review/text: The ginger flavor in this product is very sharp. It actually has a bit of a burn, almost as if you would have put a touch of cayenne pepper in it. But this is the pungency you would find in a raw bit of ginger.<br />I didn't taste any lemon actually, and the product probably needed a little bit more sweetness to off<br />set the sharp ginger taste. The granules inside the pouch are like Ovaltine and instantly dissolved. Overall if you like a strong in your face tea this would be for you.

review/summary: Brown rusty colored, spicy drink that I couldn't even finish, tastes really bad
review/text: I used one packet in a large cup and added hot water. I thought this drink would be yellow but it ended up looking dark brown and I would compare it to rusty looking water. I had never tried a lemon ginger drink before and didn't entirely know what to expect. I figured it would be like a strong lemon flavored tea. Instead I got rust colored and spicy hot cup of disgusting water. I could taste the lemon but the ginger was incredibly strong and was quite honestly the nastiest thing I have ever drunk. I forced myself to consume about half of the cup to give it an honest try but ended up pouring the rest down the sink and will never try again. It also left my lips tingly as if I had just eaten a bunch of hot peppers. I know everyone has different taste but I find it difficult to believe that some people actually like this stuff.

review/summary: not everything that smells delicious usually tastes as such
review/text: I usually make my own ginger-lemon tea, most often to keep colds at bay (as per the recommendation of Kimberly Snyder in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892322">The Beauty Detox Solution: Eat Your Way to Radiant Skin, Renewed Energy and the Body You've Always Wanted</a> (her immunity tea recipe is also available on her blog).<br /><br />I'm always looking for an on-the-go alternative to making the tea from scratch for the time when one is traveling and might not have the option of buying fresh ginger and fresh lemon, but at the time when one is more susceptible to a cold (lower immunity due to stress, jetlag, lack of sleep, etc.). Having to only add hot water definitely saves a lot of effort of tracking down the ingredients and time to actually peeling the ginger, squeezing the lemon, etc.<br /><br />I have tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and found those to be very heavy on the ginger. Comparatively, Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage, which similarly comes packaged in a bag and needs to be mixed with water, doesn't taste overwhelmingly gingery.<br /><br />However, the Gold Kili product tastes incredibly sugary. It's the kind of drink that gets worse the more you try it. The first sip seems acceptable, the second seems iffy, and then before you know it, your body decided that it's a bit more sugar than you bargained for. I appreciate the fact that it's caffeine-free, but must it be overwhelmingly sweet to block the taste of ginger?

review/summary: A rare review for me
review/text: I seldom give a one star review, usually trying to find something positive about any product, but with this one, I found it lousy.  As a ginger fan, I was eager to receive the packet and conduct a side by side tasting with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and asked a friend from Jamaica to join me.  First of all, this product is tiny granules that are much darker than the Prince of Peace product.  When mixed with hot water, rather than being a lovely gold, it is a brown.  The first taste was awful and I mean really awful.  My friend added some sweetener to hers thinking it would be an improvement, but it was an unsuccessful attempt.  I felt the lemon flavor overwhelmed the ginger flavor, yet there was some heat from the ginger that tried to come forward.  The flavor was extremely unbalanced and tasted more like the taste of a lemon which has been cut and stored in the refrigerator, turning brown and developing a rancid flavor that creeps into the nose.  My friend held her nose and drank her half cup but I could not force mine down.  Instead, I gladly drank the other beverage.

review/summary: Very stong on the ginger!
review/text: I only used about one third of the little packet in my mug and then used hot water. I like ginger so I was happy with the strong flavor. I am also going to add it to my homemade lemonade for a little "kick". In lieu of full disclosure, I tasted absolutely no lemon in the beverage.<br /><br />This is pre-sweetened. The little bag I received did not have the ingredient list, so I don't know which sweetener was used. I will say it did not seem to have the funny after-feel in my mouth and throat that I get from artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />If you are a ginger person, you will enjoy this immensely. It is a great morning drink.

review/summary: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix
review/text: If you love food that leaves your mouth burning long after a Mexican meal, and if you adore the taste of ginger, you'll love this beverage. Over-poweringly- piquant and heavily overwhelmed with the taste of ginger, this hot drink would really warm you up on that cold winter night. I am mad about ginger, and I crave spicy foods that burn my mouth for hours, so I enjoyed this beverage, once. All this said, I didn't love it, and I won't buy it. The ginger is overpowering, even for me, almost completely masking the light lemon and honey taste.<br /><br />If you are craving a rich, sweet drink to warm you up, this is not it. If you don't enjoy mouth-burning delicacies, this is not for you! However, ginger is very therapeutic for certain health conditions, so this may be a more appropriate use for this product.

review/summary: Enjoyable
review/text: I've been wanting to up my ginger consumption due to the alleged anti-inflammatory properties of ginger, and so have been looking for a ginger tea or beverage that's reasonably priced, easy, tasty, and not full of sugar or artificial flavor. This basically fits the bill, and if I had been able to try more than one packet of it, I might even have rated it five stars.<br /><br />The one pack I got, I drank cold, because I imagine that's how I'd normally do it. I do love ginger, and this has a very clean, fresh, and spicy ginger flavor. It's sweet, but not too sweet (and I'm very sensitive to things being too sweet!), and the sweet flavor also tastes clean and natural, without the chemicaliness that so many sweetened beverages have. The lemon flavor is subtle but definitely present, and makes it taste a little bit like iced tea.<br /><br />I'm not sure, after one packet, if I'm ready to take the plunge to buy 72 packets, but this is very good, and may be exactly the product I've been looking for.

Granted, I don't just pick up a chunk of ginger and toss it in my mouth and start munching.<br />That is what I think I can compare this to. *I don't know; maybe this is what this tea was made for: those kinds of people.* According to the packet, you just pour the packet (implied ALL) into a cup, add 250ml (a little over 8 oz) of hot water into it, and presto! PURE. NASTINESS!<br /><br />This is the strongest tea I think I've tasted/tried to drink in a LONG. TIME. >.&lt;<br />I tried to dilute it, which helped some, but the overall taste was just.....AWFUL! The first time or two I sipped it, it tasted bad, but then I thought it was due to something I had recently ate; so I drank some (regular, non-flavoured) water and waited a minute or two - also allowing time for tea to cool down. But none of that helped. :(<br />It was just too strong for me. It wasn't bitter, but it just left a nasty, almost dirt-like taste in the mouth. It was just too much. I couldn't drink it and ended up pouring it out.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this unless you are a ginger-LOVER...and even then I'd be hesitant. : \

review/summary: Too bitter for me...
review/text: I love ginger - I have been known to make pots of tea from fresh ginger and honey, and I'm finishing off a ginger syrup that I made that is fantastic with bubbly water (and even vodka). So, I was looking forward to trying this. Having tried it, I can say that I would not ever purchase this.<br /><br />I tried it hot first, following the instructions (then putting half in the fridge to cool). First, it doesn't look at all like the picture on the outside of the foil packet. Instead of a lovely golden yellow, it is the light brown of a beef or vegetable broth. Hoping that wasn't a harbinger of things to come, I sat down to enjoy the flavor. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it. There was VERY little lemon flavor - more like a slight lemon aftertaste, and only if you're really looking for it. The overall flavor is much more bitter than fresh ginger would be, with an almost medicinal taste. The ginger bite is there, and is about the only thing that really reminds me of what ginger should be.<br /><br />Then I tried it cold (with an ice cube to help cool it down). The flavor didn't seem as strong, but it still had the bitter taste. After those first few sips of both hot and cold, I honestly couldn't drink any more of this. The aftertaste was too much and I genuinely did not want to finish the drink. So - I didn't.<br /><br />Overall, if you're used to something like Stash Ginger Honey tea, or even tea made from fresh ginger, then this is no substitute. The flavor profile is very different, and the bitterness is hard to get past. If you have the opportunity to try a smaller amount before purchasing this, then I would highly recommend you do so. It definitely seems like something that would appeal to a very specific (and possibly limited) audience.

review/summary: Weird After-Taste
review/text: I'm sitting here drinking a big mug of this stuff as I write this--my first mug.<br /><br />I love ginger tea, so I fully expected to love this. I should have been more skeptical of this powdered concoction.<br /><br />When I poured the hot water into my mug, the gingery smell hit me in the face and I was excited. My first couple of sips seemed to confirm what my nose had anticipated: a delicious, pungent, gingery punch. The ginger really is IN-YOUR-FACE, like a good ginger beer, which I happen to love. It's hot on the tongue and has a nice bite in the back of your throat. Honestly, that's how ginger tea, ginger beer, or ginger anything is SUPPOSED to taste. It may be a bit strong for some people, but those people probably don't really like ginger. It's actually a little sweet for my tastes, but not so much that it was a problem for me. My initial thought was that I really liked it.<br /><br />As I kept sipping, though, that sweetness grew, and eventually started to taste... funny. Now, more than half way through my mug, I have a strange, lingering after taste in my mouth that is not very pleasant. I don't know what's in this stuff, but I suspect saccharine, Stevia, aspartame, or some other artificial sweetener... the after taste is almost reminiscent of bubble gum, but not in a good way. I'm not getting so much ginger flavor anymore, only its hotness.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish my mug. But I wonder if maybe it's just me. My girlfriend comes home and I hand her the still warm mug and say "here, Ginger tea!" She sips once. Seems pleased. She sips again a few moments later. Seems to hesitate. By the third sip, she looks at the mug, then looks at me, "I don't think I like this". Down the drain it went.

I was really looking forward to trying this beverage.<br /><br />Then, I actually took a swallow, and it was so awful I could barely get it down.  The initial taste is of a nice ginger beverage, but then this unpleasant aftertaste took over, rising from the back of my throat and quickly encompassing my entire mouth.  It was accompained by the worst tingling/burning sensation I've ever felt in my life.  And that was when I began to choke.<br /><br />After I got that initial swallow down, I decided to wait a few minutes and try it again.  Same result.<br /><br />Reader, I poured the rest of this vile concoction down the drain.  And my drain now runs quite a bit better.

review/text: I love lemons and hot drinks like tea and cocoa, so Gold Kili's Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix seemed like something I'd really enjoy.  Instead it had a terrible medicinal taste with a bit of a burn going down, then there was an aftertaste.  I couldn't even make it through an entire cup of this beverage mix.

review/summary: Need More Info On Kili's Package
review/text: Old Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix was fragrant when added to 8 oz. of  boiling water, and appeared to be darker than in smaller cup in the photo. The ingredients were not listed on the side of the box which always concerns me when trying a new product. I'm not a fan of sugar. Also, the directions list only the metric amount of water to add, not a plus if you don't know metric conversions (and I don't) and nothing about the depth of flavor aspect.<br /><br />I am usually very fond of ginger and lemon drinks but as I said with no ingredient list, I was uncomfortable drinking it.  It was tasty enough, but not all that remarkable to me. I have discovered since drinking it that dried honey was the sweetener, something that really should be promoted on the box somewhere. I like to be in control of how sweet something is going to be. A lack of information on the packaging would keep me from buying this product in the future.<br />On the plus side: For an instant beverage, it wasn't bad. If you were traveling, taking it to work or camping it would be great to have along because of the minimal amount of effort it takes to prepare.

review/summary: Perfectly Peppery-Ginger
review/text: The ginger is so strong it is almost peppery. I don't really taste the lemon. It is nicely sweet. Since I'm a big fan of ginger, I love this tea. The ingredients are not listed on the individual packet that I received as a trial. Amazon says that it is a product of Singapore and that the ingredients are as follows: Ginger, Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose) and Natural Lemon Flavor. This is being sold in groups of 6 boxes. I'd rather just buy it 1 box at a time. Regardless, I do plan to buy this in the future.

review/text: If you don't love ginger (real ginger, not the pale echo of ginger in ginger ale), you won't like this beverage.  If you are a ginger fan you will enjoy it.  Ginger does have documented medicinal qualities- in particular, it is helpful for those suffering from motion sickness and nausea generally.  Worth a try for herbal tea drinkers and ginger fans.

review/summary: Not too much lemon, good ginger flavor
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:13 Mins<br /><br /></span>I wish Amazon would allow a longer video so I could share the entire experience. This drink is somewhat complex if you can taste beyond the huge ginger impact of it. First there is a sweet honey-ish warmth, followed by an almost immediate rush of ginger. Next is a pepper-y taste and feel as and after it goes down. The pepper stays on the front of the mouth and the back of the throat for quite a while. Very little lemon. There is enough sweetness to be able to stand up to a healthy squeeze from a lemon wedge. Adding more water made it less intense, but was still a bit too sweet. If you enjoy a spicy sweet hot beverage, and love ginger, this might be a favorite for you.

review/summary: A hot beverage mix for the ginger lover...
review/text: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix is a dry mixture of ginger, honey & natural lemon flavor, packaged in foil pouches. It dissolves quickly & completely in hot water. I added one packet to an 8 oz. mug of hot water. Wow! the ginger was spicy! It was perfectly sweetened with a hint of lemon.  My Indian friend who  loves ginger thought it was too gingery & too sweet.  After she added twice as much hot water to her drink, she thought it was perfect.<br />The directions state: "You can control the depth of favor by how much (mix) you add to your cup."<br /><br />If you love ginger, you'll probably enjoy this beverage mix. And, like my Indian friend, you also might get more than one serving from each foil pouch.

review/summary: Well I think it's delicious...
review/text: All the haters on here calling this tea disgusting and cold medicine-like must be newbies to Ginger. I understand that ginger has a very spicy, in-your-face flavor, and it certainly isn't for everybody, but for those of us who DO like the taste, please don't be turned off by some of the more nasty reviews. Personally, I think this tea is delicious.<br /><br />Each packet contains an unique mix of ginger, lemon, and honey that instantly dissolves in hot water. No messy tea bags necessary. Once poured, you are immediately greeted with a lovely aroma--and once tasted, you are immediately transformed to a safe, warm place. It is spicy. It has tang. But it's perfectly sweetened with soothing honey (and a small hint of lemon) and the result, in my opinion, is one of the most good feeling teas I've ever drank. I wasn't sick when I tried it, but I felt 1000x better after drinking a cup. It was weird. I felt fine, and then I felt so much better!<br /><br />I've heard ginger has lots of natural heeling properties, especially when a cold pops up. From now on I think I'm going to be keeping this in my medicine cabinet as well as my regular cabinet. It's a delicious drink for any occasion.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you have to buy a 6-pack...

review/summary: sharp, sharp, SHARP ginger taste.....
review/text: I tried this not knowing if I would like it or not, I love ginger ale, ginger beer, ginger oookies, but don't like hunks of it in an entree, so I thought the ginger with lemon sounded really appealing as a hot drink I could have at work.  It came in a little pouch like a teabag, but with loose bits.  You apparently can drink it hot or cold, and I tried hot.  It wouldn't have mattered much though, the ginger taste is so extreme it would only be for people who LOVE ginger in all of it's forms.  I couldn't finish it, it was just too much for me.  So, for ginger lovers only all others should probably steer clear.

review/summary: Very Ginger-y and Sweet
review/text: After looking at the reviews here I rather thought I would NOT like this beverage, but I actually liked it quite a bit.  Maybe the difference was that I added a lot more water than the directions called for.  50% more.<br /><br />I do wish it was less sweet, and I certainly wish that there was a comprehensive list of ingredients, but I thought the Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon beverage was a great evening alternative to caffeinated teas and I think it would make a faboo hot toddy for those cold winter nights.<br /><br />The best part of the experience for me was the spicy ginger taste.  I happen to like real ginger in cooking and in soft drinks and this was strong and good.  (Ginger can be taken for some tummy disorders by the way.)<br /><br />Overall I liked this zippy beverage.  It was even pleasant when cold.  It's not something I'd drink all the time as it's very very sweet, but it settled very well and the taste was nice.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Add this to your tea, you'll feel better
review/text: A while back I saw on Dr. Oz that ginger is good for me so I went to Trader Joe's and got some.  Trouble is that when I put it in my tea, I discovered that (to put it mildly) my taste buds and ginger do not get along.  Plus it's a lot of work to prepare it.  However, I hadn't given up on ginger simply because I could feel that it was good for me and so kept right on drinking the stuff.  So you can imagine how happy I was when I saw the Gold Kili Instant Ginger and Lemon beverage.  To me this seemed like it could well be the perfect compromise.  I figured I could add this to my hot tea with honey, get (most ) of the benefits of the ginger without too much of the taste.  I was right.<br /><br />For me (and I have to say that I prefer not to have it too strong) the best combination is one regular (not heaping) tea spoon of the powder, one regular tea spoon of honey and a regular tea bag in a mug. I drink my tea with almond milk so that further disguises the taste.  Mind you, I can still taste the ginger (it's very potent) but it's not overwhelming the way ginger roots are.  And it's much less of a hassle to prepare.<br /><br />Drink this several times per day (twice for me) and you will feel better.  At least I did.

review/summary: Pretty potent stuff
review/text: I didn't feel well this morning, and went into the kitchen, and there was the packet of Gold Kili Lemon Ginger drink mix. Lemon and Ginger is just the thing for an iffy stomach, so I put on the hot pot and got the tea water going.<br /><br />When I opened the envelope, it wasn't quite what I was expecting; I think I had a powdery substance in mind. The product here is granular, and dissolves immediately upon hitting the hot water. I let it steep for a minute or so (don't know if that's recommended or not) and I must say, it is a powerfully gingery drink. It did clear my head, and as ginger will do, it heated up my mouth a lot too.<br /><br />It might be a nice item to keep on hand for times when you don't feel well. It did make me feel better. Next time I might put it in a slightly larger mug, though; it is VERY potent.

review/summary: Just as described.
review/text: I am a complete novice about ginger tea and ginger beer (didn't even know there were such things until I read a review of this product).  I was most surprised when first drinking this beverage mix, added to hot water, at the strength of the flavor and the bite it leaves on the tongue.  There is nothing tepid about it.  However, if the drink is too strong for your taste, it can be weakened, but still taste good, by putting it on ice.<br /><br />The flavor of the honey and lemon is easily distinguishable.  So you have to be a lover of ginger in liquid form to really appreciate this instant drink.  I like the fact there are no bags, it's easy to prepare.  You just pour.<br /><br />It's really up to one's individual taste as to whether or not this drink will be appealing.  As for myself, I think I might drink it as a remedy for indigestion (rather than over-the-counter pharmacy remedies); however, for pleasure, I would choose something else.

It might would help, but I couldn't get past the taste.....it was very spicy in that it burned my throat.  I used the whole packet in a large mug of hot water.....I may have mixed it too strong or it may be supposed to taste rather spicy.  I'm not familiar with ginger so I really don't know.  I just didn't care for the taste of this product, but I would like to try other of their herbal teas.

review/text: I love drinking hot tea and some of my favorites have lots of lemon. Figuring the ginger would be an interesting addition I thought I would give this a try. The drink dissolved completely into a dark yellow brew but the ginger flavor was way to powerful and I couldn't taste any lemon at all. I used 8 oz of water and when that was too strong I watered it down but that did nothing to diminish the ginger. In fact the tea even had a "hot" taste as if there was chili in it. I'll pass on this one.

If you're looking for something different, you should try this beverage. It would be good hot or over ice.

review/summary: STRONG Ginger taste, works best for me mixed wih iced tea but I like it!
review/text: I love strong Ginger flavors but I recognice that most people will find this drink, intended to ve served hot, as a very strong Ginger experience & possibly too strong.  I only got one sachet tio try which wasn't really enough to judge the product by conpletely but I could easily see myself consuming this as a hot beverage during times when I didn't feel well or was queasy from the long baot ride back from Catalina.  The Ginger is bracingly strong when hot but lightly sweetened.  It reminded me a bit of the Trader Joe's Lemon Echinacea drink I mix with my Iced tea so I waited for it to cool down and mixed it  with 2 parts Iced tea and 1 part of the reminder of the sachet and allowed to cool.  Nowe THAT worked for me.  It has a strong Ginger aroma and adds a nice ZING to my iced tea.<br /><br />I'd like to have some of this on hand for when I next get the cold or flu because strong Ginger drinks do settle my stomach and sooth my congestion.  I just wish I had a few more servings to try in several ways so I could give this a proper review.<br /><br />I would say, if you liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TPKAN4">Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies, 6.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, which are SUPER GINGER SNAPS, then you will probably enjoy this as both a hot drink and a either an iced drink by itself or mixed with your tea od choice.  There are no ugly aftertastes or icky sweetness to content with and it is an interesting, medicine-free method of treating a cold.  I can see myself keeping some on my shelf or just such occasion!

review/summary: I am a ginger fanatic and I liked this.
review/text: The flavor is almost entirely ginger.  It is barely sweetened and not at all lemony.  I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.  Shame.

review/summary: Ginger, and what's the aftertaste?
review/text: I like this drink.<br /><br />But, I LOVE ginger. This has a strong ginger taste, and I think that's great. If you're more accustomed to the bland idea of a hint of ginger in some salad dressing or Asian food, then taste the real thing, straight up, first. If you don't love ginger, you will not like this product. And yes, it's a little spicy--that's the ginger!<br /><br />Next, I know that honey is more natural and sounds wholesome and everything, but it's just not my favorite sweetener. Whatever they do to powder it, along with the other sweeteners listed on the label, gives it kind of a weird aftertaste. Ginger itself is kind of sweet, and the bit of lemon is a good complement, but the aftertaste here is just weird.<br /><br />I actually think I'll go back to dumping plain old real ginger into a cup of tea, despite the need to strain the cup or ignore the dregs, for the taste I love. It's not as convenient as the little packet, but it does taste better.<br /><br />(Why three stars? It's not terrible, and was maybe even good; it's just not great.)

review/summary: Bitter aftertaste - but ok for emergencies when traveling!
review/text: Fresh ginger is spicy and hot. Clean your sinuses out hot. In all my years of consuming grated ginger, powdered ginger, ginger ale, ginger beer, candied ginger and a favorite when I have a writing project due, chocolate dipped ginger... none of it has ever tasted bitter. Just hot and spicy. A tiny bit citrusy. But clean and mouth tingling.<br /><br />Not this. It is a powder in a foil packet. I boiled fresh filtered water in a clean kettle and poured it into a clean mug. I could taste the ginger and the lemon flavor... then a very bitter aftertaste. Old, gone around the bend, wheat paste flavor. If I was sick with a very bad cold it would serve the purpose to clean my head out... but if you have access to a fridge at all - get a jar of grated ginger and a bottle of lemon juice and mix your own. A teaspoon of honey, teaspoon bottled grated ginger and teaspoon lemon juice with 8 oz. boiling water and you'll feel just like new. Or pour boiling water over a few slices of fresh ginger and a fresh-squeezed lemon wedge and let it seep 5 minutes -- but I have trouble with fresh lemons shriveling in the crisper drawer before I use them.<br /><br />This powder would be good to put in your carry-on luggage to clear your head on a long trip. But I think I actually prefer ... trade secret here ... lemon-flavored Gatorade made with hot water. I think will actually prevent a cold if you drink two cups the minute your throat gets itchy.<br /><br />Oh! Ginger is also good for digestion. Again - I'd prefer a spoon of fresh grated in a tub of yogurt to this powder - but this powder would help if you were traveling.<br /><br />Good luck! May you never need to know what hot Gatorade tastes like!

review/summary: Perhaps a hit for chai lovers or cold-sufferers, though not exactly my cup of tea
review/text: I have to admit; I have a cup of this beverage right in front of me, piping hot, and I as my three-year old son would say, "this is not my favorite."<br /><br />(And this is where we say, "BUT.")<br /><br />But the poor showing of three stars I am giving this product is truly based off of the way I perceive the taste... My palate has never liked those hard honey candies that some people -- like my Dad -- adore, and that's the prime flavor I pick our instantly.  The same honey sweetness is right there on the front line of the palate.  But there are things that even I like about the product; the ginger taste soon separates itself from the honey flavor, and the after-swallow finish is very spicy, like cloves, and remains strong for some time.  It's strong spiciness does reach beyond your palate and into your sinuses - I can see this as being an excellent beverage for someone who has a cold (sore throat especially) and is looking for a zippy drink for relief.<br /><br />Also, I can see adding a shot of your favorite brandy or spiced rum to this drink to make it one of those special "toddies" you allow yourself in those winter times when the sniffles have got you.  In those times, I imagine even my taste buds would appreciate a Gold Kili Ginger Lemon Toddy in a hot bath.  :^)

review/summary: Tastes artificial
review/text: I saved this hot drink for a time when I wanted a beverage after a large meal. When the time came, and I was in a kitchen with nothing but water to drink, I tried it. It tasted, mostly, as you might expect: a kick of ginger and tang of lemon.<br /><br />Then the "honey" kicks in. And by "honey" I mean that's what the Ingredients say--but they also list to of those -ose sugars. Result is an artificial taste. You could put ginger, honey, and lemon in hot water a million times and not come up with that artificial taste.<br /><br />Because of the aftertaste, I won't be buying any of this. It's ultimately gross.

review/summary: I liked it, but tastes vary
review/text: Before sampling this, I had the advantage of reading other reviews, and I knew that this could be strong. I only had one packet, and the instructions told me to mix the contents with 250 ml of water. That's about 8 1/2 ounces, so I decided to try to divide the packet into two portions. I mixed half with 4 ounces and the other half with 6 ounces. I figured one would be slightly stronger and the other slightly less strong.<br /><br />The reviews were right. The ginger taste prevails and is quite strong. Fortunately, I like ginger. I'm a big fan of ginger beer, for example (when I can find it). There is a hint of lemon, but it is nearly lost amid all the ginger flavor. I squeezed a bit of lemon into the more dilute version, and I think I got it about perfect.<br /><br />Recommended for ginger fans.

review/summary: WAY too strong
review/text: When you see "ginger & lemon beverage mix" a reasonable person expect a balanced refreshment. That is not what you get. If you like to munch on ginger in your spare time, this is a drink for you. The ginger taste is overbearing and overpowering, and the only hint of lemon I got was a sourness in the aftertaste.<br /><br />Speaking of, the aftertaste so strong, as strong as but distinct from the main taste, that I ended up throwing half my glass down the drain. I've drank some odd things in my day (passion fruit and aloe juice, for instance), but I just couldn't tolerate this. And, just for good measure, the package was a bear to open for me.<br /><br />On the plus side, the mix is some nice yellowish pellets (about the size of the wax ball you see on new pens sometimes) that dissolve quickly and cleanly in hot water. But when the best thing I have to say about a drink is how nicely the mix dissolves, something's not right.

review/summary: mediocre flavor - I prefer Prince of Peace brand
review/text: This is a ginger drink. From reading the other reviews, it seems a lot of people expected it to be some sort of herbal tea-like beverage. It's not. It's a ginger drink like the kind Asians enjoy and/or use as medicine. However, it's not a particularly good one. I much prefer Prince of Peace brand: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a><br />This Gold Kili drink doesn't have the warm spicy ginger flavor that a good ginger drink should have. It tastes sort of bitter and tart. It didn't make my throat feel better when I was sick. I tried it hot. Maybe it would be better as a cold drink? I think I wouldn't buy it to try again.

review/summary: Strong Ginger With A HINT of Lemon, Dissolves Very Well
review/text: I was kind of excited to try this tea out.  I've been looking for something that would be easy to put in my purse that would dissolve and not have fake sugars like Aspartame in it, so I was excited to see that this was sweetened by honey and lemon.<br /><br />That said, you have to REALLY love Ginger to enjoy this drink.  If you do, you will likely LOVE this tea.  I am not a huge fan of Ginger (I love to cook with it, but not have it as a main flavor), so this really wasn't my favorite drink.  I thought there should have been more lemon in it.<br /><br />It did dissolve really nicely and didn't leave a film of grit in the bottom of the glass.  I do actually want to give this tea another try... in a recipe.  I think it would be great in chicken broth or when making chicken salad.

review/text: I am a big fan of herbal teas, but when my stomach was feeling sick, I remembered that I had this, and boiled up some water, and made this tea. All I can say is YUK! The ginger is so over powering, that I couldn't taste any lemon or honey. There was kind of a rancid taste to it, and it leaves a horrible after taste. I was thinking about trying to doctor it up with more lemon and honey, but the smell literally got me sick, so I dumped it out.

review/summary: Great for someone who loves ginger!
review/text: Wow. Lots of ginger in this drink, anyone who in their head (like myself) makes an assumption that this is a lightly flavored beverage would be way off.<br /><br />I poured my packet into a mug of hot water. Consistency-wise this is thicker and closer to a hot chocolate or cider rather than a clear tea.  You have to really, really like ginger to like this drink.  I tried to drink as much of it as I could, but it actually overwhelmed me. I'd have to have watered it down greatly to drink a cup's worth.<br /><br />For people who really like ginger this is a great alternative to tea or hot chocolate for a warm winter drink as you get that extra zing of flavor with ginger.  The powder mixed really well and easily with the hot water.<br /><br />I won't be drinking this again, only because my love of ginger isn't that strong, but I'd recommend it to someone who did really like ginger.

review/text: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix, 6.72-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I prepared the beverage with 8oz of hot water (about 250ml per instructions). The first sip reminds me of the Trader Joe's Ginger Candy, it packs a punch! If you are a ginger fan I think you will like this "tea" very much. It has a robust ginger taste with a lemony finish behind it. There is some nice sweetness to the blend too.<br /><br />For me personally, it's too strong. My taste in ginger is more to the pickled stuff served with sushi.  It's not bad, to me, but I think it's really more for people who crave ginger more than I do. I have a friend who's like that but wasn't able to share my sample with her.<br /><br />As for the actual powder that's in the foil envelope. It's a crystalline sandy colored granular powder. It dissolved quickly in the hot water from my Keurig machine. If you're in the ginger loving class of consumer, I'm betting this beverage will please. If you like your "teas" more mellow, this is not for you.

review/summary: I like it a lot . . .
review/text: In quite a lot of the world, ginger is used as a quasi-medicinal agent in foods and beverages.  It's delicious and adds a pit of heat to everything from curries to hot tea.  I've been a fan for some time, but frankly, ginger is kind of a pain to deal with on a "casual" basis - it dries out if not consumed fairly quickly, it's difficult to peel and it's not always available at the local grocery store.<br /><br />I especially miss it in a late night tea.  There's something about it I find relaxing, and this product fills that need without a lot of mess.  The lemon / ginger / honey bland tastes great.  The Gold Kili brand is widely touted as a digestion aid (as ginger is in general), and though I can't claim any problems with digestion (!), I do like to brew a bit to enjoy with Thai or Indian food.  My only complaint about his product is that it's a bit on the expensive side (as I write this.)  Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Jasmine matcha - light vegetal flavor - not heavy floral
review/text: This matcha smells like a nice light matcha.  I really love jasmine so I had hoped that the scent would come thru, but it did not.  For those that are not into a strong floral jasmine flavor, this is the jasmine matcha for you!<br />My first impression of this matcha was, "Where is the jasmine?"  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I was unable to detect a "flavor" in this matcha.  That of course does NOT mean it will taste bad, just not what I expected.<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I'm becoming a matcha pro now.  No need to go looking for my tools, they were all handy.  This matcha brings me to a place where I imagine sitting with friends passing around a matcha bowl contemplating our day.  I would love to share this outdoors on a warm spring or summer day.  Today is 60 degrees so I have to use my imagination.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar and 6 oz of water.  Last time I had a total of 7 oz and the matcha was bitter.  After going back to my 8 oz I tried the matcha and still felt that it was a touch bitter.  I added 2 more oz of water and a bit more sugar.  I know it's psychological, but I feel healthier drinking this matcha!  It's just so light and fresh and reminds me of a health food drink.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes stayed the same, light and vegetal.  I am now curious how the Pure Jasmine Matcha compares to this one.  I was torn between them when placing my order.  The quality of the matcha is very good.<br />I'm not sure if this matcha will make my keep cupboard.  Red Leaf Tea has so many flavor offerings that I think I'll try those before going back to this matcha which doesn't seem far off my normal matcha.  My plan for the rest of Jasmine is to mix it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  I ordered the large size so I will save a bit for next spring when I can enjoy it outside.<br />To try Jasmine Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: A nice blend, but...
review/text: I love Great River Orangic Milling products. So I was very excited to add this to my repertoire. I guess I didn't read quite as carefully as I should have. I expected this to be a blend that contained oat flour as well. It's basically just their whole wheat bread flour (an excellent product) mixed with oats. It's a very nice blend. But I buy the whole wheat bread flour in the large bags, and I can easily add my own oats (in fact, this seller sells big bags of those too). So it's not exactly what I was expecting.<br /><br />I'm still giving it 5 stars because it's a good product. I've used it by itself and blending with white bread flour and had excellent results both times. But I just wanted to make clear that it's not a blend with oat flour if that's what you're looking for.
