review/summary: Don't  Get Too Excited About Ice Cream of the Month Club
review/text: I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut, a very bland vanilla frozen yogurt, some type of caramel,that didn't taste at all like caramel(I tried,but couldn't give it away), also 2 peppermint in one month. I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 "neopolitan"(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare. I felt I should write this review because the person who sent this gift had no reviews to read and had no idea that I might receive duplicates, along with the vanilla custard and neopolitan.

review/text: I love this Balsamic, it is beautifully flavorful.  I purchased at a local store a couple years ago, and have since tried several others in the same price range.  This balsamic was by far my favorite.  Aged 12 years, the consistency is perfect.  Sweet, full bodied, and complex, I won't buy any other balsamic in this price range. Love The Stuff!!!<br /><br />In addition, The bottles are great, I keep the bottles after they have been emptied for use with my other vinegars.

review/text: This is the best of the Goya jams for my money.  Not cloyingly sweet, but sweet.  Not overwhelmingly aromatic, but undeniably mango. A judicious dab on toast gives a happy start to the day without kicking the calorie count.  Clever wife makes a tangy-sweet salad dressing with lemon juice, mango jam and some other magical incantations or stuff.  Nice going Goya.

review/text: Twang doesn't have that odd chemical flavor that other beer salts have.  This is by far the best.  The little long neck bottles always spark conversation and we gladly share with any one who is curious. We always get comments on how good it is and questioned as to where we get it.  I always carry one in my purse so we don't have to do without, or worse, use some other brand!  We have several "disappear" through out the months, they go home in someones pocket and that's okay because we buy it buy the box and always have plenty on hand!

review/text: I used peanut oil for the first time at a friends house, and really liked its high smoke temperature. So I went to get some at my local supermarket and they wanted $7 for a 10 ounce bottle. I decided to wait two days and get this instead. Seems to be a great oil. Fairly tasteless (as most peanut oils are) and has a very high smoke point compared to olive and vegetable oil. For three big bottles for around $20, and you can't really beat this deal.

review/text: My husband has been after me to buy peanut oil to use when making his favorite fried chicken for quite awhile. I finally remembered to do just that.  He is sensitive to certain odors.  Not finding any locally I went on line to Amazon and there it was.  I am very happy with the product.  During cooking it doesn't stink up the house when heated as a lot of other oils do.  Makes great fried chicken. Stores easily do to the design of the bottle.  It was all I hoped it would be.  Frankly, I am pleasently suprised.  Thank you.

review/summary: Love this product!
review/text: I absolutely love this dressing, both on salads or in marinades.  The lime flavor definitely isn't subtle though, which could explain one of the really bad reviews.  I often grill chicken with a chipotle-lime marinade using only this dressing and pureed adobo peppers to taste.  So easy, and best chicken we've ever had, both on its own or added to a chicken chili or tortilla soup.  On salads, this dressing is amazing with goat cheese, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and whatever other vegetables you like.  So delicious I forget that it's a light dressing.  It IS hard to find, but I hope I don't have to resort to buying it here - the price at the time of this review is outrageous!  Surprisingly, the only consistent place that I've been able to find it is Target.

review/summary: Some of the other reviews are for a DIFFERENT flavor
review/text: If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack.<br /><br />This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked.<br /><br />We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different.<br /><br />Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet.<br />When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough.<br /><br />Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />------<br />UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time. I am finding I do better with soaked nuts. I also prefer to eat as close to 100% organic as I can.

review/text: Read the ingredients, this is not a HFCS/processed chocolate bar!  However if you like "REAL" food and are looking to have a slightly sweet snack that is completely good for you then this is it!  I gave up sugar a few months ago, and these bars have been wonderful, a way to satisfy my sweet tooth will all natural fruit-sugar sweetness...the main ingredient in ALL of them (Larabar & Jocalat) is dates, this one also has almonds and cocoa powder, do note that just because it has cocoa powder it does not mean it's sweet, this is unsweetened cocoa powder, the sweetness comes from the dates.  It's a snack you can feel good about eating.  Just make sure you are not expecting a sugary chocolate taste, or you will be disappointed! If you want a real, raw, good for your body, mind and soul snack then I highly recommend.  I also love the Apple Pie Larabar!

They can curb your appetite and give you energy. They are also good for snacks.<br /><br />If I were to have an emergency food supply, Larabars and Jocalats would be in the box, (even though I don't know what the shelf life is for them.)<br /><br />Now about this particular flavor, Chocolate Mint Jocalat:<br /><br />I love this flavor.

I decided to try every flavor and discovered (oddly enough) that I only like the original chocolate. It seemed like most of the other flavors were too dry or something. If you buys these expecting them to taste like a "real" candy bar, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a healthy treat though give them a try.

review/summary: LaraBar Jocalat Chocolate Coffee -- Excellent!
review/text: I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as "food" (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like "dessert".

review/summary: Different (Good!) Chocolate Flavor
review/text: I think that some of the comments that mention that it's not chocolate-y enough or just plain tastes bad might be used to a more milk-chocolate taste rather than a pure chocolate taste. Since, as far as I understand, the only sweetness in this bar comes from the dates, people might be missing the processed sugar and all the other stuff usually mixed in with chocolate.<br />I also thought at first that the bar tasted strange, but I think it was like a city person getting to the countryside and thinking that the fresh air is unbreathable. I was intrigued enough to try a second bar, which I tasted so much better than I remembered. The third was a revelation. Now I crave this flavor all the time, and find that most other chocolate desserts that I used to love taste much too sweet.

They have a very strong orange-y smell (like concentrated orange oil, orange extract, or lots of orange zest) and a zest-like flavor but again, not quite orange or chocolate. But I like them. Weird I guess but they're moist and dense and you can't beat the unctuous quality of a snack that feels naughty, fills you up, and yet is healthy and natural and actually good for you. I'm starting to really like Larabars and hope to try more flavors.

I wish they had more mixed boxes as 16 of the same flavor will wear me down.  If you get a chance, try to Cashew flavor and the Chocolate Coconut Chew -- they're delicious.  So far the only flavor I'm not a fan of is the banana -- the consistency was weird.

review/text: This is a pretty tasty bar with good texture.  Nice simple organic ingredients.  At the end of my case, I thought the taste wasn't as good they tasted like they spoiled even though the exp. date was very good.  These bars make a good snack or meal on the go.  I like to keep them in my bag for times when I'm out past my usual lunch/dinner ect.  They help keep the hunger at bay for a bit & keep you going.  They also make a nice quick meal as long as you have them with something, yogurt/kefir or the like.  The flavor is a mild chocolate nut.  I will buy again, but not by the case I think that was a bit much for me.

review/text: I tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet.  Even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love, I could not finish the box.  I just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and I love them.  I think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot.  I also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars.  The same things I like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike, so it seems like it is all about preference.  I don't like things that are super sweet.  I think milk chocolate is gross, and when I eat chocolate I prefer 85% coco or above.  So, maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not.

review/summary: Satisfy Without Being Overly Sweet
review/text: Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee was the first Larabar that I've ordered. Before the bars arrived at my doorstep, I was expecting a typical fruit-n-nut type of food bar that contains whole pieces of chunky nuts. So I was a little disappointed when I opened one and saw that the nuts were broken into tiny pieces instead. The bar was also shorter than I'd imagined.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the taste didn't disappoint. All the bars were not dry and hard, but instead they were moist and firm even when they were kept in the refrigerator. It would be a different texture if huge chunky nuts are used. Those who found them hard and dry probably got bars that were too close to their sell-by date. My bars had a good 10 months to go before expiring.<br /><br />What I like most is the fact that Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee (and later I found out it applies to other flavors of Larabar as well) these bars were not sickening sweet like other energy bars I've tasted. It's quite sad to taste a food bar prepared with good ingredients being drenched in excessive sweeteners, no matter how healthy the sweetener is touted to be. But this bar did not gross me out like other bars did, and in fact, satisfied my sweet tooth pretty well.<br /><br />Since I am a chocolate lover, especially dark ones, the smell and taste of the cocoa in the bar added to my satisfaction rating. There was also a subtle hint of coffee, but it was almost undetectable if you're not mindful enough.<br /><br />I wish the bars are bigger though. I'm in no way a large man, but I find one bar hardly makes me feel full, though it does stop my hunger pang.<br /><br />After trying this product, I've since moved on to other flavors. I found that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAE">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.8-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> has almost the same taste as this. The coconut shreds in it have no taste but gives a distinctive coconut texture. But since this bar isn't made of organic ingredients, the price is lower than the Jocalat series. If budget is a concern to you, then you may want to consider that bar instead.<br /><br />One tip: As with any food bars, always eat Larabar with a full glass of water. Although not as hard and dry like other bars, it can get a bit dry on the throat when you're near the end.

review/summary: Good option for the overly health-conscious
review/text: Sure, there are no added sugars, but the dates that overpower the flavor are the first ingredient, comprising 21g of sugars/bar, certainly no innocent snack, and with no real flavor in the original flavor. The hazelnuts are lost in that variety, too; had such high expectations and these just fell flat.

review/text: I LOVE Larabars.  I am a very healthy eater and I try to limit sugary desserts as much as possible.  With that said, I occasionally get a sweet tooth.  These are a GREAT alternative to a brownie or other dessert when you feel like indulging without the guilt.  All of these bars have very few ingredients and are made of mostly  fruit and nuts. I also find that just 1 bar is satisfying.<br /><br />These are a good pick if you like dark chocolate.  If you are more of a milk chocolate person you will probably still like them, however they are less sweet and creamy than milk chocolate is, more bittersweet.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these you need to.  With around 200 calories per bar or less, these bars are like having a brownie with less than half the calories.

review/text: I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar. They were dried out and when you tried to take a bit out of the bar it crumbed. The box said they were good until Jan 2012 but they tasted old, dried out, just plan gross. I am not sure if this a bad box or if larabar company needs to redo their bar flavor.Bad product!!!

review/text: These uber-healthy bars do the trick whenever I have a chocolate craving. I try my best to eat "whole food" and this becomes difficult when I am craving something sweet. I used to buy "Clif Bar Nectar" bars, which was essentially the same product. However, since those bars are no longer sold I am so happy that I've found these. Also, the savings are amazing...they cost almost $2 at my "Whole Foods" market. The Hazelnut flavor is my favorite so far but these are almost as amazing. If you care about the quality of the food you eat and love sweets buy them, you won't regret it!

review/summary: Cherry Pie ok, Choco Cherry not so much.
review/text: I have food allergies, and while I am looking for a Chocolate fix, I think this will take a bit to get used to. The Cherry Pie is quite good, and tastes like the center of a fig newton. The Chocolate Cherry, however smells like vinegar, and while at first the flavor is fine, it soon turns into bitter cherry, a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it, a strong vinegar like after-taste. I can get used to it, as frankly I have no other options due to milk and soy allergies, but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt, maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor. Next time I will try the plain chocolate as I hear they get good reviews.<br />Over all, The Cherry pie gets an 8 out of 10, but the Choco-cherry gets a resounding 2.

review/summary: Delicious for a snack or treat
review/text: I should start off by saying I was not instantly a convert to Larabars. I tried a few of the flavors in the regular line (Larabars) and did not prefer them over other snack/meal bars. The Jocalat bars, however, changed my mind. I love how they are the perfect balance of fruits, nuts, and cocoa. You can taste all of the flavors and they all work really well together. The chocolate mint is my favorite because the mint has a really clean natural favor and compliments the chocolate well. It easily takes away my cravings for a chocolate bar. I also really enjoy the chocolate orange and chocolate cherry flavors that are in this line. Now if they just come out with a chocolate banana version I will be in heaven.<br /><br />Despite all my raving it's still important to keep in mind that these DO NOT taste like a candy bar or a baked brownie. They definitely have more of a raw taste to them and you can still taste the dates so if you do not like the flavor of dates you may not like these. I also recommend that you try the flavors before committing to a whole case. I've found the Larabar flavors to be hit or miss with my personal tastes. There are some that I love and enthusiastically buy again and others that don't seem worth the calories.<br /><br />Overall these are great and I like them so much better than Larabar flavors and have recommended them to many friends.

I am a teacher, and I keep these tasty bars in my desk for when I am hungry.  These bars are far healthier than donuts or candy, which are often found in my school office or teacher's lounge.  Furthermore, everyone who I've shared my secret stash with has enjoyed them as much as I do!  One day I took one to the principal, who is a health-conscious individual, and he now loves them, too!  So, this past Christmas I gave him a gift bag filled with LaraBar Jocolat's.  It never hurts to win your boss over!

review/summary: Great & Gluten Free!
review/text: I really like another chocolate flavored bar that's also gluten free, and have been a repeat customer of the other bar.  But I was very surprised at how much more I like the LaraBar Jocalat, Chocolate bar.  These area great!  I rated the other product 5 stars, because I simply couldn't find anything wrong with them and thought they were that good - these are even better.  And they're gluten free!<br /><br />One slight caution: I knew I wouldn't be able to eat a regular meal one day, so I took three of these along and made the mistake of enjoying all three at once in place of the meal.  I hadn't thought about what the "consequences" might be.  Two of these bars at a time are plenty for an active lower digestive system!  If you intend to spend an hour or more in a meeting a few hours after eating three of these, you may find it more than a little uncomfortable.  Have some Imodium handy in that instance.  ;~}<br /><br />GRITS

review/text: Loved these both in taste and concept when I bought a few from EMS. Bought three cases (variety packs including, cashew, apple pie, this flavor, others) to leave at work and around to snack on, given lack of concentrated sugar, etc. Even though I never ate more than one a day, got a little sick of them and now can't eat them anymore. Kudos :-)= to the folks that make these, but hard to 'live on.' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YUI576">Larabar Bars Variety Pack Of Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, And Pecan Pie, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YUGQEA">Larabar Bars Variety Pack Of Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, And Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)</a>

review/summary: If you like the smell of feet and the taste of chalk, this bar's for you
review/text: I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, "oooh I have to try".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies.

review/text: It tastes neither like a chocolate nor coffee. I'm not sure about the health benefit but it's a torture to chew this thing. I enjoy many other healthy food but this one's a totally no no.<br />It's as if they just mixed cacao and coffee bean then put tons of sugar to cover the bitterness of the two. Too sweet, but not tasty sweet.<br />I won't buy this even if it's free.

review/summary: Ugh *Awful Face* Spitting out over the sink rinsing my mouth
review/text: I love other Larabar products (and have them in my cabinet currently).  This one however shouldn't have ever made it through their testers.  It's so horrible that even 1 1/2 years after trying it, the thought of it causes my face to automatically squinsh up in digust.  I cannot express fully in words the utter awfulness of this product.  However, the telling of the story of both my mother and I leaning over separate sinks spitting it out and rinsing our mouths is sure to set both of us off in hysterics to the bemusement of anyone around us.  I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend trying this product.  (Ugh.  I need to go rinse my mouth with mouthwash just from thinking about this product long enough to write this review.)

review/summary: A really good product
review/text: OK, where do I start? Clif Bar is a company located in Berkeley, California, that specializes in foods for people on the go, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The ZBaR is made with all-organic non-genetically engineered ingredients with no trans fat, no high-fructose corn syrup. Even the packaging is made with non-toxic inks on foil (not plastic) wrapping, and packed in a recycled cardboard box.<br /><br />So, this is really a good product. It tastes great, chewy and sweet with the firm chocolate chips providing a delicious counterpoint to the whole grain bar. My kids love it, and I feel good about it and the sustainable philosophy of the company. Like I said, a good product - good to eat, good for you, good for the planet.<br /><br />(Review of CLIF Kid ZBaR, 1.27-Ounce Bars)

review/text: Other reviewers have said great things both about the Clif Kid Zbars in chocolate chip and about the entire company. All I want to add is that my toddler LOVES these. He will eat one, then ask for more. I am so glad that there is a healthier snack option out there to compete with cookies. And I don't feel too guilty giving him a "bar" snack on days when he refuses breakfast. Though smaller than Clif bars, they do seem large for a toddler. But great for kids. I often snack on them too. Just because my toddler eats them, don't assume that they are small.

review/text: I found that these are a granola bar I enjoy.  The price, when ordered as part of the subscription, is decent.  I have them set up to come every two months.  I find this makes them a treat, without having them always be in the pantry.  Chocolate taste while also containing some other ingredients that might not be half bad for me.  And even though they are for kids, they are a good treat for adults too.

review/text: My kids have been hooked on them for over a year. I switch up the flavors to avoid burnout but I don't think they'll ever tire of any of the choco flavors. Perfect for school snacks. Excellent in travel packs as they are compact, filling and nutritious snack plus you don't have to stop while you're out for overpriced, unhealthy snacks. I have found them cheaper in stores but not regularly stocked anywhere I shop.

review/summary: A Treat For The Kid (or Dad).
review/text: I noticed this six-bar box of Clif Kid Z Bar (chocolate chip) in the nutrition bar section of my nearby grocery store. Hmmm. Made for kids with ingredients that matter. Well, I had to get a box to try out on my four-year-old boy. He seems to like things that come in a bar shape and I'd like to get some proper nutrition in him. This looks like the ticket, if he'll eat them. He's at the grandparents now, so a try will have to wait. Well, I'll give one a try. Hey, these aren't bad at all. Nice dark chocolate flavor. Nice granular texture. These things are a good bar. If the boy won't eat them, they won't last long around here.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The perfect snack!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of healthy, inexpensive, yummy, easy organic food. Somehow Clif does a good job of satisfying all those for me. It's kind of funny, I started buying these for myself because I figured if they made them for kids and their picky tastes, then the bar has to be pretty good. My 7 year old daughter actually likes the adult bars more and I like these more, weird I know.  I knew immediately after trying one that this was going to be my new favorite snack. These bars are the perfect blend of chocolate, oats, and chewiness. The texture is great, which is a problem with a lot of bars. The nutrition facts are decent with 130 cal, 3.5 grams of fat, and 3 grams of fiber. Nothing to get super excited about, but they taste good, so I'm not complaining. Plus, it's a pretty low calorie snack, so I don't feel at all guilty about eating them.<br /><br />The other thing that impresses me about these bars is the company itself. I did a little snooping on the Clif web page and have done a Google search and have been pretty impressed with the company. They have won multiple awards for things like "Best Green Practices" and "Green Power Partner of the Year, U.S." to name a few ([...]). They also say they have 5 aspirations of sustaining: our planet, our community, our people, our business and our brands. From what I see they actually do a good job of fulfilling those aspirations. If only every big company were as honest and responsible...<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy that a great company is making a yummy product and will happily be buying their Clif Kid bars and their other products (their Organic Twisted Fruit is amazing as well).

review/summary: So much tastier than the adult bars
review/text: I was leery of purchasing a Cliff bar for kids because I personally find the adult bars to be disgusting, from the texture to the taste.  But we received a sample of the chocolate chip bar... the kidlet enjoyed the taste, and mom enjoyed the ingredient list and packaging.  So I bought the multi-pack in an attempt to encourage breakfast eating.  She hated the graham cracker one, which is the one I liked the best.  She loved the chocolate brownie and chocolate chip the best.  I am not generally a fan of processed foods, but am impressed at the way ZBars minimize the processing and undesirable ingredients.<br /><br />She now eats breakfast without a fight so these have become an emergency snack I keep in my purse.  If you have to have something packaged, be it for lunches, road trip, or errands, I recommend these over any other kids' bar on the market.

review/summary: Our kids approve these bars. I eat them too
review/text: We liked these bars so much, we actually subscribed to the Variety Pack and got one of these delivered to us every month. Sadly, following the recent peanut butter scare, Amazon canceled our subscription and the kids are missing them being delivered on a regular basis.<br /><br />This is the one-flavor option and choco chips is one of my girl's favorite . The bars are just about the right size - not too small but small enough for the kids to get 2 of them in one day if they earned them. I sometime take a bar myself after exercising or I take one or 2 with me to office and have them with tea in the morning as breakfast.<br /><br />After many months of ZBaRs subscription it would be fair to say that we enjoy them very much. I like them because they are made with good-quality (organic) ingredients, they are chock-full of vitamins, don't have a lot of fat and contain zero hydrogenated oils, fructose, corn syrup or the artificial preservatives and flavor enhancers that just about anything we buy these days seems to have in abundance. The kids like them because they are tasty.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />- the size is right<br />- taste great<br />- kids love it<br />- on a subscription you get 15% off and free delivery<br /><br />One note of caution. The all organic, no artificial preservatives, environmentally friendly packaging seems to cause the bars to get progressively drier as time passes. If you want a chewy, fully satisfying experience, do not plan to store them for months. One month seems to be okay though.<br /><br />Go for them (I went) :)<br /><br />P.S. - The 18-bar or 36-bar if available should be the optimal quantities if subscribing. There's a little money to be saved that way.

My kids took one bite and didn't like it. I got them to try another bite and they had to spit it out. I thought the bars couldn't be that bad so I decided to open one and try it myself.. EWWW! No wonder my kids wouldn't eat them!!They are dry and taste like cardboard and anything resembling a chocolate chip certainly isn't because there isn't a bit of chocolatey flavor in them!! I spit it out also. Just to be sure it wasn't me, I had a friend try it to and her reaction was the same.. "you aren't giving these to your kids are you?" Well, I intended to but knowing what I know about how they taste.. NO WAY! Buy something else!!!!

review/summary: Community Coffee... not good
review/text: I'm not a picky person,I use Folgers instant decaf coffee,and happy with it, but I saw this brand at Amazon and thought I will try it,I didn't like it at all, I have to use a lot just to make it taste like coffee.It's a little too weak for my taste.

review/summary: Weak & Tasteless
review/text: If you are used to drinking coffee that is strong and bold, forget buying this.  It is weak and tasteless. I've cancelled the subscription and contacted customer service to see if I can return it.

review/summary: Real Coffee
review/text: It's true this coffee is a little weak, but it is much better than all of the coffee substitutes I have tried.  For those of us who must reduce the acid and caffeine in our diets, this coffee is a blessing.  Barley drinks and coffee-flavored teas do not taste like coffee.  Community coffee is real coffee that is low in acid, not a coffee substitute.  It's pretty good.

review/summary: Fine Quality Coffee
review/text: This decaf has a rich taste.  Although I was not sure of the quality of a no name brand, it certainly meets my expectations and is an economical choice for the coffee aficionado.

review/summary: My dog really loves the bones
review/text: I needed something that would last a long time. My dog cannot stop chewing, she has to have something in her mouth. She eats anything that she can get in her mouth. rock, plants,wood chips, walnuts, apples, grasses. These work really good. I'm order somemore on line here, petsmart quit caring them. I also found out that pork in better for your dog. Instead of beef bone or anything with beef.

review/summary: A1 classic marinade
review/text: Fabulous price. Use to be able to get it all the time from Price Chopper. This particular type seemed to disappear. Could only for the Chicago and New York style. I set up auto delivery. Cheaper than if I bought it from the store.
