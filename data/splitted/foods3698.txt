It is cheaper in the long run to purchase this item from Whole Food Market.

review/summary: Only popcorn I use
review/text: This huge jar of popcorn lasts a long time.  As far as I can tell no other popcorn matches this in terms of size of popped kernals and taste.  The popped kernals are fully twice as large as other popcorns I've tried.<br /><br />I use this in my hot air popper and don't  need anything else on it.  It's delicious just as it is.  While there are always some husks, those little thin shells mixed in that stick in your teeth and you have to spit out, there seem to be less than with other brands.<br /><br />The price here is equivalent to the price in local stores.  Don't let the picture fool you, this is a very large jar.  It's also a plastic jar so it's unbreakable.<br /><br />Orville Redenbacher devoted his career to developing a hybrid of popcorn that pops up larger.  Farmers who grow Orville Redenbacher popcorn must agree not to grow any other types of popcorn on their land to prevent cross polinations.<br /><br />This is the best gourmet popcorn there is in my opinion.

review/summary: Hulls Galore!
review/text: I don't know what happened, but this popping corn has transformed from one of the best to one of the worst almost overnight!  I've always used the same method of popping the corn, which is to pop it in a stainless steel pot on a glass top range with a light olive oil.  The Orville used to pot good, but all of a sudden the jars I've been purchasing will not pop the same.  It gives tasteless popcorn with enough hulls to make a horse gag.  I thought at first that maybe I was getting stale jars, so I bought it from a different sources but always had the same unsatisfactory results.  I finally gave up on Orville, and have been trying out other brands. The Orville quality control problem has ruined their product!

review/summary: java strength matchs mocha flavor
review/text: I reordered this java mocha via the subscribe and save subscription because the price per pound was good at the same time flavored coffee prices were rising. Price was the deciding factor. I got a better price with a different order of 'eight o'clock' mocha per pound via the subscribe and save subscription when a special discount was being offered. I would not have reordered this java mocha via the subscribe and save subscription if I had the opportunity first to order the 'eight o'clock' mocha via the subscribe and save subscription when a special discount was being offered. I prefer mocha more than java mocha. Java mocha is good while straight mocha is better tasting for my preferences.

review/summary: Great taste, poor packaging.
review/text: This maple syrup tastes like you'd expect this sort of syrup to taste like; thick, sugary, and typical of what you'd get at any fast food place. The real problem here is the packaging: out of the 80 cups that were shipped to me, about 20 of them had cracks in the container and a large amount of syrup had spilled out in the packaging. The plastic of the package seems fragile and in colder weather seems likely to snap or crack. I have amazon prime, so this was only en route to us for about two days and was delivered right to my office, so it wasn't as if we left it out in the cold for very long. If the packaging was done better, this would get a higher rating.

review/summary: great food, a bit expensive though
review/text: We have a labrador puppy, and we tried Iams puppy food when we first got her however, she lost interest in it after we stopped wetting her food at about 3 months old. I did some searching and asked for ideas from family, friends and co-workers and they all said Wellness brand is the best. So we found this food and it really is the best. The dog loves it, it is healthy food for her and really has helped her growing stage. She is now very healthy in her weight, joints, and muscles. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the price. While I think Amazon finds the cheapest price I have seen it up to $30 for a small bag and $60 for a large bag at a local pet supply chain, so it is a great food but shop around for prices. I have seen it for $25 and $50 at various online retailers, just watch that shipping. But overall a great food.

She seems to like it and I like that the peices of kibble are larger to make her chew them a bit more.  The bag itself is nice with a ziploc type closure and it arrived on time.

I started by feeding him Purina then realized the ingredient label hiding on the side had a bunch of "by-product" and load of fillers. This dog food isn't all meat either but at least the first ingredient on the list is chicken (not by-product). According to the label there's no preservatives and I hope it is true. This cost twice as much as the Purina and I think its well worth it for your precious pet.

For the first week we mixed the wellness into his Diamond. 2 weeks later he developed severe diarrhea onto a diet of rice then chicken for 5 days as soon as the wellness was reintroduced severe diarrhea again, back on rice and chicken. When food was reintroduced we switched to Purina one smartblend puppy for large breed puppies. Some people may disagree but he loves it and is having no problems. Last night at training class my husband was giving him little treats and through the night he developed severe diarrhea again and realized he was eating wellness treats. We would never buy another wellness product again.The dog food also gave him gas should have been warning for us.

review/summary: Wellness is Dangerous!!! Makes dogs SICK!
review/text: I have been giving Wellness to my 7 month old pitbull since he was 8 weeks old. I chose it because it is supposed to be a good and natural food. It's very expensive and I thought I was giving my puppy the best. Wrong.<br />My pup has had bad gas all this time but I did not think it was due to the dog food. We just thought he was eating too fast. Then when he was 4 months, he got very sick.. throwing up and loose stools. We took him to the vet for x-rays just to be sure there was no obstruction. There was not. He got better but the gas continued.<br />About 2 weeks ago, my dog started vomiting his Wellness food a few hours after eating. It looked whole. He was not holding down any of his meals and this went on for a week! We took him back to the vet for x-rays and even an mri.. the vet found nothing. We took him off the Wellness and gave him chicken and rice.. he was fine... started mixing in Wellness again and he got sick. Took him off and we are giving him ground beef and brown rice.. he has not thrown up once.<br />Yesterday, we received a call from our friend who adopted Saki's brother. His brother has been on Wellness for the past week and guess what-- same exact symptoms as my dog!!<br />To me, this is sure proof of the Wellness being the culprit.<br />This morning, I researched this food more.. just type in a search engine- "Wellness Super5mix sick" and you will be sick when you read all of the cases of illness due to this product! Stay away from it.. don't risk it..<br /><br />Here is just one link-<br />[...]

review/text: I had missed my favorite cake since being told I had to go Gluten Free 3 years ago.  Then I found Kinnikinnick Angel Food Cake Mix.  I love this mix and my friends who are not Gluten Free also say it's wonderful.  I can now have my favorite cake for my birthday as I have for many years.  But I enjoy it many other times of the year too.  This mix requires a lot of egg whites but I use the liquid egg white you can buy in a carton at the grocery store.  It is a bit expensive that way but worth every penny when you take that first bit and enjoy the great taste.  I use it as my base for Strawberry short cake but it's great with any icing or just plain.

review/text: Have not even used this so called mix yet and it may taste very good, most of the Kinnikinnick products do.  The reason for my dissatisfaction is the fact you must add 12 egg whites to what is suppose to be a mix.  Before my need to use gluten free products, I was able to buy angel food mixes that did not require adding eggs and of course expected this to be the same.  If you are going to use fresh egg whites, you may as well use your own rice flour as well.  I was looking for the more simple way baking a gluten free angel food cake.  Also not sure why the box says to (spray or grease) the pan, never have heard of doing this with an angel food.  Doubt this is going to end well!

review/text: Expected this gluten-free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added.  Was quite disappointed to learn that 12 egg whites are also needed.  This results in a lot of egg yolks which need to be used in another recipe or pitched.  If that many eggs are needed, I might as well make the cake from scratch. No need for a mix. As a side note, the cake mix did perform well and produce a good angel food cake.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/summary: Bit Too Dry
review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/summary: Yum!!
review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

review/text: These are really delicious cookies and they are far healthier than most of the junk in the stores.  They are full of all natural ingredients, no high fructose or additives here.  I gave a couple of bags to my uncle who was eating one of the name brand chocolate chip cookies (ahoy matey) and he's switching brands.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors but as an adult who loves chocolate I can tell you that these are very yummy.

review/summary: THE Best Healthy Cookies Out There!
review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

The deal you get on amazon can not be beat. I have gotten these from health food stores at a MUCH higher price than the rate they go for here. I do no have kids but when I do these will make it into their lunch  boxes. For adults who are looking to maintain weight but give into your cravings this is the perfect snake. i love love love these. I would highly recommend to everyone.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

review/text: All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.5-ounce bag of Barbara's Shackimals Chocolate Chip animal crackers. I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Choc. Chip review: I wish I found these before the kids got out of school for the summer because they are a great school lunch item.  I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

review/text: My kids love the Vanilla snackimals and I think they taste great too.  It's nice to find a small bagged snack that doesn't contain GM ingredients and tastes good.

review/text: These crackers are delicious. They are a bit sweeter than I hoped for, but still, really tasty and crunchy. I try to wait until they get on sale to buy them - they are quite expensive.

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: I purchased these because of the outstanding reviews. I needed some cute, yummy animal cookies for my nieces baby shower. I was making a banana pudding in my trifle dish and wanted little animal cookies to march around the edge and show through the bowl. Well, I am happy to say it worked and these were yummy! I had quite a few bags left and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them! He is now asking for more. LOL So I am going to try some of the other flavors.

review/summary: THE BEST ANIMAL CRACKERS EVER
review/text: I just bought these for my daughter today at our local health food store and I was very skeptical, but now I'm addicted to these. I hate to say that I ate my daughter's cookies but I did and will "sadly" have to go buy her some more tomorrow. I LOVE sweets but these are perfect, not too sweet but just perfect and you don't have to feel horrible about eating them all! LOVE THEM!

review/summary: Glorious
review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

review/text: We've tried the vanilla and now regularly order the oatmeal version for our kids' snack. Both are very good.  The oatmeal variety has more "texture" but our 5 year old still loves them. I also eat them occasionally and also prefer oatmeal; they are sweet but not too sweet and make a great snack!

review/text: My kids really enjoyed these animal crackers. I purchased them as an easy snack, to throw in the zoo bag or park backpack for busy summer days. I appreciate that they don't use refined sugar and they have whole wheat. My kids love the shapes and the taste. They taste quite good and held up well. This is my first time to try the Barbara's Bakery brand. Can't wait to try other varieties.

review/text: My 3 year-old daughter and I need to avoid wheat-- but are not strictly gluten-free.  We also avoid all artificial sweeteners, corn syrup, etc.  These animal cookies are great.  She is able to bring them to school and eat them when the other kids have "regular" animal crackers and she is excited to be eating the same thing.

review/summary: More chocolate than you expect
review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

review/text: These cookies may be "wheat free", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients. Please note that I have not tried the cookies since they are not gluten free; therefore my rating is not indicative of the taste or quality of this product  - the site would not let me post this without giving a rating so I just chose the middle of the scale rating.
