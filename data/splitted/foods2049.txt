review/summary: GLUTEN FREE LIFESAVER!
review/text: Pamela's Baking mix is a "must have" for individual's requiring a gluten-free diet.  It may be used as a pancake mix, for cookies, cakes and breads.  My husband was diagnosed with celiac disease 18 months ago and the gluten-free lifestyle has been a learning process for us!  We have referred other celiac patients to Pamela's and they rave about it as well.  We look forward to trying Pamela's bread mix and pizza dough mix also!

review/summary: Good Value; Great for Pancakes
review/text: I buy Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix in the 64 oz. bags for my 5 year old son.  We have him on a gluten free diet because of ADHD issues.  The 64 oz. from Amazon is a much better buy than the smaller size available in our local health food store.  He loves the pancakes, and I make them a couple of times a week for him.  He also likes the biscuits (the recipe is on the package.  I have used the baking mix to make his pizza dough.  I got the recipe from Pamela's online site.  It is ok for pizza dough, but not as good as real pizza.  He does eat it.  The pancakes, however, are really good and taste doesn't suffer at all with those even though they are gluten free.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free, Trans-Fat Free Pancake Mix!
review/text: Our daughter has celiac disease and has been on a gluten free diet for about 9 years.  We went through several different pancake mixes before we found this one.  The others were either gritty, flavorless or had a strange taste.  Pamela's is very good.  Recently we have been more aware of trans-fat (hydrogenated oils) in the foods we buy.  We were not able to find a regular pancake mix without trans-fat so we started making the gluten free ones for  the whole family.  Everyone loves them!  One warning for those who are allergic to nuts, it has ground almonds.  I like this as it gives extra protein to the meal.

review/summary: A truly amazing gluten free flour mix
review/text: This is THE best gluten free flour mix that my wife and I have ever seen (and tasted). My wife makes some amazing muffins and cakes with this flour following the simple recipes on the back of the bag. The first time we bought some, we only bought a small bag from the local health food store and made waffles with it. Following their waffles recipe where you beat the egg whites separately produces amazing waffles. Pancakes were quite a treat too! We now buy it by the box load from here.<br /><br />It is pricier than regular wheat flour, but it enables us to have all the treats of cakes, waffles, muffins and pancakes even with an intolerance for gluten.

Though my family can eat what they want, I will whip up a batch of chocolate chip cookies and not tell them that they are GF.  The kids, my husband, have no clue - they love them.  Purchasing in bulk saves a bundle too.  If you try it, you'll love it.  And if you like to bake and miss not being able bake up some cookies or a coffee cake, because of gluten, well, your gluten free prayers have been answered!

review/text: I have been wheat free for over 15 years and many mixes and recipes just do not taste very appetizing. This is a mix that even wheat eaters love and have told me they prefer it to regular brands. That is rare! So many mixes and cookies taste "different" meaning a wheat eater is not fooled. Something is "different". Pamela's overcomes that and is wonderful! I recommend all of the mixes for their ease and taste! No more making 2 batches of pancakes in my house - one for wheatfree and one for wheat eaters. What a timesaver!

review/text: As a newly diagnosed celiac I have tried many GF products available. All are fairly expensive and aren't always delicious. My favorite, and always successful, GF Baking recipes use PAMELA's baking mixes.<br /><br />Most importantly they taste good!<br />Secondly your pancakes, waffles and bisquits are golden-brown just like real; food. Anmd NO, the others I've tried are grayish colored and taste about like cardboard.<br /><br />Buying in bulk on Amazon is the right way to go. It is surprising how quickly you use flour baking your own stuff. Anyway this is my A#1 ingredient. Try it and you won't be dissapointed.

review/summary: Best Gluten free baking mix
review/text: Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix is the only baking mix I use now since going gluten free.  I find that I can substitute it cup for cup for flour in most of my baked goods recipes.  (Except yeast breads...I still have to experiment with it there.)  I use it in my mom's old muffin recipe and I think they come out as good, if not BETTER than when I used to use regular wheat flour.  If you are allergic to nuts, this is not for you since it has almond flour in it, but for recipes that call for nuts (cranberry walnut bread) I find that it actually enhances the flavor.  I have also made brownies, corn bread and chocolate chip cookies with it.  I have served them to non-gluten free people and they had no idea they were "missing" anything.  I have tried other GF mixes and making my own mixes of flours, but they are never as good...they usually have too much of a bean taste.

Pamelas Baking & Pancake mix is better than the "real" thing.  Pancakes and cookies are not dried out or crumbly. I always purchase the large bags on Amazon.  We have tried many of the Pamela's products and they are all very good. The small bite chocholate chip cookies are YUMMY, too. We also use Pamelas bread mix. Hope this helps.

Also got really annoyed when Pamela's started being replaced at a certain 'name shall be withheld' health food chain, only to be replaced by their own brand!! Pamela's has been around forever - i think since the 50's or something and deserves our business!! Anyway - buy it online, buy a lot and save on shipping!

review/summary: FANTASTIC mix, even if you don't have to eat gluten free!
review/text: This is truly a fantastic mix! My family eats gluten free food out of necessity; however extended family and friends all love this mix as well and several began using it after eating it at our house. I use milk instead of water to create extra thick pancakes (but they are great if you use water as the recipe calls for) and we just love Sunday breakfasts ever since we found this mix. Really, try it just once and you will be hooked, too!

review/summary: Can't Go Wrong With This Gluten Free Convience.
review/text: I have been using Pamela's Pancake Mix for many years and was very happy when I found this extra large (compared to her other bags of mix) Baking and Pancake Mix. If you don't want to have a bunch of different flours sitting around in your pantry and fridge, this is the way to go. All mixed up for use in minutes...in one bag. I have made some exceptional muffins from this mix as well as pancakes and a variety of other goodies with the recipes that are all on the back of the bag. This is one mix I will continue to keep on hand.

review/text: I don't have celiac's disease, however I have wheat sensitivities which is just as painful and uncomfortable.  I found this mix several months ago as I hadn't had pancakes in 5 years, the flavor is out of this world. The combination of ingredients cause the flavors to burst in your mouth, it almost makes "regular" pancakes boring. My husband eats these also, and his doesn't have a problem with wheat!!  I pay about $6 for 24oz at the local store, THIS IS A GOOD BUY!!

review/summary: One of our family's favorites
review/text: As big pancake fans, our family has tried just about every gluten-free pancake mix out there. Pamela's is one of the best! Two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us don't, but we all love this mix for our tradition of Saturday morning pancakes. Aside from Bisquick, the only gluten-free pancake mix we like even better is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XP3R4I">Nuffins Gluten Free Pancake Mix - Case of 6</a> It's not always available on Amazon, but when it is we try to stock up. Nuffins is definitely worth trying! Their other products are great too. Otherwise the choice for our family is Pamela's or Bisquick.<br /><br />Another "pro" is the price. Just under $4.00/lb it definitely beats $5.00+ per pound for GF Bisquick. Still, gluten-filled Krusteaz is like $1.50/lb. Someday maybe gluten-free mixes will get cheaper? One can only hope.<br /><br />If you think gluten-free products need to be LESS EXPENSIVE, mark this review as helpful! Maybe manufacturers will take notice and start lowering prices.

review/summary: Delicious and Versatile!
review/text: I bought this awhile back, thinking that 12 pounds of baking mix seemed absurd, but I am so glad I got it. This mix is wonderful. It makes delicious pancakes, for starters. The pancakes are so good that my gluten eating sister doesn't know the difference between these and her "regular" pancakes.<br /><br />But even more important, there are so many things that can be made with the mix. On the back of the package are lots of recipes for quick breads, muffins, waffles, crepes, and biscuits. I made the biscuits today and was impressed. I've had other biscuit mixes before that were entirely too sweet and too dry. These were perfectly flavored and delicious. The mix is also perfect for making roux, which is great for gravies and sauces. I tried making a pizza crust with it and it was okay, but not quite right... the bread mix is probably better.<br /><br />Pamela's Products has an awesome website full of recipes for each baking mix. I highly recommend checking it out. This mix can be used in so many ways, so keep that in mind. I'd say between this and Annalise Roberts' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572840994">Gluten-Free Baking Classics</a> my gluten-free lifestyle has been a much easier adjustment.<br /><br />I set my subscription for this every six months. I've gone through one bag in about a month, so I think I have it about right. This mix has been amazing for breakfast foods. I recommend it to anyone going gluten-free!

I've made great banana bread but the muffins and the drop biscuits are pretty crumbly.  However, I love how easy it is to use and it tastes good.

review/summary: GF Baking Mix that does everything and pleases everyone!
review/text: My daughter was diagnosed with Celiac when she was barely a year and a half old (she is now 7) and I have been using Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix ever since then.  At first I only used it for pancakes, having found that this mix makes by far the BEST GF pancakes of any mix I tried--and I tried several.  Using buttermilk (instead of water, like the recipe calls for) makes them as light and fluffy as "normal" pancakes, and adding about 1 tbs of vanilla and 1-2 tbs of sugar makes them absolutely melt in your mouth!  Then when I started getting the 4 lb. bags I saw that there are SO many things that you can do with this amazing mix!  I've used it for cookies, muffins, drop biscuits, cobbler, sandwich bread, and breading chicken.  I'm sure it can do a whole lot more.  I turn to this mix far more often than simple GF flour because with all the additives you need (like xanthan gum) already mixed in it's just so much easier.  Everyone in our family enjoys the good baking from Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix--even though only one of us actually requires it.  If you've been looking for the perfect GF all purpose baking mix then try Pamela's--now!

review/summary: fantastic option for gluten free diets - wouldn't live without it!
review/text: I have had to be on a gluten free diet for several months now.  I absolutely love this product, and I can't see living without it!  Between my sister and I, we have made a large a variety of things using this baking mix; most commonly we make pancakes and waffles for special breakfasts.  It works deliciously for "thin" pancakes (crepes).  My sister made butter biscuits this morning and they were wonderful.  My sister who isn't on the same diet diet I am often cooks with my mix even when she could use her own because she likes the taste of it better than the standard baking mixes we used before.  A couple of things to note - while this mix is the best on the market for gluten free diets, it still is a gluten free mix; as in it tends to taste grainy if not used correctly.  It does not always work as a straight replacement in recipes using wheat flour; cookie recipes commonly have this concern.  It does work beautifully in oatmeal cookie recipes though.<br />**Also, because this is the Amazon website, I would highly recommend the subscribe and save option.  This cuts the price I pay significantly; in my grocery store this mix costs almost double what I pay here, and I have the added convenience of never running out of a product I depend on.  You do get a lot at one time though with this program, but this mix keeps well.  I have mine sealed and stored until use in a large plastic container and it has been fine.  Try it - depend on it - then get it with subscribe and save!

review/text: We have stuggled for 9 mos. trying to feed my daughter and her first child a gluten free diet due to a gluten allergy with him. Then we tried Pamela's Baking Mix.  This stuff is great, doesn't taste "green", stays moist, doesn't crumble.  In other words it is NOT like any other product we have tried. It is so close to "normal" that my very picky son didn't know what he was eating until he caught my smile and then even he had to admitt that it was great. The recipes on the back are wonderful. At Christmas I used my great-grandmothers measurements and Pamela's to make our Christmas Date cake.  It was the best version of this cake I have made in 50 years.

review/text: I decided to try this as we are trying to get away from processed white flour. I have tried several of the recipes and really like them. The chocolate chip cookies are a little fragile, probably because I made them with brown sugar/Splenda but they were delicious. The waffles were very good, better than those made with white flour. The coffee cake is very good although I think I will use less filling next time. It turned out very sweet and somewhat crumbly but I was using brown/sugar Splenda again. I am definitely going to make this mix a staple in our household.

I just finished my first pancakes. They were very good as they looked and tasted like typical pancakes-well, maybe a little lighter and tastier. I was VERY pleased and will try the other recipes on the package. To make the standard pancakes, it only took one egg, one tbsp. of oil and 3/4 cup of water. Since i cooked them using my Anolon titanium pan, no oil was required. Quick, easy and delicious topped only w/ organic maple syrup. Enjoy!

When I saw this as a lightening deal and read all the 5 star reviews I figured it was worth the try.<br /><br />OH MY GOODNESS~I just made the most wonderful fluffy light and thick pancakes. I have never and I mean never had such a good pancake. Being wheat free is a bonus. I don't have to be gluten free but I do tend to be a bit sensitive to too much wheat at times.<br /><br />I almost wanted to take a picture of these pancakes. I could not believe I made them. You have to give this a try. I will never want another pancake but these. They are much healthier too, I used the spray butter on them and sugar free syrup and even with those two things they are FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I will be on subscribe and save when my supply runs low. I cannot wait to make other things with it for the holidays.

It's a perfect blend for muffins and quick breads and I've made some excellent chocolate chip cookies with it too. One good thing to know is that you do not want to cover your baked goods with plastic wrap or foil because they will get soggy, even if they are completely cooled first.  I find that paper works best (I usually use a brown paper lunch bag).  Also, Pamela's website has some great recipes!

review/text: This is a great baking mix at a great price. For around $3 a pound, you will receive the most perfect gluten free baking mix that works with any recipe. This mix makes the most perfect pancakes ever. My family likes them better than regular pancakes (they can't even tall the difference). This mix makes great scones, muffins, biscuits, crusts, cookies, etc. I store my mix in an airtight container and the other two bags in the freezer until I use them. They seem to go really quickly around here. With this mix, it is so much easier to be that perfect baker you have always wanted to be without all the hassle. My mom also needs to eat GF and she used to make her own baking mix from scratch. Her mix not only took more time to make, but it was actually more costly than this mix. After she tried Pamela's mix, she stopped making her own and switched over.

Also you can use the biscuit recipe  if you add a little cinnamon to the dough to make great cinnamon rolls! Makes me not miss what my family calls "real" aka gluten filled foods.

review/summary: Gluten Free Pancakes Even Better Than Real Ones
review/text: This amazing pancake mix is so great. I made these for me and my wife for dinner last night. I have Celiac's Disease and my wife doesnt. We both loved them so much I had to make another batch. These are "real pancakes" The smell, the taste, the consistancy. I cant wait to make other items with this mix.

review/text: I don't have Celiac's, but my wife does and I've chosen to live a GF lifestyle to make it easier for our family. My wife makes pumpkin chocolate chip cookies with this mix, and I make pancakes.. we've made cakes and all sorts of goodies. Let me tell ya, we've tried tons of different mixes and this is the ONLY one that makes me feel like I'm eating good old fashioned home cookin! There are already over 350 reviews for this product with a virtually flawless 5-star score, but I just had to add my vote to the mix (no pun intended) -- there is nothing so great as Pamela's.

review/text: I LOVE these pancakes. My husband loves them too but normally thinks my GF products are terrible. Even my picky 4 year-old loves them. When we make them, I substitute chunky applesauce for the oil and add cinnamon and vanilla extract. I have also used pumpkin puree in place of the oil and added pumpkin pie spice with great results. I downloaded several recipes from the Pamela's Products website for other new things to try using this mix. So far everything has been great. I highly recommend this mix!

review/text: Product is fantastic and cheaper than buying the small bags at the grocery store.  I get 3 packages.  Two of the three packages had holes at the top, from what I could assume is an automated pick system, but were still fresh etc.  Looked like a shipping / packing error in which they were punctured.  I taped up the little holes and stuck one in the freezer to keep it fresh.  I'd give more stars, but since two were somewhat damaged, I deducted from that.  I will still purchase more after these are finished.  Great product!!!

review/summary: Gluten Free but NOT LACTOSE FREE!!!
review/text: I have to admit that this is a very easy to use gluten free baking mix and the pancakes that it makes are absolutely stellar. This mix is also great because it can make more than just pancakes. There are plenty of recipes online to try such as: loaf breads,yeast breads, bread sticks, cakes, scones, cookies, biscuits, pie crusts, and pizza crusts-- all with just one baking mix.<br />I bought this not because I bake a lot... but because every once in a while, I do want to have pancakes for breakfast or the occasional cookie treat. And prior to using this mix, I used another really excellent gluten free pancake mix called "Sweet Cake Bake Shop Gluten Free Pancake Mix" which you can also get from Amazon. I switched because it was pricey and you get a lot more for your money buying Pamela's. However, I didn't realize that Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is mix is NOT LACTOSE FREE!!!<br />I am both gluten and lactose intolerant and this product gives me stomachaches. The "Sweet Cake Bake Shop" mix was both gluten free and lactose free. When I made pancakes with that mix, it called for "milk of your choice" and I was able to make great pancakes using Lactaid (lactose free milk), soy milk or almond milk. Pamela's pancake recipe calls for water because there is already milk in the mix. And thus, you don't get to choose what kind of milk to use.<br />Since I already purchased it, I'll finish the three bags I have by making holiday cookies and such for my family and friends who are not lactose intolerant. As for myself, I will not purchase this product again. And I will probably have to go back to the "Sweet Cake Bake Shop Gluten Free Pancake Mix" or keep looking for something that meets my gluten free, lactose free, and low price criteria.

I just ordered Pamela's baking mix and bread mix  the other day and it just showed up yesterday and all 6 bags in two separate boxes had two small puncture holes in all the bags in the same spot. The holes had to have been made at Pamela's packaging warehouse because they were packaged in Pamela's shipping boxes. I called amazon and reported it to them and they were very nice and refunded my money.I would have given this product a five star but for the packaging issue from Pamela's i gave it three stars.

review/summary: If you don't need a wheat- or gluten-free product, stick with Bisquick.
review/text: Even though I grew up with Bisquick and love it, we are always looking for new and different pancake mixes...so I was excited to see all the rave reviews on Pamela's Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix Wheat-Free & Gluten Free (on Amazon). It wasn't until after I purchased it that I even noticed it was what-free and gluten-free.<br /><br />Well, let me just tell you, at least for pancakes, this stuff is NO Bisquick. Bisquick still beats Pamela's by a country mile (or six). I cannot fathom how other reviewers there likened this to Bisquick or even better than Bisquick. NO WAY, NO HOW!<br /><br />Now, the pancakes were certainly not BAD--and I could see how if your diet required you to eat wheat- or gluten-free, then the pancakes were probably even good. But to say they were better than Bisquick? Never. Bisquick pancakes cook up light and fluffy; Pamela's pancakes were too moist and dense and flat and didn't even cook like regular pancakes (they don't bubble up like normal pancake batter, so we were a bit confused how to cook them). We even tried a few different cooking methods (temperatures) and none came out any better.<br /><br />Can you tell I'm a Bisquick girl? :) Here, let me get it out of my system: Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick.<br /><br />The bag says "Makes waffles, scones, muffins, loaf cakes, cookies, biscuits, coffee cake, and more" and there are recipes on the package for all of those, including a banana loaf cake, pumpkin loaf cake with nut topping, sour cream coffee cake, zucchini loaf cake, chocolate chip cookies, and (I kid you not) Bisquick-Type Drop Biscuits. :)<br /><br />I did make a batch of chocolate chip cookies with the mix and those were good--they didn't taste any different than regular cookies made with flour. But for the regular person (i.e. you don't NEED this type of product) then it's certainly more expensive than flour. I am definitely going to try a few of the other suggested recipes to use up the rest because we certainly aren't going to make pancakes with it.<br /><br />It is costly: $40 for three (3) 64oz bags (or $13.33 per bag). If you sign up for the "Subscribe & Save" it drops to $34, or $11.33/bag or 17c/oz. That sounded like a good deal at first, but a 64oz bag isn't nearly as big as I thought it was. Compared to (are you ready?) Bisquick, which I can get a 96oz box at Costco for about $9 or 9c/oz...it's almost double the price. So unless you NEED this, I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Brown rice flour, white rice flour, cultured buttermilk, natural almond meal (may appear as brown flecks), tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, potato starch, grainless & aluminum-free baking powder (sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, potato starch), baking soda, sea salt, xantham gum<br /><br />ALLERGEN INFORMATION: CONTAINS TREE NUTS AND MILK<br /><br />*Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue & Autism Support, and Research Organizations, and is a member of the American Celiac Disease Alliance.<br /><br />I am giving the mix three stars out of five. If I needed the gluten-free aspect I would probably rate it much higher (at least 4 stars, if not 5). But as just your Average Joe looking for a pancake mix to replace Bisquick...or something to replace flour, I'd give this three stars and advise you to stick with Bisquick (or whatever product you currently use that you like).

review/text: I am new to gluten-free eating. I have 5 children and make them banana muffins nearly every morning. The kids are on the picky side and are quick to pick up whenever anything tastes "different." When I took gluten out of my diet, I just stopped eating the muffins. One day, I saw gluten-free baking mixes at Whole Foods, and I bought a package (not Pamela's). The next morning, I made my muffins as normal. The kids did not even notice a difference! And I was able to eat them too. So I went on a search for gluten-free baking mixes, and found Pamela's here on Amazon.com at a great price and even more discount with a subscription service. I've been very satisfied with using Pamela's in my tried-and-true muffin baking and will be purchasing it again.

review/text: Pamela's Pancake and Baking Mix is the best gluten-free baking mix out there! We recently made peanut butter cookies and my non-celiac friends liked these far better than peanut butter cookies made with regular flour. The cookies had a great texture and flavor. The mix also makes wonderful biscuits, pizza crust, pie crust and more. We highly recommend this mix.<br /><br />Here is our recipe for awesome peanut butter cookies:<br /><br />1 Cup Unsalted Butter (room temp)<br />1 Cup Peanut Butter<br />1/2 C Organic Cane Sugar<br />1/2 C Organic Brown Sugar<br />2 Eggs (room temp)<br />2 Cups Pamela's Baking Mix<br /><br />Preheat oven to 375 degrees<br />Cream together the following: butter, cane and brown sugar and eggs.<br /><br />Mix in peanut butter.<br /><br />Mix in baking mix.<br /><br />Refrigerate for 20 minutes (this is optional but will make it easier to place criss-crosses on the cookies)<br /><br />Use a cookie scoop to scoop dough onto lightly greased cookie sheets, then gently mash in a criss-cross pattern with a fork.<br /><br />Bake cookies in a preheated 375 degree oven for 9 - 12 minutes.<br /><br />* Use 9 minutes if you did not refrigerate the dough. Use 12 minutes if the dough is cold. *<br /><br />Allow the cookies to sit on cookie sheet for about 10 minutes before moving to a cooling rack. They will appear a little soft when they come out of the oven but will set up as they sit.<br /><br />Pamela's baking mix contains: brown rice flour, white rice flour, cultured buttermilk, natural almond meal, tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, potato starch, grainless & aluminum-free baking powder, baking soda, sea salt and xanthan gum.<br /><br />Each 1/3 cup of mix provides 160 calories, 3.5 grams fat (zero trans fat), 5 mg cholesterol, 390mg sodium, 27 grams carbs, 1.5 g fiber, 3 g sugar, 4 grams protein, 10% calcium and 2% iron.<br /><br />If you want to really review how good this product is, I suggest reading the reviews on Amazon. The reviews for this product are raving and well worth the rave. We highly recommend this product.

review/text: After making plain biscuits, which were the best I tasted since going gluten free, I came up with a few recipes. My husband has no allergies but will eat any of these.<br /><br />#1-- Herb Biscuits - When making a double batch of biscuits (10-12), I add 1 TBSP. each of garlic powder, onion powder, chives, and parsley. (find the amount that suits you best) I also like to add a packet of Chreese (GF Dairy Free cheese sauce mix) While I still miss Red Lobster's biscuits, these are quite tasty.<br /><br />#2-- Shortcake - Use vanilla flavored soy or almond milk and add a little sweetener of choice to your biscuit mix. Top with your favorite fresh or frozen fruit.<br /><br />#3-- Chicken Pot Pie - Prepare biscuit mix with a little extra milk or broth,  two cans cream soup, a cup of frozen veggies and leftover boneless chicken chunks. Bake at 350 degrees in a pie pan until done (about 30 minutes)<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Pamela's IS the ultimate gluten free baking mix
review/text: I have tried many gluten free mixes and this one is so good that my family members who aren't gluten free love it! I mostly use it for muffins, bread and pancakes. I don't use sugar so I substitute a mixture of coconut oil and agave nectar for the honey and then add bananas, blueberries or other ingredients to get a variety. I freeze my muffins within a day because they get stale easily, but the bread seems to be ok left out or in the fridge. For pancakes, experiment a bit because the mix will be different than regular pancake mixes, usually a little more water is needed. I've also used it as a batter for frying and mixed with oatmeal for apple crisp. Enjoy!!
