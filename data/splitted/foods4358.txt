review/summary: Mmm, love that Peanut Butter, especially with crunch
review/text: I picked these up when they were on sale.  Subtract the discount for a subscription & it was a great deal.  Nature Valley makes a tasty product.  It would be nice if they could somehow keep them crunchy, yet a little less crumbly.  It would make for less mess in the car.  I would certainly buy them again and probably will.  Peanut Butter is an essential food group in my book. ;)

review/summary: Best Peanut Butter Granola Bars
review/text: These are the best peanut butter granola bars I've ever found.  I'm pretty much a peanut butter addict, so I have tried a lot of peanut butter things, but most granola bars don't really have very much peanut butter taste.  These are perfect.<br /><br />They are the crunchy kind of granola bars though, so keep that in mind.  Each package has two granola bars in it, so when a box says it has 12 bars, it really has 6 packages of 2 bars each.  That's the only thing I don't like...it seems kind of cheating.<br /><br />But, I do love these and recommend them if you like peanut butter.

I keep one in my purse and in my desk, and our kids backpack for a reasonably healthy snack. Excellent choice for hiking too.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I've had insomnia off and on for the past year +. I've been prescribed just about everything...including the main stuff like ambien. Ambien, unlike what the commercials promote, left me with horrible hangovers, terrible mood swings...and often times I would sleep walk/do things that I didn't even remember. I've also tried in store stuff like tylenol PM or sleep aids you can find in your local drugstore...really, nothing worked. Finally I discovered Dream Water from a random amazon search and found some at Duane Reade. It works (no pun intended) like a dream. I sleep well with little to no hangover at all...no mood swings...and it doesn't knock you out. It slowly relaxes you into a sleep, as it promotes. After all this time...a more natural remedy, and one that's not cheap necessarily, but definitely cheaper. 5 stars, no doubt about it.

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: My Hero!!!!
review/text: This is the best stuff on earth!! I don't like medicine- I haven't even taken a Tylenol in years- so it was very hard for me to find a solution for my sleeping problems. Teas are natural, but don't work are all, and pills have nasty side effects. Dream Water is natural and effective!!! I also love that I don't have to count calories, because I do take this regularly.<br />It is powerful enough to help you fall asleep, but mild enough that you can wake up whenever you want to, without leaving you groggy or out of it. Both flavors are great!<br />By it for yourself- and if you want to make other busy/stressed out people very happy (your friends, your parents, your teachers, your coworkers, etc), spread it around!!

review/text: I've had sleeping problems for years now and nothings really worked.  I refuse to try Ambien or any prescription drugs for fear of side effects.  I use to use Tylenol PM but I found myself feeling a hangover effect in the morning.  I was recommended "Dream Water" by a pharmacist in a Duane Read by my job a few months ago and I've been using it ever since.  It both relaxes me and helps me fall asleep on the nights I am laying awake counting sheep.  It tastes great unlike some of the other products I've tried, I prefer the Snoozeberry flavor myself, but the Lullaby Lemon is just as good.  Finally something that works for me!!!

review/summary: Sweet Dreams!
review/text: I came across this product in a local store by accident and decided to give it a try.  I must say I was more impressed than I thought I would be.  And honestly I didn't think it would work at all.<br /><br />Normally, I lay in bed for a while watching TV until I fall asleep. It sometimes takes me about an hour or better to actually fall asleep even though most mornings I awake at 5am. I wake up several times in the night, for no reason, but generally go back to sleep with no problems. I tend to wake up a little sluggish and not wanting to get out bed. Well I drank the Dream Water, the taste is pleasant, and in about 30 minutes I felt more relaxed.  But I think I was fighting it at first. But as soon as I laid down, I was sleep in time.  I slept through the night.  And woke up refreshed and felt rested and ready to start my day.<br /><br />Of course this shouldn't be used daily but for those days when I think sleep is going to be hard to come by, I keep some Dream Water on hand. Some of the ingredients (this products claims to be all natural) are maybe not for people with high blood pressure. So please pay attention to the label.  But if you have no existing health issues I'd recommend giving it a shot!

review/summary: It even helped ME!
review/text: I suffer from idiopathic insomnia, which is basically lifelong insomnia, every night, with no known cause. I've tried EVERY sleep drug - ambien, trazodone, lunesta, etc. etc. You name it! I HATE taking drugs, especially to sleep. So I'm always looking for a natural alternative. I've tried "sleep shots" in the past, but my body is very sensitive and most of them have tons of different herbs that can cause negative reactions. THIS DOESN'T! This contains only ingredients that are SUPPOSED to be in your body naturally.<br /><br />5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.<br />GABA is EXTREMELY relaxing and good for an anxious mind (I have been taking GABA supplements for about a year now)<br />Melatonin is something we all know about to help induce sleep.<br /><br />This combination is just what my body wants before bed. Granted, I still have some sleepless nights. In addition to this drink I often will take magnesium and Passion Flower supplements to help calm me. The taste is great, very mild. This product has made a noticeable difference in my relaxation and sleep.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Let's get away from those sleep drugs!

review/summary: First OTC sleep aid that worked for me
review/text: As an insomniac of many years, I picked up a Dream Water at my local pharmacy, where they're sold in individual 2.5-oz bottles in two flavors, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon.  I've tried every over-the-counter sleep aid there is, and some help, some don't -- this stuff really works.  It makes me very drowsy, and far as I can tell, there are no adverse side effects.  Both flavors are subtle and pleasant, and contain no calories.  The active ingredient is sodium 80 mg, which might be of concern to those on a low-sodium diet, although 80 mg only represents 3% of the average adult's recommended intake.  The rest is their "secret blend" of what I presume is the usual herbals that are reputed to relax you. All I know is that I fall asleep within an hour and sleep better through the night with fewer interruptions.<br /><br />One minor complaint -- the stuff's expensive (hence the four stars, rather than five)!  Even if you buy it by the 12-pk, it's about $2 a pop! I guess it deepends, then, on how bad you want to sleep.  I like having the stuff around for when nothing else is working.<br /><br />So that caveat aside, highly recommended!

I finished the amount on my plate; however, my husband said, "The more I eat it, the more I hate it" and threw the rest of his portion out.  It's not the worst thing we've ever tasted, but it not worth buying again either.

review/summary: Teff-initely Yummy
review/text: Buying 6 pounds of a grain you've never had can seem risky... what will you do with it all? But I took the risk and it paid off! Teff is great. I followed the porridge cooking instructions on the back, but made it savory instead of sweet. I let the tiny teff grains heat up/dry roast for a few minutes in the pot. I could hear them popping like crazy (sounds like electricity) and then I added water, organic chicken broth, ghee and black pepper. I let it cook longer than they say and then mixed a serving of it with chopped broccoli and chopped turkey, and then topped it with a drizzle of flax oil. My toddler said "yum, yum, yum" about 100 times. That's pretty cool.<br />We can now confidently add teff to our rotation of amaranth, quinoa, brown rice, millet, oatmeal, and spelt flakes.<br />We have a high protein, high fiber, vitamin packed winner!

review/text: More difficult than oatmeal or quinoa to cook for breakfast: the small grains must be shaken apart once added to the water, and more frequent stirring required to avoid a sticky gel-like mass on the bottom of the pan. These minor annoyances aside, teff has excellent flavor and nutritional benefits, including 20% of the RDA for Iron. Great with fruits and nuts for breakfast, or as a base for vegetables in a casserole.

review/summary: Teff is great stuff
review/text: Teff replaces oatmeal as a hot breakfast cereal. Teff's pretty unique, its a tiny seed. It doesn't get mushy when cooked, but does stick together. To cook it boil it in water- use about 1/2C Teff to 2 1/2 C water- to serve two or one large guy. Add some salt too, say 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon and just boil until thick. Stir so it doesn't stick to the pan. Flavor is kind of nutty but mild and its really good. Its much higher in protein and complex carbs so you can feel the difference around noon- still with you. Its a definite must have for athletes and if you can afford it everyone else. You may also like grated orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon or for us we add toasted anise seed as well for peak flavor. We serve it with milk and a pinch of sugar. Its excellent, if you prepare any dish like this you will probably find Teff is better than all of them. Take advantage of the shipping deal when you buy two boxes.

The grain is very versatile and with a little creativity much can be done with it.  I store the packs in the freezer to retain freshness and use it as needed.  It's easy to grind in a coffee grinder and to add to pancakes, breads, cookies, muffins, as a thickener for soups, etc.  My energy level goes way up when I consistantly use this product.

review/summary: adds flavor and nutrition to any breakfast dish, so far
review/text: I purchased this whole grain teff on a special deal here on Amazon, without having tried it previously or having any idea if I'd like it, but so far I'm loving it.<br /><br />I haven't tried the recipes on the back of the package yet for teff porridge or teff pudding (they look very tasty, but require longer stove-top cooking and more attention than I usually want to invest unless I've already tried the result and know for a fact that it's worth the time and trouble).<br /><br />However, when I added a generous sprinkling of teff to a bowl of McCann's Quick & Easy steel-cut Irish oats before adding the boiling water and following the microwave directions on that package, the result was spectacularly good (much better than the oats alone, even when cooked with my usual cinnamon, dried fruits, and nuts).<br /><br />And then I tried 'blooming' a half-cup of teff in about a cup of boiling water (I ended up simmering it in the microwave for a few minutes, since I was impatient) and stirring that into a standard pancake recipe (using a generic reduced-fat baking mix).  The pancake batter looked thin and a little gloppy, but they cooked up beautifully and had a wonderful, nutty (but not heavy) taste.  After I made the first few pancakes, I didn't even bother dropping frozen wild blueberries onto the pancake batter anymore, since the teff made the pancakes tasty all alone.  The texture of the pancakes was light, but spongy, and they're just as good warmed up in the microwave a few days later.<br /><br />One of these days I'll work up the nerve to try cooking the teff all alone, but in the meantime I'm adding it to other cooked or baked products at every opportunity, and I haven't been disappointed in the result yet.

review/text: I bought this to add variety to my diet, and tried the teff pudding recipe on the back - delicious, I think. My family didn't agree, but they did like the bread I made with teff flour. Hmm...perhaps if I soaked the grain overnight first, that would make for a smoother pudding. Try the pudding, or add the grain to a mix for breakfast or as a side dish - it's healthy and it tastes good.

review/text: I heard about this product, but I couldn't find it anywhere in my local store. I was glad to find it at the Amazon. It came quickly. It is so fine, I don't know wether I need to rinse it or not. Anyway, I rinsed it once, it is hard to get rid of rinsing water without loosing the grains. I cooked the Teff with millet or quinoa. It turned out very tasty with added flavor and a little gelatin texture. My kids doesn't like quinoa by itself, it has a special flavor they don't like, with teff, it covered the quinoa taste and made it taste better. If you cook millet by itself, it is too dry, with teff, it adds some gelatin texture to it. I also grind it to flour, and add it to baking. It was great. I already used up one bag.

review/summary: Great Grain!
review/text: This little grain is a great additive to muffins, breads and pancakes.  (I always soak them in boiling water before adding them to the recipe.)  They add a delightful little crunch and very subtle texture to my baked recipes.  The pudding recipe on the bag is yummy and I think they would be great in certain cookies too!(-my next experiment)  I am sure with some thought they could be added to any number of recipes for bulk and the benefit of "whole grain goodness"!  Also, A little bit goes a long way so, For Christmas this year I am using two of the bags to give to friends, along with the Bob's flax seeds and my bran muffin recipe which calls for both ingredients.

review/summary: Tasty Goop!
review/text: Teff is a small grain, smaller even than quinoa, rich in fiber as well as flavor. It's the basic grain of Ethiopian cooking. Teff flour is used to make the sour sponge bread served in all Ethiopian restaurants. Teff whole grain can be cooked as a breakfast porridge or as a dinner course rather like polenta, either soft or solid.<br /><br />I picked up "Bob's Red Mill Teff" at my local grocery, in response to my teenage son's interest in cooking grains from around the world. There are two adequate recipes on the package, but we didn't follow either exactly. In the dinner recipe, we used cardamon in place of cloves and dried apricots in place of dates. If you've ever cooked grits or polenta, you won't find teff difficult at all. Check the other brands of teff here on amazon if you decide to order some; "Bob's" appears to be the most expensive.

review/summary: Good buy on a hard-to-find product!
review/text: Small but mighty, teff has a protein content of almost 12 percent and is five times richer in calcium, iron and potassium than other grains.  As a cooked grain, I think it tastes a little like Cocoa-Wheats.  I've never particularly cared for Cocoa-Wheats, but I love teff.  Once I learned that I need to stir it frequently as it thickens, I found it quick and easy to prepare.  I also toss a little teff in my green salads along with a few lightly salted sunflower seeds.  Special thanks to Bob's Red Mill for providing this wonderful culinary experience for those of us who are trying to avoid gluten.

review/summary: Teff is a new staple in my household
review/text: First off, I agree with E. Nonimiss that Bob's Red Mill products are of excellent quality and freshness.  As for the teff, what a great breakfast cereal!  Delicate yet flavorful with a wonderful aroma during cooking.  I rotate teff with Bob's buckwheat and brown rice farinas and oatmeal.  To a bowl of each of those I add a teaspoon or so of blackstrap molasses (lots of calcium and iron, who wants sugar?), a bit of Bob's flaxseed meal and fresh or frozen fruit, depending on season.  I prefer berries of some sort.  At this point, my consumption of both granola and milk have markedly decreased.  I do not water down the cereals with milk and fine the flavor greatly enhanced.<br /><br />Lastly, as others have pointed out, it is critical to stir teff while cooking.  At the latter stages, I stir almost constantly, a process not required for the buckwheat or oatmeal.  Rice farina is similar to the teff.<br /><br />Way to go Bob!  Now I'm trying to figure out a good storage technique so I can purchase the 25 lb bags, which cuts the cost in half.

review/summary: Not just for bread flour!
review/text: I had no idea what Teff was before I spotted a single bag in the grains section of Whole Foods a year or two ago.<br /><br />I had no idea what to do with it, and I didn't know how it was supposed to taste. I was intrigued. The whole grain looks like tiny poppyseeds, but brown.<br /><br />I decided to cook it in my ricemaker, using the package directions to estimate how much Teff, and how much water. While it was cooking, it smelled great--the problem with the ricemaker was that it overflowed and stuck all over the lid parts of the ricemaker.<br /><br />When it was finished cooing, I opened it, and the teff looked slightly puffier than the uncooked teff. I put some into a bowl, put some yogurt on it, and ate it (just like a cooked hot-grain cereal). It was great!<br /><br />My lesson--cook a whole bag of the raw Teff over low heat in a large pot on top of the stove, instead of in the ricemaker, stir frequently, and when it's done, let it cool a bit, and then, spoon 3/4 to 1 cup portions into sandwich baggies (Put the baggies into a measuring cup while you spoon the warm/hot teff into the baggie). Get as much air out of the bag as you can before sealing it closed, and then freeze the bags.<br /><br />In order to use the frozen Teff (as a breakfast meal), take the frozen bag of teff, unseal it, put it into a bowl (while still in the baggie), and microwave it for about 1.5 minutes. Empty the bag into the bowl, add milk, yogurt, or whatever you like, and enjoy!

review/text: If you've ever had Cream of Wheat, that's about the closest thing this teff comes to. The texture is almost identical, both pre-cooked and after cooking. It's real easy to eat and nice to mix into other grains like oatmeal if you need to use it up. It smells wonderful when you're cooking it. If you cook it slowly on the stove like we do, it seems to take forever to thicken up and then all of a sudden - bam - it's thick and your done. Custard is like that, too. It changes fast, so stay closeby the stove.<br /><br />Will keep purchasing this one.

At the end I added a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon, then dished it out with maple syrup, blueberries, and a dash of soy milk.<br /><br />Will try it out savory next. Its fine texture would make it an interesting substitute in rice dishes.

review/text: I ordered this whole grain teff in January, 2009 and I was looking forward to the shipment.  To my dismay, the pack was not well padded and all but one of the four bags of teff burst in shipping.  Thankfully, most of the grain was still in the bags when it arrived, but a lot had spilled out into the bottom of the shipping box.  This shipment was all grains and several of the other bags of grain also leaked.  After this experience, I will not be buying grain from Amazon again any time soon.  Otherwise, though I had to rebag the grain, it seems fine.

I love to drink mine with Almond Joy creamer, or Cold Stone Creamery's Sweet Cream creamer. One of my daughters likes vanilla creamer, and another likes to drink it almost black. Nice, warm, rich comfort beverage alternative to coffee.  Tastes best when brewed in a French press. I just have a cheap 32 oz press that I got here on Amazon, but it is so much better than using an electric coffee maker. Also be aware, it is not going to brew as dark as coffee.  That threw me off at first, but don't let the light color fool you! It has a lot of flavor.

review/text: I had to give up coffee for a month as part of a detox/cleanse (The Clean Program). I needed something hot to drink in the mornings at work to keep my routine and wake me up. At first I subbed in green tea and yerba mate but they didnt really satisfy me. I did some research and found Crio Bru. I make it in a french press at the office. It brews like coffee and I enjoy the chocolaty taste. It has a rich creamy mouth feel and and my I taste chocolate long after its gone. I cant say it provides the same caffeine jolt of coffee but it does satisfy my craving. With 4 table spoons needed for each of my french press brews the bag is only going to last about 10 days..which can get expensive (then again Im used to free Starbucks and Seattle Best coffee at my office). I'll probably go back to coffee once Im off this program.

review/summary: Very weak
review/text: I used this product in a French Press. I placed two-three heaping tablespoon in the press and covered it with boiling water. I let it sit for about 10-12 minutes. After sitting, I poured it into a cup and it was so weak and had no body at all. It just tasted like dirty water.<br /><br />I was looking for a rich, robust and flavorful alternative to coffee, but what I found here was akin to dirty bathwater.

review/text: Firstly, Rustichella d'abruzzo is the very best pasta asciutta available.  For years Amazon has been offering it in four packs for $17.50 or so and the prices have been rising to about $22. If you buy something else (another 4-pack of pasta is what I buy) the price comes to under $6 for a half kilo ( 17.6 oz) of the factory made product. Handmade shapes are generally double in price.<br /><br />Looking today all the 4 packs are on an out of stock--please notify me basis.<br /><br />This particular offering is $6.25, a price that is competitive to Whole Foods and the like.  But adding 7.25 shipping makes it $14/lb and at that price I'll east filet, lobster, and get out my Atlas and start making my own.<br /><br />Please, Amazon, bring pack the 4-packs!

They offer free overnight shipping since it's frozen, and it arrived in a styrofoam cooler packed with chunks of dry ice. I've tried plenty of different kinds of ice cream over the years, but this stuff is by far the best I have ever had.

The price is very reasonable as most grocery stores want over $5 just for 4 small bottles and these cans average to 55 cents a can.  That's a bargain in my opinion.

review/summary: GODD FAT FREE CHIPS
review/text: I have enjoyed these chips on game days in front of the TV with dip for about ten years. If you have digestion and or allergy problems then some of the ingredients such as the fat free Olestra may cause problems for you. They are FAT FREE and they only have 1/2 the calories of a regular bag of chips. They taste great and hold up to dips quite well. I was a Fritos Corn Chips addict for years but these are better for me without all of the fat content that Fritos have. The best price that I have found for these is at Walmart.

review/summary: great brand of stevia in convenient tablets
review/text: :: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages ::<br /><br />I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia. The form I most often use is the shaker jar, the blend with FOS, from this same reliable company (Wisdom Naturals).<br /><br />But I also buy their product in tablets for the convenience. I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product. I really believe AMZN's price here cannot be beat -- particularly if you're calculating in the current promo of 20% off and free shipping.
