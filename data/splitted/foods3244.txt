review/summary: Disappointing Coffee
review/text: I got this coffee for my birthday it absolutely did not taste like Jamaican coffee. The beans are medium to light brown not a dark black, the coffee is not smooth and there is barely any aroma at all.  I have to say I was disappointed with this purchase. My brother recently went to Jamaica and brought me back a blended Jamaican coffee sold by the locals that was much better looking and tasting than this one.

review/summary: Excellent coffee.
review/text: So why would anyone pay $50.00 per pound of coffee? I dunno. For me, it's a chance to have a morning ritual that makes life a little easier. I vaccuum seal my coffee, place it in a cool, dark place, and treat my coffee like a valuable product. I have a special space on my counter devoted to the tools of coffee- a specialized grinder, a tamp, my stove-top expresso maker, a french press, etc. I use filtered water and I have a few special cups that I dedicate to truly great coffee. My space for coffee is like a little shrine and JBM is like the centerpiece.<br /><br />JBM coffee can be a real scare for your pocketbook. A pound of JBM coffee should give you 32 cups of coffee. That's about $1.55 a cup of coffee. That's about $.40 higher than a cup of Starbucks.If you are in the habit of buying a pound of generic coffee from the grocery store, you are probably having heart palpitations after reading the numbers. I would suggest you split a pound with a few friends and try brewing it in a coffee press instead of a drip machine. Change up your coffee routine a bit. It's fun.<br /><br />Back to the original question- why pay $50 a pound for coffee? In short, it is not an everyday coffee (not in my house anyways) and should be treated as a different catagory of coffee. If you are looking for a cheaper, high quality coffee that can be a step-up from the store-bought coffees, I would look at buy a 100% Kona coffee. It should be about half the price of JBM coffee and is a great daily drinker coffee.<br /><br />That's my ten cents.

review/summary: I've never seen the Blue Mountains
review/text: I have never seen the blue mountains so i can not rightly say for a fact, "yes this is the real deal."<br />However after reading about this famous coffee i decided to try it for myself. initially i was a little skeptical about paying that much for coffee i had never had before,but i decided to roll the dice anyways. im pretty sure i got burned the first time around when i went out on my own, but i gave it one more try and came to amazon this time, I ordered 1 lbs of the wallenford whole bean, it arrived within a week (im on the west coast)and i put it in the burr grinder and then into the french press. I'm thinking this has to be the real thing because it fits the profile on everything i've read. it is very smooth, rich, low acidity and almost no bitterness. does this mean a weaker coffee? at first sip i thought it may, but it most certainly did not, it was so good i had a second cup and felt like i had had an espresso shortly there after. seem to fit the profile and it is soooo goood! me and my wife love it! we will be ordering more for sure. and i love the little burlap sack it comes in, too cool!

review/summary: Blue Mountain is the best
review/text: I have been drinking Blue Mountain Coffee off and on for the last 5 years, switching it with Kona (I am a true coffee snob...). After the local coffee shop here decided not to carry Blue Mtn anymore- I decided to give this a try- I was not disappointed at all. This coffee is true Blue mountain, tastes as good if not better than the fresh roasted coffee from my local roaster, and gives that extra jolt of caffeine I have come to love from this premium bean.

review/summary: Very Smooth but Lacks the Kick
review/text: This is probably one of the smoothest coffee's I have had the pleasure to drink.  The only problem (in my opinion) is the flavor.  I love dark/strong flavored coffee and even with my grinder set to fine ground, I still lack the strong flavor that I love.  It might be because of the equipment that I use - where I can only get but so much coffee in the container.  I use the Keurig B200 coffee maker (along with the my K cup dispenser filled to the max and packed), along with the Breville BCG800XL grinder.  Again - smooth coffee with no bitterness but lacks the flavor.

review/summary: Great deal / Great Taste
review/text: I buy this product on the subscription program and send it to my daughter out of state.  Typical teenager periodically runs out of money before payday and it makes me feel better as a parent that while I won't just send her money - she at least has food at hand when needed.  And these granola bars fit the bill.<br /><br />The chocolate chip are the best.  I've ordered three times now over the past 10 months and every bar right down to the 12th box has been soft and chewy.  That 12th box has come at the 3-4 month mark at times.  SO, if you are concerned about the shelf life - at three different times these have easily lasted past 3 months.

review/summary: Too much filler material, but chocolate chip the best flavor
review/text: I'm not a big fan of the new type of Quaker Oats granola bar; lot's of barley/rice filler material, not many oats.  However, the chocolate chip is the best tasting in my opinion- well, maybe it ties with the peanut butter chocolate chunk.  There are enough chocolate chips in the bar to give the moist fattiness that we all desire, yet the chocolate chips are small enough such that you don't feel too guilty eating them.  Maybe that's a bad thing, because it encourages you to reach for another.<br /><br />The granola bars seem a bit smaller than I remember, but there's plenty of flavor packed inside.  These aren't too healthy; still a lot of corn syrup (though no "high" fructose corn syrup as they stress), fructose, dextrose, hydrogenated oils, etc..  Not intended to be a meal replacement bar (unless you ate the whole box), but they're a tasty, traditional snack.

review/summary: All three of my cat's rate it a BIG 10! 10! 10!
review/text: Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne

I like it because it is a Holistic Blend of great ingredients that the cats love. It has a soft, blended, wet consistency. I still give them Halo Dry food, a small amount each day.

review/text: Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation.

Great for a quick meal with some chicken and veggies.<br /><br />To summarize: Cooks quickly, absorbs flavors easily, and it's easy for me or my little daughter to eat.

review/summary: Really like it
review/text: My wife and I have started eating couscous quite a bit. This pack is a bit cheaper, and a little easier to prepare than some of the store brands. There really isn't much taste - so it really is just "tri color". But the texture after cooking is pretty good, and it absorbs the flavor of whatever sauce you want well.<br /><br />We do like this, but when the pack runs out we will have to do a bit more searching before reordering.

review/summary: Great for dieters and diabetics
review/text: I love Cool Whip, but the sugar-free version has one gram of fat per serving (two tablespoons), while the fat-free version has a lot of sugar. The Calorie Control Whipped Topping Mix is a very nice substitute.<br /><br />I use 3/4ths of a cup of the topping mixture with 2 cups of liquid: if you use two cups of water, then 8 calories per serving (two tablespoons); if you use two cups of non-fat milk, then 12 calories per serving; if one cup water and one cup fat-free milk (which I usually do), then 10 calories per serving. Whichever you use, be sure to use a good mixer. Note that Cool Whip is 20-25 calories per serving.<br /><br />Now, standing alone, Calorie Control Whipped Topping is simply not as good eating as Cool Whip, hence the 4 star rating. Alone, it has a slightly sour taste. However, it does very well with puddings, ice cream, etc.<br /><br />Plus, I have vastly improved this whipped topping by adding some Vanilla Cream Liquid Stevia (sold here on Amazon) to the liquid before mixing. NOW it is excellent as a stand-alone topping! I have also used the Chocolate Liquid Stevia to make delicious chocolate-flavor topping.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing from Ediet from their website (I buy the topping by the case). Try the chocolate cheesecake mixture!<br /><br />Edited to add in response to comment: The Calorie Control Whipped Topping Mix comes in six ounce pouches (it is a powder). A `serving' is two tablespoons, with 128 servings per pouch (so says the information on the pouch).<br /><br />When I make a batch (using 3/4ths of a cup of mixture, and two cups of liquid, either milk or water or a combination thereof) I get a very large tub: I do not know how much, but easily equivalent to the large size tub of Cool Whip. Out of one pouch I can make two such tubs, with enough left for about half of another.<br /><br />It is certainly a lot cheaper than buying sugar-free Cool Whip. Again, the taste is not near as good as Cool Whip, but I always add liquid Stevia (such as chocolate-flavored).

review/summary: smells l like a lipstick
review/text: This is a nice tea. However, it does not really taste like Jasmin, nor like Rose. It does have some pink rose petals,  but no white Jasmin flowers. It kind of reminds me a taste of a lipstick. it says it contains natural flavors, but I find it hard to believe in - the flavor is very strong and as I said, it does not taste like Jasmin or Rose. I am kind of disappointed. I bought a few different teas from this company, and although  most of them have a nice flavor, the company has some serious mix up about tea names. They taste nothing like description. Or they have a problem with adding too much artificial flavor (or is it natural in fact? what is it then?). So you basically can't taste the tea itself and only taste the flavor

review/summary: Suprisingly good.
review/text: Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.  If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out.

review/summary: Really Good If You Make A Few Adjustments
review/text: I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes "okay" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads.

review/text: As a general rule, in my opinion, if you stay away from the creamy-type dressings, you should be ok. For example, I love the balsamic one and the honey dijon is pretty good, but ranch and bleu cheese are just inedible; I would rather just eat my salad plain.  I'm on a very low cal and almost zero carb diet, so these (especially the balsamic) have been a life saver.  I'm going to try the cocktail sauce next.

review/text: These salad dressings are a great alternative to other popular fat free dressings.  I hate those sprays that are on the market now because there isn't enough dressing for a serving for pete's sake.  I like Thousand Island Waldens Dressing the best -- made a salad with veggie steak strips, spinach, black olives and mushrooms and this dressing was perfect! I've tried Ranch, Balsamic, Caesar and Blue Cheese.  The bleu cheese is bland, but the rest I've tried have been tasty and very satisfying.  I'm glad that I don't have to waste a 60-80 calories on dressing for my salads.

review/text: This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.  I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor.  Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.

review/summary: Diabetic's Dream
review/text: For type 2 diabetics trying to control blood sugar by diet alone or with minimal medication the Walden Farms brand is heaven sent.  I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life.

Now the shipping is still the same for this flavor of dressing only. But if you try to order their other flavors you'll find that they are charging $6.95 PER BOTTLE. Quite a surprise when you see hundreds of dollars show up in your shopping cart. I spoke with Amazon and they told me to get in touch directly with the vendor because the vendor sets the pricing. I spoke with someone at the vendor who told me to get in touch with Amazon. Then she finally told me to email her manager, be brief, and explain the difficulty. I did this and got no response.

When they miss... well, you move on.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the pricing on these items. They are all over the chart, ranging from reasonable to highway robbery. Some have shipping charges of $4.95 PER BOTTLE! It would seem to be a mistake, but they refused to acknowledge it and actually defended the charge. Others are over $8 per bottle w/free shipping; no bargain there either. Some, with shipping, are over $10 a bottle. It's not difficult to find much better deals on the web-try allstarhealth.com for starters, and there are probably even better ones out there.

This year I decided to get serious about my weight (and lost 23 lbs by the way)and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet (along with those friends). In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products, although I've never heard of them before. Being an on and off dieter since I can remember, that would be shame on me. I am in love with their products now. Well, most of them. This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip. I use it with everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach. It goes well with everything. It tastes good, it's light and calorie free. And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all. Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good.

review/summary: If you're serious about calories...
review/text: I've tasted the best of the "real things," and they were wonderful and dreadfully high in fat, carbs, and calories; that includes dressings, dips, and sauces.  Yes, I've added up what goes into a salad, and those oil and fat content calories soar!  If you expect a fat-free substitute for most anything to be a close equivalent, forget it; you'll have to do with eating the tiniest bits of food to lose weight.  If you expect a zero-calorie substitute to taste the same, ditto.  However, the key here is to find the best of the WF products for you.  I can't do the Peanut Spread (and I'm addicted to Peanut Butter), but most of the other products I can manage.  Some of the dressings are really good, especially the Balsamic.  Loving sweets, I keep handy an assortment of chocolate sauce and dip, caramel sauce, pancake syrup, and I've recently "discovered" the blueberry pancake syrup.  The trick is not to use too much because, yes, there is an aftertaste, but if you use the right amount, it's a darn good substitute.  AND...the calories...the carbs...the fat...don't add up!!

In small amounts, mixed into a salad, it does the trick.  It gives a kick to "boring" field greens.  In larger amounts, it's no better than tolerable, but you may feel good that you can have a huge greens salad and dressing for under 50 calories.  One thing is clear:  It does not taste much like full fat or low fat Thousand Island dressing.

review/summary: Ranch Flavor Dresssing is OK...
review/text: At first try, I was tempted to give it a slightly higher rating, but I guess it depends on you sensivity to some of the "flavoring" used.  I actually had a fairly low expectation, so for me, this was a bit better than I expected.  I used it to make a tuna salad, so some of the flavors are better suited to that perhaps.  I am on a strict low carb diet so this seems to be good enough.

review/summary: Absolutely DISGUSTING! TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..

review/text: This is not bad, it's good on a salad, and decent as a veggie dip as well.  It's very tangy, and nice in it's own way but does not taste like a normal full fat ranch dressing.  It's on par with other low fat or light dressings I have tried, but with 0 calories.  I like to add a little cracked black pepper to mine.  I may buy this again, but I prefer their Caesar dressing.

Nothing I've tried of these dressings really tastes like normal salad dressing, but these make terrific alternatives if you're looking for a dressing that minimizes caloric intake.  The Vinaigrette also has made a good "dipping" dressing for bread, etc.  Just try a few and see which ones you like.

review/text: I am a serious weight control person.  I recently lost 25 lbs and I determined not to regain it.  The key is lots of salad and lots of veggies with adequate protein and eat frequently. I use Bacon Ranch and add some straight balsamic vinegar to my salads.  Delicious.  I use the vinaigrettes on vegetables and then roast or BBQ them.  If you hate these dressings, in my opinion you don't REALLY want weight loss or weight control.  Are the "regular" dressings better?  I don't know and I don't care.  I am a 66 year old female athlete and I love being trim.

review/text: I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.

review/summary: From a HUGE fan of Walden Farms
review/text: We've been ordering these dressings directly from Walden Farms for many years and haven't yet had a flavor we didn't like.  Our favorites are the Caesar, the Bleu, and the Ranch, but we also regularly enjoy the Creamy Italian, Russian, and Thousand Island.  You can buy them directly from Walden Farms, up to 10 bottles in an order, for a flat shipping fee of $7.95. Make the salads as rich as you want with tasty ingredients -- we like avocadoes in ours, providing healthy monosaturated fat, or a dollop of virgin olive oil -- and save calories BIG TIME with these delicious dressings. Any of them will also make a wonderful dressing for cole slaw and broccoli slaw, although WF also has a very good Cole Slaw flavor.  And the kids love them as dips for fresh veggies.

review/summary: Calorie Control Chocolate Cheesecake Great!
review/text: I am a diabetic, hence must watch my diet. I recently bought, directly from the eDietshop website, the chocolate cheesecake mix. Simply wonderful. No sugar, almost fat-free, 60 calories per half-cup, very creamy texture, very satisfying. My wife (not diabetic) also loves it. Thus far I simply mix together the mix and milk, pour into individual serving cups, and refrigerate for a bit.<br /><br />If you love Cool Whip, get the Calorie Control Whipped topping. 8 calories per serving (2 tablespoons), no sugar, fat-free, etc. Easy to make (I had been making it with milk, which makes it 12 calories per serving, but recently decided to simply make it with water, as directions suggest, and found it still is great and creamy). Anyway, add this whipped topping to your chocolate cheesecake and you have a wonderfully satisfying desert for well under 100 calories.

review/summary: Great smelling, but you'd better like hibiscus
review/text: My wife loves this tea.  She even eats it (the blueberries are definitely edible and sweet), but she grew up drinking hibiscus tea all the time.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, bought it for the blueberries and green rooibos, which I assumed would be the predominant taste.  Truly, there are a lot of dried blueberries in this, and there is a lot of green rooibos, but it is the hibiscus that you taste the most (a rather bitter/sour taste when made too strong).  Sweetener definitely helps.  With Spring, a little goes a long way, so you get your money's worth of a healthy tea.<br /><br />The smell of this tea is truly mouth-watering, both dry and when steeping.  It is a very pretty tea, with beautiful light-blue tiny petals sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />My wife will definitely go through a lot of this tea, but as for myself, I will be grabbing this only as the mood hits me.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have grown to really like this tea and I'm moving my four stars to five stars as a result.

review/text: I approached this tea with a LOT of trepidation. I had ordered two other bags of bulk tea from Davidson's, and disliked each one. Never the less, I figured I would give Davidson's one last go. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />As the other reviewer mentioned, the dried tea is visually appealing, light blue flakes contrast sharply with the deep purple of the rest of the tea. The resulting tea infusion is a rich purple (think McD's Grimace purple). If you brew in a clear container, this tea will most definitely belong on display when you have company.<br /><br />As for the taste - If you have read my other reviews, you will understand why I took my first sip of this tea over the sink. However, I was very surprised at how much blueberry taste this tea has. It actually tastes like it's primary ingredient, imagine that? My process went like this: *sip* "Hmmm, that's kinda good." *taste again* "Actually that's really good!".<br /><br />The "plain" brew has a slightly tart AND sweet taste at the same time, if that's possible. With very little additional sweetener, this tea could very easily help parents replace their child's soda fix with something much healthier.<br /><br />Final verdict: A good buy, and one that I intend to make again.

Even though it is 16 oz, blueberries weigh a lot more that just tea petals so volume wise you get less.

I have tried alot of teas and have to say this is the best tea I ever had. If you like berry or fruit flavored teas, I would highly recommend this. The only disappointment I had was that I didn't realize it was caffeine free. I like my caffeine so when I need it I just mix this with another one I have with caffeine. I also like my teas over ice and this is just great. Thank God I used the subsribe and save.

There is a lot of fruit is this tea and the dried fruit is very sweet if it's picked out and eaten. However, when it's steeped into tea the sweetness of the blue berries isn't retained and only the tartness is retained along with the floral ingriedents. I drink my tea without suger so it's a little to tart for me but otherwise isn't horrible. Maybe if you added suger or honey it would be better.

Maybe Davidson's has change the ingredients because I found a lot of rosehips and had to really search for blueberries and found only 1. I also have the chamomile flowers and mixed that with the spring fruit and flowers in my tea pot, the combo made an excellent tea.  I do love rosehips and the flavor of the tea but was disappointed that I couldn't taste blueberry.  For this reason alone I gave this tea 4 stars.  I just got my second order of this tea and it was full of blueberries, no rosehips and has a blueberry taste to it.  I will keep ordering this tea and I'm giving it 5 stars now.

review/text: When I first opened the bag, I smelled flowers.  But once I made the tea, it's WONDERFUL.  The flowery smell is not in the drink.  It's blueberries, and very good.  The value of the tea is worth it too, but I did repackage the balance of the tea into a better bag for storage.  The package does reseal, but why expose a full pound of tea to the air if it not necessary?  That said, this is a wonderful herbal tea with no caffeine, and will be a wonderful iced tea in the summer.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Cinnamon Tea?!
review/text: I was really looking forward to this tea, having purchased it as a juice replacement for my two young children. I regularly order Davidson's English Breakfast, as well as tried other offerings of theirs in the past, and have never been let down.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag, I was met with the overwhelming scent of cinnamon and discovered an abundance of cinnamon stick pieces in the mix. The presence of cinnamon is so prominent that I believe it should be stated clearly in the ingredient list. Unfortunately both of my kids won't touch cinnamon with a ten foot pole, so as a result of the misrepresentation of this item, they sadly won't be enjoying Davidson's Spring Fruit and Flowers tea.

review/text: The aroma of this tea is especially tempting.  I mix it with the Davidson Hibiscus and the Rosehips and add just a tad of Blue Agave for sweetener.

review/summary: Fresh and great tasting!!!
review/text: I love this tea! It had fresh dried berries all throughout it and taste very fresh and yummy! The price and quality can't be beat! I am so glad to find something as good tasting as Teavana but way better priced. Just wished they had more "blends" to choose from.

review/summary: A must have for frugal tea lovers!
review/text: I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this tea, I usually pay upwards of 6-12$ for similar products... with a weight of under 4oz. 16oz for under 15$ is very exciting and affordable. Organic as well? Yes please! I look forward to trying their other blends and adding my own ingredients to them.

review/summary: I'm eating it right now
review/text: I don't actually need it gluten-free, so whether it is or isn't doesn't really matter to me. (Tho the box says it is). But anyway, regardless of that, it's, like, really-super good. Helped calm my raging Asian food craving that's been going on for awhile :-)

review/summary: Beware...not sending gluten free item
review/text: Packaging did not state gluten free, called customer service who said they would resend.  Still not gluten free.  Now state gluten free is unavailable but still advertised. The one I received has caramel color and no gluten free description.  Be careful before you try to buy!

review/summary: mine not organic; not as pictured/ordered
review/text: The diff between organic and not is not cosmetic or immaterial: if the item is shown to be org, it should be. I haven't tasted the crackers as I'm not sure what my next step is. Hoping Amazon will step in to rectify as I see nowhere to email them short of a return. Any tips in this regard appreciated.

review/summary: If your brewing you need these hops
review/text: "This is a good deal". The cost breaks down to a dollare and oz and if your like me and love hops their is no guilt in adding more and dry hoppinig later... Go head and buy a few packs and save money down the line..
