review/text: I ordered this teriyaki beef jerky base on the free sample that came with another order (which is a great way to promote the product).  I thought it tasted really good and wanted more, however the teriyaki jerky i recieved tasted nothing like the sample i was given.  This was really dissapointing because i was really excited to recieve this product.  Some people might like this, but i find it has a weird overpowering flavor that is really offputting.  I did order the honey pepper also and that is much better get that one instead!

review/summary: Delicious bars, great strawberry taste
review/text: I looove these bars. I lamented no longer seeing Tropicana FruitWise bars on the market anymore; and was hoping to see something similar. I tried Target's fruit bars which while I liked the fruit leather, I didn't care for the bar's texture-- I wanted something like the fruit leather but thicker. I then found Sun Rype fruit bars and picked one up at the grocery store and was instantly hooked. These are sweet without being too sweet and are much denser and more satisfying than fruit leather strips. I could easily make a meal out of these, heh. But they're great for taking on the go since they're individually wrapped  and travel pretty well, I hope Sun Rype keeps making these delicious bars!

review/summary: Wow, Fruit that is actually all fruit no sugar added!!
review/text: I purchased the SunRype Fruitsource Mini Bites at my local grocery store, but could not find them on Amazon.  Only found the bars. It is really hard to find fruit snacks that aren't really just overpriced candy.  I wanted something with no added sugar...doesn't fruit have enough sugar in it already. These taste great, and the texture is nice, it is like eating licorice, only better for you.  I like the mini bites, as they are small bite size pieces, so you can eat just a few at a time instead of eating a whole bar. 5 star rating is for the product taste and quality itself.

review/summary: No Longer the Same Product
review/text: I grew up eating Starkist tuna.  It was my favorite above any other brands I tried.  This is not the same tuna it was before.<br /><br />I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out, the lid goes so far down because there isn't as much tuna as there used to be.  But that isn't the worst part.<br /><br />I noticed this year that every can I've opened has had some sort of sludgy gel-like goo surrounding the tuna.  I touched it to see what it was like and it feels like grimy slime.  I wondered if this was a bad batch (we usually buy lots of cans at a time) or some sort of new way they are packing it.  I looked it up and saw others were finding the same thing in their tuna.  I tried eating some of it after getting most of the goo off.  But it did not taste very good.  I now regret eating it at all after reading the following.<br /><br />Apparently the company was once owned by Del Monte, but was sold to a South Korean tuna company that was hoping to get into the American market.  For what reason?  To poison us?  Seriously, I can't imagine what they put in these cans.  I also read that they refused to provide records to the FDA when asked.  That can't be good.  Why is this stuff still on our store shelves?  Why are American companies selling out to foreign ones all the time?  Americans are finding it harder and harder to afford groceries.  We don't want to spend our money on trash products.  I will never buy Starkist again unless it one day makes its way back to American hands.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Just look at it and smell it next time you open a can.  It's no longer the tasty tuna of yesteryear.  It is now tuna bits in slimy, tuna-flavored sludge water.

review/summary: Worst solid alacore tuna ever
review/text: This is bad tuna, can't say it any better.  It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make.  The chunk light they make is slightly better.  1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style.  I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can.  When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time.  DON'T BUY.

review/text: These are great. Supposed to be sugar free but you would never know it. The only thing when ripping them apart they do not separate easy at times and I tore one and it started leaking all over the place. There is not too many of them and they go too quick. Each one is ~.50 cents a piece. I thought this was a tad bit high. Flavorice is good stuff though. Watch out for cutting your mouth on the plastic as well. It is a little sharp or can be. I want to buy them again but I think they cost too much.

review/summary: better than the Original Pancake House (high-end pancake joint)
review/text: I bought this pancake mix a few days ago, and more than anything was a little hesitant because the last review was done 8 months ago. Obviously, I was concerned about the production date, because this product contains egg. The expiration date gave me ample time (received 07-05-2010- expiration date 3-11-11).<br /><br />I took a chance, and am glad I did because these waffles/pancakes are DELICIOUS! I USED to use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029K15LC">Bisquick Pancake And Baking Mix Shake And Pour, 10.6-Ounce Containers (Pack of 8)</a>, and was overall satisfied with the taste. I was hoping that these tasted better, and they are. I also use these in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TYBWIG">Presto 3510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker</a>. The mix has to be more on the thicker side, and makes delicious waffles without ANY sticking. So far, I've made about 8 waffles trying to incorporate them into breakfast, lunch and dinner. The waffles/pancakes are all that, and a bag of chips.<br /><br />The main reason I switched from the Bisquick mix is because multigrain seems healthier. So far, I'm very satisfied with the mix. The pancakes and waffles come out perfect, and taste very fresh. Overall,I enjoy supporting American small/medium sized businesses, and from what I see, this company isn't a huge corporate farm, because of the natural ingredients used. Thanks Heartland. Keep up the great work, in providing a quality product.

It is great to use for soups instead of chicken stock in the can or other boullion, great for chicken dressing, chicken dumplings, chicken spaghetti, alfredo, adding to stuffing. Use in turnip greens instead of bacon grease, bacon or ham to add a good flavor a little vinegar gives it a slightly salty taste. The beef is also good and we use in beef stew or more beef based broths sometimes, also can use to help make brown gravy without grease, fat or sodium. These are must haves in our pantry!

The creators must be in denial -- I don't know how a company could sell something this. It has a peculiar aftertaste -- that seriously lingers -- and makes you wish you had something tasty (like dirt) to neutralize that "special" flavor. Oh, did I mention the smell? Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money without any hiccups -- which is great since I'd bought a boat load of it! Thank you, Amazon people.....

review/summary: A+++ for Taste of the Wild
review/text: I have a 13 week old boxer and for a week we had her on cheap store bought pedigree, then I talked to my local pet store and they gave me two samples the Fowl formula of taste of the wild.  I decided to try it for my dog, she gobbled it up so fast, I was sold on Taste of the Wild.  I decided on the bison formula since it has the most protein compared to their Salmon and Fowl.  I do plan on mixing in the other two or switching them once and a while to give my dog variety, but it's Taste of the Wild from here on out.  The price is great, I don't break the bank like I would if I bought Orijen, and it's still grain free.

review/summary: EXCELLENT food! However the only con is...
review/text: it's unfortunate that the prices of this brand (all the formula's) went up DOUBLE. When it first came out it was very reasonably priced. You might want to check Tractor Supply if you have one in your area for a little less. Other than that, this is really a great brand for dogs with allergies. I have a German Shepherd Dog who is highly allergic to a handful of things. This has definitely made her stop itching and reduce yeast infections. Her coat is very soft now. If you have dogs with uncontrollable itching and there's no fleas involved, it's definitely the food you're feeding him/her. Do some research and you'll find that grain based kibble can cause itchiness, hot spots, yeast infections, and reoccurring ear infections. Grain-free kibble is the best way to go. It's worth a little extra money to avoid vet costs.

review/summary: Wonderful dog food
review/text: I used to buy my dog (5 year old Corgi) the regular dog food at the store, whatever was on sale. I was at the store spending $9 on a huge bag of dog food and I thought to myself, "Man, I wish I could eat for an entire month on $9 worth of food." I then flipped over the bag and read the ingredients. There wasn't a single thing on the back that I would feed my dog as dinner. "Here boy, have some corn meal, corn syrup, and vitamin supplements!"<br /><br />My dog had bad breath from all the sugars in the cheap food I was buying him. Now that he's eating better food without the corn syrup and sugar, his typical doggie breath is barely noticeable and our vet that cleans his teeth noticed the difference. He gets his teeth cleaned once a year and there was only limited tartar buildup.<br /><br />This is a great dog food. I would recommend feeding your dog 1/4 less at first due to the increased fat content and watch for weight change. Keep in mind, if you're switching from cheap food to this food, the cheap food is larger due to corn-based fillers. This food is more nutrient dense and your dog might not need to eat the same volume as the cheap stuff.

review/summary: Fantastic for dogs with skin allergies
review/text: I started my 5 year old German Shepherd (and myself) on a grain free diet this year. He has always had terrible, flaky, dry skin and I always thought just supplementing his diet with fish oil would help. That was only part of the equation. I had him on (what I thought was) a premium dog food all of his life, and while he would eat it, he was never THAT excited about it. Since I have had him on Taste of the Wild his skin has cleared up, his coat is shinier than it ever has been, and he has TONS more energy.<br /><br />Make no mistake, dogs are omnivores but their biology is still stuck in the days when their ancestors ate meat as the staple of their diet. They shouldn't be eating grain. This is a quality, affordable, grain free food. If you are thinking of switching your dog to a grain free formula I would strongly consider this. My dog goes wild for this stuff, going so far as to start eating it as I'm transferring it into the storage container. I'm so glad that I can order this from amazon and have it delivered to my door. Its super convenient.

review/summary: Great for my dogs!
review/text: I have two Cavaliers.  Chipper came from a breeder and Shea from a rescue organization.<br /><br />Chipper was always a smelly dog.  Cute, affectionate, STINKY.  I had to bathe him every week just to stand keeping him inside.  He also always had dark "tear stains" down his white face.  We tried several high-quality foods from the pet supply store.  Nothing seemed to make any difference.<br /><br />Shea came to us at 6 years old with a wiry coat and itchy skin.  If you are familiar with Cavaliers, a "wiry" coat is not appropriate. Their coats are soft and silky.  He came to us on Science Diet Lamb & Rice.<br /><br />We did some due diligence and found TOTW.  It has made all of the difference!  After about 3 months Shea's coat had become softer, and his itchy skin was much less irritated.  We've fed it now for about 18 months, and Shea's coat is soft and beautiful.  Better yet, Chipper isn't stinky any more!  He can go three weeks without a bath.  Plus, his face is WHITE, with no stains!<br /><br />Both dogs are "middle aged" indoor-dogs, but active.  We free-feed, and have no weight problems with them at all.  We've tried several different flavors, with no real preference.  I just buy whichever one is the most reasonably priced when the time comes.  Lately that has been the Bison flavor.

review/summary: Great Dog Food!
review/text: I am a lifelong dog owner and I now own three German Shepherds. I also breed German Shepherds, responsibly.  I started all my puppies out on this food and it is the only food I now feed my three. The alpha female was my first German Shepherd and she had some serious digestive issues when I had her as a puppy. I tried everything from Royal Canin (the German Shepherd version) to Merrick Granny's Pot Pie (HA HA).  I even supplemented with canned pumpkin, cottage cheese etc. but I couldn't get her to eat consistently or gain weight. Then, after hours of internet dog food research, I found this food. It became available at TSC at a reasonable price.  I now recommend this food to everyone! It is the only food I recommend to the owners of any of my puppies.  All three of my German Shepherd's are healthy and quite active on this food. I also want to note that I feel this food helps with ear problems, skin problems, teeth problems and any dog that smells "doggy."  If you walked into my home in the middle of winter you would never know I own three German Shepherds as this food helps control "doggy" type odors too. It is just an all around great dog food! Also, someone mentioned the food smell being smoky...I do not notice a smoky smell, as it smells like wild meat to me. (I've even thought it smelled like something good to eat myself! HA!)

review/summary: One of the Best Dogs Foods out there
review/text: We have been using this dog food for about 4 months after or preferred dog food became unavailable in our area.<br /><br />There were issues with my youngest dog having chronic diarrhea when we switched for about a month.  We used canned pumpkin and plain yogurt to help relieve that and now seem to be doing just fine.  It was our fault for doing a hard change of dog foods instead of staging them into it.  They are lean and mean playing machines now.<br /><br />There can be a weight issue if you do not keep you dogs active enough.  Reading the breakdown shows that this food has a much higher proportion of proteins and fat than a typical dog food.  So you dog gets a lot more energy out of it.  If you don't use the energy it becomes fat.<br /><br />Our older dog also has grain allergies which are addressed by this foods lack of use of them.  I do wish they still used the venison more but understand about there being a problem with suppliers.<br /><br />I would recommended this food to any dog owner.

I have always fed my pups high quality dog food so I can't say that their coats look better or that they have more energy than before I was feeding this brand but I can say that they are healthy and do have beautiful coats and a ton of energy :)<br /><br />Taste of the Wild just came out with a canned version of this item which I just recently tried and was VERY impressed with. Nice chunks of meat, gravy, and veggies! My dogs love this stuff even more than the dry food. The wet food is pretty costly though so I like to mix a can in with the dry food every other day or so.

review/text: I switched over to TOTW from First Mate after FM increased their price and decreased their size. I needed a comparable grain free food for my Beagle who has severe food allergies and the ingredient list on TOTW was, IMHO, better than the FM. As others have mentioned about their own dogs, I have noticed that he has more energy and has in fact lost a few pounds.<br /><br />I also started my Plott Hound on this diet when she was 8 weeks old and she had no trouble or health issues. In fact, she did better on the TOTW than a liter mate that was started on a "large breed" puppy formula.<br /><br />I switch back and forth between the High Prairie and the Wetlands formulas to keep both hounds from food burnout.<br /><br />They even have a canned variety now, though I've yet to find it at either of our local feed stores.

review/summary: LOVE TOTW
review/text: I switched from science diet large breed to TOTW bison about 2 years ago for my 3 year old boxer. We had alot of problems with her skin on science diet. She was always itchy and her skin was always red. The vet recommended trying to grain free diet and after some research I tried TOTW. Major changes in her skin, coat, and general health. This food is awesome and well priced for it's quality! Tip: if the price is an issue...Keep in mind that you feed less with a grain free food because it does have as many "fillers." The recommended amount of TOTW is half of what I was feeding with Science diet so it is actually cheaper for me in the long run.

review/summary: Too Much Fat...
review/text: Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog.  At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it.  The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating.  Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this.  He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog.  He did seem to be more "chipper" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat.  Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food.  I'm not sure I agree with the "good for all life stages" philosophy either.  In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels.  Much as humans do.  Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content.  Hope this helps!

review/text: My dog loves this food! It's always nice to have a dog enjoy the food AND have it be good for them. My dog is a 40 pound beagle mix. We had to buy a new 30 pound bag a month and a half after the first one. Maybe that's pretty standard, but man his food adds up! It's not cheap, but with that comes high quality. His #2's have been more consistent and healthy since he's been eating it. He does seem to have more energy and be in a better mood. Overall, this is a good food, but it is a little pricy.

review/summary: Great holistic food for a good price
review/text: My dog loves this food and i love feeding it to him. I drizzle hot water over it to give it warmth and some moisture, which my 7 month Lab loves. I believe it enriches the flavor and makes it easier for him to eat.<br /><br />I bought this brand at the recommendation of an employee at a pet store. I'd been feeding him Hills Science Diet food and wanted to switch to something healthier. I'd never heard of the brand and just bought it at the guidance of the store employee. I got home and did my research and found out that this is a good holistic brand of dog food. I was very delighted and surprised. I bought this 30 pound bag when the 5 pound bag of the Wetlands formula ran out. It lasted about 2 months now and i've just put in an order for a 5lb of the wetlands formula (I believe he like that better than this formula).<br /><br />and thank god for Amazon and its Prime shipping. buying a 30lb bag of dog food would have cost at least $20 in shipping fees. I love the price of this too. Its about $10-$20 less than the other formulas.

A previous reviewer commented that the kibble has a smokey smell. To me, it just smells like roasted meat or steak. The dogs certainly don't have a problem with it. I must say that they love the food (although, honestly, I can't imagine them refusing any food!). I feel that I'm providing them with the best kibble on the market, and their health and condition seems to validate that.

review/text: I don't write reviews unless I feel strongly about something.  My dog was recently diagnosed with lymphoma.  I read that a grain free diet can be beneficial to dogs with cancer.  So I did some research on brands and this was recommended. I bought it locally, not on Amazon, but wanted to write a review anyway.  My dog had pretty much stopped eating for several days.  I bought both canned and dried of this.  Gave him half a can to start and he scarfed it down.  Gave him the other half and he scarfed that down.  Next meal gave him dry and he ate that heartily too.  He just LOVES this food.  Our next dog, I will start right out on this food since I have learned that dogs are not really built to eat grains and this is such a good dog food,  It is worth the extra cost.

He's a shelter dog that has known hard times and will eat almost anything (and loves Before Grain foods, Innova, and Canidae and a host of other dog foods).  I read the reviews, bought a bag of this version of the dry dog food, and when I gave it to him, he looked at me with a pained expression and sat down.  No go.  So I tried the canned food (the Wetlands Wild Fowl version), and I had to hand feed it to him to get it eaten.  Enough already.  It may be a good food in terms of its ingredient list, but it must taste pretty odd!

review/summary: A Great Brand of Dog Food
review/text: First off, I'd like to note that this would normally be a five star review if I were simply reviewing the product itself, but I am also taking into consideration Amazon by dropping the review by one star.<br /><br />I switched my dogs over to Taste of the Wild Hi Prairie formula when Amazon decided to jack up the price of the Natural Balance formulas I used to purchase (the Bison and Venison ones) by ten dollars.  I was hesitant to spend fifty-five dollars on a bag of food when my two dogs go through almost three bags a month, but the two-day shipping made it seem worth it, particularly since the nearest PetCo (the only store in my area that seems to carry Natural Balance) is almost ten miles of slow-moving traffic away.  However, spending almost seventy dollars on a single bag of dog food is just too much, so I decided it was time to change brands.<br /><br />Luckily, my first choice turned out to be a success.  I swapped my dogs over to Taste of the Wild over the course of three or four days and their stool has remained solid, something that has always been an issue for my Boxer (with Natural Balance being one of the few premium brands that worked well for him).  Really, the only issue I have with Taste of the Wild is that the food smells a bit strong, but when the results are there it's hard to complain much about having to catch a nasty whiff of it a couple of times a day during feeding.  My dogs seem to love it, though, and are eating with a bit more enthusiasm than they did previously.<br /><br />As I said, the score was dropped one star for Amazon's handling of the product.  First, this product actually costs about four dollars more than it does in my nearby store (it is sold in a small, locally-owned dog bakery for $49), which is only a block away.  Second, for whatever reason Amazon does not offer two-day shipping via Prime for this item.  For me, this is the bigger issue, as I typically order a new bag right when I need it rather than stockpiling them.  With the unpredictable nature of standard shipping options, it's almost impossible for me to continue to order this product from Amazon.<br /><br />That said, you can't go wrong with this product if you have dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies.  It's one of the better grain free foods that I've come across and works great for both of my large breeds (a Boxer and a German Shepherd).  Just check in your area and see if you can't find somewhere that sells it a bit cheaper.

review/summary: Good quality, tasty and delicious, high protein, BUT too Smoky
review/text: Upon recommendation by a cousin, I decided to give it a shot. It turned out that this kibble is good--high protein source (even slightly higher than Blue Buffalo), good size (medium), smells delicious, but just too smoky. The color of the kibble is pretty dark, I guess it's overcooked. My dog, a Belgium Malinois, still likes it. But she loves Orijen better. Over the past year, we have tried many brands such as: Blue Buffalo, NutroMax, Purina (Beef), Taste of the Wild, Canidae, and Orijen. By far, Orijen seems to be the best. Second being Blue Buffalo--but I am suspecting that my dog is allergic to the ingredients in it--she has bad dandruff and dried skin. So I decided to try Nutromax and Purina--both are pretty decent good kibbles (based on the price). Canidae is almost as good as Blue Buffalo. I will see after I am feeding her with Taste and Orijen mix would help her skin and coat. Hopefully it works. We've tried so many things you can name: fish oil (the real one, not the pills), weekly grooming with application of moisturizer spray specially designed for dogs, real meat, and skin tablets. Will update about this later on. The only thing my dad doesn't like Taste of the Wild is that it's too smoky--almost plungent, not sure if it's healthy. Therefore, 4 star! btw, all the above mentioned kibbles except Purina and Nutromax are natural and grain free.<br /><br />Base on what I learned from my experienced German Shepherd Trainer, the following are good kibbles:<br /><br />1. Orijen<br />2. Go! Dry Dog Food, Natural Grain Free (haven't tried this)<br />3. Wellness = Blue Buffalo<br />5. Evo Red Meat

review/summary: My dog won't eat it
review/text: My dog has severe allergies to just about everything it seems, so I was advised by my vet to switch to some rarer foods, like venison and fish. The feed store didn't have anything pure venison, so I got this instead. I have no idea how my dog would have reacted to this food, if he would still be allergic or not because he flat-out refused to eat it. He went a day and a half without eating anything, and getting worried, I put back down the food I knew he was allergic to. He gobbled it up the second the bowl touched the floor, so I know he was hungry, just not wanting to eat this food. I know the old food didn't have anything to do with it either, because after that fiasco, I special ordered California's Best new venison formula food, and my dog loved it. He just doesn't like bison apparently, which is odd because the food he was on was the red meat formula of EVO. I would think going from beef to bison wouldn't be that big a change, but it was to my dog's nose. So I'm giving it three out of five stars; this might be a good food health-wise, but smell-wise, it turned my dog off to the point he was willing to starve himself rather than eat it, and he's a food motivated dog. He never turns his nose up to anything. Oh, and if it matters to anyone, my dog is a 65 pound boxer/catahoula mix.

review/text: Researched this dog food on the internet. My two year old chocolate lab has been used to Purina One. I tried blending it,with Purina One and Science Diet. It sat in her dish for two days with nothing else to eat and she would not touch it. I gave it to a friend who has a beagle that said their dog would eat anything. The smell of this dog food is extemely strong.

Even when we tried mixing it with food he was used to, he just ate around the Taste of the Wild...which is hard to do since the kibble is so small in size. After reading other reviews, we thought we'd try this stuff out, to give our pup a change of pace. Well, now we have a full, 30-pound bag of the stuff...wonder if there are any other uses for it?

review/text: We bought a bag of Taste of the Wild after reading all the good reviews on Amazon. Our dog really seemed to like it, and do well with eating it. We bought a second bag. Again, our dog seemed to like it...but she developed a terrible case of diarrhea. We fed her chicken and rice for a while 'til things calmed down. We switched to Science Diet for sensitive stomachs, and then Eukanuba for retrievers. (Sadie is a flat coated retriever.) Her tummy troubles went away. After finishing those bags, we restarted Taste of the Wild...and the diarrhea returned. We looked at a lot of different variables...and it really seems to be this particular food that caused the problem.<br /><br />We won't be buying it again. In fact, we are throwing away what we have left.

When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow. The first thing I wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality, no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews,Taste of The Wild always came on top(dollar wise). After the switch I immediately noticed a difference in my puppy.His coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch. He has so much energy now and he has less eye discharge and less ear odor(due to being allergic to the Puppychow).

review/text: Unlike most pet owners in the world, I have fed my dogs high quality foods for years, with taste of the wild(TOTW) being one of them. Both the high prairie and the wetlands are foods I'd recommend for those on a budget wanting to feed quality foods to their dogs. The pacific stream, and sierra mountain aren't high enough in meat content for me to recommend.<br /><br />what do I like about this food?<br />dogs are carnivores with an identical internal anatomy of the wolf. dogs do not need carbs, veggies or grains. Taste of the wild is much higher in meat than a lot of other foods, and has no grains.<br /><br />firm stools! Out of all of the foods I've used, including, wellness core, canidae, acana, evo, totw always proves the best stools.<br /><br />price....this is one of the more affordable foods of this caliber....and is even comparable in price to grocery level foods such as iams or pukeanuba..which are garbage<br /><br />taste of the wild and other diamond manufactured foods are ethoxyquin free<br /><br />cons-<br />I am a little weary of foods that come out of diamond since they have had a few recalls.<br />I also think that, while taste of the wild has a lot of meat content, it doesn't hold a candle to foods like acana, orijen evo<br /><br />I'd recommend this food if you want to feed your pets a high quality diet that is better than 90percent of the foods out there but are on a budget and can't feed a raw diet or a diet such as orijen.

review/summary: Updated Review---Completely Sold on this Food
review/text: My Aussie pup loves the flavor of the Wild High Prairie blend, but didn't much care for the sample of the salmon. The only (and signficant) downside to this product is the dog ended up having awful breath. We called it buffalo breath. We started him out on no grain, free range or wild foods to avoid health problems.  We switched him to EVO and the bad breath disappeared, but he prefers the taste of Taste of the Wild. He actually leaves EVO in the dish uneaten...never a morsel left of the ToTW. I might have to learn to live with the buffalo breath.<br /><br />Went back to ToTH and the buffalo breath resolved itself. The Aussie pup is now nearly two and should be the poster dog for this food. The vet, complete strangers, everyone remarks on his beautiful thick coat, shiny eyes, and great energy. His teeth are beautifully white and he is the picture of health. He can spend a full day running with us as we back country ski...his great stamina and exuberance while breed characteristics, they are well supported by this high quality food. We'll never feed him anything else. Portion control is important, however...feed what the bag says.

review/summary: Fabulous food! HIGH FAT CONTENT, tho - be warned...
review/text: Taste of the Wild has had so many benefits for my dogs, that I have found it very difficult to know that I must switch foods.<br /><br />With an 18% fat content, you'll find that it is one of the highest fat-content foods on the market.  Both of my dogs have put on WAY too much weight... and one of my dogs (both border collies) is an EXTREMELY ACTIVE & fit "frisbee dog".  My other BC, however, has battled lyme disease - and so has achy joints and fatigue. It makes exercise difficult, and the weight has piled on.<br /><br />My dogs LOVE the taste of Taste of the Wild (Buffalo)- so much so that they have been PICKING it out of the weight control food that I mix with Taste of the wild (I'm in the process of switching to a lower fat content food)!<br /><br />Having fed Taste of the Wild for the past 2 1/2 years, I can say that their coats are BEAUTIFUL.. shiny and healthy...their stools are firm and "consistent" (easy to pick up)..they love the taste.. and the price for such a high quality food is very affordable (I buy it from Tractor Supply). 1 of my dogs is wheat-intolerant, so this has been very easy on his system!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this food is a little bit TOO good, and now I must put both dogs on a diet!<br /><br />I'm hoping Taste of the Wild will create a version of this product that is more around 10-12% fat content so that we can once again feed our dogs this WONDERFUL food.<br /><br />*Note, I do not over-feed. My dog who battles the effects of lyme disease (which was treated somewhat successfully), received less than the recommended amount for a dog that is 65 lbs.  My other dog, 40 lbs, ate the recommended amount.<br /><br />**UPDATE** :  AFTER writing my initial review, I opted to keep one of my dogs on this food for awhile as I researched what food would be best for him.  Then, as his activity level went up - he went from having gained a few lbs, to losing weight very rapidly, and was "scary" thin.  Our vet evaluated the food, and as it turns out, grainless food is not for him and his activity level (not enough fuel to burn).  Our dogs LOVED this food, and I believe it is a very high quality, affordable, healthy food for dogs.  It just didn't work out for mine, unfortunately.

review/summary: Great value for great food
review/text: I have always fed my Siberian Husky high-end, grain-free premium kibble.  I'd prefer to feed raw, but at the moment it is a little too much work and costly.  In the past I've fed Evo, Orijen, Wellness Core, and Blue Buffalo Wilderness.  Rising prices caused me to look elsewhere.<br /><br />My dog loves this food just as much as any of the others, and has transitioned seamlessly.  No runny poops, his coat is as soft and shiny as ever, and he is one happy pup when mealtimes come around.  It has been given top ratings by all of the dog food review/analysis sites that I've seen.  And quite simply, this food is by far the most cost-efficient of the grain-free foods. One bag of this at &lt;$50 lasts for over 7 weeks (your mileage may vary), whereas a $60+ bag of the "other guys'" food might get me 6 weeks.  And if you're coming from lower-quality kibble, remember that your dog will actually require *less* food on the premium kibble, due to the lack of fillers which serve no purpose other than to not be digestible and take up space...<br /><br />I see no reason to feed something other than Taste of the Wild, given its quality, and the fact that my dog has remained in excellent health since switching over.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: After trying a few different brands of grain-free food for my dogs, I gave up and settled on Canidae as my Doberman couldn't seem to handle the other premium foods.  Recently, however, I decided to give Taste of the Wild High Prairie formula a try.  I mixed it with the Canidae for about a week and then converted him over completely to Taste of the Wild.  He never had any digestive issues and within a couple of weeks his coat looked brighter.  Strangely, after all of the gastrointestinal problems he had in previous attempts to convert to grain-free, his "bathroom" activity actually improved.  I couldn't be happier with the product.  Oh, by the way, both of my dogs love the food as well.

review/text: All my pets get the best that I can give them. I researched long and hard to find the perfect food for my boxer (5mo), and this was highly recommended on the boxer forums I frequent (backed up by independent research). DFA website gives TOTW a 6* rating! The fowl version did make my girl gassy, but the bison (yellow bag) is Wonderful!<br /><br />She's growing steady, lean (as boxers should be), playful, beautiful, shiny, and soft. She eats smaller portions vs. her old food (no fillers!); really has smaller, firmer stools as well (uses more of the food). Even her breath smells good! Yard is pretty easy to clean up now too.<br />She came to me with an awful ear infection-- it has not recurred since the switch a few months ago. Our vet had never heard of this food... but she said it looks like our girl is doing Great on it.<br /><br />Our pup is always excited at mealtimes... she LOVES it... and I love that I can afford it, and we are far from rich.  In a perfect world I would feed raw, but TOTW is a great alternative.<br /><br />This food is right up there with the best of the best quality grain-free kibbles...

review/summary: The best value for a top notch dog food.
review/text: In my quest for the best dog food, I started out with the best that our local pet store had, Innova. I knew that I wanted a wheat free top of the line dog food, and Innova fit the bill.  Our puppy's coat was perfectly soft and he took to the food instantly with no transition from the wet food he was eating at the shelter.  When I finally found the time to do some real research into the best dog food I was surprised to find that Innova dog food is not one of the ten best dog foods on the market.  Innova's top of the line food is their product line EVO, but was out of my price range.  I then identified the top dog foods from independent websites that rate dog food, and went through each until I found one that I could afford, without making any sacrifice in quality, and that was Taste of the Wild.  The variety of meats in this food is impressive, and what really put me over the top was that it contains fish meal so that our puppy will get the essential omega fatty acids that are absent from the vast majority of dog foods.<br /><br />To give our puppy a gradual transition we have been putting half Innova and half Taste of the Wild in his bowl, and he has been eating out all of the Taste of the Wild first, and coming back later to finish the Innova.  So we have been happy to know our puppy is getting one of the best dog foods on the market, we are saving $13 a month, and he likes it better.  The only issue we have had with Taste of the Wild is kind of gross to write about, but he has been defecating more and hasn't seemed as hungry at meal times. This was a small concern until we realized it was because the food is so tasty that he has been eating out of the bag whenever he wants to.  (which he never did with Innova)<br /><br />Pros:  Top notch food, cheaper than lower quality foods, puppy approved.<br />Cons: Tastes so good that you will really have to keep the bag out of reach.

review/summary: holistic health approach-- high in fat and protein-- ask your vet first if your dog is old, a pup, or overweight
review/text: My dogs liked the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it.  (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)<br /><br />The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics.  There are NO yucky "meat by-products"-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about.  Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs).  The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product.  If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal.  I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too).  These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal.<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Wondering if your dog is overweight?  An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing.  Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite "waist" narrowing in front of the back legs.  Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs.  You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).

review/summary: Frenchie Approved
review/text: I have a French Bulldog that has developed food allergies and is also a very picky eater. In our quest to find him a food that was good for him and he actually liked eating I stumbled on Taste of the Wild at a local specialty dog food store. I decided to give TotW a chance after trying Canidae and realizing that the protein content was too high for my Frenchie.<br /><br />After switching to Taste of the Wild I immediately noticed an improvement in my pups stool - nice and firm and only 2-3 movements per day. Vice 5+ movements on Nutro and Canidae. My Frenchie's notorious gas was also cut way down. I supplement his dog food with all-natural unflavored yogurt too and this helps cut down on the gas greatly. After a few weeks I also noted that my dog's coat is soft and shines.<br /><br />Another positive to Taste of the Wild is that their formulas are similar enough between Hi Prairie, Pacific Stream and Wetlands Canine that I can rotate the menu a bit and keep my pup happily chomping down on his food. Previously my dog would tire of the same dog food after only a few weeks.<br /><br />For anyone with a dog with food allergies I highly recommend Taste of the Wild. Not only are their formulas grain free, but they also use unique sources of protein. For example duck instead of the more readily available chicken as a major protein source.

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: Since hubby & I switched to a primal/paleo diet it has killed me to buy dog food that listed wheat as the first ingredient and usually corn as the second. I looked at many, many reviews of many grain free dog foods, ingredients lists, pros, cons, etc before ultimately choosing this food for my boys. I have a 9 year old chocolate and 5 year old black lab. The 9 year old has chronically had an incredibly dull coat and an energy level that is increasingly low. I know, he's no spring chicken, but he was beginning to look far older than he really is. The 5 year old has always been very active with a fairly shiny coat. We switched them over slowly, as everything I read said to do & within a week it was easy to see that the older dog's coat was shinier especially around his face. A month in & completely switched over to this food, the chocolate's coat is shiny, smooth, and soooo much softer than he has ever been since he was a puppy. The black lab is even shinier than he was before. Their eyes are brighter and even the old guy seems to have more energy. The switch was easy for us, we live very rural and I have dogs who drag home dead animals and will eat pretty much anything, so no issues there. I noticed around about week 3 they were getting chubby and so we have cut back the amount we feed to what seems about right. Definitely feeding less than we did before & I think less "deposits" to be picked up in the back yard!<br /><br />We are so happy we made the change to a grain free food for our boys. I was concerned knowing there had been recalls in the past but looking at ingredients and reviews and taking prices into consideration, I think this is definitely the best for the money!

review/summary: Inconsistent lately
review/text: We used this dog food for years until this month.  Within the last year, we have noticed significant variations/inconsistencies in the food smell, moisture content, and apparently the taste.  Our 3 dogs used to love this.  But lately, our one dog won't even eat it - for days!  She will smell it and walk away looking at me.  Within the last month, two of our other dogs did eat the food but within 24 hrs  had profuse vomiting.  The vomiting issue with our 2 dogs combined with the ongoing inconsistencies has caused us to stop using this food.  For a number of years we were very happy.  Don't know what changed but our dogs either won't eat it and/or got sick.

review/summary: My Jack Russell says "YES!" Or "arf," I guess..
review/text: We recently received a Jack Russell terrier from a man who couldn't take the dog with him to where he was moving. As thanks, we got all of the dog's toys, treats, a bed, and...a big bag of Pedigree. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Pedigree's "Adopt a Shelter Dog" campaign, as it's great publicity for the millions of dogs in our local shelters that need a good home. But the ingredient list is pretty lousy, and it's something I think a working class dog like the Jack could do without. So we ordered him a big bag of Taste of the Wild, a company I'm already familiar with through their cat food line. For the week or so he's been eating it, I can already see a noticeable improvement in his hunger alone--he used to gingerly pick up pieces of Pedigree kibble and crunch them down as if saying "Meh, it's food, Kind of." After the second or so bowl of TOTW, he flies face first into his bowl like a heat-seeking missile, and scarfs down his reward so quickly you'd think he hadn't eaten for days! The ingredient list is pretty top notch--the first three ingredients are bison, lamb meal, and venison, which is a ridiculously great indulgence considering the stuff that passes for dog food these days. (Now, if they could only get a similar meat profile for their cat food, and cut down on the sweet potato...but that is another review.)<br /><br />Two things to note, though: this food is rich, with a much higher level of protein and fat than your dog may be used to. The first few days my dog ate it, his stools were almost liquid, and I had to do a Pedigree-TOTW mix just to be able to not have a nasty mess happen when walking him. I recommend you do the same, especially if your dog is transitioning off of a heavy corn/filler-based food. From what I've read about the fat, it's good for both your dog's coat conditions and energy levels, but if you have a little couch potato dog who doesn't mind not running for days on end, I might urge you to consider something a little less extreme. But for big, strong and active dogs, this food's definitely a winner. It's a touch pricey, but 30 lbs of food for one 20+ lb dog? I'd say it works out pretty well, at least in this household.

review/summary: I think this made my dog sick - bad batch?
review/text: Ever since I opened the newest bag of "Taste of the Wild," my dog has not wanted to eat it.  The pellets look much different than usual, and the food does not smell good.  My dog rejects it, and when he does eat a little, he looks very unhappy about it.  He has been vomiting multiple times per day since eating this new bag of food.  Through a process of elimination, I have come to the conclusion that this newest bag of food is making him sick.  Although my dog used to love this food, I have lost faith in the brand and will not be ordering any more.

review/summary: Great dog food, unbeatable price.
review/text: Many dry grain free foods are good but few give great bang for your buck. Taste of the Wild certainly does. It ranks among the highest rated grain free dry dog food in the market and the price can't be beat. My lab loves it, and the kibbles are ideal for snack/treat size as well. I used to buy treats for training but these kibbles to the job... thus saving me more money. The 30lbs bag is work the purchase. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great stuff unless...
review/text: I fed this, for the longest time (almost a year, cycling with "Wetlands" variety) to my English Bull pup. She appeared to enjoy it, presumably because it's a very rich food - multiple high-lean protein sources, unique protein, good fat content, grain free and at the low end of the premium food price line ($48 / 30 lbs @ my local shops).<br /><br />She grew quickly, her coat is always shiny and smooth, her eyes bright, incredible energy for an Eng-Bull and she never had any bathrooming or vomiting issues. Stellar grub for her.<br /><br />Now to the unless:<br /><br />I still give this food 5-stars because my scenario is comparitively unique. I'd gotten a 2nd pup (Treeing Tennessee Brindle - like a Plott Hound, only smaller). Immediately began transitioning her from her crap-food (Purina Puppy Chow) to ToTW. She liked ToTW as much as my Eng-Bull but about the 3 week mark began developing a bad case of Pyoderma (puss filled sores, akin to hives) on her belly, neck and where her joints meet the body. My first suspect as it should be with anybody was a protein - what does ToTW Praire and Wetlands have in common? Chicken and egg product.<br /><br />Thus began the transition to "Pac. Stream" who's sole source of protein is fish meal... guess what - the pyoderma worsened. Her belly was redder than a fire-hydrant, countless numbers of pustules, balding from all the itching she was going through and incredibly destructive behavior (I have a 16 item list of all the stuff she's eaten - includes digging a hole in the couch, a cell phone, dozens of poo-bags - in my absence and I'm pretty sure it wasn't due to separation anxiety).<br /><br />Next step, check ingredients and what do ToTW "Prarie", "Wetlands" and "Pac. Stream" ALL have - that's right: Fish meal. Now, between Cefpodoxime (a wide spectrum antibiotic), some strong prescription shampoo and the removal of all fish proteins from her diet she's looking good and behaving better.<br /><br />Thus, this is a great dog food..... unless you've got a pup w/ fish allergies (you could still reasonably feed the "Sierra" blend but none of the other three).<br /><br />As a side-note, if you do have a pup w/ what you expect to be food allergies try Natural Balance LID (Limited Ingredient Diet) blends. Both of mine now eat NB LID Venision / Sweet Potato w/ canned supplements that don't have any fish protein or oils in them (Merrick has a great line of canned food sans fish product).<br /><br />- MD.

review/summary: Best food on the market!
review/text: I switched my dogs to Taste of the Wild Roasted bison and venison about 6 months ago.  Our family includes 3 canines, a 19 pound Boston Terrier and 2 Doxles (mini-dachshund/beagle) at 20 and 24 pounds.<br />Feeding at the prescribed amount, a 30 pound bag lasts us about 3-4 weeks, depending on how many doggie visitors we have.<br />My dogs' coats GLEAM! Their eyes sparkle and their energy level is higher. Training is easier and I believe it is because they are very well fed.<br />My Boston just had a very serious eye injury, requiring weeks of meds and vet visits. Our vet told us that the only reason she was able to save her eye was the excellent shape she was in before the injury. She asked me what I was feeding them and what I told her TOTW, she beamed! "Best food available" was her comment! My dogs are worth it!<br />When we first started on TOTW, I tried the different varieties, this one was far and away their favorite. The wild fowl one they didn't care for at all.<br />BTW, Amazon's price on this feed is much higher than what I can get locally. TSC, Rural King, and Big R all sell the 30 pound bags at $40.

review/summary: good food but now cheaper in store than online
review/text: Amazon price I give a 2 star and the food I give 4 stars. The first time I ordered this on amazon after reading good reviews on it I found it was $50 in store and figuring on saving money over the long run I could get it for $46 and change through amazon and with their prime service I got it shipped free in 2 days... that was good in my opinion. Now I get ready to order another bag and wouldn't you know it the price jumped up to almost $52 with amazon and is still just shy of $50 in store locally. Even with tax it is about the same now, but I don't have to wait to get it I can just run right down to the store and get a new bag. The food is great and I do recommend it, I just may not recommend it through Amazon anymore. I have a redbone coonhound and she doesn't chow down like she is starved but she does eat it when her 2 daily feeding times come around.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: When we initially got our Irish Setter/Lab mix from the pound he was severely underweight and a sick puppy (worms).  After the proper veterinary treatment we set about gradually bringing him up to his ideal weight.  We fed our previous dogs a high quality food that included grain and started our rescue on this only to find that he had an allergic reaction.<br /><br />Our neighborhood pet food shop recommended Taste of the Wild, and despite being put off by the seemingly high price we decided to take their recommendation.  Not only has our dog thrived with this food, but it is so nutrient rich that we have been able to cut down significantly on the volume that we feed him.  Guess what else decreased when we cut down on volume...waste.  In the end the decreased feeding amount has made TOTW as or more economical as the other, lower quality food we used.<br /><br />Our dog has been incredibly healthy, and this food has helped us to keep him at a healthy weight.  I highly recommend Taste of the Wild to anyone looking for high quality food for their pet.

review/text: I have 4 Pomeranians. I switch to TOTW because my dogs are getting old and I want them to have better food so they can live longer. I have switch for over an year. At first I didn't notice any difference on them. My husband was laughing at me saying all I know is spending money on nothing and I should quit my online shopping habit. So he insisted that we should just buy regular and cheap dog food from Walmart. So we did and that's when we've noticed the difference. The dog food we got from Walmart was only half the price of TOTW. However, with the same weight of food it lasts shorter because my dogs need to eat more to satisfy their stomachs. Just like we all like junk food and the more we eat the more we want. Eventually, I spent the same money on dog food in a month and they've all pack on weight. So now my husband said we should switch back to TOTW and he admits that it is a good product.

It is not quite as good as EVO or Orijen, but its also 30% cheaper. It is entirely grainless which is great for dogs since grains are not a natural part of their diet. And it is loaded with high quality protein as the first four ingredients on the bag. And my dog loves it. She has a beautiful coat eating this food, her stool is always solid and she has plenty of energy.

If you lookup Diamond Pet Foods on Amazon you will see that they use lower quality ingredients and none of their foods are in the same league as Wellness or Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />My problem with this food is that they used to use buffalo and venison as the top 2 ingredients, as the label indicates, but now they use chicken and lamb to cheapen the product.

review/summary: Fabulous dog food
review/text: This is, in my opinion, some of the best dog food out there. It is a reasonably priced grain-free food, which you usually have to pay well over $50 to find it's equal. Especially when you look at poor quality food like Science Diet that is usually sold at a ridiculous price. I have two young Carolina Dogs which, due to their feral breed, are extremely picky. We tried a variety of foods, including Blue Buffalo that they would not deem to touch. The only way we could get them to eat it was to mix tasty things in with it after they dropped too much weight from not eating. So we switched to this, which I thought might appeal to them with the gamey meat and high protein. Bingo. We have been giving this to them for several months now and they continue to wolf it down, with or without tasty things mixed in. Love it.

review/summary: My dog goes crazy for this stuff - AND he's healthy!
review/text: This is a fantastic dog food, by far the best I've ever used.  I switched my English Springer Spaniel to it when he was about 10 months and it solved all kinds of dietary problems he was having.  I had started him out as a puppy on Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul.  It was great food and he seemed to do well on it.  His waste was "hard" and regular and everything was fine.  When he got a little older and I switched him to the adult version of Chicken Soup, he started have frequent problems with diarrhea.  And it didn't go away.  At first I thought it was the adjustment period.  Then it lasted for well over a month.  I finished the bag and put him on Taste of the Wild.  It completely solved the problem.<br /><br />The best part is that he absolutely goes nuts over this stuff.  Before, with the Chicken Soup, he would eat -- slooooooowly.  It was like he was hungry but didn't really find it appetizing.  It was a real pain because we would have to watch him eat so our little poodle wouldn't steal his food.  With Taste of the Wild, he goes nuts, jumps and spins circles, and then wolfs down the whole bowl in about 90 seconds.  I quit buying doggy treats for his training exercises because he loves his food even more!  I'm not kidding.  In fact, I think the quality taste of this product is what sets it apart from some other high-end brands.  My dad gives Fromm to his old lab and has the same problem about him eating it slowly and without much enthusiasm.  He's thinking of trying this stuff just to make the dog eat faster.<br /><br />When I was originally shopping for this product, I noticed a few people commented about the smell.  They said it stinks.  Well, I disagree.  It honestly smells like a roast dinner in the crockpot with a hint of that dog-food smell.  My wife agrees (but happens to dislike the smell of roast dinners).<br /><br />One last thing is that Taste of the Wild seems to give you a lot of bang for the buck.  I takes less food to achieve the same results as cheaper foods, probably because the nutrients are so high.  I feed my one year old, 50 pound English Springer about two cups a day and he stays the perfect weight.  That ration makes the bag last about 6 weeks.  Not bad at all.

review/summary: Incredible grain free food
review/text: TOTW is one of the highest quality dog foods you can get.  I've been through many brands of "top quality" dog foods only to find irregular stools, low energy levels, and supplementing both of my dogs diets with vitamins, vegetables, or other items.  After my third round of research I decided to give TOTW a try, something that I can't even get a 30lb bag of in my local pet food stores.<br /><br />Both of my pitbulls love this food!  They drool for it while I'm fixing up a few bowls for them, and they haven't done that in the past.  One of them has an extremely sensitive stomach but was fine with the switch over as I followed the switching schedule on the back of the bag.<br /><br />I will say, after the dogs were on the 3rd day of TOTW one of my pitbulls start to show signs of detoxification.  She got rashy, her skin was hot to the touch, and she seemed miserable.  We debated stopping the switch of the food, but are glad we didn't.  After a few days of this she was fine, and her coat was looking better, her stools consistent and healthy, and her mood greatly improved.<br /><br />Our other pup had a very difficult time putting on weight since we had to heavily treat him for mange for over 8 months.  As some reviews have mentioned this dog food has quite sufficient protein and fat content, which helped him get back up to his normal weight as well as keep his coat looking shinny and soft.  The fat content shouldn't be an issue if you are keeping your dogs active as you should be!<br /><br />Bottom line: This food is extremely high quality, has great immune system benefits for your pup, is grain free (dogs shouldn't eat grain!), and will boost your dogs energy.  This is the closet thing you can feed your pup to a raw diet, without having to deal with raw food, and dogs love it!  Please, stop feeding your dog the major brands of dog food that will put your dog in the Vet's office.  Spending a little more on dog food will lower your vet visits and your dog will be healthier and happier after this switch!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food
review/text: I own a very active, healthy border collie/bulldog mix that is 2 years old.  Nine months ago I switched her food from IAMS Healthy Natural dog food to Taste of the Wild and I couldn't be happier with the results. Her coat improved in its shine and texture, her energy level improved and she became slightly leaner. She enjoys the taste of her food and I have been able to free feed her without her putting on excess weight. I highly recommend this brand of dog food.

review/text: Our Mastiff has terrible food allergies.  We have tried several brands but finally found this and within a week his skin hotspots cleared right up!  His fur is shiny, glossy like mink!  We are just so happy he looks like a million bucks and more importantly he feels better.  I have been recommending this food to everyone!  Thank you Taste of the Wild!

review/summary: FINALLY cured my dog's digestive issues!!!
review/text: I have a lab/mix dog that we adopted in May 2012 - since day one - our dog had digestive issues resulting in extremely loose stools.  We took him to the vet and got a full blood panel done and nothing of interest came back - which meant it had to be something he was eating.  Long story short - I did a ton of research and found that our dog needed to get grains out of his diet.  We bought Taste of The Wild - Bison and Venison formula and almost immediately noticed a difference.  We are 2 weeks into this new food and when I tell you - he is 100 percent better.  He has not had a bout of digestive distress since he has been on this food.  I am so happy to have found a food that works so well.  If your dog has digestive issues consider changing to this outstanding grain free dog food - I hope this review helps.

review/summary: Best dog food ever.
review/text: My Australian Cattle dog is allergic to EVERYTHING. We started feeding her the Taste of the Wild brand and she has been the happiest dog ever  since we switched. There is no other like it anywhere. I am so grateful to the people who make this food. It is the ONLY food I will buy.

review/text: Quick shipping, and the dogs really like it.  They prefer this to anything else, minus a steak..  I like the price, and the grain free part,  my dog seems to scratch pretty bad when I feed him any other dog food, and this seems to be good for him...

review/summary: Good dog food
review/text: It took me over a year to find the perfect food for my dog. My dog gets a lot of eye "goopies" from her food so I found that mixing this food with Iams premium protection was awesome for my dog. The Iams keeps my dogs eyes clean and TOTW keeps her stool at a good consistency as well as providing her with plenty of protein and fat. Not to mention her coat is shinny and she has plenty of energy.

review/summary: Looked healthy and Prime eligible at the time...
review/text: Just easier to get this delivered via Prime. I usually mix Blue with Wellness Core but Blue was no longer available via Prime so I'm trying this. He eats it and seems fine. He mays not be as eager as he was with the Blue though. Not a problem as of yet and no ill effects from the switch...
