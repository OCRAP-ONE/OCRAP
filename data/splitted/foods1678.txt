review/summary: Another good product in this family of hair care items
review/text: (Note:  This review is mostly the same as the one for its sister product, Volumizing Root Boost.)<br /><br />We've always bought the cheapest shampoos in the store, judging that they were all pretty much the same. Well, in this case at least, there is a difference.<br /><br />Both my wife and I tested this shampoo as well as its sister product, Total Care Volumizing Root Boost. We saw very little difference between these two products, but they both stand well above the typical shampoo. Coming out of the bottle they are both thick and creamy, and very little is needed to get a good lather going. When it comes time to rinse out, they wash off easily, leaving no residue. I was suspicious at first because my hair did not feel "squeaky clean" after rinsing, but once my hair was dry I could see that it was both clean and soft, not oily, and stayed that way all day, even wearing a hat. Both shampoos also give some weight to the hair which, with my thinning hair, I really appreciate. My wife also reported that with this shampoo, she felt no need to use conditioner. The reader will see essentially the same review on both of the Clear Scalp products we tested, the only difference between them being that other one (Volumizing Root Boost) probably leaves the hair with a little more weight. But we expect to give up our practice of buying the cheapest shampoos and will purchase one of these in the future.

review/summary: Great Clarifying Shampoo
review/text: I tried the Clear Scalp&Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Shampoo through the Amazon Vine program, and I am pleased that I did.  I usually use a brand of thickening shampoo for color treated hair, and the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Shampoo was quite different.  My hair and scalp felt really clean after one shampoo.  Because my hair has thinned a lot over the years, I use a lot of products on my hair and I mean a lot!  On a daily basis I use root lifter, keratin fiber powder and spray, as well, as hair spray.  Every time I shampoo I also use a conditioner and a volume booster, and I use a hair masque weekly.  With all this "gunk" on my hair and scalp, sometimes my regular shampoo has trouble getting my hair clean and I have to shampoo twice.  I was pleased to discover that the Clear Scalp&Hair Beauty did a great job of cleaning my hair and scalp, and I only had to apply the shampoo once.  I gave this shampoo 4 stars, because I don't think I will use it on a regular basis as I'm afraid it might be a little too much for the little hair I have left.  I will continue to use this shampoo on a "weekly-ish" basis to clear my hair and scalp of all the products that I use, and let it "breathe."  For anyone who occasionally uses a clarifying shampoo in place of her/his regular shampoo the Clear Scalp&Hair Beauty shampoo is definitely one to try.

review/summary: BURNED MY SCALP
review/text: This burned the heck out of my scalp. I couldnt rinse this out fast enough and it was STILL burning after rinsing. What the heck is in here. It doesn't lather as well either it's wayyyy to thick. It's LOADED with fragrances its one of the first ingrediants as is SLS and silicones which are bad for your hair. I'd totally skip this one. Also this has Zinc Pyrithione which is for dandruff and I think this might have helped cause the burning if you have NO dandruff then use this it has nothing to burn through so to speak. Anyway I'd def. skip this.

review/text: At first I loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner. It smelled great, my hair was manageable, it curled perfectly. Then my hair started falling out. A few strands extra here and there. But my family starting saying mom your hair is everywheres. Then the clumps started coming out. I have stopped using the S&C the clumps are still coming and I am forced to swish my foot over the drain thru my entire shower. Hopefully it will stop I really enjoy having hair.

review/summary: Itchy scalp no more!
review/text: I tried this shampoo because I have always had "itchy" scalp, but no dandruff. I knew I needed healthier scalp, so I figured I'd try Clear, since it was inexpensive enough. I love it! I've been using the total care shampoo/conditioner combo for a few weeks now, but I noticed a difference in my scalp almost immediately. I have very wavy and frizzy hair, and this has really helped to tame it.  No, it won't make your hair so perfect that you don't need a styling tool, but it doesn't claim to do that. It feels silkier (NOT oily) and smells so good. I have tried every shampoo/conditioner under the sun, and this is hands down my favorite. I thought I was doomed to have itchy scalp forever, since even expensive shampoos didn't help. Thanks to Clear, my hair is so much more manageable, smells delicious, and my scalp feels great!

review/summary: Not all that!
review/text: Purchased the shampoo and conditioner after reading all the hype in magazines.  Been using Bed Head products from my hair salon prior.  After 1 week using this I noticed my hair felt thinner and could feel more of my scalp!  This was a tad alarming.  My hair went to feeling somewhat healthy (highlight my hair so has some processing stress but not much) to feeling unhealthy.  Texture was changed.  Also noticed the color looked washed out after using.  Products going in garbage can and back to shampoos/conditioners from salon!

However, when the product was shipped, the container had leaked and there was shampoo all in the bag it came in.  Other than the bottle spilling, this is a great product.

review/summary: Bad ingredients=bad shampoo
review/text: I thought this shampoo might be answering the call for a mild shampoo with vitmins for the masses, but it's just a LIE.  A shampoo is suppose to mildly clean the hair and this one contains harsh detergents (SLS).  I don't even use SLS on my hands.  It's also heavily loaded with silcones, which laminates hair and weighs it down, so you need a shampoo to get it out.  You might want one conditioner or straightening product with cones, but not your shampoo.  Also, it contains other ingredients that causes allergic reactions, and does nothing for hair, (Bismuth Oxychloride).  Why would you want to stick Bismuth in a shampoo?  In short, steer clear of these products.

review/summary: Cleans great
review/text: This gets rid of itchy scalp that I sometimes get after I visit the hair stylist.  I am sensitive to some of the products they use there.  I'm not sure what ingredient does it to me but I suspect that now, since they often include some sort of botanical essence or extract in so many products, that some sort of essential oil, possibly lavendar oil, may be to blame.<br /><br />Whatever causes it, this gets rid of it.  This really foams up as well as anything I've tried.  It really does a thourough cleaning job of the scalp without stripping the hair of moisture.  It also left my hair very shiney and full of life.  It has a very faint, almost non existant scent.  Would I buy this again?  Absolutely.  I also love the conditioner that goes with this.  If I didn't already have about twenty shampoos, I would buy a bottle of this immediately.  Oh heck, I'm adding it to my cart anyway since it's so inexpensive here.<br />It's great after I go swimming, to get the salt and chlorine out of my hair.  I love great hair products and this one is definitely great.

review/summary: Makes your hair fall out...
review/text: I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.<br /><br />Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT. Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.<br /><br />Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else. Went to the doctor and had all blood work done. Everything FINE!<br /><br />I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....<br /><br />Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene. Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out. Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.<br /><br />Called the manufacturer and complained. They said this was unusual... I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.<br /><br />They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...<br /><br />If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck. If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment. IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.

review/summary: Best I've ever used
review/text: My roommate is a stylist and is always bringing me different salon quality shampoos and conditioners to try. I usually like them, but not enough to go out of my way to buy/request more of. I tried this on a whim- I swear I'm so susceptible to hair product marketing. I'm so glad I did. Its my favorite. My hair feels clean, light and healthy all day. I have very long think hair, so often shampoos weigh it down or cause me to spend way too long trying to rinse it out of my hair. I've bought three bottles so far, which is a lot for a compulsive tester of new products.

I wanted something affordable that gave me the same results. I have tried it ALL, Garnier (the entire line), Pantene, Sauve...and finally this came to the market, so I thought, "Why not?" FINALLY!

review/summary: I couldn't tell much of a difference from other shampoos
review/text: I used an entire bottle of this shampoo (no conditioner), and here's what I've noticed: not much. I'm not a big shampoo person. I use shampoo, of course, but I generally buy whatever's cheapest. Prior to this bottle, I used Suave at $1 a pop. I don't have especially problematic hair, I keep it short, and there is no artificial coloring to worry about. So I don't need much shampoo or much from a shampoo, and this bottle lasted a while. To the extent that I noticed differences, they included: This shampoo is more viscous than other shampoos, so I was able to use less; this shampoo did leave my hair wetter longer after showering, noticeably so; that's is, though. I had neither the problems that others have had nor any particular benefits other than clean hair that any shampoo could deliver.

review/summary: Excellent Product; Excellent Value
review/text: I reviewed both the "Clear" shampoo and the "Clear" conditioner.  Several other members of my family tried these products as well.  Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.<br /><br />We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  Not only did it lather properly, it is extremely concentrated, so little shampoo actually has to be used.  Both my wife and I also found that if one used the shampoo daily, the conditioner was needed only on an every two-or-three day basis.<br /><br />This product will become a staple in our household.  Highly recommended.

The ingredients are impressive for a conventional shampoo since a lot of healthy ones are included.

review/text: The only problem I had with this shampoo is the packaging.  It leaked a little.<br /><br />I have thick hair that pretty much has a life of its own.  It's literally impossible to get it to do anything other than what it feels like doing when I wake up in the morning.  And while this shampoo didn't change that exactly, it did seem to make my hair softer and thus more tractable after about three or four washes with the Clear Scalp conditioner.  Simply put, when I wake up these days, my hair looks pretty respectable and all I have to do is brush it and go.<br /><br />Bottom line: I liked the shampoo but the packaging needs a bit of work.

review/summary: Good shampoo, may be too much for fine hair
review/text: Overall, I thought this was a good shampoo. My hair seemed very soft and shiny after using it - this occurred even after just one use. However, I have fine hair and it gets weighed down very easily. Because of my fine hair, I wouldn't use this as an everyday shampoo; eventually it would be just too much product for my hair.  Last but not least, the scent of the shampoo is a good one as well - it's a light scent but still smells good.

review/text: The shampoo works well-- it cleans without stripping too much moisture from your scalp.<br /><br />However, as another reviewer commented, the Vine shipping method did not do this product any favors.  I received BOTH the shampoo & conditioner in a badly leaked state.  The shampoo had leaked quite a bit in the bag, which had punctured as well, so it was a big mess.<br /><br />The scent is much too heavy, imo.  It doesn't give me a headache (I'm sensitive to some scents), but it is quite potent.<br /><br />If the shipping problem would be resolved when the product is released, it would be a decent buy.

Because it seems to have a somewhat of a conditioning nature, I did not have to use so much of the matching Conditioner with it.<br /><br />The container is easy to hold, the cap flips open easily with wet hands, and it may leak when stored with the cap down, as another reviewer had happen.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy this brand of shampoo and conditioner if the price were right and the shipping secure.

Unfortunately, the bottle was sent in bubble wrap and a manila envelope.  It leaked...all over!  This is when I first learned that the bottle shape is not good for soapy hands!  It kept slipping out of my grip as I tried to clean it off!<br /><br />This product claims it is "for all hair types and is clinically proven to help restore scalps natural moisture balance."  It also advertises that it is "Formulated with Nutrium10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C and E, sunflower, almond, soybean and coconut oils and aloe vera."  This all sounds great!  However, when I used it - only once - I had what I can only explain as an allergic reaction on my scalp!

review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Shampoo might actually live up to its advertising.<br /><br />I am a senior citizen with long, thin, fine hair. My usual shampoo cleans my hair just fine. However, the Clear shampoo did much more. The shampoo thickened each strand of hair. Normally it takes at least 15 minutes for me to comb out the tangles. Not with this Clear shampoo. Five minutes after my hair was dry, I had it combed out and braided. Since I've used the shampoo only once, I can't tell if it will improve the condition of my scalp as much as it has my hair, but I am eager to discover the effect there as well.<br /><br />One caution: If you travel with this shampoo, seal it in a plastic bag. The shampoo was delivered to me in a box containing no other items. In spite of that, the shampoo container managed to leak all over the plastic bag in which it was sealed. The flip-open top on the shampoo bottle cannot be sealed.

I've only used it twice and I'm practically back to my natural color and the gray is out in full force! The shampoo arrived in a padded envelope, but also wrapped in plastic. Mine hadn't spilled over as others have mentioned, but there was a strong odor just opening up the envelope. The shampoo is very thick and gooey and doesn't take much to get a good lather going. It seemed to clean well enough, but my hair felt dry and wanted conditioning - which it normally doesn't need as I don't blow dry much. I'm going to stick with the color safe shampoo I've been getting from the salon, and free or not, this product is headed for the dumpster.

review/text: I am the kind of person who reads the ingredients list of EVERYTHING. I did a little experiment. I didn't read the ingredients list until after I started using this product. I loved the feeling it gave my hair - nourished, just like the package promises. My scalp and hair felt great. I noticed the smell was pleasant even though I was sure it was a chemical fragrance. The ingredients are a real let down. The product definitely gives great results but I object to the long list of chemicals in this product. Most products have them. So, unless you are making your own or buying pricey health food store purist products, you will find this product attractive and not at all objectionable. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR898">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>

review/summary: I LOST ALL MY HAIR
review/text: This was the WORST shampoo ever! I bought it b/c it was new and expensive and there were ads everywhere about it. I saw after like 2 uses ALL my hair was falling out in STRIPS. It was HORRIBLE. I cut my hair short thinking that it would get better and it just got worse. (I have black curly hair as long as down to my knees.)Now I barely have any hair, and after reading about all the bad reviews here about hair loss, I will never use it ever again. I cut my hair for no reason like 3 feet. That makes me the most upset. I really hope that it goes back to normal soon. One piece of advice: NEVER BUY THIS EVER!

review/summary: Hair loss after Clear shampoo!
review/text: At first I too loved this shampoo. After only 2 weeks (washing 3 times a week) my hair started falling out in huge amounts. I quit using it and after a month there seems to be less fall out. My once thick native hair is now weak and thin. My daughter also had the same results.

review/summary: In LOVE!!!
review/text: I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months and am about to complete my second bottle. This is an excellent shampoo, in my opinion. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and shinier than it has ever been. I find that if I use the shampoo in conjunction with the corresponding conditioner that I am able to easily pass a comb thru my wet hair, which is not the case at all with other products. Hopefully they will release some corresponding styling products in the near future. In the past I have also not been able to use the same shampoo brand for an extended period of time for some reason. I have not had this problem with this shampoo.

review/summary: My scalp doesn't itch anymore!
review/text: This shampoo is amazing.  I have a very oily, itchy scalp.  I often scratch my scalp and get oily residue underneath my nails but this fixes that problem with daily use.  I can't use the conditioner unfortunately, because my hair is just too oily for it.  I highly recommend this product.  My only hesitation with giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that my hair is just SO oily that sometimes I have to use baby powder mid day to get rid of some oil.  For normal hair people it should be wonderful, but for me it is worth it because it gets rid of the dandruff!

review/text: I have struggled with dry, flaky, itchy dandruff for years! Nothing and I mean NOTHING made it go away. It was so bad that I would have to dust after everywhere I sat! I got this for free through shespeaks and gave it a try. I am so thankful for this shampoo and conditioner. After 3 shampoos my head was the completely clear! That hasn't happened in YEARS! I did try the one specifically for dandruff but those results weren't as good as the regular formula.

review/summary: Itchy Bumps Developed On My Scalp
review/text: I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.

review/summary: Good moisture benefits
review/text: I first saw this shampoo at Walmart. I was a little reluctant to buy the full size bottle.So I bought the travel size bottles of the "total care" shampoo and conditioner and so far I'm loving it.<br />The shampoo is pale pink a has a thick creamy consistency. It lathers really well and it smells great. The smell is very reminiscent of the original herbal essences shampoo only a little softer. I have dry, curly, frizz prone hair and this shampoo helped to tame my frizz. My hair also looked and felt fuller and thicker after styling. The only draw back with this shampoo is I felt a slight tingling and cooling sensation on my scalp. Not bothersome enough to keep me from repurchasing. All in all a great shampoo. I will definitely be purchasing the full size bottles.

review/summary: Pretty basic shampoo---not a stand-out
review/text: I reviewed Clear conditioner recently, and was very impressed with it.  I found it made a real different in how my hair and my daughter's hair felt and was able to be managed, so I was eager to try Clear shampoo.  I must say---it's a pretty basic shampoo.  It worked, it cleaned my hair, it rinsed fairly well, it didn't have an offensive odor, and there isn't a lot else to say.  My hair felt about like it does when I use most mid-range shampoos, but not the way it does when I splurge on expensive shampoo like Pantene.  I would buy this if it were the brand on sale at the drugstore, but would not seek it out, and in a crowded shampoo brand market (I think) I am not sure how it will get noticed.

review/summary: Fine but nothing special about it
review/text: I received the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty nourishing shampoo and have been using it as needed.  I do not wash my hair every day - only 2 or 3 times per week.  My hair has been color treated and tends to be very fine and limp.  This shampoo only gives me one day of good looking, clean hair.  After one day, my hair goes limp and flat against my scalp.  I think this is due to having been moisturized too much by the shampoo.  I think I'm going back to regular old anti-dandruff shampoo.  This shampoo smells nice and lathers well, it just doesn't do my hair or scalp much good.  If you were to have dry hair or very thick hair, this shampoo should be wonderful for you.

review/text: I don't currently have dandruff so I sort of ignore my scalp but it makes sense that a healthy scalp will support healthy hair. I like this in that it leaves my scalp feeling clean without that tingly feeling you get with some dandruff shampoos. And I also like that is lacks that medicine smell of some dandruff shampoos.<br /><br />Of course, it's not a dandruff shampoo but I was sort of expecting the unpleasant odor of a dandruff shampoo and was pleasantly surprised that the smell was nice.<br /><br />And I like how it makes my hair feel. Very soft and very clean.

review/summary: A good shampoo, good packaging
review/text: I basically belong to the school that holds that a shampoo is a shampoo and there is the end of the matter. I liked this product. It is a shampoo but I think it is superior. Part of the reason is the packaging. As befits a Unilever product it is solid, the opening and closing of the dispenser is smooth and it feels good to hold since it was probably contoured to fit the human hand. The shampoo itself is pinkish white and about the consistency of Nivea hand lotion. It does a splendid job of cleaning hair and I have less of this item to clean each month. Washes off well and leaves no residue.<br /><br />Also, liked the fact that it does have an hydrolyzed animal protein. I probably would not write to persons I know endorsing it but would certainly recommend it.

review/summary: Soft, silky hair is yours
review/text: Clear shampoo claims to nourish your scalp and thereby your hair. Your hair is not actually absorbing nutrients from your scalp, pleasant as that idea may be. Hair, once it leaves the follicle, is not alive and can't eat anything. I was not able to find out exactly what Nutrium 10, the secret ingredient in Clear shampoo, might be. The main ingredients are water and the detergent Sodium Laureth Sulfate, plus a nice variety of oils including sunflower and coconut oils.<br /><br />So I don't know about the nourishment of the scalp, but I do know that it leaves hair smooth, silky, and shiny. My scalp seems fine, too. This is an economical shampoo, with good results.

review/summary: great body and shine no conditioner needed
review/text: This is a very nice shampoo, it leaves your hair clean and feeling moist even when wet. It doesn't leave your hair that squeaky dry feeling when wet like after using a clarifying shampoo yet it cleans very well. I can get a comb through my hair easily after using it which is unusual for my long very fine hair that easily tangles. When my hair dried it was even a little wavy, very shiny and the fragrance is quite pleasant and lasted into the next day. My scalp has a tendency to break out from many shampoos but this one didn't do that at all. I tried the conditioner but found I didn't need it, it actually made my hair to heavy and was oily looking before the day was done. I use this shampoo alone and I really like the results.

review/summary: Nice shampoo, Smooth hair
review/text: I have color treated, below shoulder length hair.  My normal shampoo/conditioner is Paul Mitchell<br />I got both the shampoo and conditioner through the Vine program to try out.  I tossed them into my workout bag and have used them for the past 9 visits to my gym.<br /><br />The shampoo lather is creamy and seems to clean fairly well, it sometimes felt hard to rinse out competely.  It seems quite concentrated and so I started using less and less of it over the trial period, so that might be a good thing to be able to use less.<br />The conditioner feels thick and smooth.  It does a good job of coating my hair all the way down to some of my damages places.  I wouldn't call them repaired, but they were coated enough to smooth them out.  It doesn't seem overly heavy or sticky, rinsed out fairly well and my hair felt silky and slippery (just the way I like it after a shower)<br /><br />I prefer to just let my hair naturally air dry and curl the ends later.  I never blow-dry.  These products are excellent in the fact that I didn't have any puffiness or flyaway problems after it dried.  My wavy areas seemed to be smoother and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  My hair turned out to be very soft and smooth looking.  Nice to touch and comb.<br />I did have a bit of a problem with my scalp being itchy and a whole lot flakey after the first few uses, but that has stopped, so there was definitely some changes going on there from this product use.... hopefully for the good.<br />Bottom line is that I like both these products.  They smell really great, and the price is very good for what they do.  I may update this review when I get to the bottom of the bottles.

With an *. The * states that you need to use the conditioner as well. So what exactly are the benefits of the shampoo alone?<br /><br />So as a shampoo, it works great. Anything else? Who knows.

review/summary: Still just shampoo.
review/text: So after using this for about a week along with the conditioner, I can't really tell much.  I don't really have a sensitive scalp, but I do have a scalp that likes to get a good scratch now and again.  I've tried all the tingling shampoos, the liquid medicines but nothing seems to really take away that need when my scalp starts to itch.<br /><br />I must say I was surprised that with a name like Clear Scalp & Hair...I was shocked to see the product is not clear.  I don't know why I had my mind made up that it would be, but when it came out and wasn't, there was a sense of let down which leads me to believe that it's still just a bunch of chemicals I'm putting on my head.<br /><br />Since I was fortunate enough to have both the shampoo and conditioner at the same time, I will also say that I'm not a fan of the product packaging.  The shampoo stands up with the opening in the air, while the conditioners opening is down.  Maybe this is so you can tell the difference in the shower?  I don't know, but again, I didn't like it.<br /><br />In the end, this is just shampool

review/summary: Meh, Nothing Special
review/text: First of all, I got this through the Vine Voices program and was seriously miffed when I opened the manila envelope to find that it had leaked all over the inside. I was able to salvage half the bottle though after scrubbing it off. Not sure if it exploded because of a faulty cap or the bottle's curved design so I wouldn't order it through the mail if I were you.<br /><br />When I did use the shampoo I thought it was okay but I wouldn't pay $5 a bottle for it surely. It has a pleasant smell and doesn't take much to lather your hair. It did help with some very mild scalp flaking I had but it also weighted my hair down. Unlike the Heidi Klum (love her!) commercials for it claim, it didn't make my hair break any less than usual or make it shinier. All it really did was clean my hair just like any other shampoo would. Verdict: Nothing special.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: This review is going to be the same for the corresponding conditioner, as I received both at the same time to try out. Since I can't (more won't) use each individually to see their own merits because it'll play havoc with my hair, the review is going to be for the both of them.<br /><br />OK. First things first. This produces a lot of lather, which I discovered when I had to clean off the shampoo bottle that had leaked during travel. This is nice since I like lather, but I want to note that hair cleansing products do not need to produce bubbles in order to work. (Very few need to produce bubbles and bubbles/lather is actually from additional bits that have been added to make it look like it's working. Old trivia factoid.) If you're one of the people who dislike having a lot of lather, be prepared for this. (I know that there are people out there like this.)<br /><br />The shampoo and conditioner smell pretty nice, which is a bonus. I've smelled some shampoos that either don't have much of a scent or they're so overwhelming that no amount of other bonuses can make up for the perfume stench. Clear's scent is neither under or overwhelming. You can smell it if you stick your nose into the washed hair or right after you've used it, but it's not going to be smelled across the room.<br /><br />What I really liked was that this didn't weight my hair down overly much. My hair feels nice and soft, without feeling heavy or greasy. I'm pretty finicky about shampoo/conditioner products since many will either undercondition (making me look like a brown haired Little Orphan Annie) or they'll undercondition and I'll end up with hair that looks lank and greasy. (I've been pretty happy with my Garnier Nutrisse products for the most part, although lately it feels like they've changed the formula slightly.) What I also liked is that after using the combo a few times, I don't get a weird buildup feeling to my hair.<br /><br />I rather like this overall. I'm still not sure if I'd overall replace my normal shampoo and conditioner, but I'm willing to give this a longer trial period. I've already purchased more of this product with my own money, so I suppose that this is as good of a recommendation as any.

review/text: This shampoo cleaned my hair and left it soft.  It lathered well, and it smelled good.  The product is quite thick, and it doesn't take very much to do the job.  The bottle opens easily, which is great in the shower, but not so great for shipping.  My bottle arrived clearly having opened in transit- there was dried product all over my bottle.  For those purchasing, Amazon should really consider shrink-wrapping the bottle for mailing.  The easy flip open lid simply opens too easily to be safe during shipping.  Otherwise quite a good product.

review/summary: Nice shampoo, I still like my regular Nexxus Therappe best!
review/text: This is a very nice shampoo that lathers up luxuriously and smells great!  I used this a few times and my hair felt fairly smooth after blow drying (I have dry-ish, curly-ish, often frizzy hair if left to dry naturally, made worse by humidity, styling and also from my workouts, where sweat and salt coat my hair). My husband described his hair afterwards as silky. While this shampoo has Nutrium 10, which has a variety of moisturizing ingredients for hair and scalp (soybean oil, aloe vera, coconut oil, various vitamins, etc.), I think with Sodium Laureth Sulfate second on the ingredient list after water, you can pretty much expect the same results as most shampoos available today, and what shampoo work best simply becomes a matter of personal preference, although this shampoo did not strip my hair like some cheaper brands do.<br /><br />My shampoo was shipped in a plastic bag and in a non-padded mailing envelope, so naturally, about 1/4 of the bottle had leaked by the time it arrived at my door. I understand this was a Vine review product, but more care should be taken when shipping this kind of item, since there is little point if most of the product is unusable! Fortunately that was not the case, but it was kind of a pain to open it and discover the bottle had easily opened in shipping. I've had much smaller itmes shipped in bubble wrap in disproportionality large boxes, so it is baffling to me that the same care was not taken with this bottle. It made the bathroom smell good, though!<br /><br />This shampoo is definitely very reasonably priced, and I would use it again.

review/summary: Soft, shiny hair
review/text: I am delighted with this product. I wash my hair every other day, which can be drying. This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and extremely soft. I love the way it feels. The fragrance is mild when it is being used and leaves no lingering scent on my hair. While it does not claim to be hypoallergenic, it does not irritate at all (either by scent or contact) as many products I have tried do.

review/summary: Good, But Nothing Special
review/text: This shampoo cleans well and leaves your hair soft, but I can't discern any difference between this and most other shampoos on the market.  It has a light, pleasant scent -- not too perfumey -- and it lathers well.  I would use it again, but it's nothing to get super-excited about.

review/summary: So far so good!
review/text: I have to say, I'm pretty impressed so far. I'm using the one for colored hair. I have grey hairs that I color frequently because I'm pretty young, (25) and I work in the beauty industry where image is everything. I also have psoriasis and a very reactive scalp so my hair routine was an endless cycle of: coloring hair -> irritated scalp. Switch off between T-gel and keratin color care shampoo. T-gel -> faded color. Color hair-> irritated scalp. It is seriously driving me crazy!<br /><br />I haven't even thought about my scalp in the past 2 days that I've been using this shampoo and that's a really big deal for me. My scalp is usually irritated and sore, so it calls itself to my attention. The shampoo and conditioner felt instantly soothing when I put it on, which was nice, and my scalp feels really clean. If this product does not fade my color quickly I will write another review and give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: I'm reviewing the shampoo and conditioner together here because it is likely that many people will be interested in buying both products simultaneously.<br /><br />In regard to shipping, my experience was similar to what other Vine reviewers have said. I ordered both the shampoo and the conditioner and both leaked in the air bubble packaging they were shipped in. The conditioner bottle was actually broken and now can't be closed properly. The shampoo has a toggle cover that even a small child can open, and my guess is that it was inadvertently opened when packed for mailing. Along with others, I suggest that the company devise something more sturdy to prevent this type of leakage.<br /><br />I have normal hair and scalp and a typical short haircut. I prefer to use natural organic soaps and shampoos and only decided to order these products because this appeared in the Vine product description:<br />`Formulated with Nutrium 10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean & coconut oils & aloe vera.'<br /><br />The shampoo made my hair look dry and a little frizzy and also less lustrous. To me, the most noticeable thing about the conditioner is that it has a very powerful scent that lingers for a long time. I'm used to the natural scents of organic products and don't like chemical scents at all.<br /><br />The old saying 'You get what you pay for' is true here. These products can become popular because they are relatively low priced and work similar to comparable items.

review/summary: leaves hair clean without being weighed down....
review/text: I have curly hair with a thinner to medium consistency.  I like a shampoo that will give me a good wash without making my hair feel stripped or one that is so heavily conditioned that it weighs my hair down and makes it limp.  I really liked the way this shampoo made my hair feel.  Soft, but not overly conditioned. The shampoo has a pleasant scent, but may be too perfum'y' for some.  My husband also used it and thought the scent was fine, not too much, but he is not overly sensitive to fragrance, as some may be.  The shampoo lathers nicely and the 12.9 oz. bottle is a good size for the shower.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was a good shampoo that left my hair feeling clean,soft and manageable.  I occasionally change out my shampoo and would definitely look at purchasing this one as a good alternative to my regular brand.

review/text: I have been using this shampoo for a little over 2 weeks now and have noticed a difference in my hair.  I have long, straight hair and during the summer months it tends to become a little frizzy and unmanageable because of the humidity.  This shampoo helps to keep my hair from smooth and silky feeling, even on the hottest days and even my husband likes its scent and the new softness of my hair.  I will definitely continue to use this product in the future and am looking forward to also trying out the conditioner in this series.

But more importantly it leaves my scalp feeling rehydrated. Some other shampoos feel like they dry out your scalp but this one feels like it helps to hydrate it...almost like putting lotion on your scalp but no greasy feeling afterwards.<br />I will definitely be using this one again or trying the other variations.

I have really dry hair and scalp and I can really feel a difference not just in my hair, but the way my scalp feels, not so tight or something. It isn't overly sudsy, which is a good thing, I don't want to strip my hair and scalp of the oils it takes so long to accrue. My hair is medium length, about an 6 inches below my shoulder and a little goes a long way with this shampoo. I really do recommend it.

Was surprised after towel drying my hair to discover I could feel the difference.  That said, haven't noticed any of the "scalp nourishment" claims to make any difference on my scalp.  Scent is light and unlikely to offend, or really be noticed much (not a bad thing).  All in all a pretty good shampoo.

review/text: This shampoo really cleans your hair- perhaps overly.  In the shower, after using this product, my hair feels stripped and straw-like.  I definitely put conditioner on every time I use this shampoo.  That said, afterwards (with the conditioner), my hair feels very light and clean.  I do not feel like there is any build-up in my hair.<br /><br />For me, I believe this shampoo is a bit strong.  However, I do not use any styling products such as mousse, or hairspray.  I think if I did, this would be a nice shampoo, as I am fairly confident it would strip all of that gunk from your hair.  Or if you have really oily hair, this might be a good shampoo to try.

review/summary: Works well.  Quite thick . . . and pink, too.
review/text: This product is pretty good.  While I won't say that my hair is suddenly superhealthy or that it has improved body because of this shampoo, I will say that the product hasn't caused any damage that I can see.  The shampoo claims to be "Total Care Nourishing" with "nutrium 10" (a "moisture complex" of vitamins), but I wouldn't necessarily trust that claim, considering that a conditioner is designed to be used in conjunction with the shampoo.  That notwithstanding, the product did a serviceable job at a decent price. It's very thick, with something of a pink-and-lavender color.  Note that the product is not specifically geared towards women or men.<br /><br />With regard to shipping, expect that the bottle might arrive with plastic wrap around it and some product leakage, sort of what you experience when you take toiletries on an airplane and find that they leaked due to air-pressure differentials.  No big deal, but something that might figure into your buying decision.

review/text: This product works great on super-long, super-thick hair, so it should be good for anybody.  Whereas Matrix shampoo requires an anti friz cream for this hair type, and Pantene leaves it greasy, this product leaves hair with a healthy look and feel.  And unlike other competitors the feeling lasts for much longer than 2 days.  This product makes straightening easier, and it smells good too.  It exceeds all expectations.  I wouldn't be surprised to see many, many others switch from their current shampoo to this one.

review/summary: My Hair is Soft and Manageable
review/text: Lathers up nicely. Rinses out easily. Cleans my hair, but doesn't strip it, so it's not as dry as with some other shampoos. Not overly scented, but I wouldn't mind an unscented version, and I could do without the red dye. My hair is 24" long. If I don't brush it several times, it's a tangled mess by the end of the day. I find that, combined with the conditioner, I don't have to brush it as often as I usually do. In addition, my hair is incredibly soft. I love the bottle! It has a very ergonomic design and is easy and comfortable to hold, and I love the flip cap! Press to open. Press to close. So easy!<br /><br />7/3/2012: I just received the Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner. Amazon has addressed the problem of leakage by putting a piece of clear tape over the lid. It worked, and the tape came off with no sticky residue left behind. Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: i would have given it 5 stars except for.....
review/text: the bottle's design. I'm lucky that I have a compartment to store it in for easy access -- it's top heavy and if it stood on its own it would fall over very easily --  and the plastic is slick enough that it could slip out of a wet/soapy hand. The flip open top also flips open too easily.<br /><br />That being said -- the contents of said bottle are GREAT! The shampoo, which has some unpronounce-able chemical ingredients - DOES have some nice vitamin-fortification -- it is creamy and a little goes a long way (I have short short hair). My hair doesn't collapse toward the end of the day like it used to, so my hair still loooks purty at 4 pm instead of ratty -- it's shiny and even though it's baby-fine, it keeps its shape all day.<br /><br />So this shampooe is a winner -- EXCEPT for the ergonomics and design of its container.

review/text: I received this item after the first order was sent to the wrong state. It came in a bag in a box to big for 1 bottle of shampoo and it was leaking everywhere from the cap becoming open during delivery. The smell is divine and it left my hair feeling clean. The lather was very nice for only using a quarter size for my hair being below mid back.<br /><br />I honestly got compliments about how my hair smelled. I feel like you may not need the conditioner on an everyday basis as my hair felt pretty soft just from the shampoo itself. I would like to see the price on this shampoo on amazon. Wal mart sells it for 1.97 (3 oz) Walgreens 5.99 (12.9 oz)<br /><br />Amazon needs to get the shipping better also. This is not the first, or even the 5th time I've gotten something damaged through the mail. The bottle itself should have been tapped.

review/text: I have dry curly hair.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results I got with this shampoo.  The first thing I noticed was that  a small amount goes a long way which is a plus for me since I usually have to use a lot of shampoo to create a nice lather.  It left my hair soft and manageable.  It softened my hair so much that I was tempted not to use conditioner- which I ALWAYS use - in the end I decided not to push my luck and used my regular conditioner. After I dried my hair it felt clean and soft to the touch.  My husband also commented on how great my hair smelled, so I have no complaints.

review/summary: Clear - Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Shampoo, Total Nourishing Care
review/text: Note: This review was made by Ron's girlfriend as she used the product.<br /><br />This shampoo has a great scent and silky texture!  I am able to use a smaller amount than my regular brand to create a nice lather that rinses easily (and I have hard water, so that is a challenge with some other shampoo brands).  I haven't needed to use a conditioner after I use this shampoo, because it does a great job on its own of making my hair silky, soft and non-frizzing.  I've also been able to use less product in my hair to keep my hair from being frizzy or unmanageable.  My hair feels lightweight and very clean, not the heavy or unhealthy-looking buildup you can get with some shampoos. So, economy and effectiveness get scores of 5, but the only negative I experienced is that my hair is significantly less shiny than normal.  Usually when I can achieve less frizz then my natural hair gloss comes out, but not so with this shampoo.  Nonetheless, I will continue using this product, and will try other varieties of this company's shampoos, because of all the other positives.

I love the design of the bottle. It is easy to hold when dispensing the product for usage. The shampoo is creamy and rich. It lathers easily and rinses completely. What I love best about this product is the scent. It has a light, fresh smell that lasts all day; however, it is not an overpowering feminine scent. It is absolutely divine! As for my hair, it is very smooth, shiny, and full of bounce. I have long, fine hair so I have to be careful with products weighing it down. Not so with this shampoo. My husband and teenage sons are using the shampoo, too. We all love it!

review/text: I got to the fitness center a lot so between the steam, the sweat and the showers my hair takes a beating.<br /><br />I can't profess to be an expert on shampoo, so what I look for is simple:<br />a- Does it get my hair clean?<br />b- Is it easy to rinse out?<br />c- What's my hair look like the next day?<br /><br />I tried this product out several times and I have to admit that it does seem to be a therapy booster.  My hair felt softer and "nourished" after several uses, and I liked the way it felt after blow drying it.  Because it seems to have its own conditioner in it, though, I think it would be overkill to use another conditioner with this shampoo.<br /><br />Generally my hair isn't overly brittle, so this product left it with a nice feel the day I used it and the day after.  I actually tried using this shampoo every other day and felt like it helped my hair more than using it every day.  I like it as a supplement.

review/text: I bought this shampoo and conditioner after being lured in by the commercials. I was able to buy them at WalMart for a very cheap price($4.75 a piece). That is the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this shampoo and conditioner.<br />After using them I noticed that my hair looked a little funky(I color my hair, and it looked a lot lighter...and somewhat nappy). I blew it dry and almost cried. My colored hair(which is normally shiny and sleek) was at least 2 shades lighter...no shine whatsoever, and was gummy:( I was so disappointed. So I would caution any one who is contemplating buying this product, and advise them to pass this one by. It does NOT do what the commercials say it will do, and actually harmed my hair.

review/text: I wanted to try this product because some members of our family have easily irritated scalps.  We were very disappointed.  First, the bottle indicates that the scalp benefits are only indicated when the conditioner is also used, so I bet the shampoo does little or nothing to help your scalp.  The other thing is that the shampoo smells awful and everyone refused to use it.<br /><br />Pros: It might help your scalp, but only if you use the conditioner<br /><br />Cons:<br />Have to use the condition to get scalp benefits.<br />Smells terrible.

review/summary: Left my hair feeling greasy. only pro is that it smells good
review/text: This shampoo definitely looks good from the packaging so I was hopeful that it would also be a good shampoo. Upon opening the bottle, I can tell that it smells great. It kind of reminds me of Pantene Pro V or Pert Plus. I got compliments from my husband after that it smelled good and it did smell good for days.<br /><br />However, the shampoo didn't seem like it really cleaned my hair. Afterwards, it was still a little slick and after just one day, it was filled with grease and needed another washing. I also started to notice that my hair was falling out more than usual so I stopped using this.<br /><br />I really thought it might be good from the smell but I can't have a bald head.

review/summary: So Frustrated
review/text: I started with the inexpensive trial sizes that came in a box at Target. From the first use, I noticed a huge difference in my hair. The shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic and they leave my hair smelling fantastic for over a day. I never blow dry and I've never colored my hair, so when I let this air dry and my slightly wavy hair turned out with perfect waves and was so smooth and silky feeling. Everything was perfect.<br /><br />Then I went to wash my hair again. It seemed weird that it took longer than normal to wet my hair, but I brushed it off as a coincidence. I kept using it, but every time I washed my hair, it took longer to get it wet. So, I went to the store and switched to the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy: Moisturizing Dry Scalp formula. Yeah. When dry, my hair looks, feels, and smells FANTASTIC. But then I go to wash my hair and it's like my hair has become water resistant. It takes about ten minutes for my hair to get wet enough to put shampoo in. It's horrible.<br /><br />So, if you want your hair to look, feel, and smell fantastic, but in a way that cannot be good for it...at all, then I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/text: My cat will only eat the Whiskas Choice cuts with beef.  My local stores quit carrying this product and I bought any cat food similar to it, regardles of price.  My cat ate only dry food for two months or more.  He lost weight that he can't afford to lose. I am so happy that I found this Whiskas item on Amazon.

review/summary: My cat's favorite flavor
review/text: It is hard to get just one falvor of this product. I was very happy to order 48 pouches. However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don't receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments.

review/text: Another popular seafood flavor that Sophie and Samson won't share.  When I bend down to place their bowls in front of them, they are on their back legs trying to get to it before I can put the bowl on the floor.  They act like they have not been fed in days. Nothing will disturb them - not even their favorite UPS man who brings them treats.  Can't beat Amazon prices !!!

review/summary: My cats go crazy!
review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

review/text: Cats love this stuff. One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).<br /><br />Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.<br /><br />My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.<br /><br />All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.  We give pouches as a treat.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

review/summary: My cats come running
review/text: I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food.

review/summary: Roasted and not too salty
review/text: It is very hard for me to find roasted and salted organic sunflower seeds.  Apparently I'm supposed to eat raw ones, but what can I say?  They were fresh, toasty roasted, and lightly salted.  They are great straight out of the bag or in salads.  I've had some before that were greasy and soft, but these are dry and roasted properly and no rancid fat odor (I've had some real lemons).  They are not as crisp or covered in a white crust of salt like some conventional bagged ones-but I never liked those anyway.<br /><br />I hope I can get this reliably in the future, because they're the best organic sunflower seeds I've tried!

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup by far
review/text: I have been accused of going over-board on some things and my K-Cup obsession has been no different.  I have tried almost every bold K-Cup on the market (really, my kitchen is full of those little boxes).  Many of them are very good, and some (like Timothy's Rainforest Espresso) are excellent.  Still, for day to day drinking I always go back to this blend.  I find it to be smooth and satisfying.  I use the second to smallest setting on my Keurig B70 (7 1/4 oz.) and I usually enjoy three to four cups in the morning (I never reuse a K-Cup, but if it works for some people, fine).  If I want more or a cup later in the day I switch to the decaf version, also very good.<br /><br />I miss my Newman's Own so much when I travel that I have started packing a Keurig B30 with me so I can enjoy this coffee on the road.  This one is perfect for me.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, best I've found in K-Cups
review/text: I'm always in search of the perfect cup of coffee. Prior to getting a Keurig for Christmas I would make multiple visits a day to a local Starbucks or Seattle's Best for my usual Tall or Grande bold brew of the day served black so I could savor the flavor. Since getting my Keurig I've been able to consistently brew great coffee at home and have found a few I really like, but for getting that bold but not overbearing coffee house taste I believe this is the best you can get for these machines.<br /><br />This is a very smooth medium-bold (don't mistake the 'extra bold' label for a dark roast.. you'll find none of the smokey/burnt taste associated with dark/French roast in this coffee). If you're looking for something close to Starbucks Medium House Blend, you'll be very happy with this coffee. As with all pre-ground coffee, make sure you buy from a high volume seller. Get a box of K-Cups that have been sitting on a store shelf for a while and there will be a noticeable difference.

review/summary: Very Good Cup of Coffee
review/text: For an extra bold blend this coffee is extremely smooth with very little to no aftertaste. It is definitely in my top 5 k-cups. Many people argue that it is not in fact an extra bold roast, however, extra bold does not mean overly strong and bitter like many expect. I myself like many extra bold roasts that are also smooth like this one and the Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee; I also like medium roasts. If you like smooth coffee without the aftertaste this is the coffee for you -- enjoy.
