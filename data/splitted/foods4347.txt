review/summary: PG Tips - the best
review/text: First of all, I had been buying this tea from an English shop in Atlanta for years. Finding it on Amazon saved me 50%, and no shipping charges!<br /><br />As to taste, it is simply the most flavorful tea I've ever consumed. Just tea, no additional flavors or any other junk. I drink 3 to 4 cups a day. Even just before bed, with no caffeine effects. I recommend it to anyone who loves a nice cuppa tea.<br /><br />Rory Tate<br /><br />Canadian, OK

review/text: I studied at the University of Glasgow for a year and tryed all the teas the local shops had to offer. PG Tips was by far the best. It never never seems to make a bitter cup of tea no matter how long you leave the bag in and if your on a student budget the best part is the pyramid bags have enough tea to make 2 to 4 cups per bag depending on how stong you make it and how long your willing to let it brew. It also keep well so if you aren't a big tea drinker and know it will sit for a little while that is just fine i smuggled bag a whole suitecase full of beans and tea last year and i am down to the end of the tea and it is still as good as ever even though it just stored in a tin.<br /><br />I even got my mom hooked on it when she visited and now she can't stand any other kind of tea either.<br /><br />Emerald

review/summary: Decent enough coffee drink in a can
review/text: This product claims to have "50% more caffeine" than whatever else you can find in a canned coffee drink. Maybe this is true, but I have to say that based on the several cans I've consumed, a strong buzz failed to materialize. As far as taste goes, it's passable. The colder it is served the better; it gets less palatable as it adjusts to room temperature. The drink consistency is thin, not as "rich" as the Starbucks doubleshot if that matters to you. It's too bad Amazon doesn't offer Doubleshot by the case - and at a discounted price - as it does this item. I'd order that before I would pick up "Shock" Coffee.

Great for a quick pick-me-up when you start to get that middle afternoon nod going. Problem is in the military it was free.Here at home you have to pay for it. Individual cans are hard to find in my area so I purchase via Amazon. The Shock Latte (and Mocha) are pricey but I believe well worth it. It needs to be well chilled and shaken before it is drinkable. Great flavor and very effective. I like it better than Starbucks or Red Bull and feel it is more effective. I'd have rated it 5 stars except for the per unit price.

Starbucks costs much more for less, and I was cut off when Trader Joes discontinued their triple latte for "re-formulation".  Finding this saved me/us here (we both got used to grabbing a cold tripple latte instead of hot coffee every morning even when I went back to working days).  With subscription, it is the cheapest yet and delivered to my door on a schedule.  Great first thing when I get up for work (and in the morning) and during my graveyard shift.

So when I buy frozen palak paneer in USA I'm not expecting much but Tandoor Chef Palak Paneer is so very disappointing! It is extremely bland and has a plasticky aftertaste to it which is surprising because their kofta curry (that comes with spinach pilaf and channa masala)is pretty good. I'm going to stick to the channa masala/kofta curry from now onwards.

It's milder and has less intensity (don't know if it's less oil or less spiciness), so it's easier on my stomach.  Another reviewer said that this is their 2-year-old's favorite meal.  That indicates that it's not as strong as what you get in the restaurants, yet it's delicious.<br /><br />The "paneer" is a kind of mild cheese that tastes a little like ricotta with the texture of firm tofu.  It is an excellent vegetarian option to meat.

review/text: Palak Paneer is one of my favorite dishes to eat when I go out to Indian restaurants, so I was very excited to try Tandoor Chef frozen palak paneer.  Although it's not quite the same as the palak paneer I've tried at restaurants, it was still very tasty and satisfied my craving for Indian food.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be fairly high quality, with nothing unpronounceable in the ingredient list and no preservatives other than citric acid added.<br /><br />This palak paneer, like most Indian food, is slightly spicy for my taste but enjoyably so.  Since this frozen entree doesn't come with rice, I made rice to go along with it.  I wasn't able to eat this palak paneer without a hefty helping of rice to moderate the spiciness and to help prevent heartburn.  Go ahead and call me a lightweight, but that was my personal experience with this product!<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed it very much and would certainly be willing to buy it again.

Which, while I like, is something I can do with the equivalent of a can of spinach and a stick of mozzarella. Supposed to be medium spiced but, again, it just tastes like those two ingredients. Tandoor Chef does a rather passable (and tasty) chicken tikka masala too, so was very dissappointed. Will not be trying this particular one again.

I usually get my tea directly from SL but when I run out I have to fall back on Dilmah...and having moved here from Australia (where the tea is widely available), I'm very happy that Dilmah is finally available in the US.<br /><br />Update - March 18th, 2010<br />I've been drinking Dilmah Premium for a long time now and love it but lately wanted to widen my horizon; With that in mind, I tried the Dilmah Supreme and Dilmah English Breakfast. Dilmah Supreme rated an average on my scale but ah, the English Breakfast! If you wish to have an extra special cup of tea, bold and rich in flavour with subtle nuances, then the English Breakfast is definitely your cup of tea! While more expensive than the Dilmah Premium, it is well worth the price! Enjoy...:)

review/text: I'm a tea snob and typically buy the more expensive whole leaf teas by the ounce, but when traveling, I typically take bagged tea for convenience. I've tried all the usual brands you typically find at your local grocery store and they're all just terrible. No really... just awful. I had been making do with PG Tips, as they make a reasonable cup of tea but then I discovered Dilmah while in Australia. This is the best bagged tea I've ever had. Period. And before Amazon started carrying it, I had to get it from various importers (and pay too much).<br /><br />This Dilmah tea has a crisp, rich, smooth flavor with a sweet finish. It's great for a breakfast tea, takes milk well and is even great iced (I'm drinking some as I type this). It's good enough that I sometimes crave it over my precious whole leaf teas. And like all bag tea (aka shake), don't over steep! 30-60 seconds is all you need.

review/summary: Ah,  Dilmah!
review/text: This made my morning to find Dilmah for sale on Amazon.  I have struggled to find Dilmah ever since I fell under the spell of its charm and quality and tastiness in New Zealand about six years ago.  I have ordered it imported from Dilmah, I have gone back to NZ and enjoyed it every day, and I have gotten it as a gift from a Canadian friend, but now I can easily have my own sure supply.  A truly great tea!

review/summary: Tea-riffic!
review/text: I was lucky enough to stumble on this exquisite tea when a coworker "gifted me" with a couple of teabags.  I am a committed coffee drinker, so put off making tea for a couple of months.  However, after one sip, I was completely hooked!  The taste is pure, clean, and downright straightforward, without any hint of the bitterness that you get in blended teas. It also makes a wonderful iced beverage. (Dilmah's Earl Grey is also a superior tea, but in my mind nothing compares with the crisp, clean taste of their Premium 100% Pure Ceylon Tea.)  By the way, I've not had a cup of coffee since December--I'm completely Dil-wowed!

review/summary: I am thrilled they have this tea!
review/text: I am from new Zealand and they have this tea in all the grocery stores over there, I loved it when lived thee and missed it when I moved to the USA. I ran out of my stash from my last trip home and was bummed. I was thrilled when I took a chance and looked to see if amazon selled it and they do! I love the taste, it is better than any tea we have in the USA and they other thing I love is that they are not individually wrapped which is not wasting paper and extra packaging. They do not have strings and that may bother some, but I like it better as you can compost them or put them right down the waste disposal.<br /><br />Def give this tea a try if you are a tea drinker, it's the best!

review/summary: Good Loose Black Tea for the Price
review/text: My husband and I were introduced to this tea by a good Australian friend of ours. He brought it with him and insisted we try it. My husband, who used to drink Diet Pepsi in the morning, had never been a tea drinker. If he were writing this review he'd have given Dilmah Ceylon five stars. He now makes hot tea in the Keurig single-serve machine every morning for his commute to work and has another cup in the evening.<br /><br />However, I am writing this review and I can say, for the price and my palate, it's a four-star tea. We brew it traditionally and in our Keurig. The only problem I have with this tea is that I pick up a note of seaweed. I don't know why, but this tea, literally, smells fishy to me. It's not a strong smell/taste, but sometimes it puts me off. I will drink it though.

review/text: I first encountered Shock coffee while deployed to Iraq and it's absolutely wonderful (much better taste than Doubleshot)!  When I couldn't find it where I was living in Iraq, I emailed the company asking where I could find it and they sent me a free case (24)!!  I would drink one of these before going into some really boring briefings and had no problem staying awake.  Overall, great drink (much more oomph than Frappacinos and fewer calories!)....and a wonderful company who made many deployed troops pretty happy.

review/summary: Tastes rather good but lacks the kick of Starbucks Iced Coffee
review/text: I bought this after learning of the sad demise of Starbucks Iced Coffee which was my favorite canned coffee/energy beverage ever.  It actually tasted like iced coffee, not a coffee flavored dessert beverage.  I'll really miss that stuff.  Sniff.<br /><br />This stuff tastes rather good, but the coffee flavor is overwhelmed by the sweeetness, and it just plain lacks the caffiene kick of the late great Starbucks Iced Coffee.  Why is every drink company now coming out with creamy super sweet coffee cold canned beverages, but canned iced coffee doesn't even sell when Starbucks tried it?  I don't get it, and I'm not sure whether or not I'll get another case of this stuff.<br /><br />However, some caffiene is in there, but I don't feel anything close to the "three hits" touted on the label, and although "sleep is overrated" I found it quite easy to get to sleep shortly after consuming a can last night, and I had a lot of work to get done.

review/text: I love this coffee, glad I bought the 24 pack! I do like bottled Starbuck's mochas but think this has a more natural flavor. There is a fine balance between the coffee and cocoa flavors. I just have to shake gently for 2-3 seconds. It does energize me, but luckily, does not turn me into a tasmanian devil. The can is a good enough size to linger on for 2-3 minutes. I love this stuff both right from the can or poured over ice. I took one to work and it was a great way to break. Pray Amazon never discontinues this because I am hooked. Can't wait to buy again!

When I'm getting tired and about to head out to party, I slam one of these.<br /><br />They are reasonable in calories and taste great!<br /><br />I don't understand the guy who says these don't compare to DoubleShots. Every time I hand one of these to someone looking for a DoubleShot, they love it and remark on how much more caffeine they have. I had two friends who's hands started shaking after drinking one and they are serious coffee drinkers.<br /><br />I found these at a convenience store when I was on a business trip near Boston. I looked for them after I got home to Texas but the only way to get them right now is via Amazon. I wish I could get a subscription order to them!

review/summary: Wife's pack
review/text: Wife used this pack on our 10 mile excursion into the San Juan Wilderness area. Seems to work just o.k. The only real complaint is the non-standard hydration bladder compartment. I purchased two camelback bladders. My pack has two vertical compartments in main section. This pack uses a "square" bladder in the fanny pack section. We just zipped her bladder in the vertical outside pocket. Worked pretty good that way. Being able to access the bottom of the pack without unloading everything is a nice feature. It is just o.k. because of the price, and non-standard hydration compartment. Also, unrolling 4 feet(exageration) of material to load top is a pain.

review/summary: Some start their day with coffee... I prefer SACRAMENTO!
review/text: I've been drinking two 4 oz. servings of tomato juice every day for the past 35 years or so. In that time, I've tried them all, from the famous to the obscure, from brand name to generic.<br /><br />SACRAMENTO was always in my parents' home, so it was the first, and this one remains my favorite. The texture's perfect, it has just the right tang, not too much salt, not watery, not syrupy sweet.<br /><br />Tomato is the ideal juice choice. It's lowest in calories of all juices, contains 0 g. of fat, has lots of minerals and vitamins, and per ounce is the best value-- what more could you ask for? And when the juice is SACRAMENTO, well, you've got the ultimate! (Sounds like ad copy, don't it? But I'm serious.)<br /><br />My only complaint is one of marketing, and this goes for all large juice cans: why 46 ounces? Used to be 48, an even amount if you have 4 or 8 oz. servings. What's up what that, juice manufacturers? (And don't get me started on the shrinking size of graham cracker boxes...)<br /><br />PS-- love that gold-colored bottom on SACRAMENTO's cans!

review/text: Bionaturae is quickly becoming one of my favorite brands.<br /><br />I buy this spread at my local natural foods store.  It was one of the two fruit spreads (the other being Bionaturae's wild berry) that had neither citric acid nor sugar cane (both are excluded by my diet).<br /><br />Call me crazy, but this stuff is so good I eat it out of the jar.  I do not eat bread and so do not have much on which to spread it, but a spoonful after dinner or in the afternoon is a wonderful treat.  I've been thinking about mixing it with the bilberry juice (also delicious) in popsicle molds for a frozen delight.<br /><br />The flavor reminds me of black currants.  It's tart but still sweet.  If you like spreads with a little more bite than sweet this is an excellent choice.

review/summary: wonderful fruit spread (cousin of blueberry)
review/text: Once a week for a treat I like to put some organic fruit spread on my toast. I thought it would be nice to try a new flavor, especially since my favorite Bionaturae raspberry does not seem to be available anywhere anymore. I had read that bilberry is delicious and that it promotes good eyesight. The price with shipping does seem prohibitive if this is the only item ordered. But I needed to stock up on some other goods that Vitacost carries and my order was large enough to qualify for free shipping.<br /><br />So I had my first taste of bilberry this week. Yes, indeed, it is quite delicious! I thought it tasted remarkably like blueberry. A few years ago my allergy test said that blueberry is off-limits for me and I have missed being able to eat it.  As I was swallowing the last luscious bite of bilberry, it dawned on me that I should have stopped myself sooner. It turns out that blueberry and bilberry are related and someone who is allergic to one should not eat the other. It can cause respiratory difficulty in a minority of people (as could any food to which one is allergic). I add this caution for someone else who may be in the same boat of blueberry-allergy with me, who may be unfamiliar with bilberry as I was. Wish I could eat more of this myself, but it was easy to find a willing proxy who will enjoy the remainder of the jam for me.

review/text: I started using this product a few months ago after reading the benefits it has for the eyes--and it does help--or at least it has helped me.  I use it in combination (alternate days) with bilberry tea--just a tablespoon full or put that amount on some homemade bread and it is a delicious treat as well as a natural way to improve my vision health.  Highly recommend this product!!!

review/summary: Excellent Sampler Pack, Perfect for Entertaining
review/text: This Green Mountain Flavor Sampler is a great item to have on hand when you're entertaining a large group of friends.  It also makes a nice host or hostess gift when visiting someone who has a Keurig coffee brewer.  Of the four varieties included, three of them rank among my personal all-time favorite K-cups.  Rain Forest Nut is a deliciously smooth medium blend with no bitter undertone whatsoever.  The Wild Mountain Blueberry tastes exactly as you might imagine: full-bodied and sweet, with a satisfyingly tangy aftertaste.  The Vanilla Caramel Creme makes a wonderful dessert coffee: it's rich, smooth, and has an appetizing aroma.  I also enjoy the French Vanilla; it's just not as distinctive as the other three, and tends to be the least seldom chosen the coffee drinkers in my world.<br /><br />Another little tidbit about this Green Mountain Sampler: two of the flavors -- the Rain Forest Nut and the Wild Mountain Blueberry -- are Fair Trade Certified, which simply means that the coffee farmers who grew the beans were paid a living wage for their crops.  I like that concept.  It makes my morning cup of Joe just that much more pleasurable.

review/summary: Smells one ways, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past. We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book. I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

review/summary: Okay, but could have been better.
review/text: I ordered this, thinking I would receive Rainforest Nut coffee, but when the package came, the Rainforest Nut k-cups had been replaced with Caramel Nut Creme. I checked the GMCR website and found that Rainforest Nut k-cups had been discontinued in 2011! While I enjoy French Vanilla and Wild Blueberry, I am very disappointed that Rainforest Nut has been discontinued in the Green Mountain k-cup offerings. One of the earlier Fair Trade coffees offered by Green Mountain, Rainforest Nut had a flavor that wasn't like any other flavored coffee: it was subtle, understated, and elegant. I learned to love coffee by drinking Rainforest Nut, and I even learned to drink coffee without sugar by drinking Rainforest Nut. I hope I can find another flavored coffee to replace what was once a wonderful coffee.<br /><br />The good news is these sampler packs are a great way to affordably try out quality flavored coffee! I hope to try other flavored k-cup packs from Amazon in the future!

review/summary: Medium to light coffee flavor, good variety of flavors
review/text: The best thing about a K-cup machine is the flexibility it has in making hot drinks. As such I really appreciate all the companies offering variety packs like this so I have a bunch of flavors for guests to pick through. The only oddball flavor here is the Blueberry and I think it's strong enough to be noticed and yes subtle enough to not overwhelm the light to medium roast of the coffee. Extremely good probably my favorite of this pack. French Vanilla and Hazelnut are both good but less flavored than some other Vanilla or Hazelnut K-cups you can find. The Caramel Vanilla Cream has the least added flavor profile of the bunch, it's not bad coffee, but the caramel notes are very weak.

review/summary: Variety may be the spice of life, but it certainly isn't the coffee
review/text: We've had such good fortune with Green Mountain Coffee that a letdown was bound to happen. This flavor sampler, which includes French vanilla, wild mountain blueberry, caramel vanilla cream and hazelnut dark roast, reminds me of a tribute band. There are no stars but there are several good performers.<br /><br />I should preface that my wife and I don't drink many flavored coffees, with the exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a>, which is my wife's go-to afternoon coffee. Generally speaking, we like our brew black and the bolder the better. Green Mountain Coffee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Nantucket Blend</a> had us practically dancing out the front door to work with its intoxicating blend from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa.<br /><br />Of the flavored coffees in this collection, the wild mountain blueberry is the most fragrant. You can immediately catch the aroma of berries as the Keurig brews. The hazelnut dark roast was our second favorite if only because the flavoring was more muted than either the French vanilla or the caramel vanilla cream.<br /><br />We prepared these coffees using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting.<br /><br />In summary, this flavor sampler wasn't our taste but it we do recommend it if you are hosting a holiday party (especially, if your guests are light coffee drinkers) or to stock at work, where there are more palettes to please.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.

review/text: I ordered these in the beginning of August on a really hot day and they came intact so I don't know what happened to the people who complained about melting. The almonds were wrapped in some sort of tin foil cold pack that was already expired by the time we got them but the product was intact. Kind of room temperature. The almonds were spectacular, by the way. So if you like dark chocolate and almonds, this is for you! Way cheaper than at the fancy stores. If you're looking for fancy packaging, you're out of luck. They come in baggies. Since I don't care for fancy packaging it was fine with me. If you want to impress someone with packaging you will have to provide your own. Strongly recommend these treats. Word of warning: they are highly addictive!!!!

If you love your pets please don't purchase these or Canyon Creek pbj's they are made in China as well plus one other brand sorry I don't remember what it was. This includes chicken jerky, duck treats, yam chicken or duck plus others.

The outer box was smashed and someone had taped it together. The monzies cookie box was also smashed and the bag inside the cookie box was torn. The cookies were loose inside the box.

review/text: My picky, 6lb pup loves these. If I give it to her whole, it takes her a good five minutes to eat it. The cookies cut into fours nicely (with minimal loss/crumbling), which is the way I use it most of the time: makes for a quicker treat and also, my smaller dog doesn't need to consume that much...the cookies are roughly 1.5" diameter & a tad more than 1/4" thick. It still takes her too long to eat even when its quartered to use as a training "session" reward, but its an awesome reward for when I'm not conducting rapidly successive lessons/drills like sit, stay, stand, etc. Persons with larger dogs would probably not have that issue!<br /><br />Also, the treats smell delicious enough for a human to want to eat!  They do not leave my fingers sticky or stinky.  A very substantial cookie.  Overall, a great organic treat that the dog begs for.

Unfortunately, they weren't her cup of tea. She is not agressive at breaking up large cookies, and they were a bit big for her, and a little too hard for me to break up. She also did not seem overly interested in the taste on the rare occasion I was able to break a piece off. I would suggest these more for a larger dog due to the size and hardness.

review/summary: "Fake" Love Hearts!
review/text: Used to get these (at least the original candy) all the time back in the '70s & '80s at any local candy store.  I'd forgotten all about them until I rediscovered them in a candy store in Nova Scotia in 2001!  Brought home a bunch back then.  Haven't had any since, but I found these on Amazon & ordered some.  When they arrived, I was disappointed to find that these are nothing more than giant Smartees, that look like the original Love Hearts, but definitely do NOT have the tangy flavor of the original.  These just taste like the little chalky Smartees.  So, if you remember the taste of the real Love Hearts, Smartees are NOT the way to go.<br />So I must continue my search for the original (I did a bit of research, and found that the original Love Hearts were produced by a company called Swizzels-Matlow, which is based in England) candy!

review/summary: New Recipie: Less servings More Sugar Not recommended (I used to)
review/text: I'm not a member of the food police. However; I get really mad when a company short changes their customers hoping they will not notice. ESPECIALLY a supposed higher end "GOURMET" producer like Ghirardelli!<br /><br />The quick and dirty for those who don't want to read my detailed review.<br /><br />**Is it better than "Swiss Miss," YES.<br /><br />**Did it used to be better before they over-sweetened, cut the # of servings from 20 to 12 and generally ruined a decent product? YES!<br /><br />**Is it over-priced and resting on the Ghirardelli name? OH YES.<br /><br />**Is it a way to impress people who don't know any better albiet for a price? Probably.<br /><br />**Do I still recommend Ghirardelli Hot Chocolates. NOPE Not Any More. (want to know why? read on)<br /><br />For years I have enjoyed the Ghirardelli line of hot chocolates. That is about to change!<br /><br />NOTE: Until this year they have born the subtitle "Old Fashioned." That designation has been dropped for reasons which will soon become apparent. They have also quite conspicuously dropped the Product Satisfaction Guarantee along with the Ghirardelli address for applying for reimbursement if you the consumer were dissatisfied. Does this bode well for us? You be the judge and by all means let Ghirardelli know. I cannot include the address due to Amazon review policies. You may however contact them by email at their website.<br /><br />Something I strongly encourage. As a hot chocolate lover I want the original recipie back. I hope after reading my review you will too.<br /><br />What is Ghirardelli doing? Quite simply boosting the sugar levels to astronomical levels and engaging in what I call "shorting."<br /><br />Before a serving of any Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix consisted of (3) Tbsp., (22g) yielding twenty, (20) servings per 16oz. can.<br /><br />NOW one serving is (4) Tbsp., (39 grams) yielding only TWELVE (12) servings for the same 16oz. can. This gives us 40 percent LESS servings per can. And at an average of $5.50 per can less s&h an increase from 27.5 cents/serving to 45.8 cents/serving. -- Some may say this is gourmet hot chocolate why quarrel over a few cents. Fair question, but lets be sure were talking about chocolate and not cheap fillers.<br /><br />I have a few cans still left from the "Old Fashioned" style which is what Ghirardelli has marketed for years. It IS different and I can taste the difference. However, I will post both Nutrition labels side by side for you to compare and add my analysis at the end. Hopefully the facts will be as clear to you as they are me.<br /><br />NOTE: the nutrition label is a requirement of the USDA. Further they are reprinted everywhere so I am assuming that this is PUBLIC DOMAIN information.  (That doesn't mean that Ghirardelli will like me telling you about it.)<br /><br />I will be comparing Ghirardelli OLD FASHIONED HOT CHOCOLATE "DOUBLE CHOCOLATE" to the new replacement Ghirardelli PREMIUM HOT COCOA "DOUBLE CHOCOLATE."  Note it is now called Hot Cocoa & not Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />I have Chocolate Mocha and Chocolate Hazelnut to compare as well and that the differences are negligible. It is usually only 0.5g of fat but mostly 1 - 2g of sugar is the usual difference. And of course both use natural & artificial flavors.<br /><br />THE COMPARISON<br /><br />OLD FASHIONED HOT CHOCOLATE_________PREMIUM HOT COCOA<br /><br />Serv Size 3 tbsp (22g) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

To my taste the NEW formula is much too sweet!<br /><br />The Nutrition label bears out my biggest gripes with this REFORMULATED product:<br /><br />  (1) It was sweet before. Now by UPPING the SUGAR so dramatically and adding salt as a sugar booster I no longer like it.<br /><br />  (2) Not enough fat and other ingredients were added to convince me that any REAL gains in CHOCOLATE were made.<br /><br />  ## The TASTE of the new formula bears this out. (I have taken to cutting the serving size and adding Cocoa powder to get more Chocolate and less sugar.<br /><br />  (3) I DESPISE the shorting (Pumping it full of sugar and Cutting the servings by almost HALF.)<br /><br />  (4) And the price stays the same for less. That really frosts my goblet<br /><br />I can no longer recommend this product.<br /><br />Ghirardelli You had a decent thing going and you blew it.<br /><br />PERSONALLY, I'm forwarding this review to the company and since Hot chocolate is just that. I'm going to experiment making either a home-made ganache syrup (melted chocolate & cream) or trying to find a way to finely grate or powder high quality chocolate to make my own brand. That's Really All The Old Style Was. Hot "Chocolate" not Cocoa.  I'm sure for people with way too much money there are Hot chocolates available through boutiques where price is no object or... it IS the object. I'm not that rich. Besides if I come up with a home version that curls your toes then I may go into business myself or just enjoy it with a few friends.

review/summary: too sweet, but there's a cure.
review/text: No,this isn't the "old fashioned" cocoa mix, there's just too much sugar in it.  However, you can buy unsweetened cocoa in bulk and mix it in 50/50 and now you're getting a real hot chocolate.  Of course, you can adjust the ratios to taste, 50/50 is kind of hardcore.<br /><br />Ghiradelli, you're not doing America any favors by making this product so sweet.

review/summary: You Gotta Love It!
review/text: Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of "buck$" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with "chocolat chaud" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.<br /><br />At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout!<br /><br />Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!<br /><br />OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a "bowl of soul," a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others. It may move you, as it does me, to rhapsodic heights. Twenty servings per can, give some to your sweetie.

review/summary: Great cocoa flavor like none other, but waaaaay tooo sweeeeet
review/text: Whoah! I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named "Double Sugar" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.<br /><br />First, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)<br /><br />People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.<br /><br />Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed. But overly sweet. If you don't like supersweet cocoa, pass this up. If you do love extremely sweet hot drinks, you will absolutely adore this mix.

review/summary: VERY CHOCOLATE-EE WITHOUT TONS OF ADDED SUGAR=DOUBLE CHOCOLATE
review/text: WHAT IT IS!<br /><br />The incredible thing about this stuff is that it is very, very chocolate-ee without a ton of added sugar and calories. It is much better tasting than the usual grocery store brands, but it is harder to find, though not much more expensive. Very full bodied, and ideal for adding to coffee to make your very own Hot Coffee/Chocolate treat, or just drink it by itself. It is about the best Hot Chocolate I have ever found.<br /><br />A great value actually, and it even has its share of iron and protein, a nice touch along with avoiding excessive sugar.<br /><br />IDEAL GIFT:<br /><br />This year, this will be a Christmas gift that alot of people will be getting from me. Buying this here at Amazon has really simplified matters and allows me to give away a rare treat that is easily purchased here though not usually at one's local grocery. The shipping and handling policy of this vendor makes the cost of additional items to be shipped, negligible, making it ideal to buy a bunch at a time. What more could one ask for?

review/summary: absolutely the best hot cocoa mix
review/text: The ingredients in the major brands of store-bought hot cocoa mix are alarming.  They don't taste good either.  I don't like to think that I actually used to drink the stuff.  The Ghirardelli hot cocoa mix is not at all like that nasty sweet stuff.  It is just so good!  It doesn't have any disgusting ingredients.  Of course it is not a low-calorie food, but it's quite good made with whatever level of reduced-fat milk you are accustomed to, and if you mix part cocoa and part coffee, that saves on calories, too.  Because it is made with high-quality Ghirardelli cocoa, it tastes even better than mom used to make (my mom didn't have access to gourmet cocoa powder).  If you buy this product, you will not be disappointed. It would be nice if this mix was also available in single-serving envelopes.
