review/text: I bought this mix just yesterday. The whole box makes about 8-10 nice size falafel patties. About the size of a slider. Very filling, spicy, and hearty. A cheap alternative to the standard going rate for getting a falafel at a restaurant, where I live, about $4-$5.

review/summary: Very Good Jasmine Tea!
review/text: I really have to disagree with the other reviewer. I have had a lot of Jasmine Teas and this is one of the better ones. The Jasmine scent is much stronger than a lot of teas I've had before. It's true that the smell is stronger than the actual Jasmine flavor but it's still a good flavor.<br />If you are looking for a highly perfumed tea then it's better to go with Jasmine Pearl Tea as that is scented several times with the Jasmine. And honestly, I would never recommend Bigelow tea over this. The quality of it doesn't compare.<br />Besides, this is organic tea so there are many benefits to drinking this over standard tea.<br />Try this tea! You'll be happy with it!

review/summary: Tastes Like Green Grass
review/text: I purchased this at a local chain grocery store (Albertsons) for $2.79.  Unfortunately, the tea tastes like grass and nothing nearly like jasmine green tea.  Maybe it's me, but there wasn't a good balance between the jasmine and green tea.  As FYI, each tea bag is individually packaged, but not sealed.  However, the main box is sealed.<br /><br />So far, the best jasmine green tea bags I've tried are ones from Bigelow.  And those tea bags are individually sealed.  I strongly recommend Bigelow over Touch Organic for good jasmine green tea in a convenient, stay-fresh packaging.

review/summary: Best tin of tuna you will ever have
review/text: If you like tinned tuna you must try this. It has a light (almost white) colour, a distinctive whirled, flaky grain and  a delicate fresh taste. It is worth the extra few dollars over the supermarket brands (which, afterward, will seem like pet food). I especially like it as a quick meal on its own with a bit of fresh bread, some cracked pepper and a small drizzle of lemon-infused olive oil. Toss it through pasta or a salad or whatever else you like - just don't overdo it - the product speaks for itself.

review/summary: A Very Good Snack Chip
review/text: Flavor is good, not excellent. I really like these but I have to stay accurate here with the review. They are very good but not the best. I guess there are some limits you get from staying healthy. As a health snack I'd give them 5 stars though.<br /><br />Secondly, they leave almost no oil residue in your mouth. So you don't have to wash them down with any strong soda to cut the film off of your tongue. And let's face it, a healthy snack is not healthy if you have to use some unhealthy drink to wash it down.<br /><br />All in all, these are one of my favorite healthy snacks. Very good.

review/summary: The best veggie snack
review/text: These are THE original veggie stix.  If you go to to a major grocery chain store or Whole Foods, most have resorted to selling veggie "straws," which are like veggie stix but hollow, hard, and overly salty.  The Good Health veggie stix are a lighter snack and simply, just taste better in my opinion.<br /><br />I was happy to find the product on Amazon, but learned quickly that 10-7oz bags is a lot.  I bought the product in the beginning of Summer and it had an expiration date for August.  Unless you really love snacking on these things, it's probably more worth it to buy in the store if you can help it.

They are a terrific alternative to potato chips or fries as a side "dish" when serving hotdogs, hamburgers or a simple tuna sandwich.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a light, tasty, not-too-salty or oily snack food, this product is just the ticket. But be forewarned, it can be addictive!

review/text: Overall one of the better veggie stix I have tried. I liked that they have much less of an oil taste than other brands I have tried; very fresh tasting. Also better than store bought price especially if you use subscribe and save.<br /><br />I got these in late December and they had around a 3 month expiration date. The have the standard potato, tomato, and spinach flavors. And like most brands I have bought in store they are not evenly placed in the bag, the potato flavor dominates. But not more than other brands, and these taste better and better priced at Amazon. Recommended.

review/text: Trying to break the frito habit, I tried veggie chips.  Really yummy and no greasy aftertaste.  Buy them by the case and put on monthly auto-delivery.  You will always have something appropriate for late night snacks and those take-along snacks to the lake or golf course.  Each bag contains only 140 calories - with much better ingredients.  Unfortunately, I'm now addicted to Veggie Chips, and so are my five children and 12 grandchildren.  But I don't feel guilty.

review/summary: A surprising find
review/text: I was grocery shopping two days ago at the local Wal-mart. My daughter went down the chip aisle looking, of course, for potato chips. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bag that read Veggie Stix. I picked them up, glanced over them and said to myself "Naw, probably tastes like crap.",and walked away. I was trying to find a snack for myself and everything was high in sodium or contained additives. So, I went back and decided to try the Veggie Stix. That was the best purchase that I made in the store that day. I got them home, tried them and had to force myself to stop eating them. And the BEST part is that when I let my grandkids try them they LOVED them. That was the only bag that I saw in the store that day, but believe me I will be checking to find out if it is an item that Wal-mart regularly stocks. If not I will be ordering from Amazon.com. Very Good.

review/text: I liked the taste of the bags that were sealed good, but probably about half of the bags were not sealed properly.  The ones that were not sealed correctly tasted stale, so I was really disappointed with these.  I have had this brand in a larger bag, and really liked them, so I don't know what happened, but I do know that I won't be buying these smaller size bags anymore!  There were openings in a couple of the bags on the end, but most of them just did not have the air tight seal in the bag.

review/summary: The best chip I've EVER had
review/text: I'm not even going to lie, I learned about these delicious little snacks by snagging a couple from my roommate's bag.  I go to the store that is almost 10 miles away--on the bus--just to get a bag of these.<br /><br />As one commenter suggested, they can be a little bit greasy, but since I bring them to work in a paper towel and inside of a baggie, I don't have a problem at all.  I don't think they're too salty.  They're about as thick as fries from burger king and they taste EXACTLY like french fries.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, almost 40 straws is one serving and its only 130 kCals!  I've switched to eating these as a snack instead of any alternative and I don't even need to portion them out by serving size.  They're so filling, I usually don't even eat 25 at once.<br /><br />I hope these are sold all over the country because the prices here are pretty steep and I'd love to share Veggie Straws with my family back home.  I get them at the grocery store for about 3.50/7ounce bag.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Potato Chips
review/text: If you want a low-fat and low calorie natural snack, these veggie stix are tasty and have 55% lower fat than potato chips.  They are fun to munch on.  I was surprised, however, that they had no Vitamin A as some vegetable snacks do.<br />No fiber, and only 1 g protein.  So, they are more healthy for what they don't have, than what they do offer.  And that's fine for a snack.  If you want snacks that offer some nutrition, popcorn chips offer fiber and sweet potato chips often have Vitamin A.  I'd get these for fun for a party for something different, but it would be great if they had a little more nutrition in them.

review/text: Most everybody loves chips, but don't want to feel guilty (at least I don't), about eating them. These chips are a good way for me to get the crunchy/salty flavor and satisfaction from eating "chips", yet these are healthier than just regular potato chips. I love the hint of salt and garlic. For those that are afraid of the "spinach", you really can't tell that you are eating spinach. I love the convenience of the size of these. Since it's just me , I can sit and eat a whole bag (bigger), without even thinking about it, but with this size, it's easier to control the portion. Since not all stores carry this product, it's great that I know that I can order from Amazon. I think the price is reasonable also.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/summary: Low. Low. I repeat: Low.
review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/text: These bars come two in a package (and two to a serving size!) and are absolutely delicious.  They are crunchy and rich. The peanut butter bars taste like they are made with actual peanut butter holding the grains together.  The white chocolate macadamia nut bars have little pieces of soy white chocolate in the bars and you can taste them when you bite in.  These bars can keep me full for a while and are a great snack.  Appropriate for a plant based diet.

review/summary: Best crunchy granola bar!
review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

review/summary: Filling and taste great too!
review/text: I like Clif bars because they taste good but not great enough that you want to eat a whole lot of them. These crunch bars are no exception. I usually have clif bars in my school bag to stave off hunger during classes before succumbing to the call of a vending machine.<br /><br />The Chocolate Macadamia Nut flavor is a bit too sweet for my tastes which was a little surprising for a Clif bar (but it is chocolate). I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/summary: Delicious!  But Too Crumbly!
review/text: I like Clif products in general and this one is also pretty good.  It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bar
review/text: I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut. However, when I bought them I wasn't expecting them to be quite so messy. They are definitely crunchy, and you will get crumbs everywhere - so keep that in mind. Otherwise I love the things! I'm a college student so this is a good breakfast or snack on my walk to class.

These take exactly like crunchy chocolate chip cookies. They are absolutely delicious. I find myself craving these now instead of brownies or a candy bar. I was actually eating them in class one day and a few people tried them and now are also obsessed. Great product and completely yummy!

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

No high fructose corn syrup, a big plus.  They do have "evaporated cane juice" as the sweetener.  I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

review/summary: Pretty good, 100% vegetarian soup
review/text: Anyone who likes ramen can appreciate the Maggi noodle brand. The noodles taste the same, and the flavor packet makes for a very tasty soup. The tomato flavor one is the mildest, and the masala flavor is the spiciest, and thus the Curry one is pretty spicy. Rinse out some of the boiled water before adding the flavoring if you want a spicier soup, and add more water if you want a milder soup.<br /><br />Maggi is also really great for those who are pure vegetarians. Please be aware, most instant noodle packets contain beef stock, chicken stock, etc. in the flavoring. It may not be whole meat, but if you completely abstain from meat, I wouldn't recommend most of the instant noodles available in stores. Since one of Maggi 2-minute noodle's major target markets is the Indian population, and several Indians are pure vegetarians, Maggi's soup flavorings are 100% vegetarian.<br /><br />Instant soup is delicious when you're starving, but it's not very healthy, so I like it but don't love it. Also, I prefer the Indomie brand over this one.

review/summary: Love, Love, Love Barney Butter
review/text: Unlike many Almond Butter reviewers, I'm not much of a fan of peanut butter. I love almonds, know that they are good for us, and thought I'd try BB to see if I'd enjoy having it with celery sticks and/or crackers.  I bought this size because I really wasn't sure.<br /><br />"Super yummy", was my thought when I tried BB for the first time. It is a lot like the consistency of natural peanut butter with the oil at the top and the really solid part at the bottom, but not nearly as hard to stir thoroughly as PB.<br /><br />I love BB. I have gone through 2 of the 3 jar package I ordered in record time. It's the kind of snack that satisfies that sort of amorphous craving you get sometimes for some little thing to eat.  I even eat it on the spoon sometimes.<br /><br />I haven't tried other brands of Almond Butter and I probably won't, so I can't make a fair comparison of this brand to other brands. I can't imagine being happier with another product than I was with this one.  I highly recommend this product.

It's a shame that this type of customer service is attached to what I thought was an amazing product. I would recommend not ordering thru amazon, simply drive to the grocery store, which I wished I had done originally.
