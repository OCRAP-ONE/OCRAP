review/summary: Love these
review/text: These are great if you're doing a low carb diet. Buttery and soft on the inside I'm not sure I would compare them to a real cinnamon bun but they're great tasting in their own way -- with this one thing -- don't put the glaze on them. The glaze introduces a real splenda like aftertaste which kinda ruins it. Instead just eat them without the glaze and they're great. Be sure not to overcook them or else they'll get hard - but even without the glaze there are a great semi-sweet treat.

review/summary: Good for kitties, good price too!
review/text: I'm glad Amazon now carries this product. I have tried cheap grocery store brands, those inferior corn based products make a difference in my cat's behavior, quality of her fur and overall health. Natural Balance is highly rated by several web sites evaluating cat food as it has no corn or other fillers. Canned food may be a better choice for her health, but my cat won't eat it, this is a good second choice.<br /><br />It really does not cost more than the grocery store types as she needs less food due to it being nutrient rich. One 6 pound bag lasts a little over two months for my 10 pound short hair. Less food fed means less poop to scoop, not as stinky too!  It's rare to find her hacking up a hair ball or vomiting, unlike a major well-known brand where she puked almost daily. Her coat is shiny and soft. No fat belly. She has energy to spare!<br /><br />I like being able to have it delivered to my home, no extra trip needed to a specialty pet store.

review/summary: Preferred by All three Finicky Cats
review/text: I did an experiment when I bought this slightly more expensive than usual cat food. I set bowls of their current foods out. Chicken for the Cat Lover's Soul came in third.<br />EVO, which is the healthiest for one cat because it has no corn meal, became a treat/snack because it is most expensive, California Natural came in second and Natural Balance is first. However, knowing cats, if you do, this choice could change at any time because of the finicky part of the experiment. Although the full fat California naturals can be a favorite it really is fattening for indoor cats and they do not care for the low fat variety.<br />I feel satisfied because this is a healthy choice. There was one bowl that I removed from the test: Meow Mix, because they put something in it besides cornmeal and other questionable by-products, that act as an addictive. They can have Meow-Mix as a treat also, until they use of the bag.<br />So, my cats-- two adult (consenting) males and one kitten-- vote for natural Balance.<br />Thank you

review/summary: Made my cat healthy again!
review/text: I adopted my cat from a shelter about 9 years ago and fed him one of the better grocery store brands without incident. Suddenly, about 9 months ago, he developed an allergy to that food (or something) because his fur got dull and started falling out in clumps. I took him to the vet and ruled out anything healthwise -- the vet pointed to a food allergy. So I tried Natural Balance. Not only did my cat have a renewed interest in his food, slowly his fur began to return to normal. Now it's healthier than ever, the thickest, softest, silkiest fur you could ever want! Plus, he never spits up or gets hairballs. It's worth paying a premium to have such a healthy, content cat.

review/summary: Natural Balance rated among the best dry foods
review/text: UPDATE 12/2011:<br /><br />This is a ridiculous price for this product.  The review below was written when this item was but $12 and some odd change.  Now it's $23?!  Go elsewhere - you can find it much cheaper.<br /><br />------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I love this food.  I knew the Purina One dry food I was feeding my one cat wasn't the best.  After researching several different reputable websites for dry food reviews, I decided to purchase Natural Balance.  Several different sites had included Natural Balance among the best dry food (especially for the money).  I have been very, very happy!<br /><br />My cat switched foods effortlessly.  I didn't even gradually introduce it like I should have - one day she was eating Purina One, the next Natural Balance.  The one major thing I've noticed after weeks on this food?  Her coat is SO much SOFTER/SHINIER!  She's so silky and soft now!  Holy cow!  I know if it's doing such good things for her fur it's a good sign.  Her bowel movements have always been nice and solid, and they look even better on this food.  I also have to feed her less each day, which makes the 6 lb. bag last longer than 6 lbs. of the Purina One would have.  All in all I'm a convert, and I will keep buying this food.  Thanks, Natural Balance!

review/text: This food works really well for my cat and we have never had a problem with it. He has no hairballs, a nice shiny coat, and maintains a healthy weight even though he's a bit of a piggy.<br /><br />The only problem I have is with this price on Amazon. I decided to just check the price here since the idea popped in my head, but I'm appalled to see that it is $20+ for a bag with Prime, when I usually pay around $15 at the chain stores and $10 at a warehouse store for the same exact product.<br /><br />I usually buy products on Prime because they're more affordable and more convenient, but I think I will continue going a little bit out of my way since it saves me about $10.

One of my cats has had skin issues for about 2yrs and the drs never could figure it out, i thought i might as well try a better food sorce, how many cats do you know in the wild that will hunt the wild corn cob? I felt i was feeding my cats corn flakes with vitamins and chicken flavoring.  On Natural Balance, my one cats skin is clearing up, and both my cats are not begging to be fed all day long, this fills them up and i feel good about feeding it to them, they had no problems changing over either. which really surprised me. Very happy with Natrual Balance. Thank you!!

review/summary: My cat loves this product, I kinda don't
review/text: My kitty is the epitome of vacuum-ism. She will eat anything that kitties deem edible. Raw and cooked meats, strings, her own whiskers...you get it right? As such, she loves food-time (too much)...<br /><br />There is this awesome pet supplies store near where I live, and I go there often, since I love that place and help try to support their business. Every time I shop there, they always dish out PREMIUM cat food samples (and dog food too) out front. Last time I went there, I got almost ten sample bags. Anyways, since my cat is a little smartie, she'd pick out the better food from her usual food, and just gobble up it up, leaving her old food in her bowl.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Moving along, this one hands down, was one of her favorites. My issue is, that the kibbles are ridiculously *small*. So small, that she eats them whole, and therefore eats more. I wound up having to switch her food, which is a shame because this is a higher quality cat food, which lacks the corn-soy-wheat filler that is just ever-so-popular with all the more known brands of pet food.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Chicken, Brown Rice, Barley, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved With Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Duck Meal, Potatoes, Carrots, Lamb Meal, Canola Oil, Natural Flavor, Salmon Meal, Dried Egg, Brewers Yeast, Duck, Potassium Chloride, Whole Ground Flaxseed, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Natural Mixed Tocopherols, Spinach, Parsley Flakes, Cranberries, L-Lysine, L-Carnitine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Kelp, Zinc Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B-1), Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin (Vitamin B-2), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B-6), Vitamin B-12 Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Sodium Selenite, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Folic Acid.

review/text: I have fed my Munchkin cat Science Diet for years but she threw up a lot. I added a hairball remover to her diet and that helped a little but she still threw up. Since my dogs love Natural Balance, I thought I'd try it for her. She not only loves it and eats more, but I haven't seen her throw up since I started her on it 2 months ago. We are a Natural Balance Family now.

review/summary: Just as good as everybody says....
review/text: I fed my cat expensive food the first few years (like Science Diet--altho now I'm told that Science Diet isn't that great), then gradually switched to cheapo supermarket-brand dry food, & Friskies wet food. He eventually got really sick, got a bad respiratory infection, had a bunch of hairballs, & was shedding something terrible. After a round of antibiotics, he was better, but still shedding terribly. I switched to Natural Balance dry food, & the difference was almost miraculous, in his coat, no more hairballs (altho I also put some laxatone daily in his wet food), & his overall health & energy.<br /><br />Even tho I still kept him on the Friskies wet food (?), but recently I've started feeding him (expensive!) Natural Balance wet food. The main difference I've noticed with that is even less poops to scoop, but I think he also may eat less. Lastly, I don't know if I can name a good online retailer of Natural Balance here, but it rhymes with "Mr. Blooey". Amazon is very good too, of course, depending on the price--it pays to shop around.<br /><br />One last thing--I bought the 1st 6 lb. bag of Natural Balance dry food here on Amazon when it was only $12.99 (!). And almost on a fluke--I thought all the rave reviews almost sounded too good to be true, but they're spot on.

review/summary: Very Happy Cats
review/text: I normally research products in depth before I buy them but for some reason I blindly purchased Science Diet for my cats for years. One cat is of normal weight but was constantly throwing up his dinner. The other cat is overweight and had horrible smelling stool that was often on the soft side.<br /><br />Once I began researching cat food options I was embarrassed by what I had been feeding my cats - mostly plant by products which are not naturally in a cat diet! No wonder they had digestion issues.<br /><br />When we switched to Natural Balance the overweight cat took to it immediately and the normal weight cat took some convincing. I simply filled his bowl with half of the old food and half of the new and gradually took the old food away. Within 10 days he was completely switched. Every cat is different, just be patient with them.<br /><br />2 months later and both cats are doing much better. My normal weight cat has only thrown up his dinner once or twice (compared to 4 times a week!) and my overweight cat not only seems more satiated between meals (doesn't ask for food as much) but he has lost a lb or two and has normal bowl movements.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this product and am so glad I finally opened my eyes to find a better option. Also important to note that when I compared the unit price of my old food against the unit price of Natural Balance they were almost the same. I always assumed a natural food would be more expensive and I was really wrong.

The other is a young, rescued cat whose coat was dull<br />and rather stiff.  I tried Natural Balance for them. The older cat no longer vomits and the coat of the younger<br />one is now sleek and glossy.  What a difference!  A little more expensive, but they don't need so much and it<br />is well worth the cost for the wonderful results.  There was no problem with getting them used to a new food -<br />they loved it immediately.

I was going to mix a little more in each day (like your supposed to) but they ended up puking the first day and their food bowl was almost completely full still.<br /><br />I think I will just stick with my Royal Canin since I know they like it and give them that wet food in a can here and there for a treat and a little different taste.

review/text: I was never having hard drinks, as I'm a Beer lover all the time!<br />It was in one of the coldest winter during college life. I was having cold and it wasn't getting better for continuous 3 weeks.<br />Then one of my friend came to rescue by offering Old Monk. I was reluctant in having any sort of hard drink. But he insisted it could help in getting rid of the cold. And finally I had 4 pegs and it worked like a charm. Cold was gone in next 6 hours and I felt much better.<br />Since then, Old Monk has been one of the best companion during winters, whenever there is extreme cold, I prefer having Old Monk rather than Beer ! And guys this does taste good despite its strong flavor. I recommend just try it once and it can give a run for money to any other international Rum brand !!

review/summary: Picky Tea Lover Would Recommend
review/text: When I first tried this tea over a year ago, I was instantly in love. This tea has a light but rich taste; the roasted rice lends itself well and almost gives this tea a buttery quality. The quality of the tea leaves themselves is great, with a beautiful deep green color. The tea is worth the price, but it comes with an added bonus: if you buy this online here, you get two tins instead of one-- perfect for gifting or sharing. This tea is a tea I would serve to someone who claims to hate green teas, just to showcase the variety green teas can have.

review/summary: Just "OK"
review/text: My wife and I really love Genmaicha tea, and we've had it from several tiny tea shops and purchased loose leave tea from those shops and the taste has always been fantastic. We have a larger tea purveyor that sells strictly Tao of Tea, and we purchased a tin to replenish our supplies.<br /><br />Other Tao teas have been very good. I am, to be honest, very picky as most teas just don't end up being something I like. So, while I definitely wouldn't be a very good judge of many teas, this one I feel I can fairly review.<br /><br />We did not purchase ours from Amazon, however I came across it here looking to replace it. The can we purchased has very little fragrance and looks very dry and not very fresh. For brewing, I use a tea tumbler that allows the leaves to expand, and I do not use boiling water, but around 185 degrees.<br /><br />The flavor of Tao of Tea Genmaicha is very weak and disappointing. I suspect they used a very cheap green tea based on how sad and dry it looked. The brewed product has very large leaves, indicating its probably a later harvested batch, which is typically the cheap stuff. I've been told that the best green tea is picked in April/May and the leaves will be smaller and contain more flavor. This stuff tastes more boring and lower quality than the stuff I get when my friends drag me to get cheap sushi off of the conveyor belt restaurant.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this tea online, and if you must buy it locally, I would do so and open it up to inspect before leaving the store, as to avoid wasting gas when you return it.

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/text: When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Flavor by Far
review/text: I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/summary: Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!
review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

The Lavazza Crema e Gusto turned out to be a very good gift for her.  She loves it!  According to her, the coffee comes out Rich and Full-Bodied, while also being very smooth.  There is no bitterness at all to the coffee.  She makes her espresso using a 3 cup Bialetti, which seems to do a good job getting the flavor out of the coffee grounds and into your cup.<br /><br />For the Espresso lover out there, while it may not be a premium cup of Espresso, the Lavazza Crema e Gusto Italian Espressoo Brick did not disappoint.  You get excellent quality espresso for a fair price per cup ... 5 stars!

review/summary: Of the LavAzza Coffee's this is my favorite
review/text: I started drinking LavAzza when I was working with the Italian's as a subcontractor back in the mid 90's in the middle east.  After lunch I would have one espresso to pour over my cup of ice cream, and then I'd have a regular american size cup of coffee of espresso after that.  I never had problems staying awake during the afternoon.  Predominantly we drank the black can version in the middle east. I didn't come across this version until probably 7 or 8 years later.  I think it has a slightly richer fuller flavor than the black can.  If you want to compare it to well known brands, I'd say its close to Starbuck's Italian, but richer, fuller and definitely smoother.  In comparison to the inexpensive Puerto Rican espressos you can pick up in Publix (among others stores) in Florida, it doesn't have the slightly burnt flavor of those brands, but isn't quite as intense either.<br /><br />In general none of the LavAzza brands have that over the top, slightly burnt flavor I associate with French roasts.  If you want a rich, smooth espresso or cappuccino, I think LavAzza is the way to start, just remember to make it in a proper espresso maker.  I've used the standard stove top Bialetti stainless steel espresso maker for the last 10 years  It does a good job, and will last indefinitely.

I was actually looking for a higher fat and calorie content like these crackers for her, but if you're younger and cling to your pounds- make sure you stick to one package ;)

review/summary: My new favorite brew
review/text: Since I got my Keurig coffee maker, I have been trying to find the one coffee I could designate as my favorite.  My preference is for something medium--not too strong, not too weak.  The assortment that came with my Keurig was mostly of the dark roast kind.  To me, dark roast tastes somewhat bitter or maybe burnt.  That is not what I want my coffee to taste like.<br /><br />Accordingly, I have been ordering a variety of the so-called "medium roast" varieties to assess them and find the right one for me.  I've had the Kona Blend, Columbian, and Private Blend--to name just a few.  So far, I like the Private Blend and Mocha Java (both by Timothy's) the best.  They are both mellow and aromatic and do not impart a bitter aftertaste.

review/summary: Makes a great cup of coffee
review/text: To reiterate what M. Collins stated in his/her review "People please keep in mind that the Mocha means Indonesian and Ethiopian bean blended coffee. It is not a Mocha Chocolate as some are used to. It is usually named MOKA JAVA" Thank for that great tip.<br /><br />For a medium blend this is a smooth full bodied coffee with little acidity and after taste. I don't like a coffee that stays on your palate and with you most of the day. I drink my coffee with Liquid creamer and a sugar Substitute. Great flavor if you don't like a coffee that "bites Back"

review/summary: Timothy's Mocha Java K-Cups
review/text: Having only recently purchased our Keurig brewer, my wife and I have been experimenting/taste-testing with various flavor/vendor offerings. I prefer the flavored variety while my wife prefers the fuller bodied blends. The Timothy's World Coffee, Mocha Java, was a pleasant surprise for both of us. It had the special flavor that I enjoy and the full bodied flavor my wife enjoys. The Mocha flavor was sufficient enough to not have to enquire what flavor was just made for me. It also was not so over powering that a second cup would become sickening. Nice balance! Great price point by Amazon. Should have taken full advantage and purchased 4 double packs for the ultimate savings! We can now add Timothy's to our vendors of choice.<br /><br />Robert

review/text: This is a good blend and I signed up for subscribe & save at $19 for box of 48. We drink alot of coffee so I used to place an order every 12 days. It's no longer available under the subscribe & save program which means it costs much more even at the listed $37.99. Too bad because I won't pay more for coffee. I ordered reusable k-cups and have my favorite Starbucks blend ground for much less than the Timothy's brand.

review/summary: Best cup so far!
review/text: I've been using my Keurig for about 6 months now and I have tried a lot of different coffees. So far 2 of my favorites are from Timothy's! The MOKA Java is #1 followed VERY closely by the Kona Blend. And to reiterate what was said above, this has NOTHING to do with chocolate, it's a BLEND. It's a fantastic cup and I HIGHLY recommend it (If your not into fake cups of coffee and like the real stuff. But if you like the flavored kind, go for the blueberry by green mountain I think it is)<br /><br />(if interested, a couple of my other favorites are Caribou Breakfast Blend and the Coffee People's donut shop)

I am a real coffee snob!  I have always ground my own beans and have never liked packaged ground coffee.  But, I found the exception with Keurig and Timothy's World Coffee.  The Mocha Java is one of the smoothest of medium bold coffee.  Not bitterness at all.  I find it very difficult to have just one cup!

review/text: I have had Mocha Java at my daughter's house several times, and always enjoyed it.  I have a Keurig B-70 model brewer.  My daughter's brewer is one of the old style that does not allow cup size selection (only makes a small cup).  This coffee is great when brewed as a small cup size, being too weak in the normal cup size.

review/text: These k-cups are a blend of Ethiopian beans and Indonesian beans which makes an exotic bright coffee that sits nicely on the palate with a rich finish and it stands up to cream and sugar. I love it for a bolder coffee taste to start my day or for a flavorful cup in the evening to sip while watching TV. If it was a big cheaper I would order it more often.

review/summary: Taste is great, but packaging is faulty
review/text: Have ordered this product twice before with great results or I would not have ordered it a third time.  This time though, out of five 'k-cups' four have been faulty, meaning, they have failed to engage the Keurig coffee maker properly making a huge mess on the counter in my office.  I know it's this Timothy's order because I have cleaned up the mess, cleaned out the coffee maker and tried other k-cups and the maker works perfectly, so it's not the maker - it's the Timothy's k-cups.  I'm very disappointed because I really have liked this coffee flavor in the past and wish it made the product correctly.  I'll keep trying the other k-cups in the box, but with care.  I'm just wondering if they changed up the formulation on their plastic somewhat and this has caused the problem?????

review/summary: My favorite k-cup coffee
review/text: Mocha Java is my favorite of all the k-cup coffees that I've tried so far.  No, I wasn't confused about the "mocha" in the name.  Like others have pointed out, the name comes from a port in Ethiopia - not about chocolate.  I don't like bitter/acidic coffee and this isn't.  I enjoy the flavor so much that I don't need to use as much cream to lighten the taste.  When I want stronger coffee, I use Newman's Organic Extra Bold - my first cup of the day.  Otherwise this is my go-to coffee.

review/summary: my very favorite
review/text: I started drinking Mocha Java (which is Not a flavored coffee as so many might think because of the 'mocha" but is rather a region for beans to grow) when I had a subscription to Gevalia coffee and loved the rich flavor of this coffee.  When I got my Keurig I thought I would still have to get the coffee from Gevalia and make it through the filter.  Since I enjoyed Gevalia coffee so much, I was somewhat skeptical to try the K-cap since they tend to be a darker roast than I like.  Wow was I surprised to find the Timothy's brand to be quite smooth, rich and just a great cup of coffee.  I drink my coffee black, so it is important that it not have too much acid and this one is just great.  I have it on my Suscribe and Save to get every month but if I am not careful I can drink this up in no time at all!  It's a little pricy but so worth it to me to indulge and no calories!

review/text: I wasn't crazy about this while indulging in the first box but have grown fond of it.  I find it irresistible when adding a 1/2 teaspoon of cocoa powder (unsweetened) to the medium size cup (7.25oz).  It adds another layer of taste that brings it up to a more sophisticated level.<br /><br />Added 31 May 2011<br /><br />Sadly, I've grown to crave this cup of Mocha Java.  Why sadly?  Well it is no longer available on subscription and secondly; the price has exploded from $19.55 in January 2010 to the current $33.79 May 2011.  Whaaaat?  Up  $14.24 in just 16 months.  At this price, I can grind my own higher-end coffee and break even thanks to the refillable k-cup adaptor.<br />Gonna miss ya!

review/summary: Change the Name
review/text: Not quite sure why this is called Mocha Java, since the Mocha flavor is lacking.  However, the coffee is quite smooth and it is perhaps one of my husband's favorites.  I on the other hand prefer something with a little more chocolate flavor such as Timothy's German Chocolate Cake. This blend definitely has the hint of choclate that I was looking for when I ordered the Mocha Java but it also has a touch of coconut flavor and a scent that I enjoy.  In Timothy's defense, they don't truly market Mocha Java as a Flavored coffee but rather as a "medium roast" blend of "Ethiopian and Sumatran coffees".  However, unless you really researched this, the name is misleading.

review/summary: MOCHA JAVA is highly rated at the K-CUP EXCHANGE
review/text: There have been several reviews on Tim's Mocha Java here and on the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo groups. I just tried it and found it wasn't for me (tough on my stomach). But it tasted great. Luckily, you can trade unwanted k-cups at the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo Groups. [...]<br /><br />Hope this helps sensitive stomach coffee drinkers

review/summary: One of my morning cups
review/text: First, I guess I'll reiterate that this "Mocha" is not chocolatey. But it is a delicious, medium-strength cup. Not very acidic,which is perfect for the mornings and an empty stomach.  I actually subscribe to this, because I drink at least one cup of this every day.<br /><br />Also, all of Timothy's World Coffee is fair trade. They pay their farmers a living wage. That is equally important as taste, as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: OK coffee, but where's the mocha java flavor?
review/text: While this is a nice, dark cup o' joe, I can't even detect the mocha java flavor (not even just smelling it when brewing).
