review/summary: Ok for dark chocolate
review/text: I have to say that I have had better dark chocolate before, but I love what these bars stand for so I purchase them whenever I can.  This is my first time trying this particular bar and I was not impressed.  I mean it was ok, but I kept getting gritty pieces when I took a bite, so that was a little off putting.  The flavor is ok, but nothing to run home about.  I dont think that I will be getting this bar again, I will stick to my other favorites by this company.

review/summary: Great if used correctly
review/text: As usual, Amazon's description of how much chocolate you are getting with an order is unclear.  I can clear it up.  You get 6 packs of 3.5 ounce chocolate, resulting in 21 ounces of total chocolate in 60 individually wrapped squares.  Each square is about .35 ounces (maybe two small bites).<br /><br />I would not try to eat this straight up, since its just one step away from baking chocolate.  There are two ways I like to eat this chocolate.  The first way is to take some heated peanut butter (15 secs in the microwave), add a little sugar, mix it together, and use it as a dipping sauce for these squares.  It's scary good.  The second method is to replace half of the chocolate chips in a cookie recipe with chopped up panther chocolate.  It makes a mean cookie.

review/summary: My favorite chocolate!
review/text: As a vegan, I still have a bit of a sweet tooth.  I used to buy these chocolates individually wrapped for $1.19 at a small natural foods store; and when I began eating them daily the box of 12 cost almost $12 for a bag.  Needless to say, they are substantially less expensive here.  I am always happy to find that my chocolate is never melted, despite arriving to hot Florida heat!  And I have never had any issues receiving a quality product.  Value is terrific, for the savings I get by buying in bulk.  The chocolate itself is delightful.  It is not too bitter, as some dark chocolates are, but rich and flavorful.  I am also very glad to support a company like Endangered Species that gives back to the enviroment and animals as well as being fair trade.  Bravo to the company for a great product and the seller for superb shipping & delivery!  I will keep buying again and again!

review/text: I agree with Pf who gives a higher rating to Ghiradelli 86%.  If you really like bitter chocolate (and I have a friend who eats unsweetened Bakers Chocolate) then this may be a great choice for you.  For the those of us that like the benefits of dark chocolate without the hard edge, this one may not be the one.  This one has a chalky, medicinal taste to it.

review/text: I originally thought that I was ordering ghiradelli 86%,but ordered these by mistake and was greatly disappointed. The chocolate is not rich and smooth, but rather dry ang chalky. I would never by this brand again. Try ghiradelli 86% dark and you will do yourself a favor because that brand has the texture and rich taste you would expect for that price.

review/summary: Bitter and delicious, great quality, and helps animals too.
review/text: I love the Endangered Species brand of chocolates. I used to buy them at Target, but my store quit carrying them. I love the 88% Dark Chocolate as it is rich, a bit bitter, but loaded with delicious chocolate flavor. The company only uses 100% ethically traded cocoa beans, and gives a percentage of it's profits to helping endangered animals. I had tried other dark chocolate bars before as high as 86% but have never found a brand that tasted as good as Endangered Species. Every piece of their chocolate has a good consistency and tastes like a very high quality chocolate. I would recommend their chocolate highly.

review/summary: My kids LOVE these!!
review/text: My kids love these (ages 15 & 12). One of my kids doesn't really like apples and she eats bags of these. Great to take to school for a snack. I keep several bags in my car to have onhand if we are out shopping and they get hungry. These tide them over until we get home so we don't have to hit the fast food drive through. I even have some in my desk at work. Quiet enough to eat in meetings.<br /><br />Ok so to respond to another poster that the "organic" apples come from places that organic is not regulated as much - I understand but as our busy lives go - these are great. I will do my best to get US organic as many other aspects of food shopping as I can.

review/summary: Hard To Find Item Is Excellent
review/text: If you are a macadamia nut lover, these are exquisite.  Mauna Loa are simply the best because of the rich volcanic soil in which these nuts are grown. I know of no other brand of macadamia nuts that even approaches the freshness, caliber and flavor of Mauna Loa. This flavor is king on the Hawaiian Islands but is very difficult to locate in stores in the continental U.S. due to shelf space, slotting fees charged by retailers and supermarkets to stock the item and demand. Hershey Chocolate Co. has recently purchased Mauna Loa, and since this acquisition, these nuts have enjoyed a much wider distribution on the U.S. East coast. Amazon's price is competitive and the nuts are simply delicious.  Be sure to refrigerate them immediately after opening to retain their mellow, buttery aroma.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to purchase this product due to the price, but my family and i love macadamia nuts. I been wavering between two different brands and finally decided on the Mauna Loa brand. I am very happy with their product and service! The nuts were fresh and the maui onion garlic flavor were bold. I could not stop eating those nuts! The only downsides to the product were size and price. The container was very small (it fit perfectly in a woman's hand, smaller than i thought it would be. However, every bite was worth the buck. I wish they carried macadamia nuts here. I would purchase this again in the future with extra cash to spend. Hehe.

review/summary: Maui Onion & Garlic are my favorite!
review/text: I'm lucky to be born and raised in Hawaii because getting my hands on these nuts aren't as costly and hard to get as most folks would find.<br /><br />Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts come in a variety of flavors including dry roasted, chocolate covered, Kona coffee glazed and Maui Onion and garlic.  By far my favorite is Maui Onion and Garlic.  The first taste on your tongue is packed with bursting flavor! Salty and onion/garlic taste.  Not one taste overpowers the others, but they all compliment each to make the taste that makes macadamia nuts so special.

review/summary: Can't stop eating these delicious nuts
review/text: I've loved mac nuts since I was a child. Because they're so expensive, they were always a rare and welcomed treat in my family. This summer, my brother and his wife brought back a variety pack from their trip to Hawaii. There's chocolate-covered ones, plain, and sea salt. Out of the 4 or 5 different cans, this is my favorite by far.<br /><br />The dusting of seasoning is delicate and makes an already tasty snack even better. When I got to the bottom of the can, I ran my finger around the inside walls to get out all the extra bits of garlic and onion powder, showing how despondent I was at having eating them all. That's how good these are!<br /><br />Nuts are naturally high in fat, so try to control yourself if you're on a restricted diet! It's nearly impossible to stop eating these. Highly highly recommended.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I really love these nuts and have been eating them for the past twenty five years.  This was my first experience receiving old nuts which were far below the standard I have come to expect.  Instead of a nice white they were brown.  They were not as flavorfull as in the past and I suspect they were just starting to go bad.  The flavoring was clumped instead of being evenly distributed on the nut.  They left a bad taste in my mouth.  I thought I would get a box of six as I have received in the past, but instead, I received six individual cans which were repackaged in plastic.  There were no expiration dates since they were repackaged.  It makes me wonder if they were repackaged because they had expired.  I'm truly disappointed.

review/summary: Pretty decent for out of a box
review/text: I have tried several of the Banquet Homestyle Bakes. I don't expect good food from a box, but I do expect it to be reasonably edible. I live alone and sometimes I just can't force myself to cook. This one is my favorite of this brand's offerings. It is easy to make and it is acceptable. It can even be spiced up to make it a little better. The potatoes do not even remotely resemble hash browns-- fair warning. The sauce contains a decent amount of cheese and the ham is visible. This one is one I will keep on hand. The one I won't ever buy again is the chicken alfredo. The sauce was pretty good, but the pasta was inedible after being cooked according to the directions. I almost threw it away. I suggest that all pasta dishes from a box be looked upon with suspicion. Rice and potato dishes are more likely to be acceptable.

review/summary: These meals are overall good
review/text: My best friend and I live together.  I do the cooking and cleaning, and he is disabled so he does little work around the house.  We eat these meals, both this brand and the Betty Crocker complete meals, about 3-4 times a month.  We are fairly new to them.  I would eat them more often but the salt intake is too high for part of a regular diet.<br /><br />This one we first made the other day.  I made it for breakfast, with some scrambled eggs.  We haven't had hashbrowns in a while, so he was looking forward to eating some.  I have bought a frozen hashbrown casserole before, that was similar to this one.  It's not supposed to have a crunchy texture.  With the sauce in there it really can't have one.<br /><br />When I asked how it was, he said we need to eat hashbrowns like this from now on!!  I said really?  He said oh yeah this is really good.  I hate the thought of grating potatoes just for a side dish.  I love the cheesy sauce, and the ham pieces were consistent.  You definitely need something else with it, like all these meals.  But this one I will definitely get again for a nice morning meal.  Or a breakfast for dinner meal too, I am a rule breaker.

We had a little hiccup with the initial shipment (missing 10 bags and the individual bags weren't labeled -- reason for less than 5 star review), but Amazon was great about taking care of this and we plan to continue to get this coffee. Great find for the price!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Got our second shipment today and all the items were in the box -- still not individually labeled, though. We're still enjoying the coffee.

review/summary: A "Must Have" for our dogs
review/text: Our dogs need to chew.  We feel comfortable with this product because there are no little pieces breaking off as possible chocking or digestive hazards. The dogs love it and could work on it for hours, but we set a time limit and save the treat for another day.  That way it lasts for quite awhile.  We prefer the ones that are wheat free. Most dog treats contain wheat which our dogs can't have so that's another plus. The biggest problem is fitting the treat into the ball, but if that were easy it would also be easy for the dogs to get it out! This product is safe and fun.

review/summary: Use with caution
review/text: This toy definitely kept my guy busy. Unfortunately when he ate a chunk of it, it also kept my vet busy.<br /><br />I only allowed my dog to use this when I was around and gave it to him in the ball holder but he still managed to swallow a piece. It got stuck for a bit in his gut and caused him to throw up anything he ate and quite a bit of discomfort. Fortunately since this is a digestible item he was able to pass it without the need for surgery.<br /><br />My dog is a STRONG chewer and very determined, so you may have better lick, I mean luck, if your dog isn't so intent on liberating it from the holder.<br /><br />Also, if your dog has a Wheat/Corn/Soy allergy, be sure to test this with them before giving them the whole thing. I can't say for sure, but I suspect the package we had was NOT wheat-free b/c the boy reacted to it much like he does when he eats something with wheat in it. Unfortunately I didn't put that together in time to prevent what was described above.

review/text: One of the only things my mini poodle gets to eat. They don't bother him has long it is in moderation, if he is allowed a whole one it will give him the runs. But he loves them for a few minutes a day and keeps him quite entertained for a little while. They don't smell really at all. I am not sure how a normal dog that can eat other things would like them, but he is allergic to everything so he likes them quite well. We use the Bento ball with them.

review/text: I have always been a candy person as long as I can remember and I came across this candy while I was spending time in Japan. I was instantly hooked. The flavor in these candies are awesome. I found myself picking a pack of these up almost everytime I was near a place that sold them. I brought a bunch home and shared them with friends and family. I haven't met a person yet who doesn't love them. Personal preference is purple grape and green apple. Some may disagree but the version of this candy with the english words "Hi Chew" are not as good as the Japanese version. Different wrapping and different texture slightly. Buy some of these today! They are amazing!

review/text: I bought these thinking I would probably eat one a day and be all set for quick snacks for about three months.  Peanut addict that I am though I've been eating two or three a day so they haven't lasted so long.  Still, I can't imagine a better thing to put in a kid's lunch box, hand out at Halloween, or take to work.  The peanuts were fresh and not overly salty.  Being a peanut butter freak as well I don't dare keep a jar in the house but I find that two or three of these one ounce bags of peanuts in my small food processor provides me with just enough peanut butter to take care of a craving without eating up an entire jar.

review/summary: ADOBO WITH NO SALT OR MSG,  YEAH!
review/text: I am so thrilled to have found this product as I love the original Goya Adobo, however, I've had to change my diet in the past year and must follow a very low salt diet.  I've missed using the original Adobo which makes meats and fish taste wonderful.  Now I can enjoy it again with Marshall's Creek seasonings. This tastes great and allows me to control my salt intake.  It has the same ingredients as the popular brand except for the salt and msg (msg can also raise blood pressure).  When I opened the (BiG) jar the aroma was great.  I've used it on chicken, fish, beef and shrimp.  If you love the original adobo seasoning but have to watch your salt consumption you will enjoy this product. Thank you Marshall's Creek.

Great for quick garlic bread, add to sour cream for garlic dip, sprinkle on popcorn, in scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, salad, etc.  I like it because I can add the garlic flavor to my portion of food on my own plate too, when cooking for others who don't like garlic.

review/text: I first had the Big Franks while visiting a friend during high school and I've loved them ever since. They do not taste exactly like traditional meat hotdogs and the closest description of the flavor that I can come up with is something like a light-flavored vienna sausage. Otherwise, you can use the same condiments as regular hotdogs, or add mayo to add a bit more of a creamy flavor to them.

review/text: I grew up on Big Franks, so I admit they are an acquired taste. They don't taste like regular hot dogs. The texture is softer, and more chewy. But they are flavorful, and I think the flavor grows on you--although others in my family object entirely, and they find the aroma very disagreeable. But my youngest--and pickiest--child lives on them! They are her main source of protein. Fortunately they are basically healthful, and they are a great source of B vitamins. Plus, they are so convenient. You can eat them straight from the can. Start with the one in the middle so you can wiggle the others out that are stuck to the side of the can. ;)

review/summary: Very different from Morningstar/GardenBurger frozen dogs
review/text: This review is for people who are expecting Loma Linda franks to taste like Morningstar and Garden Burger-type frozen veggie dogs.  I bought these expecting them to be quite similiar.  They are not. They are, however, shelf-stable (I got them b/c I'll be overseas and need protein) and very nutritious at only 110 calories each.<br /><br />I just can't seem to get used to the taste and texture -- much softer and more pliable than the frozen variety, with less of a hotdog "skin". The taste is pretty different.  Less meaty.  Also, there are 8 per can, so storing the leftovers is a bit inconvenient.<br /><br />I can see how these might be great in a casserole or as part of another dish, but on their own (which is how I ate them), they weren't to my taste.<br /><br />I feel bad giving this product a poor review since it's my own fault for thinking that frozen veggie dogs and shelf stable ones in a can would be the same, but thought I should alert others like me who were unfamiliar with Loma Linda and expecting something comparable to Morningstar's product.

review/text: No need to cook them. They are best right out of the can dipped in big frank juice!  I have been eating these for at least 30 years.  Whenever we get a can in the house it's a big deal as they are so hard to find these days.  The kids and I try to limit ourselves to 2 franks a day and even that is difficult.  My husband won't eat them as he thinks they smell like dog food.  I can see how someone who isn't accustomed to the taste might not like these.  You either love or hate these.

review/text: Big Franks are the best vegetarian frank that I have ever tried. They taste far better than real meat weiners. They have a somewhat soft texture and could be easily broken down and used in a casserole or some other recipe. They come in a broth that could also be used to add flavor to recipes. I dare anyone to who hates meat analogues to not be pleased with this product. I can't say enough about Big Franks!

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: The franks aren't the best substitute for hotdogs.  I didn't like them much and neither did any of the people in my house.  Before getting these I would highly recommend Smart Dogs, they have a much better texture and cook up a lot better.  The outer layer is a little tougher than regular hot dogs.  The best are Tofurkey sausages though.  They are much larger than hot dogs, but have a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Don

review/summary: Tasty Veggie Dogs
review/text: Soy-based "meat" products can often be a hit or miss affair, but my family has consistently found the LL Big Franks product to be on the tasier side of the spectrum (even through several manufacturer recipie modifications).  If you are looking for hot dogs for grilling, however, try the frozen Morningstar Veggie Dog product -- for our taste, Big Franks are much better at room temperature.  Price-wise, buying through Amazon is less expensive than at our local health food shop -- not even factoring in the free shipping vs. gas used to physically go to the store.

review/text: Okay, so I've been vegan for 9 years. This means I haven't tasted actual franks in that long. These franks tasted very familiar though. After reading the last review, I realize why. He was exactly right! It has a vienna sausage taste. Though it doesn't have that exact flavor, which is great. I always attributed the part of the flavor it doesn't have with spoiling meat anyway. So this is perfect for me. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.<br /><br />These franks are nice and plump. I boiled them, though I thought it would mess up the flavor. But they were perfect after all. I can't wait to try the burgers!

review/summary: Love My LL Big Franks! BEST NOT-DOGS EVER!
review/text: GREAT taste and texture -- Loma Linda Big Franks have been a favorite of mine for over a decade. Even non-vegetarians enjoy them (HONEST!). They are plump and make a nice full sandwich; you don't feel like you are eating all-bun. They are easy to prepare and SUPER on the grill. When I moved & no longer could find my Lomas at the market, I was surprised (and glad!) to see them here, on Amazon, at a great price with free delivery (Amazon-Prime). A box containing 12 cans lasts me over a year; very economical. They don't take up valuable refrig space: The cans can be stored in the back of a closet until opened. (Once opened, I wrap them & freeze.)  These are so much better than meat hot-dogs, which are made from gawd-knows-what! These are vegetable protein, taste like regular "dogs" but better, and have 58% LESS FAT than beef dogs. I made up the term "not-dogs" because people would look surprised when a vegetarian says she is having hot dogs on the grill.  So it's Loma Linda NOT-dogs for me. And BTW - this is a VEGAN product, so everyone can get in and enjoy!

review/summary: Cans were all banged up and dented
review/text: The worse was that over half of the cans had significant dents and were all banged up and crushed.<br /><br />I like the tofurkey Italian style sausages but was looking for a smaller veggie dog with a less exaggerated amount of protein.  These have a better nutritional profile (we can only absorb so much protein per meal, the rest is wasted and stresses the kidneys) and they do taste a little like the little canned Vienna wienies that we used to get as kids.  I do not like them as well as the italian style tofurky taste wise, so it is too bad that I have 12 cans of them!  However, I think I can eat them as regular hot dogs, maybe with some grilled onions, or something spicy.  I wish I had been able to taste just one can, but they are not available anywhere where I live. I do like the fact they do not take space in the freezer.

review/summary: Truly Delicious
review/text: I'm one of those people who would like to be a vegetarian but there's a little problem in that I'm not that crazy about most vegetables.  On the other hand, I could happily live I think on the faux meat line of vegetarian foods marketed by Loma Linda, the absolute best of it's kind and the best of the best are the extremely delicious Big Franks.  These may not taste like hot dogs but then I never eat them as such. I boil them in the delicious juice/sauce they are packaged in, stirring regularly (the juice can boil away quickly), and then put them on a plate pouring the remaining juice over them and then eat them with a little mustard on the side of the plate to dip them in as I chop them into pieces with my fork. I also usually have a few chunks of cheese with them and occasionally a roll, making a terrific meal. I usually eat them three or four at a time (the only bad thing I can think of is one or two is just not very filling, but at only 110 calories a dog one can eat several per meal without the calories climbing too high).  Big Franks are one of the tastiest meals ever and one of the few vegetarian products that even those who normally don't like that sort of thing often love.

review/summary: Best Veggie Hot Dogs
review/text: I think I have been eating the Loma Linda Big Franks for some 30 years.  While I can't think of another canned product that I can sing the praises of, I have to admit to an addiction to these franks.  I first came across them in a health food store in Honolulu.  Actually, I think that is the only place that I have ever found them.  When I moved away from Hawaii, I would often check the local stores of my new home to find cans of the Loma Linda Franks.  Years went by with no luck.  Finally, I decided to check with amazon.com (they seemed to have everything else).  Eureka!  Now I order Loma Linda Big Franks by the case from Amazon.  I thought they were my little vegetarian delight until my wife, who is not a vegetarian, started filching them.  Then, she gave away a can to a friend who was also not a vegetarian!  Everyone's tastes are different and I can't speak for everyone, but I can say that I am hooked on these dogs...

They tasted better than I had rememberd them.  I now buy a case every two months.  I still have two boys at home and they love them.  They're quick and easy to make.  We put sourkraut or vegetarian chili on them.  We cook them on the grill.  We cut them in pieces & marinade them with onions, mushroooms, green and red peppers, and grill them as shish-ka-bob.  They are nutritious and a huge part of our diet.  Five stars for this product.
