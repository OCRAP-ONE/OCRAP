review/summary: Nice chocolatey cookie without the junk!
review/text: These are small crunchy bunny cookies with big chocolate taste.  Our family really enjoys them.  I found Annie's bunny grahams when searching for grahams without the hydrogenated oils and high-fructose corn syrup of other national and store brands.  These fit the bill for us.  Good, natural ingredients, fun shape, great texture and taste.

I love what they're selling and I intend to keep buying their products because the taste is natural and the flavor is much better than the other stuff out there...or the junk...that's not as good for you.

review/summary: By The Sea...
review/text: For this item I withheld the 5th star in my review because it's expensive (less expensive than others that I've tried, but because I buy a lot, it gets expensive).  It's the best TASTING sea salt I've tasted (I've tried twelve gourmet brands b4 finding this one).  It's not overly salty; the salt plus whatever minerals embedded in the Blue Crab Sea Salt tend to make everything tastes better.  (The mineral flavors in the salf is more pronouce when used with unheated food.)  The only downside is the possibility of the taste becoming inconsistent: mineral/chemical composition changes according to condition affecting sea waters, so taste may vary--Hey, I bought enough to last a while.  Yum, yum.

review/text: If you like smoked sea salts this is a very good product.  The smoke flavor is mild and the taste is great.  I put this salt in a grinder and find that the crystals are a bit small so it comes out fast.  I may switch to a small jar and salt spoon or a large holed shaker.  The 12.4 oz jar is enough to go a long way as seasoning salt.

review/summary: One of my top 5 favorites
review/text: I'm pretty much in concordance with Will the first reviewer. I use to drink Costa Rica Tarrazu when I bought it through Gevalia's coffee program. So when Amazon had it on sale I bought a two pack just to see if the two brands were similar. I can report yes they are. I brew mine in my B40 7.5Oz setting and what a wounder coffee it is. I love the aroma when it first starts filling my cup. A light roast with a mild after taste. Never overpowering. I drink my coffee with cream and a sugar substitute. This one wins a spot on my 10 top most favorites list<br /><br />If you like a light roast, this coffee is for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Hint #1 I highly suggest that you get some type water filtration system for your coffee water<br />Hint #2 I immediately remove the used K-cup after brewing and leave the K-Cup holder open to avoid<br />  the accumulation of that stale coffee smell to permeate the k-cup holder.<br /><br />UPDATE I just purchased another 2 pack of this coffee :)

review/summary: Breakfast is a little better now
review/text: Amazon placed the Van Houtte blends on sale recently.  I had tried Van Houtte coffees on a trip to Canada and really enjoyed them. I figured the K-Cups would probably stack up to the batch brewed coffee I had on my trip.  My thought turned out to be correct.  The Costa Rica Tarrazu is a very smooth, medium roast. It has a bright, slightly sweet and lightly acidic flavor, followed by a pleasant, lingering finish with no bitterness. The aroma when brewing is pleasant. I don't use milk or sugar in my coffee, so I'm not fond of really acidic roasts. This is one of the better K-Cups I have tried.<br /><br />Not for you if you like a very dark roast. But if you appreciate a good City roast, definitely put this one on your list. I'll be a repeat customer.

review/summary: How much should you pay for Van Houtte Tarrazu coffee
review/text: I love this coffee a lot because it's mild and has flavor .However I'm shocked at the price of this Van Houtte Costa Rica Tarrazu Coffee .Since Van Houtte wont ship this coffee to the USA and has dismantled their web site ,you only have 1 choice , Amazon .There for around $50 you can buy 48 cups roughly $1.04 per cup .But wait ,and I spent a few hours researching the availabilty of this coffee .I found a web site "tweedandhickory" where they sell 24 k cups or loose coffee in a bag for around $17 , and they do ship to the USA although expensive around $18 .BUT!! here is what you do if you like this coffee so much as I do.The shipping charges while high for 1 order ,increasing your order the shipping is a tiny bit more .SO!! if you buy 5 24 cup boxes and ship to the USA (Boston area) the cost including shipping is $89 thats .74c a cup .This is what I'll do ,maybe we can break the Tarrazu cartel ,because not even Keurig carries it .I hope Amazon will publish this review because it would be a great saving for the readers that like this coffee . I think no one should pay more than .75c a cup .<br /><br />Since I wrote this review I discovered another online site "filterfreshlv.com they sell this Tarraszu for $14.95 for 24 cups plus shipping .Spend $50 ,shipping is free .I can't understand why Amazon my favorite company deals with this company that lists the retail price at $33 which is crossed out and the price is now $45.95 plus tax .<br /><br />Unfortunately a big scam is being is being played here Filter Fresh and the Amazon seller are both advertizing Tarrazu and are delivering Costa Rican coffee .The only similarity is the Van Houtte printed on the box .It's virtually impossible to buy Tarrazu in this country so some sellers are showing a picture of a split label cup which says Tarrazu ,but when you buy and open the box the cups have a black label which says Costa Rican coffee .Folks there is a difference and these sellers are substituting Costa Rican coffee knowingly and charging outragious prices.This should be stopped ,and twice I have bought what was advertized as Tarrazu and wasn't .After pointing out to these sellers they told me to keep the coffee and refunded my money ,but continue to bait and switch the public.The only place to get Van Houtte Tarrazu coffee is in Canada and most companies wont ship to the USA.In conclusion the Costa Rican coffee is good but not as good as Tarrazu ,so you will have to drink this slightly inferior coffee .I just get upset about the games being played.<br /><br />2/26/12<br />At last I found it Tarrazu coffee ,not Van Houtte but from George Howell in Newtonville ,MA web site www.terriorcoffee.com .<br />While it isn't Van Houtte it's a delicious quality coffee in a 12 oz bag (no K-Cup )at $13.75 .I live about 4 miles from their coffee shop and because I bought this bag of coffee ,they gave me a free cup of their coffee of the day .That was El Roble from Colombia  and boy was that delicious .For those people who don't know who George Howell is ,he started Coffee Connections in the Boston area many years ago ,only to be bought out by Starbucks .Well he's back at it brewing great coffee and he carries Tarrazu .

review/text: I've tried more than 20 K-cups found on Amazon since purchasing my machine in early 2009. To give an idea of what other blends I enjoy-Donut Shop, Wolfgang Puck Vienna, Kona Blend, Gloria Jeans Hazelnut-so generally medium roasts with decent but not overpowering coffee flavor. This is my favorite. It is a very smooth aromatic cup of coffee with a wisp of nut flavor. I usually add a bit of creamer and a splenda to my coffee. This is perfect. I like it on all settings but I tend to use the medium most.

review/summary: Terrific flavor has changed, but Amazon keeps the old pictures
review/text: Van Houtte's Costa Rica Tarrazu was the BEST, but unfortunately the manufacturer has changed the formula. Instead of a sweet, mild, light roast that even people who dislike coffee could love, VH changed it to a more medium, more bitter, more dark roast (even though it says light).  Even though I dislike coffee, I love my Keurig - and was so happy to find a great flavor and devastated that VH changed it from "Costa Rica Tarrazu" to just "Costa Rica" (you'd think coffee manufacturers would want to keep a flavor that would be a "gateway flavor" for folks with sweet tooths!) I was thrilled when Amazon pictured the old style of Tarrazu (two colors, word "tarrazu" included) and tried buying it in December from Royal Buy.  To this date, they STILL have not responded to my two letters complaining that they did not send the old style as pictured, but the new formula (single brown color, "tarrazu" not on it). I have 47 k-cups I don't want to drink, no response much less an exchange or refund, and it was a terrible price.  What's worse, Amazon is continuing to show pictures of the old formula from other sellers.  "We3_Sell_Stuff" was kind enough to write and warn that they are selling the new formula; have not heard yet from Coffee Filters.  This is not the only product where Amazon pictures a (better!) old formula (liquid soap comes to mind), meaning it is hard to trust what to buy for those of us hoping to find the last of an older formula of a favorite product.  Caveat emptor!<br />(Rating is difficult - 5 stars for old flavor; 1 star for new flavor; 0 stars for Amazon's misleading photos & for Royal Buy).

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ4I">Van Houtte Cafe, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast) Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Of all the coffees I tried since getting my Keurig, this is the best so far. This is my 3rd refill. My suggestion is to try using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LXY2HA">Capresso frothPRO</a> that  also got on Amazon. Makes great crema using skim milk. Then add a spoonful of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NT35LY">Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for Baking - 16 OZ</a>, mmmmmmmm good!

review/text: Got hooked on Tarrazu coffee while working in Costa Rica. This is a pleasant cup that tastes just as I expected it to. Not for people who want coffee so strong that it walks around on its own... they will be disappointed. Glad to find it in a k-cup... the stash I brought from CR for my conventional coffee maker was all gone!

review/text: I bought these on a Friday special on a whim.  I was running low on k-cups and thought I'd give them a try.  These are fantastic.  I prefer a light roast coffee and these fit the bill.  They are smooth and do not have a bitter aftertaste.  I'd definitely buy these again, whether on a Friday special or not.  It was my first Van Houtte Cafe purchase and I look forward to trying some of their other k-cups.

review/summary: Great Coffee, but
review/text: This coffee is flavorful but gentle, not harsh or bitter. Unfortunately, the filter inside the K-Cup seems to be a little weak. On about 1 in every 5 brewed cups, the filter has split inside and a significant amount of coffee grounds are deposited into the brewed cup of coffee. We CAREFULLY autopsied the K-Cup after noticing the grounds in the coffee and saw the split filter and only a few grounds remaining in the K-Cup.  We switch around brands and strengths throughout the day and this is the first Van Houtte coffee that we have purchased. We have not had the same problem with the K-Cups made by other brands of coffee roasters.

Green Cow is a good value and will extend your pets healthy life. i started feeding green cow to my 13 year old Golden 18 months ago. this is my 7th golden and number 8 will get tripe from the start. also it should be noted that she gets 45 minutes of hard exercise daily. dont let age slow your pet down. if you have an older large dog with hind leg and back arthritis you may want to try Pyhcox, I double the recommended dose. my observation is these 2 products have decreased my pets pain and stiffness increased her muscle mass and improved her daily life.

review/summary: A Bit Stinky, but FANTASTIC for the Picky Eater
review/text: We have a new puppy Yorkie who has decided to be the most finicky eater on the planet.  We have to continually mix up the types of foods we give her or she'll get "bored" with what we're feeding her.  Anything that smells like actual dog food is out of the question - she won't touch it.<br /><br />I've tried all types of kibble and wet dog foods and have had no luck, UNTIL I tried the Green Cow Tripe.  It came as a suggestion from our obedience class teacher and I haven't been happier.  Our Yorkie loves this dog food, and although many complain about its smell, I personally don't think it smells too much worse than other canned dog food.<br /><br />Mixing up the canned tripe with other dog food, rice, some cottage cheese, etc. virtually guarantees an appetite.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier - try it out if you have a picky eater.

review/text: My puppy, who used to always leave some kibble behind no matter what I mixed it with, eats the last little piece since I began mixing it with Solid Gold's tripe. I haven't tried any of the other ones besides SG. There is little smell to it, as tripe can be quite stinky. That is a plus. Since she is a growing girl and I really want her to get the full nutritional value of her meals, I will be using this regularly now. She also loves tripe treats.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to get this because all too often, these things lack in flavor or texture, if not both.  The batter was thicker than I'd expected and kind of oozed slowly out of the mixing bowl.  You can tell as it hits the pan that it isn't going to get any fluffier.  The box says to cut and serve after they're cool, but of course- who can wait?  We gave them a few minutes and had them warm.  Wonderfully chewy with a hint of gooey, and they tasted just like brownies made with oodles of sugar.  I will definitely be making these again!

What a wonderful treat -- and you can serve them to anyone with or without an issue with sugar; no one would guess these are not regular, premium brownies. No kidding.<br /><br />To add some serious pizzazz, try adding some Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Raspberry (just add it to the mix), which is also sold via Amazon.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GYJUJC">Torani Syrup, Sugar Free, Red Raspberry, 33.81-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />BTW, I never had any odd intestinal problems whatsoever from eating these brownies. If you eat a whole bunch of brownies, have a weak/very sensitive constitution, or have problems with Splenda or sugar alcohol (not a real form of sugar) in any amount, then common sense would point toward, "you're only asking for trouble." Besides, diabetics beware: these brownies are indeed SUGAR FREE -- but NOT CARBOHYDRATE or FAT FREE. -- Always be very careful how much and what it is, one eats!!!

Much smaller, with very tart skins, but delicious insides.<br />These gummy candies taste and smell exactly like the inside of those grapes.<br />When I first opened the bag in the car, the scent filled the air and I immediately succumbed to redintegration.<br />Even absent your own childhood memories though, I still highly recommend these.<br />Very tasty and not too, too sweet.<br /><br />- mike

review/text: Muscadine grapes are my favorites.  These gummies are remarkably close in taste, texture, and smell to the real thing....sweet with a touch of sour.  I enjoyed the different shapes (heart or round).  The smell is incredible!

review/summary: Juicy!
review/text: This candy is awesome...upon first hitting your mouth it sends a little zing to the sides of your jaw, then it's a mountain of juicy flavor. They are bite sized gummies that pack a powerful punch of taste. This candy tastes like real juice, which is more than I can say for its American counterparts. Eating these are a wonderful sensation that you'll be sorry you went so long without trying after you've had them. Highly recommended if you are a fan of all things gummy.

review/summary: Sugar Free Heaven
review/text: Being a diabetic I am always on the search for sugar free products that actually taste good. I always loved caramel corn and have tried several brands. The last was expensive and tasted nasty. Then I tried one that was great but very (over 12.00 per bag) expensive. Thatcher's tastes great , is reasonably priced, and the service was fantastic. I ordered it and was told it could take 7 to 10 days to get it. I was surprised when it arrived 3 days later! And it tasted great! I would highly recommend this product and company to anyone looking for sugar free caramel corn!

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

review/summary: Best Tea to Relieve Urethra Pain
review/text: This tea is for urinary health.  It definitely helps relieve pain.  If you have an UTI, this tea does not cure it, but it helps in relieving pain in the urethra.  The taste is not the greatest, but it's a medicine tea, so I don't mind, knowing that I will find relief.  You need to steep the tea for a half hour and then drink it while its still hot and fresh.  Use a few times a day.  This tea is from Croatia... a place where they have wonderful herbs for medicinal teas.

If you have episodes of UTI it is best to keep using tea even though infection is gone --- some herbs in this tea have such potency very similar to Cipro antibiotic i have been told by my NP.  So using tea regularly it helps prevent infections from happening.  And after some time, one get used to taste, too.  :) Happy tea time

review/summary: weird combination
review/text: let me first say that we are a family of 6 and nugo bars addicts.  you will find at least 7-8 boxes of different flavors in our household on any given day.  Our favorites are nugo dark mocha, chocolate peanut butter, chocolate pomegranate and several others.<br /><br />on to this particular bar.  quality and nutritional values are great - just like with any other nugo bar.  that said, a combination of crunch and almond is quite strange.  Crunch in this bar seems a bit tougher than many other nugo bars, but not really hard.  then they add small chunks of almonds into the mix, and eating this bar feels like you are eating something partially stale, as you bite a piece and feel a chunk of hard product ( almond) and a chunk of semi-soft product (soy crunch).  .  it's neither crispy, nor crunchy - JUST VERY STRANGE.  this bar should have had whole almonds mixed in so there is clear "separation", but with poorly crushed almonds mixed in,,,,,,,,well, enough said.

review/summary: Greatest health bars ever invented
review/text: These are the greatest health bars ever invented for the following reasons:<br /><br />First of all, if you like almonds and dark chocolate, then these bars are absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Second, these bars don't have any more sugar than the limit recommended for a health snack (&lt;15).<br /><br />Third, they will stave off hunger for hours because they are made from brown rice and almonds, a great combo of complex carbs and protein.<br /><br />And they are good for your heart because they are made with the darkest chocolate possible.  In fact, I'd prefer their being less healthy with milk chocolate, as I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate.  But the combination of ingredients is well balanced so the dark chocolate flavor doesn't overpower the other flavors despite it having the darkest chocolate possible.<br /><br />Finally, the company owners and employees are extremely friendly.  I used to buy directly from nugo.com, which can at times be cheaper than Amazon.  Unfortunately, these bars are so popular that they go out of stock quickly.  Once I complained to the company about their changing the dark chocolate content to make it darker, and I received free samples of other flavors.<br /><br />All in all, this product is a recommended must buy.

When I saw them on Amazon, I purchased a whole pack of 12 for $21.23 .  anywho....here's the thing....I also ordered at the same time another item...which I wanted to receive quickly...so when I went to check out i selected the 2 day shipping option..what a huge surprise and NOT in a good way, when I saw a $19.07 shipping for a total of $40.30 I was shocked, because ofcourse that put the price for each at $3.35 a piece. . .I  could have just poped into the local store for that!! I felt ripped off...I thought my larger item would possibly cost more for shipping but it did not...it was only $11.74 for a large item...so I am eating a very expensive bar right now, but it sure is good. I will be more careful and only select the 'normal delivery' time option from now on. live and learn I guess.
