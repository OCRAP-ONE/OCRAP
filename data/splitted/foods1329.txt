review/summary: For your health
review/text: This is a great product even though I am a health nut.  The Acai powder taste really good with my protein shake plus it has a high potency.  I will mix this powder with a chocolate protein shake and both taste and color changes which shows it's the real deal.  Even though it is a antioxidant product you have to eat right as well to feel the effect.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS really carefully put in the refrigerator after first use or else it will spoil.

review/summary: Convenient way to get Acai in my diet
review/text: Acai is a potent source of antioxidants and the challenge has been to get the freshest Acai in my diet. It is important to get freshest possible Acai as its potency do decrease as time goes on. I was getting frozen Acai from local health food store and it was expensive and not convenient.<br /><br /> Amazon offers this Freeze Dried version of Acai and I jumped at the chance and was glad to have tried it. Some reviewers have commented it tasted horrible. Well that is how Acai tastes in nature and that is what you get. I tried the Sambazon frozen Acai from a local health food store and it tasted exactly like this freeze dried version.<br /><br />I have found a great way to use this freeze dried Acai and that is to add a scoop of freeze dried Acai to plain Mountain High Yogurt. If you have a sweet tooth, you could add Agave sweetener or raw honey and you get a great combo for a healthy snack that will help your digestive system, get antioxidant properties of Acai and have a wonderful taste from tropical paradise.<br /><br />There is a multilevel marketing company that markets chocolate made with Acai and I am thinking one could melt Belgian chocolate bar and add this Acai powder to it and place in a small mold and then cool and there you have made your own Acai Chocolate snack and you don't have to pay $100 a month to boot !! I would hesitate to do it as theoretically heat destroys and lowers the potency of antioxidant nature of Acai.

review/summary: Yummy? Check you taste buds...
review/text: OK, so yummy doesn't describe the taste.  Actually it's almost tasteless.  You can prove this by mixing it with water instead of juice.  That's how I drink it when it's not in a smoothie.  Seems to have a really good nutritional profile but I can't confirm the health benefit claims.  Afterall, I take a lot of "miracle foods" like bitter melon and Gac.<br /><br />Price is a factor and this stuff is expensive.  I won't be ordering this again.  It's too expensive for what you get.<br /><br />Oh yeah... Dig down in the powder and there's a measuring sccop.  I found mine purely by accident.

review/text: I have been using Sambazon Acai powder for a number of years and have always been extremely satisfied with the quality of the product.  However, the latest shipment I received from Beepco llc (Sun Light Savings) is of a very poor quality.  The powder is a brown color (usually it's dark purple) and it smells rancid.  Amazon is sending me a replacement order.  Hopefully the quality will be better this time or we will quit using this product altogether.

review/summary: BEWARE! Seller put me on a marketing list!
review/text: ------------ Product Review 5 Stars -------------<br />The powder is good and cheap (compared to other brands), and tastes great in my smoothie.  A 5-star product for sure!  It needs to be refrigerated after opening and is good for 60 days.  The scoop is over twice as big as the scoop that came in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q1SYNQ">Perfect foods Acai Powder</a>, so although the Sambazon Acai Powder costs less (and is just as good), the price probably comes out to be close to the same if you use the huge Sambazon scoop.<br /><br />If celebrity endorsements matter to you, Alton Brown recommends using the Sambazon brand acai juice. Since he's a food scientist, you can be sure he's researched his product.  Although he's not using the powder, the fact that he specifically uses Sambazon, gives me some greater comfort in using it because apparently, not all acai products are equal.<br /><br />------------ Seller Review 1 Star --------------<br />I hate it when people review the seller and not the product in this area, but this seller violated one of the MAJOR reasons I use Amazon. Also, there was not enough room in the seller review area for me to warn other folks, and trust me, you need to be warned.  So here it is...<br /><br />I enjoy using Amazon because I don't get put on junk email lists by sellers.  After buying this product, I received a non-Amazon email from the seller requesting my feedback.  I've been an Amazon customer for over 10 years and this is the first time I've experienced this kind of solicitation.  I'm now finding myself having to go to a non-Amazon website, [...] requesting to be removed from their marketing.  Are you serious?  Subscriptionloop.com?  That should send chills up your spine!  God only knows who has my email address now.  If you hate spam, the potential for spam, or don't want a company called subscriptionloop.com to have your email address, avoid this seller at all costs.  As most of us know, it only takes one mistake with your email address and then it's spam city.  I fear that I have made that mistake by using this seller.<br /><br />**Note: When I purchased this product in Feb 2012, it was being sold by Beepco llc (Sun Light Savings).  It now shows that it's being sold by Amazon, and if that's the case, then you shouldn't have my experience.  If it changes to Sun Light Savings though, you've been warned...**

review/text: Here is day one of use, if the benefits are proven I will definately continue to purchase! It doesnt have much of a taste, isnt bitter like other brands of premixed acai drink. like others have said previously, yes it does not mix very well...BUT think of vitamin shots, they tend to not mix well either but millions make that purchase every day. I mixed with water and a tad of low calorie sweetener, to myself I found it tastes just like an instant tea. So that is how I will drink it to improve water intake as well. The price of this product is very sufficient. Affordable, and better tasting overall when mixed with plain water or as a shot (like a wheatgrass shot).

Usually acai will make the smoothie a rich purple color, this powder didn't do that and watch out, it will give you gas.  I couldn't read the expiration date because there was a sticker over it.. hmm... It was a very small amount for 12.00 too.  I'm going back to frozen sambazon.

And the grit...holy grit!  I bought this to include in my smoothie shakes for nutrition.  I could probably get use to the grit consistency, but the smell and stale taste seems to over power my shakes.  This is with just one scoop.  Again, maybe it's my inexperience with this type of powder, but I will not be purchasing again.

review/summary: works for detox
review/text: I'm not sure what acai powder is supposed to do exactly- I'd heard all these claims about it being good for weight loss, having anti-aging properties, providing energy and boosting the immune system etc. I started taking it as just a general all around tonic because of the vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients. I have problems with my central nervous system so I'm really sensitive to toxins and chemicals both inside and outside my body. I hoped that this would be a better way of getting essential vitamins instead of taking artificial pills which irrate my nerves more. I can't vouch for all the other claims but it did work as a detox agent. After about two weeks of taking a full teaspoon everyday in my smoothie I started to get detox symptoms similar to when I took apple cider vinegar(also very healthful and nutritious) for a week. I started to get a really bad soar throat, bloatedness, a blocked, runny nose and headaches and irritability out of the blue. However, when this passed I DID feel better (more clarity, less anxiety, more able to feel my emotions etc). So it must be doing something right. To get around the problem of it not mixing well I put a teaspoon in a cup first and then added about an inch of a smoothie (not water or regular juice- disaster!)and mixed it into a thick paste first before adding more of the smoothie. I think this prevents it getting everywhere and not mixing well. So it was okay. If you would like a nutritious all round tonic and something with fibre and the daily quotient of vits and minerals I would also recommend Amazing Grass All Natural Drink Green Superfood.

review/summary: WORKS w/ diet and exercise
review/text: I was turned on to the benefits of acai back in december. As part of my new years resolution, I am drinking at least one spinach/fruit smoothie DAILY. For the last three months, I add one scoop of the Sambazon acai powder along with Green Vibrance powder to my smoothie.<br /><br />I haven't felt this great since my 20's! My body has transformed dramatically, but NOT overnight. If you are looking for a miracle potion, it doesn't exist. However, I highly recommend acai powder with sensible diet/exercise. I have been using the Sambazon brand because it's not overpriced like Monavie, and is easy to add to my smoothie. The slightly bitter taste doesn't bother me and is not even noticable when mixed w/ fresh spinach, banana, mango, blueberry, strawberry, and rasberry.<br /><br />Results speak for themself: in 5 months I went from 165lbs to 147lbs of lean muscle. My skin has cleared up completely and I feel great. Remember, gradual change will come with patience and lifestyle change.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I've tried this a couple of different ways.  I don't use a full scoop.  1/2 a scoop works great with a protein shake or other liquid form.  I use about 1/4 (or less) of a scoop with my morning Muesli and yogart.  The dried Acai is better if it has time to soak up some liquid.  I usually mix my Muesli, acai and yogart the night before and refridgerate overnight.  I love it!  The acai gives the mix a berry flavor, but not a LOT of flavor, just adds to whatever flavor is already there.  If it has time to soak, you can't tell it's there (texture wise).  If it doesn't, it's a little grainy.  Overall a great product.  sealed fresh, delivered fast, and a great deal.

review/summary: Jury still out
review/text: I had a hard time rating this product because I am still not sure of the validity of the benefits it claims.  I mix it with Odwalla's superfood and some frozen berries (blueberry, raspberry and marionberry), along with another liquid multivitamin from Costco (which also touts many fruit extracts,antioxidants and fish oil)to make a super-duper smoothie that the children and I drink every morning before breakfast (about 1-2 fl ounces for the kids and double the amount for the adults.)<br />So far none of us has made notice of any drastic healthy changes in us for the 3 to 4 weeks we have been drinking it.  Then again I personally live a very healthy lifestyle to begin with that includes eating healthy and taking 4 different multivitamin pills a day.  So the jury is still out regarding the effectiveness of the product.<br />A similarly healthy friend who drinks monavie (and sells it) says that the latter's effects shows up during excercise, where he can go on much longer and harder without getting tired.  Maybe it is the same.

review/summary: Good product, good value
review/text: Supposedly freeze-dried Acai powder is the best and most potent form of Acai.  If you take a scoop a day of this stuff a day it will last you over a month - this is more powder per serving than what's offered in the capsule forms of Acai.  When compare the value - the amount of powder in a jar versus how much you pay for it, plus how much powder you get in a scoop... this is hands down the best!  I mix mine in milk - to me it tastes like malted milk.  I've had a lot more energy since I started taking this stuff and every time I drink my glass of Acai milk it seems to have a balancing effect on my stomach and body.<br /><br />Sambazon sounds like a great company too.  If you are going to take an antioxidant to help purify your body, then why wouldn't you take organic?  Also, they are a member of fair trade and so forth.  The company was begun by two environmentally-minded surfers.  So there's the added benefit (besides getting the best deal) of knowing that I am supporting a good company.

review/summary: Not the miracle I anticipated
review/text: Sambazon Acai Powerscoop Powder 90g from Sambazon<br /><br />As a person with an auto-immune disease, where chronic fatigue is a major obstacle, I have navigated through many nutritional support options to supplement a healthy diet and when I first began to read about the Acai Berry, I was interested in trying it. I have used other anti-oxidant products from very dependable sources, and there is just no dramatic difference I detect with this product. Freeze dried Acai appears to be the most dependable formulation for delivery of the benefits of the berry, but I honestly noticed no change after a month trial. (I actually had to stop taking this product for a few days as for some reason, perhaps attributed to the pH of the supplement, I found the product worsened my gastritis). I give the product three stars, because I do believe that for some people, they may see remarkable results, but I certainly did not. I still believe that this product is worth a try, for all the reasons that the Acai Berry has the potential to yield wonderful changes in overall health. It just did not do it for me. Good luck to those who choose to try this. I would recommend this brand because of the preference of the freeze dried state to hold onto all the nutritional "miracles". Don't get succored into cheaper brands. The nature of a complicated illness may or may not be a factor that determines clinical outcomes. Healthy supplement options are at times only as good as the Company that makes them. I do believe that the Acai Berry is a very important food souce. Besides the wonders of its potential health benefits, it is a product that ensures the preservation of the Amazon Jungles. On the flip-side, the less we eat hearts of palms which comes from the same tree and literally ensures the destruction of the tree to harvest the hearts, the better.

review/text: I have got in the habit of working out when I get up.  I drink a soy-protein shake and have started putting in a scoop of this freeze dried Acai.  Didn't expect anything, just figured I would try it.  However, I do notice a higher energy level throughout the day when I drink this powder in the morning.  I was a bit surprised that it has little to no taste to it, I was expecting some sort of berry flavor.  I would not recommend just stirring it in with water as it is like you just stirred in some card board.  Mixed in with my flavored soy protein, it is just fine though.

review/text: ACAI Powerscoop Powder 90 Grams<br /><br />According to the product literature, this ACAI powder by Sambazon is organic and USDA stamped.  I wanted a good antioxidant supplement to take in addition to my other supplements.  It is a deep purple color, tastes good, and easily dissolves in liquid.  I take mine every morning mixed into my oat bran cereal or stir it into milk or juice.  I have so far purchased 4 cans, and each can lasts for about one month.  I find it gives me energy, and eliminates bloating and gas which I had before starting this product.  It also seems to help my joints for mobility, which I assume is because it is acting on inflamation such as arthritis.  I feel that my skin is looking better and I have recommended it to my son who has dry, sensitive skin.  I am delighted with this product.

review/text: So there are now probably over 100 products out there with Acai in it.  There are people that use it that can't even pronounce it but just want you to know they use it.  Crazy, I've been using this stuff for about 3 years now.  I think the best way to have Acai is straight up on its own.  I combine it with juice or smoothies.  I'd recommend keeping away from the multilevel marketing side to get Acai, you can benefit from it in a more pure form on its own.

review/text: This is a tasty powder, indeed.  It reminds me very much of the flavor of tea, which is why I'm able to mix it with plain water and be quite satisfied.  It looks a lot like potting soil, but certainly doesn't taste like it.  I agree with the others that it is rather grainy, but I hardly notice that at all when I'm enjoying a glass.  It gives me a pleasant energy boost without the annoyance of a crash.  As for weight loss, I would say that due to the boost in energy and the help of the ingredients, you could definitely make this a part of a healthy weight loss regime.  It leaves one feeling a sense of comfortable fullness, calm stomach, and pep in your step!  I recommend it to all.

review/text: 10/11/2009 UPDATE<br />Folks, Ive been on this stuff for close to 6 months now and miracles have happened. No more depression. My spirits are very high and happy. Vision problems have gone away (likely due to the depression). My energy is like a 20 year old (and I"m 44 years old with a thyroid problem). It feels so good to be "back in form." The improvement in my brain chemistry is really what I am using this product for. It is not advertised as doing this... I've just noticed a gross improvement in mine as a result of it so I'm using it daily. In the beginning I was using a great deal of it (because I was so excited with the results)...but eventually when the depression went away I lowered the amount I take. I feel really good on this product and it will always be part of my daily regimen...<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I've been on this product line for about 5 days now and tried the powder for the first time yesterday. It tastes great..not strong...tastes like a mild berry flavor. I would recommend you buy Welchs grape juice to mix with it...because when the two are together, you hardly notice the powder or the taste at all. In the last week I have noticed an improvement in my brain chemistry, memory, vision, energy and have even lost a couple of pounds. It seems to suppress your appetite but not in a bad way. There are no side effects to this product at all..I also noticed that I'm sleeping better. This is a great product. I'll be on it forever.

review/text: The quality of the coffee and the speed of delivery were outstanding -- especially because my order was placed during the holiday season.  I was a little surprised to find, however, that the two bags contained only 7 ounces of coffee each -- not the way the bags looked in the on-line ad image, but consistent with the relatively small print on the label shown on the image.  What I thought was great coffee at a great price turned out to be great coffee at an OK price.  While it was my failure to look in detail at the packaging that led to my expectation not being met, more clarity and detail in the text of the ad would have avoided this confusion.

review/text: I use my great-grandmother's recipe for molasses cookies. She died in 1915 and the recipe has been handed down. My grandmother always used Bre'r Rabbit green label. Tonight I used a substitute after a fruitless search of the local supermarkets for the real thing. The difference was profound. The substitute produced cookies that are nearly inedible. I'll be using only Bre'r Rabbit from now on.

It is the best flavored molasses having not just a sweet flavor but a true, strong molasses flavor that makes a difference in what you are cooking.  For me the Green Label Full Flavor is by far the best.

review/text: We wanted a deodorizing pet cologne that lasted on our dog, especially since he's a water dog.  Our local groomer recommended this.  I was glad to see in the product description that the scent lasted between baths.  I was shocked when it truly only lasted about 1/2  a day on the dog.  We can spray him in the morning, and by afternoon, that wonderful scent is gone.  He's back to smelling like a wet dog.  The scent of this product, by the way, is great.  We just wished it lasted as long as it claims!

review/summary: The Sweet Smell of Success
review/text: Unlike many other similar products, Fresh'n Clean doesn't bury your dog under a layer of heavy perfume. Instead, it has a subtle sweetness. I apply it after giving my two English springer spaniels a thorough combing with a shedding rake. Then I rough up their coats so the spray penetrates to the surface of the skin, where it helps to control body odor.<br /><br />You may also want to try Pro-Groom Coat Pet Conditioner <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063KHHC">Lambert Kay Pro-Groom Coat Pet Conditioner, 12-1/2-Ounce</a> from the same company, which I've been using for about a dozen years. It's especially effective on heavy, dense coats, and because it facilitates combing I use it both before and after. It has a very pleasant scent that makes my house smell fresh'n clean.

I use it everytime they come in from outside.  They mostly stay in the house. But do go out about 4-5 times a day.  Sometimes they stay out for a while if the weather is good.

review/summary: Gone in 60 seconds...
review/text: The dieter who couldn't eat a whole package in a day must have been eating these tasty little gems one by one, with a break inbetween each bite. Not my family.  We would each take a handful for a snack, and before we knew it, the bag was empty.<br /><br />But enough about the bag.  These things are tasty and provide a concentrated strawberry punch of flavor which makes "strawberry flavored" items taste lame.  With these, you get the whole range of flavors in a strawberry, sweet without being too sweet, and none of the acidic taste that you sometimes get in an underripe berry.  The dried fruit is very crunchy, without any of the gumminess that shows the manufacturer removed them from the dehydrator too early.<br /><br />My only beef is the price, although I understand why they are so expensive.  When I dried fruit, it took many pints of cleaned, stemmed and sliced berries to come up with a respectable amount of food.  My family was always finished with one batch long before the next before the next was ready. When I consider the effort involved, these snacks are probably underpriced.  But it still hurts to see an expensive packet gone before the commercials are over!

review/text: I love to snack on freeze dried strawberries but find it hard to find a small package for sale, usually they're sold in large cans.  These were really crunchy and melt in your mouth when you first open the package.  I couldn't eat one whole package in one day.  If you don't eat them all in one day - they tend to loose some of their crunch and go slightly chewy, but this is to be expected and not a sign of a bad product.  Even chewy, they're still good.

review/summary: Strawberries are good, packaging is poor
review/text: I am not new to dehydrated strawberries since I have been eating the "Just Tomatoes" brand that comes in the plastic canisters for years. Amazon was out of them so I ordered these instead.<br /><br />The bag poses a problem for me because the strawberries are packed above the the resealable part so that when I opened the bag where it says "tear here" strawberry powder and small pieces spilled out. I only wanted a few of them so resealing it without crumbling the berries on top was difficult since the resealable part, as I mentioned, is below the level where they are in the bag.<br /><br />The strawberries taste good and have a nice texture, but I noticed that compared to the "Just Tomatoes" brand they aren't as red which makes me think they are using less ripe berries or maybe they lost some of the color in the processing. It also seems like there are more "crumbs" maybe because the plastic bag doesn't protect them from breakage.<br /><br />Overall good berries but when amazon is back in stock of the other brand I will buy them instead.

It balances well with the sweetened cereal just like the strawberries that are already in it.  For a snack, I prefer the Crunchies mixed fruit.  It too is unsweetened, but the other fruits in the mixture are sweet enough to carry the strawberries.  It's really very good, especially with the mango bits that give it a unique taste.

review/summary: Healthy alternative to candy!
review/text: I'm a candy addict, but I love fruit, too, so when fresh fruit isn't available, I love having dried fruit for snacking. The difference between these packaged fruits and some other dried fruit snacks is that these are freeze-dried and crunchy, with no added sugars, while the others are chewy & moist, and usually processed with sugar to sweeten & preserve freshness. These are great additions to yogurt, cereal, desserts, baking, and so on. They store well in a cool, dry place, & do have to be kept in an airtight container to keep them crunchy, because if they absorb moisture they get rubbery. Also, it's best to consume them by the freshness date because even when they're still sealed after months of storage, eventually they will lose their crunchy texture due to air seepage. The freeze-drying retains all the flavor, and I presume much of the nutrients, also.
