review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: Great food for cats
review/text: My two cats love Science Diet. Only problem is I wish they would have a picture of the food on the outside of the bag. There is the dry which is tan, triangle shaped and the other is a dark brown,round shape. I always end up buying the wrong bag and the cats only love one.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/summary: Its duck fat!
review/text: This product is very popular in France and when I had some foods cooked with it, I had to have some. The only problem I had with this was that apparently it had to ship refrigerated to preserve it which cost me just as much as the product itself. I ended up spending around $50.on a gallon so I'm not so sure I'll be purchasing another one.

review/summary: The best of the best.
review/text: This is an outstanding product.  My only complaint is it's an energy drink, but that's also why people buy it.  It's 80% fruit juice, loaded with vitamins, and tastes incredibly good.  The caffeine is a bit strong for me, but I can't resist the flavor.  No one at work can either, since I brought them in and people tasted them.<br /><br />If you like the synthetic, plastic taste of most energy drinks, maybe this won't appeal to you because it's a delicious fruity flavor, without the toxic flavors that most energy drinks have.<br /><br />This is kind of the energy drink for people that don't like energy drinks.  If you've never had it, you should try it.  You'll like it.

Every time I found a store that had them, I would buy them until that store ran out and they wouldn't restock them.  I thought they were discontinued until I found them on the "marketplace".<br /><br />M80 is the BEST energy drink that Monster makes and the BEST energy drink ever.  It is the ONLY one I drink.  With it being one of the juice drinks, it has the taste like the Hawaiian islands that inspired the formula.  Out of all energy drinks, it has ended up being the best "mixer" as well.<br /><br />I am now the envy of so many of my friends who love Monster M80s but can't find them anywhere.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMC2IC">Monster Energy Drink, M-80, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Alternative to common chocolate puffs
review/text: Finally decided to make the transition to stop buying the popular food stuffs on the grocery shelves. I'm not saying whether or not they're more or less healthier but I like the simpler ingredients in this brand. Ingredients listed are: Corn meal, Dehyrated Cane Juice, Whole Oat Flour, Cocoa Powder, Fructan (a natural dietary fiber) Oat Hull Fiber, Calcium Carbonate, Salt, Natural Flavor and Iron.<br /><br />The texture of this cereal has a bite to it familiar to me as being from the corn. Not offensive but doesn't "give" like the common brand. The color is not as deep as the common brand but does definitely scream chocolate. The flavor is mildly sweet, just enough so. To transition myself off of the chemical laden brand, I put a squirt, (a tsp or so) of chocolate sauce in my cereal. My kids know something is up  and haven't tried this yet. Whenever I try and force food on them, it's not a good result. So I am waiting for them to notice that there are none of the old cereals in the house anymore. I wish I would of started sooner.

This cheese is good with just about anything you can put cheese on. My favorite way to use this cheese is to spread it on crackers. It makes a delicious snack. I get it at my local grocery store and it is always very fresh.

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines.

The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them.

review/summary: LOVE Happy Baby!
review/text: My daughter is now 2 and we have been buying Happy Baby product from Amazon since she was 6 months old. They almost always have the best price and best selection! These are the best portable snack for a active toddler! My daughter loves the taste and I love that it is a healthy snack. A added benefit I have found is that the extra fiber helps keep her digestive track in check. She has had constipation problems since around a year and these have been the key to keeping her comfortable. For the best price Join Amazon Mom and subscribe and save. Lifesaver for those of us who live in Very rural communities!

review/text: These are amazing pouches.  My son will usually eat 1-2 per day, which is at least 100% of the vitamin A and C that is required for his age.  It's not always easy to get him to eat vegetables and fruits, and this is a nice, convenient way to encourage healthy eating.  I HIGHLY recommend these!  This is the most nutritious version of the HappyTot pouch, as well.

review/summary: Good way to ensure daily fruit and veggie for the new solid food eater
review/text: I love these for my son (he is now 14 months).  He likes these because he can do it himself - he's very anti-other people feeding him at this point, so with these he gets to do it himself - they're fairly clean but every once in a while when he's in a particularly "playful" mood he realizes that he can squeeze it out and fingerpaint with them - still much cleaner and more efficient than trying to spoon feed him these days tho.<br /><br />I also use the subscribe function so these (along with two other varieties of these) get delivered every 3 weeks to my house - amazon gives a little bit off the cost as well and then i don't have to worry about it - its also MUCH cheaper buying in bulk this way via amazon as opposed to something like $1.50 each in the grocery stoe

review/text: Love this product. Perfect for babies while on the go. We actually purchased these specifically while on vacation (usually I just have a few on hand for occassional use). My daughter gobbles these up. I just wish they sold a variety pack! I find myself filling with with individual ones of a different flavor here and there cause I can tell my daughter gets tired of it.<br /><br />Although, along with a previous review, I too, received the 3.5 ounce package rather than the size stated in the description. BUT, Amazon has amazing customer service and immediately fixed the problem. And that's the only reason I give it four stars (and the fact that I wish there was a variety).<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying these, totally worth it.

review/summary: Baby loved it, convenient pouch
review/text: Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option.

I wish it was a little greener, indicating more green beans and peas, but he loves it and I'm thrilled with that.  His favorite meal I think is a pouch of Chick Chick and a pouch of this.  As long he continues to love it, I will make sure to keep it stocked for him.  Love it!  I also love the convenience of this style of pouch since you can just squeeze it straight onto the spoon and save what you don't use for later.

We've tried all of the different flavor combinations Happy Tot has to offer, and this is by far our favorite - incredible, really, when it's nearly impossible to get my son to even touch peas or green beans. Like most fruit / veggie pouches, these travel well and are convenient for on-the-go. The lid screws back on as well in case your tot doesn't finish his / her snack. The Subscribe & Save price is right for us as well - at barely over $1 per pouch, these are the cheapest snack pouches to be found!

review/text: I love the variety of flavors and fruit/veggie combinations HappyTot offers.  Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.  This flavor seems to be her favorite one though as she'll eat this one or ask me via 'sign' for this pouch more then the others.  With it being organic, all fruits and with great vitamins, I'm thrilled to have this readily available for her to enjoy.

review/text: These pouches are a godsend. I keep a stockpile in the pantry and in the car. Even on days when my two-year-old is feeling particularly picky, he will eat these up without blinking an eye. I love that they are made with organic ingredients with TWO green vegetables -- peas and green beans -- in one pouch, not to mention the pear for fruit. I also like that the salba is included in these pouches for the omega 3s and extra fiber. I had never heard of salba before, but it is a very nutritious grain that I'm glad to have in my son's diet. These pouches are dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free too, so I never had to worry about them affecting my son's food sensitivities, although he has now outgrown most of them. All in all a great product and the flavor is a winner, even with my picky son!

review/text: I needed an alternative to making my own baby food when I found these pouches at Target. It was SUPER easy to warm up the food just by putting the pouch in warm water, then serve to my baby. First I gave it to him using a spoon, but then he was reaching for the pouch so I just gave it to him! He absolutely loved it! I think the novelty of the pouch is so much fun for him. And I was happy that he was getting organic fruits and veggies for the day. Then my 3yo wanted to try it-also bc of the novelty- and she loved it too! I never thought she would eat "baby food" and spinach at that! But in the pouch, it's a great on the go snack or meal and it's healthy and we are all happy.

My son is in Kindergarten and he asks to take these to school for snack time. The pear added to this combo is especially nice since it adds sweetness not found in the veggies - a very nice balance of flavor. Also, the convenience of the pouch is so great, I keep some in my bag, in my car and at the grandparent's house so I know a healthy snack is always available. Highly recommend trying this product and flavor if you are looking to add tasty nutrition to your child's diet.

review/text: I have a four year old, three year old and 18 month old that love these. When I buy them, I have to get very creative with hiding them or they'll eat them all at once. I didn't know what they were and was very health concious with my slightly chubby and younger daughter. One day while on a walk, we saw these at Target so I bought them each one. Ever since we can't even drive past Target without being asked to stop and get them. We do a lot of traveling and I love these. My oldest is very picky, never ate baby food and was always a "junk foodie". This is the 1 healthy thing that goes down with out a fight. In fact she'll ask for more, then fight her little brother for whatever he still has left in the pouch. We do a lot of traveling and I always pack lots of these, quick, easy and healthy snack on hand.

review/text: I ordered this for my 7 month old who LOVES this food. I ordered the 4.22 oz pack of 16, but received 3.5 oz pack of 14. I'm about to return it and ask for the correct product to be sent, but had I not looked closely, I would've just accepted this. Just be careful and make sure you're getting what you ordered. It says it comes from Amazon, but I'm wondering if there's a Happy Baby problem as well...the nutrition facts on the box don't match the nutrition facts on the pouch for the same 3.5oz serving. For example, the box says there's 100% daily value of Vitamin C while the pouch says 27%. I'm wondering if anyone else sees any discrepancies? I would think this would be illegal?

review/summary: Spinach never tasted so good
review/text: My baby doesn't really like spinach, but he does when it's in this format. It was really easy to get him to eat his green leafy vegetables this way, besides the fact that Amazon Mom made it easy to get it on a regular basis

review/text: My 17 month old boy loves these, I don't give him as much of these as I used to since he is now into table food more than purees, but I would mix half of this in his oatmeal in the morning or if we are out, I'll use these as a snack or dessert. They are a good handy pouch to throw in your diaper bag and can sit there for days, if not weeks! I love all the ingredients in this one, baby seems to enjoy it too!

review/summary: Great for Toddlers - this flavor is the most nutritious.
review/text: Our toddler loves this brand. We have tried the other brand of pouches, but she always goes back to these. The flavor and texture is the most favorable to her. We just recently subscribed to this item, because you could not beat the price. Target and our grocery stores have all increased their prices on this line, so they are no longer competitive with Amazon. There is also the bonus convenience factor since our stores were constantly running out of this brand.<br /><br />This flavor is the most nutritious. The pale green pouch comes second, but this combination really has by far the most nutrients than all the other flavors. Toddlers are of course picky and fickle, but our toddler very rarely turns down a "pouch" when all else fails.

review/summary: Multi-benefit pouc
review/text: I love these pouches!  From their ease of use for the baby (who just sucks it out of the pouch), to the easy-carry little-mess take-along value, to the interesting combinations of food.  The combos are perhaps odd, but good.  I love that some have the grains too, as that is what is needed to keep baby fuller longer.  I take at least one everywhere we go.  Needed one for the 6 yr old the other day who was hungry while we were out.  She loved it too.

review/text: My son loves it..so that counts for a lot, he has an easy time getting it out so thats a good thing too.  Be careful when giving it to your child, they may accidentally squeeze it out all over themselves.  Oddly, he really likes this flavor and not others....so its a repeat keeper for us.

review/text: My baby loves this combination. It is relatively high in iron becuase it has spinach and it contains omega 3 from chia seeds. This is the only way I can give my son a green leafy vegetable. It tastes really good. Most baby food that you taste is very bland, this one is really good.

review/text: I absoutly love these things!! And so does my 13 month old.. Perfect for when we are out and about and he gets hungry.. just pop the top open and my son will suck all the goodness out in a matter of minuites!! Then Put the cap back on and he will play with the pouch for quite a while, so dual purpose!<br />Also when he doesnt feel good (which has been qutie a bit because of teething) he will have one of these with no fuss.. So when he wont eat anything else I as least know he is gettin something good in his tummy when he has one of these.

review/text: I love all of the Happy Baby products, but this one is my favorite. Some highlights:<br /><br />- It is packed full of nutrition (and it is organic)<br /><br />- It is very convenient. When my daughter was younger we would mix these with cereal for breakfast. Now it is a great on-the-go snack and she eats directly from the pouch. (She is 16 months old).<br /><br />- My daughter loves it! She always asks for more.<br /><br />- With the subscribe-and-save pricing on Amazon, it's a good deal.

review/text: LOVE THESE!  A MUST HAVE for any mom that has ever left the house with a baby (ha! all of you).  You know what a hassle it can be to feed your little one while on the go.  My kid just sucks the food right out of these like sucking a bottle and he's happily fed in seconds.  Found these by chance when my kid was having a meltdown in the shopping cart at the grocery store.  Fed him right in the cart in under a minute and then we were on our way to finish the shopping trip in peace.  Fast, no messy bowls or utensils to carry around, and my kid loves them!  I've been hooked ever since and don't leave the house without them.  They are great while on long car trips or just running errands around town.  These are little pouches of sanity for any mom that's out and about with her baby.  I love the convenience and my kid loves the taste.  We've been using them for 3 months now, and my kid (now 12 mo) has since refused to eat jarred baby food, but will still suck these down without any complaints.  Try them and I hope they help make your life a little easier too.

review/text: What a great way to get some good nutrients in a baby food. And, in these packages, I cannot tell you how CONVENIENT they are. My daughter likes to eat it right out of the pouch. It is perfect for when we're traveling, or out at the mall or whatever. I can just twist off the top and feed her right there. These were a good price when I got them too! They are a bit more expensive than other baby food, but not that much. Love them.

I love them because they are not messy (my daughter eats them right from the pouch) and you can easily send them to daycare or throw them in a diaper bag. I fall back on these pouches to get some veggies in when she doesn't want to eat what ever other veg I offer her. The ingredient list is simple and short. I feel pretty good about giving these to her, as opposed to other convenience foods.

review/summary: I never thought i'd have to say no to more fruit and veggies!
review/text: My toddler absolutely loves these fruit pouches. We started using them randomly when she was a baby and eating the purees by using the boon spoon which was handy. Then when she was around 18 months i wondered if we could get her to eat more veggies if they were hidden in a fruit puree, after all she eats applesuace like a champion! well much to my delight she devoured these handy portable fruit/veggie pouches as if i had given her candy. She's now 2 1/2 and i have to say that its gotten to the point that I have to regulate how many of these she can have!<br /><br />I keep a box in the car along with an emergency diaper and wipes for those times when you just can't get home fast enough. I really like the bigger size which is more appropriate for my older toddler (and to be honest, i sneak them for myself sometimes).
