review/summary: One of the Best Ever
review/text: We are always searching for low fat, lower calorie snack foods to satisfy our strong snacking needs. These chips are one of the best we have ever found. They are delicious and satisfying and have only 120 calories per serving. They are terribly expensive at our local supermarkets, but  Amazon offers a great price!

review/summary: not too salty and not greasy
review/text: If you're a big potato chip fan, you might find these a little unusual because they are baked.  I personally am not big on the greasiness that most potato chips have, so I actually prefer a baked chip like this.  I also like that these chips have a little less salt than most chips, so the potato flavor really comes through.<br /><br />Let's face it:  a potato chip is never going to be a truly healthy snack.  Even without the extra fat that comes from frying and without the excess salt, a chip is still a bunch of simple carbohydrates.  If you can control yourself and not scarf down bags at a time, however, this is a reasonable indulgence to add to your diet on occasion.

review/summary: Disappointed with Freshness Date
review/text: My husband and I are on Weight Watchers and eat these chips frequently because they are much lower in fat than regular chips. One serving is equal to 2 Weight Watchers points (old point system). It seems that the local stores are always out of them so I ordered through Amazon, but was disappointed in the freshness date. All 15 bags had a freshness date of August 11, which was much too close to the date ordered. The ones I bought at the grocery store in June had a freshness date of October. Although we eat these almost daily, we won't be able to consume 15 bags by August 11, and did not want to be bothered with the hassle of returning them.

review/summary: Best. Baked. Chips. Ever.
review/text: These chips are amazing.  Though baked (i.e., much healthier than regular chips), they have a great and thick crunch to them.  The ingredients list is also pleasantly short:  potatoes, safflower/sunflower oil, and sea salt.  It's rare to find such a high-quality pre-packaged product these days.  Only real negative is price, but buying on Amazon helps in that regard.

review/summary: Buy These Chips -- They're Excellent
review/text: Kettle brand Baked Potato Chips are the best baked chips I have ever eaten.  They are real sliced potatoes (unlike some brands that are "compressed" chips).  They only have 3g of fat and 135mg of sea salt per 1 oz. serving but you can't tell that by their taste.  I have trouble finding them in my local stores, so this is a great way to buy them at an excellent price and keep extra bags on hand.

review/summary: Good flavor without the guilt
review/text: These chips have some of the best barbecue flavor of any chip without all the grease. The texture is a little hard, so sometimes if I get a thick chip it hurts my teeth. But the taste is worth it!  The irregularity of the size and shape of the chips tells you that they're real, not something created in a lab. Plus through Amazon I save almost 50% off the grocery store price!<br /><br />I just wish Amazon carried the baked salt and vinegar flavor. It exists, but is not easy to find. I manage to snag some every few months or so but at almost $4 a bag I can't really stock up the way I could if they were available through Amazon.

review/summary: So delicious!
review/text: Yum, yum, yum! These baked chips are so delicious I keep forgetting they're baked. They taste like thick fried kettle chips. My husband prefers lightly salted chips, and he was thrilled with these. We only have a couple bags left and will order more when they go on sale again. My only complaint is that they're a tad pricey.<br /><br />In case you're wondering how big a 4 oz bag of chips is, the bags are in-between the larger bags you usually find at the supermarket and the small individual serving bags you might get at a sub shop. The nutritional info says each bag contains four servings. Well, of course, that depends on your appetite and restraint, but I'd say it's more like a two-serving bag.  :)<br /><br />I received the chips on August 30, and the expiration date is December 14... So I wouldn't order these if you don't think you'll eat them within a few months. Not a problem in our house!

review/summary: Baked, and not faked!
review/text: Well, baked potato chips have finally gone mainstream after years of being some obscure brand in the store that you bring home and just try to eat while they crumble in your hand and taste bland while they're doing it.<br /><br />Now some of the big national snack companies have "baked" chips, but why are they shaped like hexagons?  Some of those baked chips from national manufacturers look like the result of some mad scientist experiment.<br /><br />Not these!  These look like somebody sliced up potato and baked it in such a way that they still hold their structural integrity when the process is complete.  They're crispy just like traditional potato chips and the seasoning is balanced just right.  Once I get through this box I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: delicious and nutritious!
review/text: Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the "bad stuff" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality. Moreover, in cutting out the fat, almost every snack adds artificial sweeteners, fillers, preservatives, or fat substitutes, nearly all of which can be health concerns for consumers. (For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips. Even better, the BBQ flavor is really great in these chips, ensuring that your snack is really satisfying and truly filling your cravings. I love the fact that more salty snack options are appearing on the market, and I hope that Kettle continues its trend of producing simple, healthy, and absolutely tasty products. I guarantee that chip lovers will not be disappointed by this yummy offering...

review/summary: Weird after-taste for me (try one bag before you buy a box)
review/text: I bought a box of these baked barbeque Kettle brand chips from Amazon in somewhat larger-sized bags, because they came so highly recommended by other reviewers, but I really don't care for them at all (though other people to whom I've offered them  munch through them quite happily, and are pleased to take the rest of the bag home with them when I make the offer).  I can only conclude that individual palates may respond very differently to these particular chips.<br /><br />So, if you've bought a bag of Kettle's baked chips in this particular flavor recently in your local grocery store and found them quite tasty, you'll probably be quite happy with buying these by the box-full from Amazon.<br /><br />However, if you haven't yet tried them, do NOT invest in a multi-bag shipment until you first discover whether or not these particular chips appeal to your particular palate.<br /><br />I'm busy giving away every bag I bought, because I developed a distaste for them after eating the first few chips from the first bag I opened (which I ended up throwing away half-full).  But my dislike for these baked barbecue-flavor chips from Kettle brand (whose other, 'full-fat' chips I've almost always relished) is definitely a minority opinion among my friends and neighbors, so far.

review/text: Considering these are baked, they are very tasty.  They are super crispy and taste like fried goodness, but without the oiliness.  The only bad thing I have to say is that these are supposed to be "lightly" salted but I still found them overly salty (that's why I only gave it 3 stars). I actually found the Baked Salt & Malt Vinegar ones less salty than these. So for those watching their sodium intake or don't like things too salty, then you may want to consider the other flavors.

review/summary: Junk health food
review/text: I hope that one day this snack can reach the point where it is truly healthy and consistently good.<br /><br />A) Claiming to be healthy, at least - last bag I munched on had nutrition info that would in one serving give you the bare minimum healthy cholesterol score (&lt;300) for an entire DAY. Many snacks do this. Like peanuts. Or popcorn. The idea is that since the products are from 'natural' sources, there is less control over the batch. But seriously - less than 300mg per serving? Give me a break. This gives no one trying to help themselves in this area any hope of control. It's almost like writing a blank check. To yourself. To state that your product's single serving falls less than the daily total max recommended is garbage. Read the label.<br /><br />B) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol, and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max'. But the uneven textures and flavors you may get (I consumed, along with family and friends, several cases of these over 2 years or so) don't add up, either. I had burnt tones, teeth-cracking textures at times.<br /><br />I used to love these chips, much as the majority of the reviews portray. I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product, staying healthy, keeping the fat away. But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren. In case you are not sure of where I stand, I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food. You don't miss health until you lose it. These chips will not help your health. They might, at best, make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.<br /><br />A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food'. They cited other causes, as well. I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food. It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Just got around to adding this. My wife purchased a bag of the "Hickory Honey BBQ" at the beginning of July. They were real dental-rattlers, uneven but thick-cut and baked into seriously hard material. The spices were horribly uneven.<br /><br />Lot mark: 12JUL12 090227921:37

review/summary: Makes GREAT Healthy cherry pie filling
review/text: This is a great product.  It's not as finicky as arrowroot powder which if heated too long will not thicken. I made the recipe on the back with some additional changes and it was fabulous!! My kids loved it and it's a great substitute for the very unhealthy cans of cherry pie filling on the store shelfs.<br />Here's what's on the back:<br />QUICK APPLE CHERRY PUDDING (I call my new reciipe "Cherry Pie Filling"- used for cobbler)<br />4 C EDEN organic apple cherry juice (I used Santacruz unpast. OG apple juice)<br />(I also added 1 1/2 Tbl of Dynamic Health Black Cherry Juice Concentrate)<br />4 Tbl EDEN Kuzu dissolved in 5 Tbl cold water<br />Place all in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and stir constatnly until thick.<br />Kuzu is also good for sothing the stomach and strengthening the intestines. this would be a great thing to give your child if he's suffering from a tummy ache.

review/summary: We use this for colds, flu
review/text: I add it to warm apple cider to help fortify the constitution and ward off colds and flu.  It is necessary, I have found, to bring the cider to a low boil, then allow it to simmer.  When the cider is just cooling from a simmer, that is when the kuzu just stirs in beautifully.  Any warmer or cooler, and the kuzu powder clumps.  If anyone has any more precise directions on how to avoid clumping, I would really appreciate them.  Because, every so often, I miss.  But this is still great for what we use it for.

They didn't taste like salted caramel, just a pure sweet caramel flavor. They were about 2 bites each, and were absolutely perfect with a cup of hot cocoa after a rough day.<br />It's a shame they aren't available at the same price, they would be worth buying in bulk next time.

review/summary: Great new assortment! :)
review/text: This is a great assortment, and to me a better choice than the standard assortment - which is often 40% chocolate and 30% grape. This would be perfect with a few Oranges thrown in as well (instead of the chocolate!), but the Strawberry is great, the Lemon-Lime is also very nice, and the Blue raspberry is great too. You can usually count on 5 or 6 of the raspberries (red and blue, each)in the regular assortment but you only get the blue ones here. The watermelon is nice, and kids seem to really enjoy it as well. The regular box is Chocolate, Grape, Cherry, Orange, Raspberry (red) and another flavor, which is often Raspberry (blue).<br /><br />If you go through Tootsie Pops regularly or semi-regularly, this box is a treat not only because you don't get stuck with such an abundance of chocolate and grape, but because the Lemon Line, Watermelon, Strawberry flavors are great new additions (and you no longer have to fight with the kids over the too few Blue Raspberries).

Even though I still do like every flavor of tootsie pop that's available, I don't mind this standard assortment, but I was definitely caught off guard when what I received did not match what I had ordered.  After sending in my complaint, they did issue me a refund so that was a nice gesture.

My heart is set on these flavors, they are far more superior to the "regular" flavors that I usually throw away (orange, grape). I love the strawberry and watermelon the most, they are both sweet and fruity. I also enjoy having chocolate and cherry, the "classic flavors" and blue raspberry a "fun flavor" in this box. Try it out and i'm sure you will love it too!

review/text: Okay, I will admit I tasted this right off the bar and it was really, really good. I really think this is one of the best tasting chocolates for cooking I have come across. It melts easily and you can use it to create such wonderful chocolate dishes. A little goes a long way because the taste is so rich. It is satisfying and puts you on a whole new level if you are most familiar with run of the mill type chocolate brands (some of the more mass produced brands). I absolutely love the fact that the ingredients list is so simple: cacao beans; sugar; cocoa butter; non-GMO soy lecithin; whole vanilla beans. This really is an amazing artisan chocolate experience and I am glad I had it. Will definitely be purchasing these in the future as well - can't wait to test out some new recipes using it!

review/summary: SO DELICIOUS YOU WON'T GET TO BAKING WITH IT
review/text: If you're a choco-holic you probably like everything that comes your way, like Hersheys, or even lesser brands.  As long as it's chocolate, it's good.<br /><br />But then we had the pleasure of having a German girl come to visit us, and she brought some of the "real" stuff from her country, and it just strikes you how much better the higher quality stuff is.  I'm not denigrating Hershey's or Nestles or whatever--all right, I am, though I still like those brands too.  But try this chocolate, and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />It's a semi-sweet bar and therefore made for cooking, so it's not going to taste as sweet as normal chocolate you get in this country, but trust me: you'll probably never get to cooking with it.  We handed some out to friends to show them the difference, and ate the rest ourselves.<br /><br />It's pricey (we paid about $16) but you get six bars for it.  The pieces are a bit big, so the bar goes pretty fast.<br /><br />But taste it: it's sweet, but the most amazing quality is its RICHNESS.  It has a very full quality to it--there are three real sensations with most food: the first taste when you bite it, then the "mouthful" taste, then the lasting or after-taste as it disappears down your gullet--and all of these tastes are of CHOCOLATE.  Not sugar, not additives..nothing but full, rich CHOCOLATE.<br /><br />It's really wonderful.  There's nothing quite like it.

I would if I could, though. Everything about it is perfect--complex flavor, smooth texture, melts well...it's great. For a real treat, try chopping some up and whisking it into about a cup of gently warmed milk, for a rich hot cocoa similar to the "drinking chocolate" you can get at some cafes. Great stuff.

review/summary: Luscious
review/text: This is a deep, rich, luscious chocolate.  I intend to use it for frosting, so I had to hide a few of my six bars because otherwise they would all be gone by now.  I made the mistake of offering samples to family and friends.<br /><br />Let it melt in your mouth.  Very smooth.<br /><br />It supposedly has a citrus undertone, but I did not detect it and no one else mentioned it.  It must be very subtle.<br /><br />My only "complaint" is that it is scored into relatively large pieces that are too big and awkwardly shaped for eating from the bar.  Of course, it could be broken into smaller pieces, but . . . . somehow that never happens and I always eat the large piece I broke off.  No will power.  And friends and family each got a bigger piece than my chocolate greed would normally have allowed.  Okay, so that's my fault and not the manufacturer's.<br /><br />I might also point out that this is semisweet chocolate.  So there is a light touch of sweetness, including a very slight honey undertone.  It is my favorite semisweet, but that makes this only my second most favorite eating chocolate, as I usually reach for bittersweet -- my favorite chocolate for munching is Ghiradelli Bittersweet 60% Cocoa Chips (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KNFBJC">Ghirardelli Chocolate 60% Cacao Bittersweet Baking Chips, 11.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>).  We usually associate cocoa percentages with sweetness (62% cocoa for the Scharffen Berger semisweet), but semisweet chocolate in general is just a bit sweeter than bittersweet.<br /><br />Here's another wonderful use for the Scharffen Berger semisweet:  try heating some of the milk and melting some of the chocolate in it.  Oh, my gosh!  You'll never use hot chocolate powder mix again.

review/summary: Beats my old favorite for eating out of hand
review/text: I jumped at the opportunity to test Scharffen Berger chocolate, as I was interested in comparing it to my go-to chocolates, which are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H240JS">Ghirardelli 60%</a> for eating and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IDLKZC">Callebaut Dark 60%</a> for baking. My original plan was to try three bars as eating chocolate and three in baking.<br /><br />Ahem. Well, I didn't get around to the baking part. This is a fantastic chocolate for eating out of hand, though! It's very creamy and has a very faint undertone of cherry--not obtrusive, just enough to deepen the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />These bars are only 3 ounces (as compared to the 4-ounce bars that Ghirardelli makes). They are scored in half and then each half is scored diagonally into quarters, sorta like your mom used to cut up the grilled cheese sandwiches when she wanted you to eat slower.<br /><br />I shared quite a bit of this chocolate with other folks, and even the milk chocolate lovers agreed that it's a voluptuous taste treat. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Holds Up Well in Cooking
review/text: I love dark chocolate...the darker, the better. I didn't think that I would particularly care for this chocolate since it's only 62%, but I thought it was about "goldilocks", just right. As just a stand-alone chocolate bar, it was delicious (in fact, my 2 1/2 year old snuck some behind my back, the little ninja). But, in recipes, it was even more delicious! I made two recipes with it (both from Scharffen Berger's website): regular chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal chocolate chunk bars. With the cookies, the chocolate melted just right; with the bars, the chocolate stood up to the heat and stayed in chunk form. The pack of 6 was plenty to do 2 recipes, eat 1 1/2 just by themselves, and have 1 1/2 left over.<br /><br />Yes, they are a little pricey - but you get what you pay for with the cheaper chocolate, in my opinion. A very good product, worth the price.

review/summary: Great after-dinner chocolate
review/text: Our family usually has a few pieces of semi-sweet dark chocolate after dinner for our dessert. It's a great way to top off a good meal, leaves a nice sweet taste in our mouth without going crazy with calories like most desserts would.<br /><br />Our typical go-to brand is Trader Joes, with a few international brands thrown in for variety. I'd never heard of Scharffen Berger, so was interested to try it.<br /><br />Fortunately, we had a family get-together the weekend these arrived, so I was able to let 7 people try it. Everyone liked the consistency of the bar - it's got a good "snap" when you break off a chunk. The smell is very chocolately with no floral or weird after tones. Taste to me is a nice blend of chocolate with a rich hint of cream, and not too sweet - I agree with their description of honey rather than sugar. My brother said it was a great accompaniment to the red wine he was drinking. My mother said it was a bit hard for her and kind of difficult to bite (she has partial dentures), but enjoyed the flavor. My sister-in-law doesn't like extremely sweet desserts, and she really loved this chocolate, saying the flavor was near-perfect to her. My husband and nephews thought it wasn't sweet enough and had a bitter aftertaste, but my husband really liked the flavor when I shaved some into his cappuccino the next morning.<br /><br />If you really like the taste of cacao, and are more of a fan of dark than light chocolates, I think you'll enjoy this blend. As a garnish and for baking, this would be great, as it has a straightforward chocolate taste without any added flavorings.

review/summary: Not For Everyone
review/text: Since there were six bars in this review package I gave half of them to the front office where I work and asked what they thought. A surprising number -- more than half -- said things like "Icky", "Too Bitter for Semi-Sweet", "Weird after taste".  Some thought it was OK, but not great. But the very few who liked it (including me) liked it a lot.  It has a strong chocolate taste, but is far more bitter than most 62% Cacao dark bars.  It has a waxy quality, but seems all natural when you read the ingredient list. It also appears to be lower calorie than other bars of the same Cacao content.  Bottom line is this - you can beat the price and taste at Trader Joes, so for most it's not worth going out of your way for, but the unique blend of flavors will make it something you are unlikely to be ambivilant about. You'll either love it or hate it, so try it and see where you fall. If you do not like true chocolate flavor (in other words, you prefer Cacao butter and cream, milk chocolate, over dark) don't bother with this. If you do, this bar is more bitter than sweet.

This semisweet offering has a hint of citrus and honey that supports but does not overpower the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Any good cook will tell you that her Coq au Vin is only as good as her red wine, and her chocolate pie only as good as her chocolate.<br /><br />Scharffen Berger chocolate is for cooks who spend time with their cuisine and deserve good ingredients.<br /><br />And it's for cooks like me who nibble.

I have typically gone even darker with my chocolate (70% Valrhona or even the 85% Green & Black's) and enjoy pretty much anything chocolate from the darkest to a simple Hershey's Kiss.  This Semisweet offering really grabbed my attention with its smooth consistency and great flavor.  I would guess chocolate preference - like coffee, wine or many other things - is subjective, but to my mind there is nothing NOT to like about this bar.  I can't guarantee it will be, as my 10-year old daughter said, "The best chocolate I have ever tasted", but I'm pretty sure you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: This is Really Chocolate of the Best Type
review/text: Disclaimer First:  I am a chocolate hog of the first order and just love the stuff regardless of its brand name.  Scharffen Berger (SB) is without a doubt the best chocolate I have ever eaten at anytime any where.  I especially love the semisweet variety and am eating some right now.  Some brands of semisweet are just bitter and without much chocolate taste but not SB's.  The bitterness did not rear its head on the bars I ate and I would say that the odds of bitterness are diminished significantly with their quality controls.  I opened one bar and peeled small curls onto French Vanilla ice cream and that was one fine sundae.  A baking pan full of SB Brownies were consumed in one half the time of a normal serving.  I guess I'm not the only hog around here.  There may be other brands available that are better but after many years of eating this tasters delight none is better than Scharffen Bergers.  Thanks for the taste!

review/summary: A decadent treat
review/text: I love dark chocolate and this was a wonderful treat. I think this 62% bar is a perfect balance of a rich chocolaty taste that retains just enough sweetness to be satisfying but not overwhelming. What puts this bar at five stars for me is the creaminess. I know dark chocolate will never have the smooth texture of milk chocolate, I've found many brands can be brittle, which ruins the sensual experience. I really enjoyed having a smooth, creamy dark chocolate. I will keep my eye out for this brand in the future, I think it's my new favorite.<br /><br />As an addition, currently amazon doesn't list ingredients, so I thought I would throw those out there just in case anyone needs that information. The only allergen statement is that this is "a gluten free confection."<br /><br />cacao beans, sugar, cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin, whole vanilla beans

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate
review/text: Scharffen Berger's Semi-Sweet 62% Cacao chocolates bars are, simply put, delicious. They are very rich, very flavorful, and are perfectly semi-sweet--not at all bitter, smooth rather than sharp, with a perfect, light amount of sweetness. I used mine for hot chocolate (absolutely incredible, by the way), crumbled over homemade parfaits, melted in rooibos, chai, and mint teas, melted and marbled into yellow cake, broken up in lieu of chocolate chips, and of course, eaten straight as a dessert. I was extremely pleased that it was good on its own, and as an ingredient. I know that they're a little pricier than your average bar, but they're worth it (on top of the quality, the bar is almost double the width of an average Hershey bar.) Whether you're looking for a baking ingredient, a garnish, something to drink, or just something to eat, Scharffen Berger's chocolate fills each purpose.

review/summary: Good Chocolate!
review/text: A nice semisweet bar of chocolate.  Texture is good--both out of the fridge and at room temperature.  I found the citrus/honey overtones a bit much to finish an entire bar by itself, but found this bar (especially when pulled from the fridge) to be the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of ice cream (especially soft chocolate or vanilla).  I suspect it would also do very nicely on top of cheesecake or similar desserts.

review/summary: AMERICAN MADE CHOCOLATE GOOD FOR EATING AND BAKING
review/text: I love chocolate, and  cannot bring myself to eat  low-end chocolate anymore. A  Hershey bar tastes  like plastic and sugar to me, and I'd never  bake with most  bagged  so-called chocolate chips. I will eat a high- end milk chocolate, but usually prefer semi-sweet.<br />Somehow, I had never gotten around to trying Scharffen Berger, and I'm pleased to say I really liked it.<br /><br />I ate the first bar by itself over the course  of a few days. The flavor is a nice balance of bitter and sweet, with a touch of fruity acidity. The texture is firm and crisp,  with a smooth and quick melt in your mouth.<br /><br />Next I tried it in chocolate chip cookies- again, nice flavor and texure when baked.<br />Third test was brownies- this chocolate gave the brownies a nice well-rounded chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As nice as it was in the cookies , at this price I'd probably reserve this for more  fancy chocolate-centric desserts.<br />As a stand alone treat, it's very nice.  In addition to the taste, darker chocolate can be healthy, and this even has a bit of fiber in it.

review/text: This is wonderful semi-sweet chocolate.<br /><br />I usually favor dark chocolate, and this isn't as dark as I'd usually get, but I find this really a treat.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It's not too sugary sweet, like US chocolates tend to be.<br />2. The texture is good. Some chocolates seem a bit waxy to me, and this did, just a bit, on first taste, but that sense immediately went away.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Maybe the slight waxiness, but it's so slight that it's not enough to even lower this to four stars.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this chocolate and will get it again.

review/summary: Made in America and made to please the Continental palate
review/text: Scharffen Berger's Made-In-America lightweight bar - 3 very flat ounces - delivers a highly edible payload with its 62% cacao. The wrapping alone accounts for a fair amount of the total weight. The flavor is as dense as an Arizona dust storm without being as harsh, although my Hershey-bred palate pleads for a smidgen more sugar.  The paraffin-free texture is not exactly creamy; while it does not readily melt on the tongue, neither is it gritty like some other bars.  It grates quite nicely with a microplane grater and also shaves fairly well, but doing so is made awkward by the bar's wispiness.  While I do find this is suitable for eating as is,  I think this bar would perform best as a special embellishment, such as a drizzle over warm banana bread or shaved as a topper for pots de creme.

review/summary: oh my, oh my, oh my...
review/text: Oh bliss, mmm, oh, mmm, oh, excuse me!  Was I talking with my mouth full? I have received a package of Scharffen Berger Semisweet Chocolate in the mail to review, and it is both my favorite type of eating and baking chocolate (of most brands).<br /><br />The Scharffen Berger does not disappoint. It bakes beautifully when chopped into chunks and used in my go-to cookie and scone recipes. The chocolate has lovely gooey melty flops when you bite into the chunks (I'm eating a cookie right now), and the chocolate is a glorious, subtle, hits-you-slowly essence. It's the sophisticated version of Mom's cookies. In scones, the chocolate is perfect with raspberry jam.<br /><br />I'd happily make my Death By Chocolate Cake  - or any other pure chocolate recipe - with these stellar bars. They really have an after dinner quality to them.<br /><br />So why am I eating the other half of a leftover bar in the afternoon? Well, as I said, Semisweet is my favorite kind of chocolate and Scharffen Berger does not disappoint! A perfect treat with a cup of coffee.

review/summary: A an excellent gourmet cooking chocolate
review/text: This chocolate is an intense semisweet. It is similar to Ghirardelli's but somewhat less sweet, and far superior to the Baker's chocolate you find in supermarkets.  It seems primarily intended for baking, but it comes in thin bars that can also be eaten. The bars weigh 3 ounces each. They are hatched in a design of large, differently sized triangles that's attractive and facilitates breaking off pieces. However, the triangles do not seem to represent any specific weight, therefore are not useful for measurement. That's absolutely the only flaw I can find in this chocolate.

review/summary: Oh, this is good!!!
review/text: I've never tried this brand of chocolate before. I prefer semi-sweet so this was a real treat to be able to try it out. Everyone's taste is a little different so let me describe the flavor as very close to Nestle's Semi-sweet morsels used in chocolate chip cookies. Scharffen Berger is just a little bit sweeter (not quite the sour bite I'm used to).<br /><br />I did not taste the honey but I did have an aftertaste of citrus. Its hard to describe. Its like if you eat a fresh ripe strawberry, after a few chews you get a little twang after you notice the sweetness.<br /><br />Good chocolate is expensive so I think the price is reasonable at around $3 per 3 ounce bar. Although there is a cross-cut design on the top, it does not help if you want to make specific sized pieces.

review/text: This a fine premium chocolate. The bars break cleanly along the lines without a lot of slivers or crumbs. The flavor is some of the best I've tasted with no nasty tastes or aftertastes. It has an nice mouth feel. I haven't used it for cooking yet so I can't comment on that.<br /><br />So why not five stars? Unlike many premium chocolate companies like Green & Black and Divine, Scharffen Berger offers no products that are certified Fair Trade or organic. I prefer to support companies dedicated to providing the growers a better price through a certified Fair Trade or similar program, and I am willing to spend more for it. So for my chocolate cravings, I will choose G&B, Divine, or even Newman's Own.

I would rate this over godiva or lindt.  especially if you enjoy a soft melt-in-your-mouth texture.  while there is a risk of melting (4 stars), i've given it as gifts more than once - they are good.

I thought the teabags were defective, but they just have a pull-through thing you do...not bad once you figure it out.  While most black teas are either a toasted/mild, fresh-wood/brisk, or dull/old-leaf this actually has an aromatic, almost floral top-note on a mild woody base.  Very nice as is, without other flavors dumped into it.  The steeping goes well, especially for a bag.  Makes a good light tea, or a flavor to break up your routine.

I follow Weight Watchers and these are only 4 points, and they're very tasty and satisfying. I appreciate that they deliver a lot of the dietary fiber I need each day, too. The reason I did not give this purchase 5 stars is that for some reason I was given an uneven assortment of bars that was not packaged in a sealed box. I got MOSTLY the expresso chip, which turns out to be my LEAST favorite flavor in the assortment. There were 2 each of the orange/cranberry, brownie, and cinnamon/raisin, and banana, and I did not get ANY of the Lemon/Ginger. There were 8 expresso chip bars!! NOT what I expected -- I should have gotten a more even assortment.

review/summary: Chintzy cheese
review/text: I am a huge fan of Parmigiano Reggiano after wxpweiwncing this dairy wonder in England in its finest three-year-old state.  I was delighted to find this cheese offered by igourmet and ordered it for a friend for Christnma along with an Argentine "reggiano" and a collection of SPanish cheeses.  The latter are pictured in a black gift pack in their listing, but arrived in a foam cooler.  I had to find a suitable presentation package.  WHile the quality of the Spanush cheeses was excellent, The description of the Argentine product was really lacking.  It in no way resembled Italian PR or grana padano, but rather a nice Gruyere with a nutty and pleasant flavor very suitable for a fondue.  It was not a hard grating cheese as expected, eityher.  As for the much anticipated very old Parmigianno Reggiano, it was poorly cut with a large proportion of rind.  For $25.00 a pound, they could have done a LOT better!  It was otherwise the superb product I had so enjoyed in England.  I would add that theeir aged Gouda bears little resemblance in the photo to what I had in ENgland- that cheese was deep amber, waxy in consistency and very intensely aromatic and fruity/ketotic in flavor.  Overall, I was disappointed with my purchase, rating the experience a very mediocre one.

review/summary: Brand-new product gets thumbs up from family!
review/text: This is a brand-new pasta variety from Tinkyada, and it's wonderful!  We have pasta, always Tinkyada, at least once a week, so I have the cooking method down, and it's dependably al dente.  This pasta is much whiter in color than their brown-rice pastas, a little too white to look like glutenous pastas (which may be good).  As for the taste and all-important texture...A+!  My hubby was very complimentary and he and the kids ate evey scrap of the spaghetti.  Tinkyada is very good with gluten-free pastas, and this one is their best yet.  One thing I will say is that you REALLY need to rinse this pasta before serving, because it does make the water it's cooked in very gluey and sticky.  I don't usually rinse the other Tinkyada pastas, but I know some people rinse all of them.

review/summary: White Rice Spaghetti
review/text: I have to say first off that I love Tinkyada products. But I accidentally bought the white rice spaghetti instead of the brown rice spaghetti and I found a product I don't like from Tinkyada. My son (7) and I have Celiac's sprue and so eat gluten free everything. My son isn't usually picky about his gluten free food, but he won't eat the white rice noodles at all. I will eat them, but I definitely prefer the brown rice ones over these.

review/summary: HEY - GREAT STUFF!
review/text: THIS STUFF ROCKS! Meaning it is wonderful. Cook up just like regular wheat pasta. Its whiter - doesn't have the familiar mild yellow tinge of wheat pasta - but for some reason this is appealing / looks I don't know, "cleaner" somehow. The taste is similar to rice, but not that you'd notice (and that's not bad) it takes on the flavor of whatever you put on it / just like regular pasta. NOT mushy, sticky or goopy - unless you over cook it (just like wheat)...takes about 10-20 minute on a high boil to ready to eat. It is not enriched pasta (FYI) so the nutrition is that of plain white rice (but excellent also in the nothing is added) its all natural, just unenriched plain white rice and water. I've used this actually to make rice pudding and pasta salads. Just cook it up and put it in the food processor with either honey or sugar or on another occaision some tuna and celery - green peas/mayo - and one whirr - Bam you have deli style pasta salad! Use your imagination with this. I know, you're thinking - but 12 of them? Hey, once you start eating this you'll realize it goes fast (for a person who cannot have other grains). I only wish the company would make this white rice pasta in all the other shapes/types that they do in the brown pastas. [...] So please, if you like this kind please contact them as ask as I have for that to happen. They say they follow consumer demand - so lets DEMAND macaroni, linguini and all the rest too! The company that makes this is in Toronto, Canada. Im very very pleased with this product and grab a large fistfull of this several times a week - and I enjoy!

review/summary: Hard to tell the difference...
review/text: This is an excellent product if you have sworn off grains, I follow the Perfect Health Diet and rice is allowed as a starch, but only white rice so his product fits the bill perfectly. A few tips.. use lots of water when cooking double what they say, I use a huge pot and wash in cold water quickly after straining. Put your sauce in a saute pan and heat, add the spaghetti and toss being careful not to over cook. I have found leftovers don't reheat well, so I only cook what I need. It is hard to tell the difference of the finished product from a wheat pasta, you may detect a slight difference in texture.

review/summary: These were disgusting
review/text: We did not like these at all.  The water was so thick, and it was too hard to get the noodles to cook properly.  They wanted to stick together.  If you have already purchased these, plan to eat right after cooking and try to use a much larger pot than you would expect. I've used the brown rice pasta before, and would recommend those instead.

review/summary: Great pasta!
review/text: My husband and I eat this pasta because we follow (pretty much) the blood type diet which means we need gluten free foods.  This pasta is fabulous and a great deal for the amount you get.  One tip I learned from another review-rinse after cooking to get the gummy film off of the pasta-other than that-enjoy!

review/text: This pasta has a nice taste, but is so starchy that it makes a mess when you<br />cook it.  I much prefer the brown rice pasta,  cause it cooks better and<br />retains it's shape much better.

review/summary: Terrible!
review/text: This is the worst gluten-free pasta I've ever cooked.  I have a pot of mushy "spaghetti."  The package actually claims it's "not mushy!"  That's funny...  I've been cooking pasta for 30 years, and this is a terrible product.  Where the glowing comments are coming from, I don't know.  I bought this at the grocery store. I'm going back to my faithful brand now, Jovial.  I can only buy it here on Amazon or sometimes at Whole Foods.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Jovial-Organic-Spaghetti-12-Ounce-Packages/dp/B0049IT94M/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1342132011&sr=1-1&keywords=jovial+gluten+free+pasta
