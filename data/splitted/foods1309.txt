review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but purchased this flavor for my husband. He is normally a "bold" taste coffee drinker, but says that this is now his favorite. He says it is not too strong and it's not too weak. It's just a nice "medium" blend of flavor. Because he was such a bold coffee drinker prior, I stocked up. I keep trying to get him to drink the bold stock and he only says: "Do we have any more of that Caribou?". Well, looks like I'll be ordering much more of his new favorite coffee soon!

review/text: I like to say my taste buds require a lot of flavoring so it might not be the norm. When I first ordered it I was hoping it would have a nice full taste, and not, for a lack of a better word, diluted flavor.  I was not disappointed. Not to say this tasted burnt like some coffee.  I'm really enjoying it and will order some more when the time comes.

review/summary: Very sweet for natural ketchup
review/text: I hate that most ketchups have high fuctose korn syrup, so I am always on the lookout for the next natural ketchup to try.  So far the only natural ones that I have tried are Muir glen, which is delicious and out of this world.  But I like to change things up so I purchased tree of life ketchup, I was not impressed.  WAY WAY too sweet, sweeter tasting then the ones with high fuctose in them.  I was not impressed by this ketchup but I give it two stars for it being all natural and healthier then your average commercial brand of ketchup.  So I am going to give some other brands a try but so far my favorite would have to be muir glen.  If you dont mind a very sweet ketchup then tree of life is the ketchup for you.

review/summary: Amazing flavor. No aftertaste. :) Not too sweet. Perfect.
review/text: I have tried almost all of the flavors amd the Banana is the best. It is not oversweet, has none of that fake banana aftertaste and is filling but not bloating. It is better than the other 2 flavors by far and I don't usuauly like banana as a shake that much, but this flavor is really outstanding. I do not say this lightly as I usually base most of my initial pruchases like this on amazon by the reviews comments. My advice, try this.<br /><br />I would caution that the best thing to do is by from a fresh source. I did go buy and try the flavors out at like vitamine shoppe a while back and they were good, but once i got them from amazon which must have a high turnover rate, the flavors were much better. Just be sure to shake them up well before consuming.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.<br /><br />I love the banan\na.<br /><br />Erich

review/summary: Lean Body Bananas and Cream Shake
review/text: I bought a couple of Lean Body Shakes, Bananas and Cream and Strawberries and Cream.  I had shoulder surgery 5 months ago and have just finished rehab.  I am a truck driver.  While going through rehab, I needed a protein drink that helps muscle repair and loads me up with protein.  And being on the road as a truck driver now, I needed to have a good protein drink for a quick meal that provided the protein and the nutrients I don't get with regular meals on the road.  These shakes are awesome.  I'm ordering a couple cases through Amazon now to see how that works out.  I've tried various protein shakes, powder and liquid, over the years and Lean Body is by far the best tasting I ever had.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Too sweet for me. And I LOVE sucralose.
review/text: This is my first go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036F576I">Labrada Nutrition Lean Body Ready to Drink, Bananas and Cream, 17-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a>. I've tried Muscle Milk (not the light variety, since it has more carbs) and even the Costco brand protein drink. Save for the Costco stuff, I'm baffled why the recipes for these meal replacement drinks are so freaking sweet. Lookit, I love sucralose (Splenda), and I mean LOVE. I'll add anywhere from 5 to 22 packets of Splenda to my coffee (I hate the taste of coffee). I make sure to keep a giant Costco-size bag of Splenda always in stock at home, and many of my jacket pockets have packets of Splenda stuffed in them in case I go somewhere that doesn't offer it as sweetener. I even have a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W91SZA">The SPLENDA World of Sweetness: Recipes for Homemade Desserts and Delicious Drinks</a> (gifted because: see above). So yeah, me and Splenda are forever bonded. Given all that, you'd think the sweetness of Labrada's Lean Body RTD Bananas and Cream would be to me what ice is to water, buuuuut no. The sweetness is so overpowering and cloying that I have to water the drink down before consuming it. The bonus of doing of that, though, means my 12 bottles turn into 24, essentially. If I buy the stuff again, it'll be because I didn't have time to go to Costco to get their meal replacement drink.

review/text: The banana flavor lean body has a great taste! It doesnt have the watered down nutri-sweet taste to it either. I have been very satisfied with the lean body ready to go shakes so far although I havent yet tried all the flavors. My husband usually drinks the pure protien ready to go shakes and he recently got a hold of mine and now he wants me to buy the lean body ones for him because they taste so much better. I told him he cant because they are more expensive then his but I dont think he's going to let me get away with it!

review/text: I bought Blue Sky Organic Black Cherry pop at a local health store along with their orange.  While I found the orange to taste a bit flat and un-orange, the black cherry was outstanding!  Just the right amount of sweet, not over powering at all.  I do not like my drinks to taste like they are full of high fructose corn syrup.  The cane juice gives it the taste it needs and a healthful reprieve from HFC.  The cherry flavor was decently bold and very refreshing.  I love that Amazon has this pop for sale and as an option for repete orders because I can't afford to buy it from the health store too often!

review/summary: Delicious Replacement to Callard and Boser LIcorice Toffee
review/text: Back in the 1960's my Dad, who had a notorius sweet tooth used to bring home delicious individually wrapped licorice toffee in a slim cardboard box.  My sisters and I would snitch these taste gems if he were so careless to leave the box out on the counter unguarded.  These green and black wrapped treats were the best licorice toffee I had ever sampled.  Years (decades) later, wanting to share the same treat with my children, I went on the net to find my childhood taste treat, only to learn that Callard and Boser went out of business!  My search then began for a suitable quality replacement, and although I have found several worthy competitors, this product, Walkers Royal Toffees, is very close to the deliciousness of Callard and Boser's toffee.  This is a 5.5 pound bag, so there is plenty to go around.  They make a great appetizer treat at social gatherings like birthdays, graduations, and even marriages.  They will go fast, as they are so good, so I recommend buying two bags and saving some extra for the after party wind-down.  Absolutely delicious taste treat.<br /><br />kone

What I got when I ordered the 5.5 pound bag from Amazon were hard as a rock,  pull-your-teeth-out chewy.  The flavor was still great, but they obviously were either over cooked or old.  If anyone knows where to get the soft Walkers Toffees that don't stick to your teeth, let me know.  I love ordering from Amazon.  It's quick, easy, and convenient.  Occassionally I don't get exactly what I want, but returning products is pretty painless. I did not return the toffees as everyone else loved them tough and chewy.

review/text: This is the third tripe product I have reviewed. My dog and I are taking K9 Nose Work classes. We like to use stinky treats for training and competition. Pet Kind Green Lamb Tripe w/ Chicken Treats - 6 oz are moderately stinky  but not sickeningly stinky like some tripe treats we have sniffed out. They are stinky enough that my dog finds to be a worthwhile reward. The strips are thin and very easy to break in to small pieces. They do not crumble which is a good thing because we don't want to leave a trail of odor behind us. The odor could be distracting to other dogs in the class. Pet Kind Green Lamb Tripe w/ Chicken Treats - 6 oz may not be stinky enough for every nose, but for us they are an excellent choice.

This treat was no different. However, to my surprise, my sister's dog also goes crazy for this stuff. He is extremely picky with treats and only seems to like certain kinds. But so far so good with my our dogs.

But I like mine with milk and cream.<br /><br />Check out Seitenbacher Muesli #1 Natural Body Power with European Hazelnuts, also on Amazon.  The Hazelnuts are so good.  And the apple slices have a great texture.

review/summary: It was only the RANCID smell.
review/text: We repeatedly tried Muesli # 11 but it smelled (and tasted) rancid. In response to our complaint, the US distributor confirmed that the smell is due to a problem with an unrefined sunflower oil that was used when toasting: Quote "Now there should not be anything you smell upon opening a bag of the muesli.  If you tasted it, even with the smell, you would see<br />that nothing tasted wrong, old or rancid. It was only the smell." Unquote.

review/summary: No real cinnamon in these chips
review/text: I wish I'd known the ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips when I bought these (the ingredient list was not part of the product description as the time of this review).  There's no real cinnamon in them.  I had been using King Arthur's mini cinnamon chips previously (ingredients: sugar, palm oil, cinnamon, nonfat dry milk, soy lecithin) and was happy with them, but I was curious about Hershey's chips.  They were cheaper than King Arthur's, and I'd heard people rave about the Hershey's cinnamon chips.<br /><br />Well, curiosity killed the cat.  Now I have a lot of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I don't want to use in my baked goods.....  I might end up using them if I'm baking something to give away where the person eating it won't know I made it.  I used my King Arthur chips in Cinnamon Chip Bread, great results, but when I switched to Hershey's, the chips kinda melt and get mixed a little with the bread dough, and that turned my bread YELLOW.  Artificial colors are on the ingredient list before the natural & artificial flavor.... that's a lot of  artificial color!  I usually don't care about artificial ingredients, I'm a junk food addict who drools at the sight of bright orange Doritos, but the yellow bread the Hershey's cinnamon chips made was displeasing.  Not to mention the flavor of the bread, which was negatively affected by the Hershey's chips.  Didn't have that same sweet cinnamon flavor that the King Arthur chips give.<br /><br />Why'd I give this product 3 stars instead of 1 star?  My husband didn't care about the changes in the bread, he'll eat anything I turn my nose up at, so he'll probably end up eating stuff I make for him with the Hershey's cinnamon chips.  Hopefully my bags of chips won't go to waste, but I won't buy Hershey's cinnamon chips again.<br /><br />Ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips:<br />Sugar; nonfat milk; partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (palm kernel and soybean oil); palm kernel oil; contains 2% or less of: cornstarch; artificial colors (Yellow 6 Lake; Yellow 5 Lake; Blue 2 Lake); natural and artificial flavor; salt; palm oil; soy lecithin.

review/text: I looked for these in every grocery store within a 25 mile radius, since I needed them for a pumpkin spice scone. I purchased them in the past when I lived on the other side of the country, but absolutely could not find them in my new area. These cinnamon chips add another layer of flavor in your baking. They're also quite nice when eaten out of hand. Mixing them in an oatmeal raisin cookie batter is another way I like these. They give a little cinnamon burst to your baking.

review/text: Boy are these a surprising find!  I picked up a bag of these at Christmas when they were marked down, not having any idea what I would do with them but since they were almost free, well....  Anyway, you HAVE to try the oatmeal cinnamon cookie recipe on the back.  It is totally awesome!  They make a zillion, literally.  You can bake a batch for your family and still have enough to give to a neighbor.  They are NOT those hard, nasty, crumby crunchy things either.  Not by a long shot.  They're just so soft and chewy, moist, ahhh.  You gotta LOVE Hershey!  This is the one weird item that we, the forgotten people in Ohio, can get at the grocery on a regular basis, depending on where you shop.<br /><br />However, if you're looking to make something like cinnamon bread, these are not your guys.  They won't produce that thick line of cinnamon that the recipes require, but are more made for accents to holiday items, cookies and cupcakes.  Great, great item, a nice change from chocolate.  Highly recommend!

review/text: I purchased this exact item, 6 Pack Hershey's Cinnamon Chips on Oct. 26, 2011, and the price was $15.43. Today, November 16, 2011, exactly 3 weeks later, I thought I would purchase more for the upcoming holidays only to find the price has been marked up to $27.95. This is ABSOLUTE ROBBERY. You mean to tell me they almost DOUBLED in price in a 3 week span? And I'm supposed to believe the holidays coming had nothing to do with it? And in a time when people do good just to get by... While I highly recommend the product(I myself use them to make Pumpkin muffins), I cannot condone this sort of business practice. If I am to purchase this item again on here you can believe it will NOT be until the price has returned to what it was 3 weeks ago. I am only giving one star to reflect my disgust with the company, not the product. Shame on you Amazon.

review/text: For the amount of time it takes to brew, this kit the beer is completely worth it. My beer turned out pretty good, but I've had better home brews from more ingredient heavy brews.<br /><br />The Malt both crystal and liquid included in this kit was incredibly easy to mix, and the total brewing time took me about an hour. The fermenting stage for this beer was incredibly quick, and I had my first drinkable beer about 10 days later (record time for me). I was wary of the carbonation drops that came with this kit as I'm used to using priming sugar but tried them out anyways. They were fantastic, sediment stuck to the bottom like a champ and the beer was perfectly carbonated. I could almost drink these brews straight from the bottle.<br /><br />If you're just getting into the hobby this is a simple kit that will help acquaint yourself to brewing, just make sure you move beyond them eventually or you'll miss out on much better home brews you can do!

review/summary: Nice first time kit.
review/text: This was my first attempt at home brewing. I selected this kit due to the fact that it seemed very easy and for my first batch, that is what I wanted. Other than adding 3oz of raspberry extract just before bottling, I used the Wheat Beer Hopped Malt Concentrate and Coopers Light Malt Extract. I do question the yeast packet as to it's freshness, but it did do it's job. One week in the primay frementer, two weeks in the secondary, and three weeks priming in the bottle. While in the seconday, the fermentation did seem to stall a bit, which is why I questioned the freshness of the yeast, but slightly shaking up the yeast kept it going and it ended with a FG at 1010. The color came out a little darker than expected compared to commercial Wheats that I have had in the past, but not an issue. So in the end, I was very impressed with the outcome and several friends that have tried it were impressed as well. I would recommend this product and will try an other batch in the future. If you are a fan of traditional Wit beer I would recommend just using the Hopped Malt Concentrate and the Light Malt Extract and let the yeast do its job. It does take a bit longer, 6 weeks minimum, but it is well worth the wait.

review/text: I bought this pre-hopped malt kit along with an additional can of un-hopped wheat malt extract and a box of brew enhancer. I have to admit I had doubts as all my other cooper beers turned out kind of sour (Cider like) I have been home brewing for over a year and have had much more success making beer from partial mash recipes using my own hops and dry malt extract but this beer turned out pretty good.<br />I did add an additional ounce of Perle hops to give it a slight ending bite and than 2.oz of hazelnut flavoring but all in all compared to the other cooper kits this one was pretty good.<br />Crisp Clean Flavor, Slight Carbonation, Beautiful Coloring. I cannot review what the product would have been like as a standalone, but from other experiences Coopers is best when you add on to it. If you want to try making it like mine here is the recipe.<br /><br />You'll Need:<br />1 oz. Perle Hops<br />1 Can of un-hopped Wheat Malt Extract (Coopers)<br />1 Can Of Pre-Hopped Coopers Wheat Brewmaster Selection<br />2.oz Hazelnut flavoring (Use half bottle for milder flavor)<br />1 12oz Pure Maple Syrup<br />1 Box Brew Enhancer (Blue Label)<br />1 Packet of Safale-05 (Optional) but better flavoring over coopers yeast<br /><br />Bring water to boil in large pot<br />Add the Wheat Malt Extract and Half Box of brew enhancer<br />MIX WELL<br />Then Add Perle Hops for minimum of 20 minutes and max of 60 (Unless you want IPA Style then go up to 90)<br />Once the hops are done in the boil add maple syrup and can of Coopers Wheat Brewmaster<br />Leave on heat long enough to get contents disolved but not too long as you really shouldn't boil coopers kits for long<br /><br />Add to fermenter (I usually have a 10lb bag of ice in fermenter to automatically cool it to yeast pitching range)<br />Add additional water<br />Take you OG (if you have a hydrometer)<br />Add yeast<br />Ferment for 7-10 days<br />Bottle or keg (We like to keg and use in keggerator)<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Beer should have close to 5.2% ABV

review/text: I have to say that I have brewed for Coopers Kits at this point and this is most likely the best... Not necessarily because this product is more superior then the others kits but I added a few more "things" as I become a more experienced brewer. First, you can not produce a true Wheat Beer buy utilizing Coopers standard ale yeast... Therefore, I went with a liquid Wyeast stain. Also, I boiled the 1.5 liters of water as per the coopers instructions but I added a 1/2 oz of Bitter orange peal and 1 tsp of Corriander. This really gave the beer a nice Orange zest which is a true Southern Germany/Munich style wheat beer. However, I do believe simply making the kit as is will produce good beer just like the other kits.

review/text: Need I say more.  The only problem with them is stopping.  You too?<br /><br />They were my morning treat in the service.  A truck rolled up around 10 and my standard was the 6 Lorna Doone sleeve and the large coffee.  25-cents BTW<br /><br />FIVE STAR DOWN TO ONE!!!!<br />Added 3/12: Well, I just got another deal.  Seems affordable with deals and anything but when not featured.  The above indicates a lifelong relationship.  I should know the taste.  This case of cookies is different and not a good different.  Even the texture is off.<br /><br />The expiration date appears to be 14May12.  Still in spec but close and if poorly stored you get rancid.  The price was almost $2/box cheaper and close to grocery store prices.  I have figured out why it went from $50+ to 30's.<br /><br />WHAT MAKES ME MAD IS THAT I WENT TO AMAZON RETURNS AND THIS ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE.  AMAZON ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME ON RETURNS.  DISAPPOINTING. VERY DISAPPOINTING!  These went from a lovely treat to a reward for my dog.

review/summary: LORNA DOONE SHORTBREAD COOKIES 5-OUNCE SLEEVE(PACK OF 12)
review/text: Lorna Doone's is a delicious buttery shortbread cookie that melts in your mouth if eaten alone or as a cookie to accompany your morning coffee or tea, as well as a perfect breakfast treat. Recently in October through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon and shipped for free, I picked up 2 cases of 12 boxes that are 5oz. packages each with approximately 20 shortbread cookies per package for $12.99/case = $25.98 for 24 total 5oz. sleeves of Lorna Doone's. I point this price comparison out to help educate my fellow buyers of this product, seeing that in your local supermarket they're retailing for around $4.49-$4.99 for each 10oz. box containing 2 of the 20 count cookie packages in each. Now that is the same EXACT equivalent as 2 of the 5oz. sleeve packages that I purchased containing 12 boxes per case. Amazon frequently sells the 10oz. boxes in a pack of 12 for around $46-$52. Buying it my way for around $26 is economically smart and can save you as much as 50% off the listed above reference! Have fun and ENJOY!

review/summary: Good packaging, great cookies
review/text: The cookies arrived intact--none of the boxes I've opened so far had even one cracked cookie. The 12 boxes were packed snuggly into a medium box, which makes for easy storage in the basement pantry (as opposed to the usual gigantic box from Amazon with tons of paper).<br /><br />These cookies are really good, especially with coffee. They have a buttery flavor, and they're not too sweet. I originally bought them for my daughter--she loves them. But I really like them too.

Almost as good as Walker's, but for $26.00, half the price.<br /><br />These run about $4.99 each box in CA and almost $4.00 in Texas, so well worth buying 12 boxes, even if my hips disagree. Should come with the tape I'll need to attach them to my bum, lol.<br /><br />Very good for making shortbread crusts, see Epicurious' Lemon Cheesecake recipe!!

review/summary: So glad to find this!
review/text: I have used Roland black olive paste for years, but moved and it is very difficult to find. I am so glad Amazon is carrying it! I agree with the other reviewer that it is a bit intense by itself on crackers, but when you cannot make your own, it is a great substitute. You can add more nuts, oil, or basil and combine in a food process to tame it down some if you want. It is wonderful to use in cooking. I use it when I make vegetable lasagna. I use the black olive paste instead of tomato sauce, and it gives the lasagna a richness that can't be beat.  It is also great as a condiment on fish and chicken. If you love black olives, this is for you!

I buy this one to use as a component in other dishes (i.e. add it to pasta sauce for a kick of umami or to make a side of penne with olive paste and freshly grated romano); however it's flavor is not stand-out enough to serve solo on crusty bread as a rustic tapenade.

review/text: We're always looking for healthier alternatives to carbo and sugar loaded snacks for ourselves and our kids.  Jerkey is one they seem to really like as do we.  I have been a long time consumer of SnackMaster's Turkey and Beef Jerky.  Unfortunately, my grocery store stopped carrying it so I decided to order it online.  If you check the ingredients of SnackMaster's Jerky there are fewer chemicals and preservatives then other leading brands of Jerky.  That's why we continue to be satisfied customers.

I do not know why they stopped selling it there, but ever since, It has been hard to find, and ever harder to find it fresh.  I am so thankful I have found it for sale on this web site.  I overnighted a box the other day, and as soon as itt showed up  I immediately ate two of the 3.5 ounce bags for lunch.  Looks like I will be making another order shortly.

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I love Jerky. I use to order it on eBay and other sellers mainly from Seattle. Like pizza, everyone has their preference to the type of jerky they like best. My preference is the harder type and then I'll leave it in my mouth and slowly chew on it. I don't like the soft gooey type. To me, the hard dried out jerky is the best, as 20 or so seconds in your mouth will soften it like a piece of gum ready for chewing. Being a vegetarian my preference is the salmon and tuna jerky. SnackMasters makes both. I ordered a box of each. It arrived in short time and I could not wait to jump in. You must watch out when your friends come over as the jerky will be consumed in record time. I had a friendly poker game with 6 friends and we went through 5 packages of jerky! My friends are now all sold on SnackMasters jerky. This by far is the best jerky I have ever had and I highly recommend it.

review/text: I started eating this Jerky when I was in elementary school. My parents bought it as a snack from Trader Joe's and I became addicted. I am 24 now and still a fan of the Teriyaki jerky. It really is the best I've ever tasted, and I have tried many times to find a jerky that is just as good or better than SnackMasters. It just doesn't exist. Trader Joe's no longer sells this jerky. They replaced it with a terrible Jerky that really is inedible, so I've resorted to buying this from Amazon. The Gelsons sells a one ounce package for $5 but that is just unreasonable. Lucky, Amazon sells it for much cheaper.

Some may think this is too salty - for me it is perfect, but I love salty things.
