review/summary: Cats LOVE Weruva BFF
review/text: My four discriminating cats rejected every other brand of cat food that was placed in their bowls, but still love BFF.  Amazon's very low price is GREAT and the food is delivered to my door.  Who could ask for more?  All five of us are happy.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

review/summary: Really Good !!!
review/text: Awwww another winner from Weruva, i really like the brand and they made the BFF line with us in mind. It's a little cheaper than the actual Weruva brand cause its seafood based. Their seafood has the lowest mercury levels but still this isnt recomended for everyday use on your kitties, you're supposed to switch it around. I only give it to my babies 1 or 2-ice a week that's it. You should hear them begging when the can is popped open ha ha ha.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

review/summary: Absolute Life Saver!
review/text: My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/summary: Good price
review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

Even my roommate's cat, who is extremely picky with wet food (to the point that there is literally only one brand he would eat at all) has been caught sneaking tastes out of her bowl now! This stuff is very high grade - if you check out the b.f.f. site, they make all of their items in a human food processing facility, and there is no grain filler in the food. When opening the cans, it really smells like something you'd open up to eat yourself! I love this product and I will continue to buy it for my baby.

My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them.

review/text: Two of my cats are very picky eaters most of the time and will only eat kibble or straight up canned tuna. They even turn their noses up at canned salmon and sardines. Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/summary: BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack
review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/summary: Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand
review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

review/summary: My cats don't like the salmon
review/text: This is a great product and my three cats eat the Tuna Too Cool and the Tuna and Chicken canned food, but they don't like salmon, I guess.  You would just have to try it to know for sure.  This is a very healthy product because it contains NO GRAINS and is produced by human standards.  I know BFF is an excellent product.

review/summary: Look good to me but expensive
review/text: Best Feline Friend cat food cost more for less food. I did not try it but my cat eats few bites and look at me for something else. I found that it has a very strong smell of fish compared to other brand. In other word may be the food is too concentrated.Despite the much higher cost I would have given my cat this brand if he would have liked it.Sorry "Best Feline" but I did not decide. If you want more details ask Wicket, my cat.

review/summary: Not the best flavor of BFF
review/text: My cat completely ignores this flavor. Instead of the normal slab of meat, like BFF's other flavors, this one is soupy, and apparently not very good. My cat looks at me like I'm crazy when I give it to her. I don't know if I got a bad batch. If someone has gotten this, and it wasn't soupy, please leave a comment.

review/text: I am always looking for good quality cat food and thought I would give this a try.<br />Sadly it did not go down well in my house ! Two of my cats just walked away without a mouthful and the third ate about a quarter of a can. Whereas with Fancy Feast, they inhale it.<br />Maybe it's like humans, the stuff that is bad for you simply tastes better !

review/summary: Cat loves it, but it STINKS horribly
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either.

review/summary: My cat is a picky eater
review/text: and she will evetually "give in" and eat this food, but she doesn't "dive right in" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!

review/summary: This stuff stinks literally!!!
review/text: My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/summary: Individually boxed and very fresh.
review/text: I had been craving fruitcake during the holidays but couldn't find the time to go get one locally so I purchased these last week to share with family and friends.<br /><br />They arrived well packaged in a large box, then inside was a smaller box with 10 individually boxed fruit cakes. They are the same fruitcakes you purchase at stores except each one comes in an indvidual cardboard box. This is great if you plan to gift these because it makes a more presentable package and will probably keep them fresher. I was impressed that each one had its own box.<br /><br />These also arrived very soft and fresh like they had been shipped soon after they were made and not sitting around in a warehouse all year. These are the freshest I've had including when I purchased them at local stores.<br /><br />They sell these locally for $3.99 each plus tax. However, the price on Amazon is cheaper than I bought them on the Claxton website and I prefer to buy from Amazon. I will purchase these again next year and would recommend them.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/text: I eat several varieties of the Think Thin bars, and they are a good, low carb snack.  This particular variety, while VERY tasty (not to mention a higher fiber count than the other varieties), is not sugar-free...it contains honey.  For anyone NOT doing a low carb diet, this may not be an issue; however, for low-carbers out there, you know that the carb count alone isn't enough.  You have to read the ingredients.  I was sooooo disappointed to see honey on the list.<br /><br />Oh, well...it was a nice, one-time indulgence.

review/text: Looking for a low sugar alternative in a bar, this is it!My husband was munching on Zone bars until I glanced at the sugar it contained! This bar was a great substitute without the high sugar (his trigycerides were much too high) and now it's part of his daily food choices. No complaints about taste, the crunch and chocolate are very satisfying. Buying on the monthly plan is also cost effective as they can be costly bought individully at the store. In all, a win win.

review/text: I usually buy a few of these for $1.70 each. They are perfect for people on-the-go. I am an active person, always on my feet at work. This box works out great because I don't run out after a few days and its works out to be more economical than paying per bar. They taste delicious and are low in sugar, high in protein. In between work and school, eating one of these with a bottle of water holds me over until I can get home for dinner, because who in NYC can afford to buy dinner every damn night? They arrived a day late, but it perfect condition, no melting and just a few were broken in half, but that even happens at the store. Great product and great price.

review/summary: Good crunch and not too sweet
review/text: I like these bars because you get the crunch and flavor of a nut bar without too much sugar. They are peanut-y, without the weird texture and gross sweetness of other peanut butter protein bars. In my mind these are positives.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not likely to be a large amount of chocolate coating on any given bar. The first time I bought one, I was disappointed when I opened it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste so I decided to buy more.<br /><br />They can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty, which I suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch, or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day. I simply make sure I have a glass of water available when I plan to eat one of these.

review/summary: Satisfactory but very little chocolate
review/text: These bars are 'crunchy' with a strong peanut flavor.  There is just a hint of chocolate on the outside edge.  If you are hoping for a good chocolate bar with a few nuts you will be disappointed but if you want a crunchy peanut bar you will probably be delighted.

review/summary: Decent but heavy on the peanuts
review/text: These are decent ... and MUCH better than the other think thin bars. However, the #1 ingredient is PEANUTs. I'm not sure that "mixed nuts" is apt but it's tasty for being so low in sodium (90mg) & sugars (3g) and gluten-free. I'd buy them again but would wait until they're on sale.<br /><br />Nutrition: 190 cal, 11g fat, 10g protein, 5g fiber<br /><br />Major Ingredients: Peanuts, soy crisps, almonds, chickory extract, cashews, maltitol, brown rice syrup, honey, soy lecithin, flavoring, salt.

review/summary: Little too sweet
review/text: I was looking for a nut bar made with 100% wohle nuts for a meal replacement.<br />Saw Think Thin here and tried it.<br />This bar tastes good. Whole nuts and soy crisps and everything.<br />But for a meal replacement, it's too sweet.<br />It says to be 70% less sugared than leading fruit and nut bars. I wonder which bar it's reffering to? It's still pretty sweet. I'd call it sweet snack than meal replacement.<br />When I have less than satisfying meal, I would eat it for desert. For me it's canndy bar replacement.<br />I feel guilty eating it instead of a meal.<br /><br />Everything is laced with so much sugar now days, when I eat something for health, I want no sugar or very little sugar in it.<br />This bar would taste even better if it were less sweet.

Although these are not organic, my husband and daughter do like these to have a bit of variety in their lives. There are only so many Larabars one can eat in a lifetime. If you are looking for a good organic snack type product and have not yet discovered Orgain drinks, run there and order them immediately.<br /><br />I purchased several varieties of the Thinkthins when they were on promotion. Best price I have found.

review/summary: I Like These Bars But They Don't Like Me
review/text: I love the taste and texture of these bars; they're sweet, but not overly-sweet and have a satisfying, nutty crunch and just enough chocolate to make them interesting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, I apparently have a severe negative reaction to the artificial sweetener, maltitol, used in the chocolate coating.  About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.

These bars are great for on-the-go, in your handbag, purse, or backpack and actually fill you up with a bottle of water and an apple for a healthy meal.  I don't recommend refrigeration, as they are already chewy and don't need to be hard on top of that.  I recommend these bars for athletes, students, moms, and kids alike.  They taste great and are very satisfying.

review/summary: The best bar Think Thin makes
review/text: I have always longed for a real crunch in the Think Thin bars. Until this bar came along this sensation was lacking. This bar combines a darker chocolate with nuts in every bite. It's very tasty, and with the crunch, it satisfies one's chewing crave. I have bought this product by the bar in Trader Joe's but when I saw that Amazon sold it by the box, I jumped at the price point. I haven't had any of the shipping problems that other reviewers have mentioned. (Mine are shipped to Maryland.) I will definitely order these bars again. I use these bars are a meal replacement, especially at breakfast.

review/text: I've tried many low carb bars and these are very good.  Not too sweet but a perfect balance of sweet and crunchy.  They don't have that funny chemical taste that many bars have - probably because they are made with maltitol, which can cause gastric distress if you eat too much of it.<br /><br />One reviewer complained about the lack of nutrition information provided in the description, with which I agree.  However, I have that complaint with Amazon overall for the food items they sell, not just this particular item.  I look up nutrition information elsewhere before buying on Amazon, which shouldn't be necessary.

review/text: If you want the nutrition info on these bars, go to [...].  All the info you need is there.  The crunch bars are 190-200 calories each.  I think I'm going to try a couple of different ones.  I'm always looking for stuff that is not artificially sweetened and that has "good stuff".

review/summary: CALORIES????
review/text: My first thought when I saw this product was "Yum.  These look good.  I'll order some."  I am ALWAYS looking for a healthy, lo-cal treat.  My next thought, after reading the description was "Why would anything sold with the name 'thinkTHIN' NOT tell you the calories in their description?"  Wouldn't just about anyone who is looking for a healthy, nutritious treat want to see the nutrition information?  Come on, people!  What are you hiding?  I will certainly NOT order these until I see more information, be it here or somewhere else.  Maybe the nutrition labeling is here, and I just don't see it, but it should be front and center.

review/summary: Great all natural product
review/text: I feed my cats only high quality food and treats.  These are great crunchy treats that are natural, healthy AND my cats like them!  I don't have to worry about excess fats and gross by products when I give these.  My girls usually only get freeze dried meat treats, so these make a great alternative.  Innova is fantastic quality brand.

review/summary: Cats truly love this stuff
review/text: We've got three cats, and they absolutely love this stuff.  Just picking up the little packet of it will bring all three of them running from all ends of the house.  I'm not even talking about opening it - just the little crinkling sound of picking it up off the table.  These are "treats", so despite their being on the healthy side of the genre, they're not intended for main meals, and it'd be too expensive to do that, anyway. I typically give them a small handful (10 to 20 pieces each) at night.  Their main diet is Blue Buffalo wet and dry foods, and Wellness Core dry.  These treats are just supplements to a main diet.  If you're looking for something that will really get your cats excited and get them out from whatever corners they're nesting in, try the Innova Cat Treats.  This stuff is like catnip.  Actually, it has catnip in it, which may explain part of the excitement.

review/summary: Fabulous
review/text: My cats (3) absolutely love these treats.In fact, as of this writing I have to order more.<br />One of the cats loves it when I slide them across the floor one at a time,which encourages him to run to have to get it.<br />The other 2 love to watch him running while they chow down into their plates<br />(They are Siamese,and Siamese are to be waited on,they can not be bothered to have to chase their treats!) :)<br />I love the ingredients and feel that my cats are getting a healthier treat.<br />Will definitely order again.

review/text: This coffee tastes great. I have tried Lavazza and other non organic brands, but the taste of this coffee is very good and the price is reasonable. I will purchase it again.

review/summary: happy chewing from two dogs for hours
review/text: I have two Dogs, 12 and 1 yr old, medium size and a bit larger. both have strong health teeth, chewing bones like this for most of their lives. I was told by my Veterinarian one of the main reasons (besides no soft food) the have great oral hygiene. these natural bones are the right size and the dogs never leave them alone until they are gone or I take them away. Dont give these to them before bed time (crunch crunch crunch). I notice they develop a thirst after chewing for awhile. No digestion problems as a result of eating on these. a great bang for the buck as far as dog treats go. Strongly recommend for dogs that have good teeth.
