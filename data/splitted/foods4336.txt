While its no cure for serious sea sickness I find these liquorice drops very settling for a queazy stomach.<br /><br />Also this "candy" is not overly sweet  -  a problem I have with most similar American made products. Only Problem is that once I start eating them I want to devour the whole package!

review/summary: Best Hair Oil!
review/text: After reading about the benefits of Indian hair care products I decided to purchase this oil.  Since using it, my hair has become stronger, more shiny, and thicker.  My best friend noticed the difference and asked me what I was using in my hair.  Since there were no Indian grocery stores where she lived I recommend she buy it on Amazon.  Great product, especially for African American or thick/coarse hair (which I have).

review/summary: Great for hair! Does not smell horrible
review/text: First I want to start by saying this oil does not stink. It does have a scent but it's nothing to make you upchuck your dinner. Anyway, oil is great for hot oil treatments. It is absolutely not to be left on the hair for days at a time as it makes my scalp itch! It makes my hair very shiny and moisturized. I love the size of the bottle, it will last a long time. I definitely recommend for AA ladies with dry damaged hair. You will see results.

review/summary: My first impression after the first time I used it.
review/text: I have been wanting to try this product out for YEARS. My friend from High School used this stuff and her hair was gorgeous, thick, long and shiny. I read that some people said this stuff stinks.. Yes, it kind of does stink but the smell goes away after you wash it out. After reading about how "bad" it stinks I could never find anyone to describe what it smelled like.. Well.. It smells A LOT like the original Pine Sol floor cleaner. It smells a bit funky to be putting in your hair but I would say it is totally worth it. Anyways. To apply, I put a generous amount (2-3 tablespoons) in my hands, using a tablespoon at a time, and worked it through the middle of my hair to the tips and whatever else I had on my hands I would lightly apply to the top of my hair but not getting it on my roots or on my scalp. Then I put my hair up in a towel for an hour. An hour passed and I washed my hair with shampoo and I used conditioner only on the tips and middle of my hair (my hair routine). I dried my hair and it was incredibly soft and looked amazingly shiny. The only bad thing I can say about this product is that it stinks and that it left some of my hair a bit oily on top of my hair but I think it was my mistake for putting it close to my roots. Overall, I really like this product. Also, keep in mind that just because this product made my hair shiny and silky smooth it doesn't always mean that everyone else will get the same results.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: I bought this oil over two months ago but was put off by the strong smell so I didn't use it. To me it smells like a combination of industrial strength soap and old school petroleum hair grease. Given that, my hair was in desperate need of protein and coconut oil does not work for me. I have also been using Aphoghee leave in protein treatment and it worked initially but not consistently. So I decided to give this a try and I'm glad I did. I heated it up over a double boiler then put it on section by section and let it set for an hour. I could immediately feel my hair become smooth as I put it on. I had to rinse it out for a good 5 minutes before shampooing but my hair was so soft and most importantly it stopped shedding. I gave my daughter the same treatment the following day and she had the same results. I am so excited that I finally found something to balance out my protein/moisture level but the challenge will be to see how it does over time. The directions say to use it 2-3 times a week for best results but given the smell I think I will try once a week and see how it works. I think the smell is worth the results.<br /><br />Update end of July: I am almost through my first bottle and I still love this oil. I am still using it once a week but really wish my schedule would allow me to do it more. The smell no longer bothers me, especially since the shampoo I use takes the smell right away. I skipped doing this treatment one weekend out of pure laziness and I will never do that again. I could definitely tell the difference in my hair. Oh and my hair has been getting noticeably darker. Which I dont mind at all. I like it. From now on I will buy this oil in two's.

review/summary: Awful stench, did nothing amazing for my hair
review/text: I can't for the life of me remember what inspired me to buy this stuff in the first place, but after just 1 use i promptly threw the rest of the bottle away. 1st of all, the stench is absolutely awful. Then after glancing over the ingredient list I can imagine why putting all these chemicals on my hair would really be beneficial. I've had such better results with just plain old coconut oil. Before the shower, i slather a bunch on my hair. I let it sit for 10 minutes then shampoo and condition as normal. Makes my hair super soft without having to add all these chemicals and putrid stench to my hair.

review/text: I'm a African American woman with kinky 4a/4b textured hair and this oil really makes my hair SUPER soft. Yes it does have mineral oil in it but that doesn't really matter to me since I use it mostly as a pre-poo. Also, it really makes my hair feel stronger which is why I guess I have retained much more length then usual. I had a serious breakage problem and this oil and henna definitely helped combat that.

review/summary: My dogs love the Greenies, and I like Amazon's price...
review/text: I am an enabler.  My two dogs have an insatiable addiction to Greenies.  Every night around 8:45 p.m., they start whining, barking, and circling me... and they don't stop until they each get a Greenie for the day.  If you're a consistent buyer of Greenies like me, you know that it can get very expensive-- at the local chain pet store I can expect to pay $17.99 per bag of Greenies (12 oz., 43 teenie pieces).<br /><br />Which leads me to review Amazon's performance in delivering these doggie treats at a reasonable price; currently it's $15.99 per bag and if you buy 3 bag you get one for free.  In addition to this, there's free shipping which saves me time and a needless trip down to the pet store.  If you buy 4 bags, you're getting it for about $12 per bag, which is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />In terms of the snacks themselves, the senior version of these Teenie Greenies are great-- they taste just as great as the original (based on my dogs' ability to consume it in under 3 minutes) but they have a softer consistency.  One of my dogs is nearly 18 years old, while the other is 9 years old... so dental care and not stressing out their teeth is really important to me.<br /><br />As long as Amazon maintains this deal, I'll continue to purchase the item directly from them.

Keeping an older dog's teeth clean can be a challenge, especially if they aren't able to eat really crunchy food or gnaw on rawhides or bones.  Senior Greenies can help!

review/summary: Buyer Beware!!
review/text: I have ordered Starbucks Espresso Dark Roast Coffee Pods from Starbucks through Amazon in the past and the coffee is delicious! When Starbucks was out of the coffee pods, I ordered it from the Amazon vendor Nicorazz. What I received from them was a product over one year past the sell-by date. In an email answer to my complaint, they snidely told me that the information was on the order before I purchased it. I went back to the item and it's true, the information is there and I overlooked it. If you read it, however, they attempt to convince you that nothing is wrong with selling it long after the sell-by date. Don't believe them! The coffee tastes like dishwater. In all fairness to them I guess, they offered to refund my money minus shipping if I would send it back. They'll just sell it to some other poor sucker, so I'll toss it and feel better about the coffee not going to anyone else. You just lost a customer, Nicorazz.

review/text: These pods from Starbucks are simply the best for making lattes, etc.  They're packed tightly in the pod, but not too tight, plus the espresso itself is delicious. I highly recommend these espresso pods, especially for your espresso machine.

review/summary: Starbucks Espresso pods
review/text: I bought the Starbucks Espresso pods to use in my Senseo machine. The pods are too hard to use in the machine which prevents the espresso from flavoring the coffee when the water flows through. It also doen't work in my espresso machine. The pod "melts" from the heat of the espresso machine. I was able to use the espresso grounds by cutting a hole in the pod and sprinkling the coffee directly into my Senseo Coffeeduck accessory and espresso machine coffee filter holder. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U7QG7A">Starbucks Espresso Pods (12 count)</a>

review/text: I used to buy these BOLD Espresso Dark Roast Pods from Starbucks; enjoying BOTH the flavor and buzz. These pods are very MILD, nothing BOLD to be found with them, I'm on my 3rd pod today awaiting the buzz. These are NOT expired until 11AUG12 so I suspect although the box indicates BOLD these are mislabeled and really are MILD.<br /><br />I called both Amazon AND Starbucks to share my comments about this purchase. Both are pleasant but have nor rhyme or reason for these pods "missing the mark".  This definitely is not recommended!

review/text: I was so excited to try this. I love Starbucks. I got to work put 2 pods into my coffee maker, I thought that might be a little strong but I like it that way. It finished and I did not even have to take more than a sip, looked and tasted like colored water. I poured it back in and ran it through again, no better. I am so disappointed. I even added another pod, no better. I would never have expected this from a Starbucks product. I'd like to say I will give it another chance but it is too expensive to take a chance on.

review/summary: Decently priced shots
review/text: These are decently priced per shot and it's easy to replicate a Starbucks latte at a mere fraction of the cost in store. However, I ordered these direct from Amazon and the "best by" date is only 3 months from the date I received them. Probably not a problem if this is the only espresso you're drinking but I like to rotate 4 or 5 different types at home (all of which have a "use by" date more than a year from now) and am now limited to using these since they won't be fresh for much longer. At least I can take comfort in the fact that I never have to go to Starbucks anymore though.

review/text: I have learned my lesson with these - always read ALL product reviews that have an unusually low price. Yes, price is low but these DO NOT WORK for a Senseo coffee brewer. They are clearly made for espresso shot machines only. They came up as an alternative though when I searched for Senseo pods. Now, because they are not actually sold by Amazon I am stuck with them and they don't work in my single serve brewer. As others have said, mine are expired as well - dated September 2011.

review/summary: This soy's a joy!
review/text: Soy sauce is a very subjective item. The tastes of soy sauce vary widely - there are cooks and diners that look down their noses at LaChoy sauces, but I am not one of them. I have studied Chinese cooking extensively (Seattle). In doing so, I have been exposed to all sorts of soy sauces. Bottom line, my personal favorite is this one - LaChoy Lite. The LaChoy salesman does not make it to my part of the country (SW Arizona desert), so I have to order it on line. It is excellent for marinades such as Bulgogi, a Korean street food (sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, sugar), or as an ingredient in more complex sauces. A 12-pack of this lasts me two years. Try it - you'll probably like it!

Oh, and it also has a gooey center.

review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

There ARE richer, creamier, better tasting cocoas out there but I like this stuff and you can't beat the price and the convenience of just adding hot water instead of milk. Its outstanding to carry when camping- light weight and pretty secure in its little bags.

review/text: I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office.  Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton
