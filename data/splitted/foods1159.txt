review/summary: My son loves these
review/text: My 10 month old son seems to think these things are the best treats on earth.  If I hold one out for him, he'll grab it and crunch on it until it's gone. They don't get too messy and tend to not dissolve like some other crackers we've fed him.

review/summary: So far so good, but...
review/text: I ordered some at the recommendation of a friend who has 2 toddlers. Her toddler had been eating them since they were babies. I just got our shipment today and had my 3 y.o. test it out. I figured if he did not like them, then we can always save them for his baby sis when she is old enough to eat them as well. It passed his taste test and he had 2 pcs within 5 mins. I like now they are individually wrapped so its easy to pack in a diaper bag/lunch box. They dont crumble, but do break easily as they are pretty thin. The expiration date says 7/2010 so if you order them now, there is plenty of shelf-life left in them.<br />I gave it 4 stars only because the product is made in China. Hmmm.... with all the baby formula w/ melamine and lead in toys problems they had the recent years... made me second guess this product. I was really surprise that it was a Chinese product, seeing that the packaging actually looks somewhat European in my opinion. I think it should be fine, but still, I prefer to buy items (esp food items for BABIES) that aren't made from there. That's just my opinion.

review/summary: the strawberry flavor is better
review/text: My daughter likes the strawberry mum mums.  The strawberry ones are organic.  I expected this one to be organic too, but it doesn't say it anywhere on the box.  I also expected that since this was made from vegetables, it may have a little more nutrition.  But it was no different than the strawberry.  So there was no benefit from buying the vegetable ones plus they weren't organic.  I'm going to stick with the strawberry ones from now on.  If you buy the strawberry ones, make sure your little one doesn't have any allergies to strawberries.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: These are great!  I started giving them to my daughter when she was 6 months old and desprite to feed herself.  She loved them right away.  They fit into her little hands perfectly.  I have never had a problem with choking and she has had at least one a day for the past 4 months. They are great if you're on the go and just need to give them something to tie them over until you can properly feed them. I order them on line in bulk because they are hard to find.  They have them at walmart and babies-r-us, but not always and never very many in stock.  Walmart only carries the original and my daughter really likes the veggy ones the most.

review/summary: My baby will ONLY eat these snacks now!
review/text: I started out giving my baby some Earth's Best Teething Biscuits to snack on when she was about 6 months old. They were soooo messy, but I liked them because it was easy to just grab a pack and throw it in my bag!  Then, on a whim, when she was 9 months old, I saw these and tried them out. We LOVE them!  My girl eat these suckers up!  I ordered 6 boxes from amazon.<br />These aren't "teething" biscuits, but it keeps my girl entertained and busy.  We take them everywhere now... grocery store, church, in the car...<br />Pros: Lightweight, good packaging for grab and go, easy for baby to grasp, dissolves easily in the mouth. NOT MESSY!<br />Cons: they crush easily, so protect them while traveling.  I've had many a crushed snack when I get to my destination after just throwing a pack into the diaper bag!  Although, i usually just give her the small pieces!

review/summary: THIS IS WHAT EVERY MOM SHOULD HAVE
review/text: this is my second child and after using the Gerber biter biscuits and zwieback toast, I was disappointed that both could be so messy. Especially  the biscuit melting and turning in a compacted cement that made my son cry when it was time to wash up. I just found these accidentally and bought 2 boxes. I am so impressed. My 7 month old loves them and can eat them with ease and I don't have to worry about large<br />chunks breaking off and choking him. I still have to watch him eat them, but after eating one myself I found it tasty and it does dissolve so quickly I really can't anticipate a problem with any chunks. Not to mention they are much cheaper than any other biscuits I've seen and come in a handy 2 pack. I just wish I had found them sooner!

review/summary: GREAT first snack for baby!
review/text: My 6 month old daughter LOVES these. I was, at first a little apprehensive to give them to her, as she gums them so hard she often breaks pieces off of them. I used to sit right next to her as she gnawed on them but as she is getting older she is chewing them more and can navigate them quite easily. Rarely she bites  off more than she can chew and i just scoop it out of her mouth.<br /><br />They arent very messy, in my opinion, and are much easier to clean then the biter biscuits or arrowroot cookies.<br /><br />She likes all of the flavors, especially the veggie.  She actually kicks her legs excitedly when I get them out of the package for her.<br /><br />I find they are cheaper to buy in bulk on Amazon than at Target, etc.<br /><br />The only downfall is they are not very portable as they snap and break with any pressure.  These cannot be thrown in a purse or diaper bag (unless all you carry is packing peanuts) without breaking into a hundred pieces.<br /><br />OVerall a great product for eating at home.

My older children did not get diagnosed until recently but my baby got diagnosed gluten intolerant at 3 months. I worried about finding a teething cracker/biscuit for him.

review/text: I don't care where in the world these are made! China, Mexico, India, Yugoslavia, I don't care! Put my 8 month old son in his car seat and hear his instant high pitch screams that seem to never end while running errands is the worst! I watch carefully what he eats organic everything. Even his cookies and teether's that come from Whole Foods at a Whole Bunch of money can't do the trick! Not to mention how incredibly messy they get. I found these at Walmart. I got a box and wished I had bought a case since the closes Walmart is 40 minutes away. Instant happiness for the both of us. They melt in his mouth almost instantly so no worrying about choking while driving. The ingredients are very simple and taste good too. I would know my son likes to share.<br /><br />On a side note. I just found out that my local Babies R Us now stocks these wonderful China made husk! So stocking up! Sometimes you just have to go with what works.

review/summary: Great food for baby
review/text: My love of Baby Mum-mum Rice Rusks does not account for where they are made or what they are made of. Rather, my love has to do with the fact that my daughter loves them and they do not make a mess.<br /><br />When my first daughter was entering the finger food/teething stage of life, we bought her Gerber's Biter Biscuits.  While she loved them, I hated them because they made a terrible mess.<br /><br />Fast forward to my second daughter now being in the finger food/teething stage - I scoured the baby food aisle trying to find an alternative to the messy biter biscuit.  I bought these and was so impressed with them.  My daughter (who doesn't even really like vegetables) likes these vegetable flavored ones as well as the strawberry ones.<br /><br />They are great for keeping a little one occupied while you try to cook dinner or when you are on the go and they need a little distraction (although watch out, they are a bit fragile and will break into pieces if they find themselves at the bottom of your diaper bag).

I started giving our 8 month old wheat, unsalted pretzels which is the perfect shape and size for his little fingers.  The pretzels also create less of a mess.  I give the Baby Mum Mums right before planned bath time.

They do not leave the difficult to clean mess that the Biter Biscuits do, and they're not a big choking hazard like the Biters, either (they are easy to bite and dissolve easy in the mouth).

review/text: I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to "kick up" a notch.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!<br /><br />After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!<br /><br />I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others<br /><br />Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed

review/summary: Generic chicken breasts
review/text: Nothing makes these chicken breasts special whatsoever. They are standard generic tasting chicken breasts, tiny ones at that. They are tender and juicy when grilled, I will say that...but you'll be through eating one in less than 2 minutes. There's no difference between Omahas chicken breasts and regular chicken breasts I can buy in any grocery store Save a lot/Aldi included....for well over 1/2 the price of what they charge for these and for nearly quadruple the amount. So, why charge so much for these? I can get behind their steaks, even though they're overpriced too, and a few other Omaha products like the hot dogs and stuffed baked potatoes, but can't really get behind these chicken breasts. It's not like these are organic chicken breasts that have a decent size to them, which is what the price Omaha charges for them would suggest. These are as generic as generic gets. Would of been fine if 1 of their chicken breasts was the size of 2 of their chicken breasts. Instead it's like they got 1 large chicken breast and cut it it up to make 4 out of it. Luckily, I received these in a comped sampler. There's no reason whatsoever for anyone to buy just these chicken breasts through Omaha Steaks as Omaha gives you no reason to. Omaha really needs to make their portions bigger. People would be fine paying their prices if the portions were bigger...but half the things they sell the price to size ratio leaves you feeling ripped off. Not that I paid for these as like I said they were comped, but if I did no doubt I'd feel pretty ripped off. Change your mentality Omaha. Instead of less is more, think MORE is MORE. Get with the times.

review/summary: Expensive but Excellent, The Only Food My Boxer Has Loved
review/text: Pros: Endless list i.e. lack of grains, high quality protein, appeal to the dog's palate, lack of stool, vitamins and minerals, no by products, fillers, or possibly dangerous ingredients, availability at you local Petco. The list goes on and on.<br />Cons: As Expensive as dog food gets (Over $2 lb). Price is the only con for me, the protein content could be an issue for some less active breeds than Boxers. The largest bag size is 24 lb. I wish they had a 40lb bag at a lesser price per pound.<br /><br />First off, this is the highest rated, best quality food that can be purchased at Petco, without question. This is the only blue buffalo line (Wilderness) in that class as well. It is not advertised as an allergy free dog food, but it definitely is due to the fact there are ZERO grains. I thought the high protein content would be an issue for my dog based on issues with other high protein foods, but that is not the case with the Blue Buffalo Wilderness. When I change foods, I want to make sure I can buy it locally in the event I need some on the fly. I love a website called dogfoodanalysis.com, and this is the only 6 star rated food that Petco sells, and most every other food except a few (Wellness is one exception although my dog didn't like it) are rated 3 stars or less. For example, Natural Balance, regardless of the flavor is rated 3 stars. Brands like Iams, Science Diet, Eukanuba, Purina Pro Plan all get horrible 1 ratings at best because they are so full of garbage ingredients, unnecessary fillers and by-products. Many of the foods that cost as much as this or close are also rated 1-2 stars.<br /><br />I have a 2 Yr old Boxer, and owned 2 before that. All of them have had soft stools the majority of the time, and 2/3 had hot spots on the fur causing them to scratch themselves constantly. Over the years, I have tried a number of premium dog foods such as Solid Gold, Nature's Recipe, Natural Balance, as well as some cheaper foods such as Iams. My dogs really never loved or even liked most of these foods, and generally wouldn't start eating the food when the bowl was put on the floor unless I poured some low sodium chicken broth on the food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo Wilderness is like candy for my dog, but is the most healthy by far at the same time. With other foods that cost as much as this food, he has never looked forward to eating, and never had a proper stool.<br /><br />I am a very harsh critic of most things, and am great at playing devil's advocate. I have nothing bad to say about this food other than the price becasue it truly seems no corners were cut, and Blue Buffalo is offering the best quality dog food on the market. However, the price is probably justified unlike any of the other expensive , but not necessarily good quality dog foods. After 2 weeks eating this food, he is filling out, seems much less hyperactive, his hot spots are disappearing (I feel due to the lack of any grains from my research), he's pooping less and more solidly. Since the last food he was eating gave him the runs anyway, I never mixed the old food with the new, and the first time he pooped, it was more solid than ever before.<br /><br />If you can afford this food (I barely can), do not hesitate to go buy it now. There were no corners cut in the design of this food. It is truly top quality dog food that is the next best thing to making your own dog food which will cost even more.<br /><br />If you own a Boxer, you know how messy they are when eating! They love filling their mouth with kibble, then dropping half of it on the floor, and not eating all of the leftovers on the floor. My dog is so addicted to the Wilderness food that he will find every last piece of kibble that he scattered on the floor, and gobbles it up.<br /><br />I prefer the Salmon

review/summary: Great for dogs with skin allergies!!
review/text: I know this product looks expensive. I was a little hesitant at first to buy it. But OMG it is remarkable. I had tried everything to get my dogs skin to clear up. They live inside and would scratch and scratch. They were on flea medicine so I kept taking them to the vet. It would cost me about 500.00 each time and their skin would only get slightly better. So I switched vets and they asked me what my dogs were eating. I told them Dog Chow. They advised I pay 80.00 for one of there bags. On a budget we couldnt afford it but I did decide to go to Petsmart and look at the back of the bags of food to find one for my dogs. While there I spoke with a very nice woman who told me maybe my dogs are allergic to grains. It all kind of clicked when she said it. I noticed my dogs were getting yeast infections in their ears and could smell the yeasty smell from them. I switched them a little over a year and cant even tell you how amazing they look. Their coats are so shiny when I take them for walks everyone tells me how beautiful they are. They each gained around 10lbs. This food is solid protein so they dont eat as much but they LOVE this food. My advice to people who are looking for something that will help their dogs skin allergies would be this. I know it seems expensive but its a lot cheaper then taking your dog to the vet and definately more healthy. You can also get a 5.00 coupon from their site.

review/summary: Awesome Food!
review/text: My dog LOVES this food. I bought it because I was looking for something closer to a raw diet. This is also the first food that we've seen a noticeable difference in her fur. The other foods claim that you'll feel and see a difference, but this is the first food that has actually done so! So much that the first week she was on it, I almost took her to the vet because I was concerned why her fur was getting softer. She really looks forward to meal time every day. Amazing food! Well worth the money!

review/summary: This grain free dog food is excellent!
review/text: My Standard poodle is getting old. He is 12 now. His stools have been very difficult to clean up after- they are soft and often very loose. We tried it all, numerous Vet visits, enzyme and other blood tests, changing his diet to rice and lamb only...wet food, dry food. We have been going crazy trying to learn what will stay with this dog and keep him from having accidents...We tried this Wilderness dog food in the dry form and he loved it! In two days he was back to normal stools. We were worried about boredom with this diet as he seldom likes dry food but we have no trouble getting him to eat both the chicken and the duck varieties. I got a can or two of the same food in the wet formula and I add a spoon ful of it to the dry food. HIs bowels<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZNW346">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Duck Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a> are now back to normal and he is not suffering any longer. Two people mentioned recently to eliminate grains from his diet, even the Vet hadn't thought of that! Now, with his new grain free diet, the dog will be healthy and happy and so will his owners!

review/summary: Never knew a dog's fur could get so soft and shiny
review/text: I've had dogs before but they were family dogs so were fed the usual Purina or typical grocery store dog foods.  I recently started fostering a pit bull and was given Science Diet for sensitive stomach formula since she had stomach issues.  I used that and her stool was firm but I decided to put her on this food because price isn't as important as her health right?  In a few weeks her fur is amazingly soft!  Anywhere there is short fur it's like stroking a bunny and in the longer areas it's mostly soft and I can tell the rougher stuff is almost all finally gone.  Even in recent pictures I noticed later how shiny her coat is as well.<br /><br />She loves it, her stomach is doing well, and her fur is amazing.  I can't say much about her attitude though since she's as friendly and happy as usual but pits are like that even coming from the worst situations anyway.  Oh yeah, I adopted her last week so she'll be eating Blue Buffalo for a long time to come.  Thank you, Amazon, for having it Prime eligible so it shows up right away.

review/summary: Excellent, high-quality, grain-free food!
review/text: We've already used the Wildnerness chicken-flavor for a couple months and decided to switch to the duck (salmon next). This duck flavor is the same high-quality as the chicken we've already used. We've much healthier appearing and active dogs with a noticeably smaller quantity of very solid waste as well as a marked decrease in odor. Excellent product and rated very highly on REPUTABLE dog food comparison websites(top 2 - BB Wildnerness and Orijen). I decided against Orijen as the product is produced in Canada (USA product patron) and the protein is unnecessarily high in my opinion. The Blue Buffalo Wilderness has the best balance of nutrients and availability is an important consideration for our family. I've also used other good kibbles in the past like Canidae (so-so with an unwelcomed and spontaneous ingredient change) and Wolf King by Diamond(better but not as high-quality as BB Wilderness) and we've noticed a great improvement in our dogs' overall health. Very pleased with this product although a bit pricey for the quantity.

After several thousand dollars in vet visits and steroid medication, (he had some sort of  white blood cell condition) the doctors told us to start feeding him more protein and no carbs. I discovered this food after searching online and reading the numerous good reviews. After about a month on this food, his condition cleared completely! Now I feed the rest of my dogs (3 total) this food.

review/summary: Pricey But well worth it!
review/text: Ever since our 2 mini poodles and 2 Maltipoo came in to our household they stole our hearts and became a part of our family. The hunt for the right food came when I heard countless horror stories from friends and family on how leading brand name foods affected and even caused the death of their pets. We all know how costly vet bills can me and because of this reason I believe that being proactive and taking preventive care will be a lot cheaper in the long run. Certain grains and corn are not a natural part of a dogs diet and as you know most or all advertised brands use that as one of their main ingredients. What i love this brand is that it doesnt skimp on any of the right ingredients and makes meat/poultry/etc. (depending on the flavor you buy) the main ingredient! this is awesome because there really isnt any other brand out there that is true to their pet owners and their pets! This manufacturer makes me feel like they actually care and thus they will get my money for their 1 of a kind and amazing food! My dogs love it, they have beautiful coats, they are energetic and healthy all around. Been using this for about 3 years now and will continue to do so. This is our households choice of food- the right food.

review/text: One of my dogs is very allergic to grains in dog food. He gets hives and itches terribly. Tried a raw food diet, but that's not very practical and I'm not convinced that it provides enough nutrients. We tried several different grain free brands and they're all fine, but the Wilderness is the brand that even my cats try to steal because they love it. So now we get them the cat formula and all our fur faced kids are eating Blue Buffalo Wilderness. No more hives, better skin, shiny coats.

review/summary: Perfect food for my GSD!
review/text: I just transitioned my 8 month GSD to the duck recipe.  I was using Orijin Large Breed Puppy previously for the grain free/low calcium aspect.  However, it was difficult to find and really expensive.  After researching different brands, I found this one.  Again, it is grain free and low calcium, high quality ingredients and about $10 - $12 less than Orijin!  My dog transitioned very easily and really quite quickly.  I was surprised she didn't have the loose stools that some have experienced while transitioning.<br /><br />In addition, I am finding that I am actually giving her less food than the Orijin.  She is satisfied at 3/4c - 1c.  With Orijin, she wasn't satisfied until she had almost 2 cups.  I thought she was eating less because she didn't like it, so I added a few things to it and she would still stop at 3/4c - 1c.<br /><br />Her coat is amazingly shinny and I have found that she is shedding less.

review/text: I have two lab mixes and strongly believe in feeding high quality food. In the past, I've fed both Innova and Blue Buffalo Weight Control - and was generally happy with both. However, one of my dogs recently developed a gas problem. After learning that digestional issues can be caused by grains and fillers used in many dog food formulas, I decided to give Wilderness a chance. I was a little hesitant given the high cost - but am very glad I made the switch. The gas problem is almost entirely eliminated, and both dogs seem happy and healthy. Soft, shiny coats are anoter added bonus. This food has proved to be worth the high price for us!

review/summary: Chicken Flavor is good too....
review/text: We have a 9 month old lab who has a very sensitive stomach. Over the past 3 months we have been trying to find a food that will (not to sound gross) firm up his poop, as it has been very soft and that can lead to problems. Each new food we tried to give him we gave him 3 weeks on, slowly switching him. We have had him on Kirkland puppy (Chicken), Nature's Domain (Turkey), Taste of the wild (Salmon), and most recently Nature's Variety (Chicken). All of the above foods are rated 4 stars and up by several websites. While all of them are very good dog foods, none of them helped firm him up like the Wilderness Puppy formula has. I am not a vet, but i have done alot of research on the foods, i think it's the combo of 36% protein and 6% fiber (at least 2-3% higher more than most dry dog foods) that has made a world of difference, and im only 1 week into switching him. I wish i could buy the puppy Chicken formula from Amazon (not sold as of this review, currently sold by Petsmart or Petco). I look forward to switching him when he's an adult to the Duck formula. This food is worth every penny, if he didn't perform here he would have been taken to the vet to see what was going on (we did have his poop checked early on for parasites, came back negative), so it saves me in vet bills alone.

review/text: We recently added an Akita pup to our family and decided to try a higher quality food source for her and our current 6 yr old lab. I new the higher quality food would be better for the pup but what really surprised us was how well our lab took to it. Itcheness & hot spots she previously had quickly disappeared and she really filled out putting on some solid weight within a month. I thought we fed her well before but wow did this make a difference. I cant pinch any loose skin on her at all and believe the weight gain was good mass gain. The only two negatives I have are price and not being able to get this stuff in larger bags for bulk ordering.

review/summary: Great ingredients but something is wrong
review/text: I did a lot of research on dog food after hearing Eukanuba and other dog food were found top have pentobarbital in them. I loved the ingredients of Blue Buffalo and they seemed to have an amazing reputation. We slowly, over ~ 10 days, weaned our dogs off Eukanuba and onto Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon. Bad things began happening soon after we started. All 3 dogs stopped having solid feces, and someone vomited everyday. We got through the bad and figured that lot or set of ingredients didn't agree with their digestive systems so we went over to the Duck. Things got worse.<br /><br />After 2 months of this we changed over to Nutro and they have been great since. I contacted Blue Buffalo to let them know our experiences and they replied with an email pretty much saying "Thanks for being a valuable customer"

Pedigree is 68cents a can and our Black Lab always gets complimented for her coat. She reminds us of a miniature black horse with a shiny illustrious mane. So Blue, yah nu-uh. Dogs can't read and are always happy to see their owners feed them even if it's table scraps where both the owner and dog know it's real meat, bones with marrow, vegetables and wheat. If was more competitive maybe just maybe but they're not so why bother.

My dog was the worst, I had to take her out every couple hours for a day and a half and she still had accidents all over the house. She's never been that sick before, poor thing :(. For those of you skeptical of the one star reviews do a little research. Check out consumer affairs, there are numerous similar complaints and Blue Buffalo has done nothing about it. Maybe this used to be a decent food but not anymore. There are serious quality issues, I am never purchasing from Blue Buffalo again.<br /><br />I'm sticking with Orijen and throwing in some Ziwipeak when I can afford it. They cost more but you get what you pay for! With this economy who knows where some of the lower quality food's ingredients are sourced from now to make things cheaper. It's not worth risking the health of my furry little friends :/.

Unfortunately, even after switching brands gradually, our dog continues to have abnormally soft stools.  He did seem to love the taste...  but I am currently feeding him homemade ground turkey/ rice combo. and will gradually get him started on a different blue buffalo type (the large breed version).  We'll see how that one works out... it doesn't have quite as much protein and we're hopeful that his system will handle it better.  Update:  Out dog did great after we switched him to the large breed Blue formula.  He is currently on the weight control version and loving it... no more problems.  Very pleased with the brand overall!

review/summary: Compared to the others, this looks the best
review/text: I have been researching and gathering all the info I can. Heard an informative video from Dr Karen Becker on YouTube on how to read ingredients.<br />My only concern is the chicken is not ORGANIC, meaning the chicken ate GMO corn/soy. "Natural flavor" can be processed free glutamic acid or MSG as a flavor enhancer. However, of ALL the other brands, this one is probably the best. The bags are smaller. I read P & G bought INNOVA EVO and the ingredients had changed. DIAMOND is a company that own Artemis, Canidae, Chicken Soup, Sold Gold, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild and Wellness. Research this company and decide.<br />I make homemade food, however, when I travel, I must board my dog and they do not (sadly) accommodate refrigerating Riley's food! Most NAME BRAND foods are cheap and harmful to our dogs health. Some people claim their dog "loves" the food, however, it is made with flavor enhancers for that purpose. Vet's get a kickback and the food they sell is sub quality. You can read the research for yourself and decide. Also, BEWARE of GHOST WRITERS who are paid to write on these sites to promote their company's product.<br />If you can, make your dogs food with ORGANIC chicken. GMO's, antibiotics, pesticides, fillers and chemicals will take their toll on your pets health, just like it is taking on ours.<br />DRY is the least preferred for food, but dehydrated raw and "Human grade" are just too expensive. For large dogs, even canned is quite costly.<br /><br />Our pets are relying on us to make good decisions, and believe me it is not easy considering all the marketing deception.Go to YouTube and listen to Dr Karen Becker, search the Internet, learn to recognize good ingredients NO GRAINS should be in your dogs food! GOOD LUCK!

We started all 3 back on Science Diet and within a couple of days they were all back to normal.  I threw out the Blue and will never risk using it again.

review/summary: This Dog Food Wreaks Havoc on Dog's Digestive Tract (and Backyard Grass)
review/text: Our labrador has an iron constitution. She has eaten a broad variety of food (and other strange things that she finds under bushes on walks from time to time), and has been like a machine producing the solidest stool for the last 8 years (I've actually bragged about this...something you too might be prone to do if you live somewhere where you must pick up after your dog with little baggies). This food, however, has turned her into a a diarrhea fountain. Not to mention that we can no longer allow her to wander into our room at night...the stench of her gas will wake us from the soundest sleep. While this has been unpleasant for us, I simply feel like we've been torturing her poor belly with this "premium" dog for for the past three weeks. We've tried to hold on for half a bag, but I'm changing back tomorrow. AVOID THIS FOOD!!!

There's no dilution in it and for anyone who loves the taste of vanilla it will WOW your taste buds.  To really experience the flavor of vanilla you need to get this vanilla.  Once any of my clients try anything with this vanilla they're always asking how I get the rich vanilla flavor in the food - it's simple use the Madagascar vanilla!

review/summary: Excellent low-calorie protein snack
review/text: Think thin bites taste really great and are only 100 calories.  Most protein bars are high-calorie (at least 150 and often over 200 calories).  I wanted a 100-calorie choice and am very happy with this product.  The bars taste wonderful and go very well with morning coffee.  I think they taste more like peanuts than toffee, so perhaps they should be renamed chocolate-peanut.  In any case though, this product is delicious and provides 6g of protein and some hunger control for only 100 calories.  These bites are smaller than regular protein bars, so don't expect a big bar.  I think it's nice that they are called bites not bars, since their size might otherwise be surprising.

review/text: I really enjoy the Think Thin Bites. The Chocolate Toffee Nut does not taste like Chocolate Toffee Nut, but I do like it. It's more like Peanut Butter. I decided to order on Amazon to save a couple dollars on a box. This item sat on a hot truck all day, then sat on my door step for however long. By the time I picked up the box the bites were so soft they were just short of liquid. I figured no biggie, I'll just put them in the fridge. The bites did solidify, they just weren't the same. I will definitely order them from Amazon again, just not in the summer.

I usually get them at Trader Joe's but Amazon price is same so I'll probably order here next time.

review/text: These are delicious, especially for something that is sugar-free.  They are light, with a nutty, chocolatey taste.  I thought there was a light toffee flavor; if you're looking for more toffee, this is not the way to go.  I was surprised they were creamy inside, but this did nothing to detract from the flavor.  My only complaint is that I typically want more (they are rather small), so perhaps not the best choice for weight loss.  :/  I'd go with something that has more volume for 100 calories.

review/summary: Good Tasting, Diabetic Friendly - Recommended
review/text: These thinkThin "100 Chocolate Toffee Nut Bites" are good tasting and filling. These are not as pictured on the box, but are rather a soft cake with a chocolate coating.<br /><br />The taste is better than most "diet" snacks and they are also diabetic friendly at less than 6 Net Carbs per bar and only 100 Calories. These do contain Maltitol and that can cause "gastric distress" that varies in severity from person to person, so you might want to see how these effect you before enjoying one of these and heading out to your weekly Book Club meeting.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/text: These little bars are incredibly hard to eat. The first bite is doable - I love ThinkThin bars generally, and I was expecting a bit of the fake sugar taste. But after the first bite you stop because there is an overwhelming amount of sugar - fake sugar - taste. Maybe the goal is to make you stop eating? I bought a large pack and I am now stuck with a shelf full of inedible bars... I will stick to the regular ThinkThins from now on.

review/summary: Drink white tea, reward good work by good people
review/text: It's interesting how one gets to expand his tea horizons. I stumbled upon the Teatulia only because my regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EU85DE">White Ambrosia, White Lion Tea</a> was temporarily unavailable at Amazon (just checked, it's back and I ordered some while writing this review) which I ordered after I exhausted my supply of Revolution Tea White Chai Tea sold out and never reappeared.<br /><br />Well... surprise, surprise - Teatulia is not bad at all. Maybe a little harsher (some peach flavor added to smooth it out) than the uber-smooth White Lion but it's a honest, drinkable tea, with the full leaves delivered in those nice pyramid-shaped bags that protect the leaves inside.<br /><br />And when I say 'honest', consider this: there's an note on the box that advises you to brew each bag TWICE, which I do and I'm very happy with the results. Also from the box I learned that the tea is apparently produced by a local cooperative in Bangladesh so proceeds go back to the local people, it all comes from a single garden (no impossible to trace blends) and it's certified organic - "all Teatulia teas and herbs are sourced directly from the Kazi-Kazi Estate in Bangladesh. I suppose the pyramid bags are the product of some industrial process but the makers claim that most of what you get is handmade, including the nice paper boxes.<br /><br />It's hard for me to decide whether I prefer White Lion or Teatulia at this time. It comes very close to a draw maybe with some advantage to the White Lion because I currently prefer my tea in 'extra smooth' but preferences change. For the time being I'll be drinking Teatulia at the office and White Lion when at home. I am planning to buy some more once the current supply is exhausted.<br /><br />If you're into white tea - an acquired taste - or curious about sampling it, you can't go wrong with Teatulia. Give it a try and, remember, you probably help some nice people struggling to make a living out there in Bangladesh if you buy their good product.<br /><br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />If anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: "white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing." What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.

It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.

review/summary: Using this item for years
review/text: Our family has been getting this for several years at our BJ'S store but recently have not been able to find it at any stores.  I have tried the others available at my local supermarket, Wal-mart, etc. but they just do not compare to the Victorian Inn.  When they still did not have it on my last visit to BJ'S, I decided to see if it was online and I found it.  I will be putting in another order for 6 or more cans very soon.

review/summary: Very good flavor
review/text: I love cappuccino, and I've been searching for a mix that tastes like the brand I got hooked on, Big Train, which I have been unable to find.  I decided to buy Victorian Inn from Amazon based on reviews and just tried it today.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Very good flavor and price<br />* Good to add to your regular cup of coffee instead of cream and sugar<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It was kind of weak.  I had to use a lot of the mix to get a good amount of flavor in my cup.

review/summary: I love this stuff!!
review/text: I always buy this at BJ's, but don't get there often and get very cranky when I run out!!  I'm so glad to see they sell this online now!  This has been a favorite hot beverage for 10+ years.  It's also great in the summer, if you blend it with milk (or water) and ice.  Makes a great slushy frozen cappuccino.  Far cheaper than Frappuccinos from Starbucks and tastes better in my opinion.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Like It Hot?
review/text: There are lots of "hot sauces" that just go for being the hottest. But unlike something that is basically pepper extract for the sake of being hot, this stuff actually tastes good. And make no mistake...it's HOT. Very hot.<br /><br />For the average person who doesn't eat a lot of spicy/hot food, 2 drops in a large bowl of chili will have them running for something to drink. For those of us who enjoy the spicier side of cuisine, 5+ drops in a bowl of chili is pure watery-eyes goodness.<br /><br />I have also used this in stir-fry, soups, Chinese food, flavored rice, pot roasts...you name it. I definitely recommend this if you want something to really spice up your food and yet add some flavor instead of just insane hotness for the sake of it.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Definitely one of the better tasting hot sauces not the hottest on the market but with all the additional fruits in the ingredients it wasn't made to be the hottest. Try this in ketchup with french fries, the ketchup dilutes some of the heat but leaves the great taste! 5 stars

review/summary: This sauce is super hot.........
review/text: I had tried Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce before, and was really impressed with the heat, but not the flavor. So I wanted something with a lot of heat, and a lot of flavor this time. This was a great choice! I work at a hot wing joint, and our X-tra Hot is pretty warm, and customers sometimes place orders where they want it "as hot as you can get it." I put three drops of this on a hot wing and WOW.....I didn't want to to finish the wing....the heat comes on strong at about 30 seconds to a 1:30. It lasts for a few minutes as well.....I'm thinking of talking my boss into letting me use this on one of those orders where the customer wants it "as hot as you can get it" because I guarantee this will be too much for anyone. The flavor is really smooth as well, a little smokey, but not much. As far as heat goes, on a scale of one to ten, I would give it about an 8.

review/summary: Tasty Brown Rice
review/text: If you're looking for some tasty brown rice, this brand is great.  I made it tonight for the first time and loved it.  One serving size (3/4 cup cooked or 1/4 cup uncooked) provides 42g of whole grain and is only 150 calories. It was moist and tasty.  I love to cook vegetables in olive oil: zucchini, onions, spinach, red pepper, add black beans and brown rice and it's a complete meal of whole grains, vegetables and protein.  I serve it for dinner and it tastes great the next day heated up for lunch.  Also love to saute chicken strips dipped in whole grain bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and mix them with brown rice.  Will be buying more of this brand.

review/text: This takes forever to cook and no matter how you cook it, it comes out mushy and has spots that don't look appealing.  There are better brown rices out there.  Don't try this one.

review/text: Walkerswood Sorrell chutney is unbelievable, spicy or not, for use with any kind of chicken, meat, egges, tofu or vegetable.  You can cook with it or eat it raw.  More than a bit of Jamaica in my home.
