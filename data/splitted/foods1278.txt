review/summary: Only oatmeal my baby will eat
review/text: This stuff is fantastic!  My son started on rice cereal and wasn't a huge fan--but then we tried him on this oatmeal and he goos and gaas with joy and smacks his lips and smiles because of this oatmeal.<br /><br />Our grocery store doesn't carry this so we had to buy another brand one time--we thought "what's the diff--it's oatmeal right?"<br /><br />My son got all excited since he thought he was getting fed--opened his mouth, literally gagged and then started crying....<br /><br />Lesson learned.

review/summary: Rancid Smell and Taste
review/text: I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.

review/summary: Contains Life's DHA
review/text: I do like this better than the Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal (made my baby constipated). However, I will not continue to buy this product. THIS IS COMPLETELY MY FAULT FOR NOT DOING MORE RESEARCH. The company claims that none of the DHA used in their products was produced using the "hexane method". However, the company that produces Life's DHA, claims that they only use the hexane method, because it is the only FDA approved method. I tried questioning both Happybaby, as well as Martek (makes Life's DHA), but didn't get a response from either company. If you are wondering what's so bad about Life's DHA, and the Hexane method... Google: Hexane method Life's DHA.<br /><br />I have the grain blender for my Vitamix, so I will make my daughter's cereal that way from now on.

review/summary: Weird smell and taste!
review/text: Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can, it smells like green apple candy.  However, the taste does not have any apple flavor, or even "grain-flavor" like the other cereals but a little weird/chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.<br /><br />Back to Gerber & EB for my son...

I don't think I will purchase this item again through Amazon, although I do purchase the majority of items for my twins(including diapers) at a great price from them.

review/text: I recently started my 18-month old son on this cereal and both he and I are very happy with it - I wish I had found it sooner! It is gluten free and provides 60% of his required iron (as well as a lot of other things he needs to grow well). He likes the taste and it mixes easily.<br /><br />My only complaint has less to do with the product itself than the packaging; the cans are only 3/4 full, which is a blatant and shameful waste on the part of the manufacturer.

review/text: My daughter has a tendency to be a picky eater.  I am not sure where this came from b/c other kids are not.  But this product, she doesn't seem to 'reverse eat' as we like to call it.  But the product itself is very pricey for the amount that you get (7oz vs 16 ozreg for same price).  But,all in all, the ingredients are good for my little one. We take probiotics, DHA, and eat brown rice, so why would we feed her differently?

review/summary: Great product, reasonable price
review/text: We only fed our son rice cereal for about 2 weeks - he vastly prefers the taste of oats. This cereal mixes instantly, and combines well with other foods. The addition of DHA and probiotic supplements is an important factor in our decision to buy this product.<br /><br />It was a little disconcerting to open the cannister for the first time and see that it had settled to the point that it appeared only half full. The label says this may happen...it's a shame that so much packaging is wasted, though.<br /><br />Tip: We saved the scoop from his formula and use it to measure the cereal from the cannister.

review/summary: My son loves this cereal!
review/text: No joke--this was the first solid food we gave our son and he went "hmm hmm" (yum yum). We now give this to him one or two times a day (he is 7 months now) and often mix it with apples, or pear, or other foods too.  He really enjoys this and I like that it has probiotics. It does seem like a large amount of creal in one order, esp if you aren't sure if your child will like it. But if you plan to feed cereal to your baby while supplementing with other solid foods, I would say this is one of the best rice cereals available.

review/text: My wife and I tried so many different types of cereal, and every time my daughter would give us this "what in the world is this stuff" face. She would then not eat no matter how hard we tried. Our friend recommended this rice cereal, and we have never looked back. My daughter loves this, and gets it three times a day. We love it because not only is it organic, but it has other vitamins and nutrients vital to the development of any child. Whats even better is that with this pack of 6 we are able to have plenty and not have to worry for weeks, and the subscription makes it even cheaper than if you were to buy it in any retail store.

review/text: My son loves this stuff.  He likes it by itself or when it's mixed with fruits.  We were initially drawn to it at one of the local big box stores because it is multigrain and has DHA and probiotics.  Compared to plain old rice cereal I think this has been a much better choice.  After finding out that our son loves it we started getting it from Amazon and have put it on subscribe and save.  Our little guy is 11 months now and goes through the 6 pack in about a month.  Great product and a better price then we've been able to find locally (plus the convenience of getting it delivered).

review/text: My son LOVES HappyBellies Oatmeal, so I tried the Multigrain and he loved it, too. So did I, until I read the ingredients and noticed that they added glucose to make the cereal sweet. No extra sugar for my darling. Back to the oatmeal version for us since it's naturally sweet. As he's now 10 months old, I'm exposing him to other grains, like quinoa (which is in the multigrain)and complementing his daily grains with the HB oatmeal to get all those good vitamins and probiotics and DHA.

review/summary: Pre and Probiotics Make the Difference!
review/text: I was searching for an organic baby cereal to give to my 2nd daughter because I had not been happy with what I had fed my 1st.  I am not saying that Earth's Best *caused* my daughter's PN allergy, but I was very disillusioned with them, having called and asked about cross contamination and having them dismiss my concerns (now, surprise surprise, everything is labeled for cross-contamination, as it should have been before!).  At any rate, my 1st had eczema and other issues, and although breast fed exclusively for 6 months (and for another 7 thereafter),did not stay on the cereal as long as she could have because of these issues.  So, when it came time to feed my 2nd, I was so happy to find HAPPYBELLIES!  I absolutely LOVE the added pre and probiotics, and think they make all of the difference in the world.  It is so nice to have this included in the cereal, without having to worry about supplementation.  Already at risk for food allergies because of her sister, I feel confident that this has helped boost her developing digestive and immune systems.  And ... so far so good ... she is allergy free! Great for mixing with HAPPYBABY fresh frozen or pouches, I cannot stop raving about this cereal (and continue do so any opportunity I get!!)

Oatmeal was all right, but the other two smelled like they were already stale(the expiration day is May 2013), and they tasted bad too and sticked on my throat when I tried them. My baby cried and refused to eat them. The customer service of Wholefood was very nice and refunded me. I don't think I will buy this brand of cereal again.

review/text: I bought this because I was looking for something with probiotics.  I have purchased a similar product from Plum Organics (contained Pro and prebiotics).  I have purchased several items from HappyBellies before and have been pleased with them all.  I ordered this despite the reviews from others that commented on the rancid smell.  I assume this has to do with the added DHA.  I bought 6 containers.  Opened all 6 and they ALL smelled rancid.  I would never feed this to my child.  Ended up contacting Amazon because there was no return available for this product.  Save yourself the hassle.  Buy Plum Organics Multi grain cereal.

Luckily my son was okay...just getting really chunky from the cereal in general.  So I bought this because it is completely dairy and soy free...and since it's organic and brown rice, much healthier for him.<br /><br />This stuff actually smells like rice, not processed shiny flakes.  My son also loves it.  He even makes an "mmmm" sound when I feed it to him.<br /><br />I left out the last star because it's a bit expensive compared to other cereals...  But as they say, you get what you pay for.

I drove my self crazy doing all kinds of research for a safe, BPA free cereal, then drove myself crazy looking at all the research on DHA, and so on.

I will say my local target is currently selling it for only $3.19 a can, which is a little cheaper than amazons current price.

Just opened up a recent case from Amazon and the first two cans out are definately different than what this product has been in the past. It is not white in color, but green/gray, it is also not as 'fluffy'. The rancid / acrid smell is definately present. It smells like a two year old can of holiday nuts that went stale long ago. I am somewhat shocked at the number of reviews and comments that have had a similar issue. The Manufacturer does not list a phone number on their website and e-mail is the only contact method. I got an auto-response e-mail with a 718 number that is no longer in service.....not inspiring much confidence in this brand.

review/text: The probiotics helps my baby's gassiness. However, my 8 month old likes her food thick. No matter how much rice cereal I added, the food practically digests itself (very quickly at that too) before my baby even has a couple spoons of it. Don't understand why it has to contain amylase enzyme. I have let it stand and literally watch it thins itself out, without my baby ever touching the food. I typically added a couple ounces of homemade organic vege with an ounce of breastmilk plus the Earth Best oat and rice together with Happy Bellies, hoping to keep it thick a little longer, but to no avail. I am writing this review because I just threw out another bowl of food because my baby refuses to eat it after a couple spoons since it literally just became soup despite I made it *thick*.

review/summary: DHA and probiotics puts this cereal way above others
review/text: Dr Sears knows babies, and his recommendation of this product went a long way in our decision to purchase it.  At first we were making our own rice cereal out of organic ground brown rice, but of course couldn't add the DHA and probiotics.  Our baby gets those through breastmilk, but it is nice to be able to supplement with the cereal.<br /><br />It is very easy to mix and use, and tastes good.  Much easier than making your own, and way better than any of the Gerber products.  I'd recommend any of the HappyBellies products.

review/summary: Great alternative to Gerber
review/text: I had a hard time finding organic single grain cereal at the store.  All the grocery stores including Central Market and Whole Foods were completely out of the Earth's Best, and I don't really like the Gerber organic.  My baby was exclusively breast fed for the first six months, and I felt like this was the best transition to solids.  I also like that it's brown rice.  I feel good about giving it to my baby, and he likes it!

Not only is this product iron fortified, but also has probiotics. Thank you Happybellies!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I discovered the HappyBellies at Babies R Us and didn't know anything about it. (btw it is more expensive there) We started our baby on it in 4 months. She LOVES it and it is good for her belly. She used to be constipated from time to time even on the breast milk. Now she is much more regular. Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle<br /><br />The only problem i have is what's up with the 3/4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is

review/text: I make my own baby food - it tastes much better than the canned baby food and introduces them to the taste of real food. The only exception is that I give them the Happy Bellies oatmeal as well as their rice and multigrain. These have extra iron formulated to be easily absorbed and also the probiotics which are probably part of the reason both babies are nice and regular. They're organic and whole grain so they're healthy and train the babies taste to like whole grain. I mix it with water and they gobble it up and love it.

review/summary: multigrain version does not appeal to either of my twins
review/text: My now 1 yr old babies love the rice and oatmeal versions of this cereal, but hate the multigrain version.  Pity that I tried it out<br />as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a slightly stale<br />smell to it -- perhaps they don't wash the quinoa enough before processing it?  I taste everything my babies eat, and have<br />to mention that it does not have the melt in the mouth texture of the other two besides not tasting good.  My babies will eat quinoa for eg<br />when I cook it for family meals.  And amaranth in flakes from their brother's cereals.  Buy a single can from whole foods<br />or target etc before buying a multi pack.  They won't even eat it if I put in one tablespoon to 5 of rice cereal.  Ended up just tossing the open can.<br />Either of these is fantastic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSTGGW">HAPPYBELLIES Brown Rice Cereal Contains DHA and Probiotics, Organic, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSS7EO">HAPPYBELLIES Oatmeal Cereal, Organic, Contains DHA and Probiotics, 7-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: The can of oatmeal clearly says they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek). If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae. Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane. Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid. I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.

Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now.

review/summary: Had been wonderful until September 2010 - now bad color/smell
review/text: My son (now 9 months old) has been eating HAPPYBELLIES organic oatmeal cereal twice a day since he was 6 months old, and loves it. So I love it too - until recently. The last container I bought had a different color and smell. All our cereal until now had been a cream-ish color, soft and flaky in texture and smelled like, well, oats. Not anymore. The recent batch had cereal that had black/gray-ish flakes mixed with the regular-looking oat flakes, and it smelled horrible, almost like mold or really, really rancid oil. I had bought that batch from [...] and they promptly issued a refund. Now I'm a fix as to what to feed my baby! I don't want to experiment with an unfamiliar brand given how much he loves this one, but again I don't want him to eat what clearly doesn't look or smell like food.<br /><br />Can someone, from either Amazon or HAPPYBELLIES, please repond to this and other similar concerns and put them to rest?

review/summary: Baby developed yeast diaper rash after trying this cereal
review/text: I have been giving my 8 month old happy bellies for the last month and noticed that after a process of elimination, this cereal has caused my baby to have a yeast diaper rash. She loved eating it so I gave it to her daily. I've done everything to take care of her diaper rash but it persisted even after I started applying nystatin which her pediatrician prescribed. I then decided to eliminate foods and monitor what happened to the rash and identified the happy bellies as the culprit. It's too bad because I thought that the probiotics would do her good but instead she's developed an annoying yeast diaper rash. Has anyone else's baby had any allergic reactions to this cereal?

It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too.

review/text: I use a ton of "greenies" or other dental products for my little dog (a 7 lb Yorkie/Maltese mix.)  She used to hate it when I left the house, so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only.  However, she was started to get a little chunky, so thought switching her to the "light" version  might be a better option.  I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system, but I've seen no problem thus far, and I've been using them for over a week.  She doesn't seem to notice a difference at all, and I feel comfortable knowing I'm not overfeeding her (in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place!) I would definitely recommend this product.

We have been giving our babies these treats since our 12 year old was a puppy, the vet says she has the best teeth of any 12 year old yorkie she has ever seen. The little one is no slouch either.<br />But Yorkies are nortorious for getting bad teeth. Not ours. They love the greenies and the teenie lites are perfect for their after our dinner treats. And made in America. How much better can you get then that? Your pets are important, treat them  to a greenie!

review/summary: my dog goes crazy!
review/text: My dog absolutely LOVES greenies!!! Started him out on regular ones, but because I give him two a day, I buy the smallest ones in the "lite" version and give him one in the morning as a reward for "doing his business" and going back inside when I ask (it helps that he knows he'll get one if he goes inside) and one at night, once again, for going back inside. I keep them in the freezer and he loves them cold. It makes me happy that these will help with his dental care. Its fun to see him get so excited! LOL.

review/summary: Summer Savory
review/text: Unlike the ground savory, which comes from a perennial plant, summer savory is from an annual plant and is milder and not bitter.  I wouldn't dream of making chicken stew without summer savory.  I also add it to fish and egg dishes as well as pea soup. When I lived in northern Maine I could find it in all the grocery stores, but here in Connecticut I have not been able to find it anywhere, even at stores that carry the Spice Islands brand.  Apparently, the people who order the spices are not familiar with it and don't realize how summer savory can "spice up" their meals.  Thanks to Amazon, my daughters and I don't have to worry about running out of this wonderful product.

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/text: For the sale price, this box filled my jumbo litter box 1.5 times that is used by two cats. I scoop multiple times a day, so it seems a box will last 10 days max before needing a complete refill.<br /><br />But what I do like is the texture is small grained and silken so that it doesnt get flicked everywhere when they dig around or jump out of the box and want to shake off and gravel that might cling. My cats were raised on corn/scoop/flushable so they were able to adjust to a new more affordable litter. Great deal, pricing on Amazon.

review/text: I have had excellent luck purchasing from Amazon (and I order a lot of items) until today.  Two items arrived - packaged separately. One was broken. The other was SUPPOSED to be a box of Scoop Away Free.  I opened the undamaged package to find the box of kitty litter totally split open and dumped out into the larger cardboard packaging box.  After much ado to get the litter into a plastic bag, I looked at the litter box and saw that they had sent me Unscented with Ammonia Shield (which I cannot use) rather than the FREE version of the litter.  As this item is not returnable for any reason, I am simply out of pocket on this.

review/summary: My All-Time Favorite Broth!!!
review/text: I find it interesting that there are those who have reviewed this and think it is like colored water or has no flavor. To me, that is always what beef and chicken broth have been like. I always thought they just tasted like dirty water. They have never given me the flavor I would like to have and always seem so weak and watery.<br /><br />THIS broth on the other hand, really gives things a bolder, richer flavor.<br /><br />When I discovered this mushroom broth, it took my cooking to a whole new level. No, I don't particularly care for the taste of it on it's own, but it adds SUCH a great dimension to the flavor of things I make with it. The main thing I use it for is making a vegetable soup richer. I also add actual mushrooms to the soup and it helps make it more "meaty".<br /><br />The flavor this adds cannot be beat! I am SOOO excited to have found it here on Amazon, as where I currently live, this is not available. Kinda hard to keep the good stuff on hand when you have to drive 150 miles to get it! We absolutely love this product!

review/summary: Underwhelming.
review/text: I didn't try this from Amazon, I bought a box at my local grocery store. I thought this would be a good base for a vegetarian miso soup. The broth is very bland and nearly flavorless to me, and I found cooking didn't help. After adding the seaweed, miso paste, and seasonings, the soup was still lacking. In fact, after serving my vegetarian friends I had to add bonito sauce to bring the flavor up.<br /><br />I didn't find the odor offensive, but the broth was effectively colored water.<br /><br />While I didn't like it and wouldn't recommend it, my vegetarian friends really enjoyed it. I suppose if you don't eat meat then give it a try, but if you're used to chicken or beef broths then you will probably be disappointed.

Can use in any recipe for beef broth and most for chicken broth.  Enjoy experimenting!  GREAT PRODUCT.

review/summary: don't eat chicken or tomatos and limit beef so love this broth
review/text: I do not eat chicken so I substitute turkey when chicken is called for in a recipe, however there is no turkey broth. I can't use vegetable broths because I don't eat tomatos. I have a white chili recipe I love but using beef broth messes it up. The discovery of the mushroom broth was just what I needed. It has nice back up flavor without dominating any dish in which I use it and is great for a healthy saute. I love it and use it all the time.....when I can find it. I decided to check the Pacific website to see if I could locate it in a store near where I work. Lo and behold, they referenced Amazon. What a relief!! I ordered a pack of 12 and since I have Prime, it came to me near the same cost as the store saving me the gas and frustration of trying to find it. I will be ordering it regularly!!!

review/summary: Worst broth ever
review/text: I bought a case of this mushroom broth based on the 2 positive reviews, but I do believe now that those aren't real reviews. They were probably written by someone hired by the seller to induce people to buy. First of all, the broth has a smell of mushroom gone bad. Second, it has a bland and flat salty taste to it, and NO other flavors. I love mushroom and the sweetness of mushroom. When I cook mushroom in water, the water become very flavorful. Not this broth. It tastes like water mixed with salt and rotten mushroom. I used some of it to make soup, but the smell was so bad that I ended having to throw out the whole thing. I would have been better off buying fresh mushroom to cook and make broth. It would have tasted 100% better AND cheaper, too. I wished I had gone to the market and just buy one container to try out before buying a whole case from Amazon. Wasted my money because Amazon won't accept returns of grocery items.<br />If you want to try out for yourself, do yourself a favor, buy one small carton at the market (like Whole Food) and try it out, so you won't waste $35-$40 like I did.

review/text: I bought this syrup to try something different and because maple syrup is too expensive. Though the formula contains no high fructose corn syrup, there is plenty of sugar to make up for it. Sugar, in fact, is the first ingredient listed. The blueberry flavor comes from the blueberry juice from concentrate, probably not the apple juice, or pear juice, or elderberry juice or the clarified lemon juice from concentrate.<br /><br />Great blueberry flavor here and a viscosity that's perfect for pouring, not too thin and not too thick. Also the syrup is allergen and gluten free. I just care about the taste which is pretty good.

review/text: I have become a huge fan of Veri Peri ever since I tried it a few weeks ago. I find that all of them have such a unique taste and they are all delicious but I'm just going to talk about the garlic now. I have used this sauce while sauteing shrimp, i have added to salad dressing to give it some panache, and I have mixed it in my hamburger meat before grilling it so the flavor cooks right in to the meat. I can't explain how many ways you can use this sauce. I have literally just poured it on food that was already prepared as a condiment. All that is great but what really makes this sauce so invaluable to me is the taste. Hands down I have never had anything like it before. I use it every time I really want my food to stand out. As a matter of fact of I can't think of too many time when I don't use Veri Peri.

Infuriating.  Plus, they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup, so when you remove the steeper, you're left with a 1/2 cup of tea.  One other thing, there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures.  It's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper, for what purpose I can't tell.  It might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down, so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing.  I was disappointed by these.  Great looks, little function.  My hunt continues.

review/text: If you are a loose leaf tea drinker then this little gadget should be a permanent part of your life. I bought several. Work, home, car, travel bag. Cleans easily, folds up small and handy, works great. Cannot ask for more than that. A pleasure not to depend on tea bags in a hotel. Of course you have to carry the tea also for most of the places. At home I use a multi-cup tea maker but once in a while I want just one quick cup and using this steeper is perfect.

review/text: Have loose tea when you want.  When on the road most gas stations have a hot water dispenser so it makes it easy to carry your tea in a ziplock baggie and use this nifty little steeper.  Clean up is a breeze!  I have one for the office too.

review/summary: Easy to use and clean
review/text: Of all the tea steepers I have used I think I like this one the best. Very easy to use and clean up and folds for travel if you so desire.  What makes it better than the others is just putting it in the cup with as much tea as I want and filling with water. It is a bit big so it easier with a big cup but it will work in a smaller cup too.
