review/summary: Great Corn Flour, Not Gluten Free
review/text: This is wonderful tasting corn flour, some of the best I've had. Perfectly milled. Beautiful color.<br /><br />I emailed the company and asked if their flour is gluten free before I ordered it, sadly it isn't. It's made on shared equipment with wheat and other flours :(<br /><br />I switched to a gluten free diet and was hoping that it would be OK, not knowing my level of sensitivity. Unfortunately, I don't think I can order this again.<br /><br />The company was very responsive and replied quickly to my email and explained things in detail, I very much appreciate that! If the company would process this corn flour gluten free, I'd buy it all the time! Please... :)

review/summary: Unable to make tortillas, different taste.
review/text: First, I am Mexican, and have always made my own tortillas using Maseca. Due to changes on eating habits, we were looking for organic corn flour to continue making our tortillas. I received my package yesterday and could not wait to get started. Before I bought this product, I read both reviews and simply thought that the lady who could not make tortillas was perhaps inexperienced, but that is not the case. This flour is not made for tortillas, the texture of the made masa is not right, it needs a "binder" like you would need xanthan gum if you are baking gluten-free. I would love for the company to specify in the product what this flour makes and what does not. In Mexico we simply call it "harina de maiz" (corn four), so to me, this was it. I tried the company, but they are closed as it is  Saturday. I will try them again on Monday because I don't know what to do/make with 25 lbs. of flour that was bought to make tortillas and gorditas. Thank you.

review/text: I followed a corn tortilla recipe to the "T" and they turn out oweful. I don't know if it's this flour or what, but I'm very disappointed. I'll make them again and see if I can figure it out, if they turn out bad again, I'll never buy this corn flour again!!!

review/summary: Delicious honey with a full flavor
review/text: I'd forgotten how real honey tastes, it's been so long - honey has really gotten diluted, likely from the factory treatment of bees. I know this sounds silly but it's actually true.<br />Besides being delicious, I've also found a possible beneficial side effect - my previous flower allergies have gotten better. They were never that bad, no daily Claritin use or anything but they were there. Now when I start to get that tickling etc sensation I have a teaspoon or so of honey and I notice by the next day the allergy is gone though the flowers remain.

review/summary: Outrageously priced (and I don't mean outrageously good)
review/text: It's all my fault for not reading the listing more carefully. I must have been in some sort of candy frenzy (I ordered a big bag of circus peanuts at the same time). "Bulk" makes you think that this is a very large bag of Smarties, and "1lb" drives it home, but 1 pound is 16 ounces...and you can buy an 18-ounce bag of Smarties at Target for less than $3.00--and you don't have to pay another $5.50 (more than the price of the product!) for shipping. (And if you wait for Halloween, certain stores sell 2-pound bags for about $5.00. Smarties overload!)<br /><br />The product was good, but I paid about four times too much for it. Don't make the same mistake.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I used to buy these when I was growing up at a candy store in my hometown. The candy store was gone on my last visit home and I was disappointed. Thank goodness for Amazon and the wonderful sellers here!<br />The outside of these is like the wafers in a Kit Kat. Made of cornstarch and doesn't have much taste on it's own. It's the filling of sugary little beads that make these my favorite. They rattle inside the shell so little kids like to play with them even before eating. The box says 8 pieces is a serving for 157 calories, 2 calories from fat. There is 0g total fat, 31mg sodium and 25g sugars. Not too bad for candy.<br />The box comes with all 240 of them loose in the box and I was afraid that they would go stale before we ate them as I wanted to savor them as long as I could. I opened the first box and then took them to work and had mixed reviews of those who liked them and those who didn't but none of them had ever tried them before. After a week they are still fresh and I have left them in the original box which is a retail selling box that does not seal... there is a cut around the white square on the top of the box so the lid can double as a retail sign when the lid is opened. This does not affect the candy, they are just as fresh as the day I opened them!<br />These would be perfect for a child's birthday party or a candy table for a wedding.<br />My only con? Trying to eat only 8 (the serving size). If you like them then let me warn you... they are addicting!<br />I will definitely buy more!

review/summary: Too buttery
review/text: This popcorn just oozes a greasy, buttery mess when you take it out of the microwave.  It pours out of the bag.  Yuck!  In fact, the microwave itself is covered in it.  Amazon was  not selling the Pop-Secret Homestyle brand, so I opted to try this one.  My husband and I are completely addicted to the Homestyle and have a big bowl every single night.  Horrible habit but it is the best popcorn I've ever had.  We are terrified they will stop making it and we won't be able to get our snack fix! :)  Avoid this popcorn and buy the Homestyle!!

It is just salty enough for you and the butter is made from the best real butter there is which is Land of the Lakes.  I just hit the popcorn button and it stops by itself all but a tiny spoonful of kernals are popped on each bag.  I never have a greasy buttery mess like other brands of popcorn, so this is a keeper and a MUST HAVE at our house!!!  Good Job Pop Secret!

When it was time to buy more, I decided to go with this brand due to the "A-Grade" in the title and some of the positive customer reviews.<br /><br />This tea is nowhere near as tasty as Delisse and is completely ineffective at the rejuvenatory things coca tea has a reputation for, much less so than a regular cup of coffee.  Just tasted like dirty water.<br /><br />I also don't like how the seller sells the tea in his own pouches instead of factory cartons. who knows what has transpired between the two?

review/text: This is a message I sent- hopefully I'll get a reply-<br />Hello 'Mysterious Bolivian'<br />This is the first time I ordered the Highland Coca Tea from you and was very happy that it arrived a day before estimated time. And I also like the lip-balm.<br /><br />My question to you is about the tea's action. I have drank more than two cups a day and I haven't felt a thing. Right now I just finished a cup with 2 tea bags and still nothing? I think I might have gotten a bad batch?<br /><br />It is very tasty and I like the grassy fresh flavor. It is very close in flavor to green tea and I'm wondering if that's what's in my bag instead of the intended product.<br /><br />Obviously good green tea is expensive , but not as much as I paid for this tea. Can  you please tell me what I should do. I got the tea as am alternative to coffee, because after one cup of coffee I get jittery, but this is not doing anything.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />**** UPDATE I got a prompt reply from the company and was given instructions on how to test the tea I got to make sure it's authentic and it was, just very weak-that's all.

review/summary: Try McMate Coca tea. It's remarkable!
review/text: Paper wraps are known to dry the delicate crushed coca inside the tea bags and the ink used can alter the flavor. McMate Caranavi is a Eco-friendly line. The Silver Biopack pouches are a secure biodegradable packaging material, this new type of proactive bio-based packaging extends the shelf-life after opening, reducing the growth of moulds and development of rancid taste.<br />The tea is extremely fresh, very tasty and crisp compared to the other brands and even better that the Previous McMate Gold ( that was my favorite for over a year ).<br />Medical uses of coca focus on its stimulant qualities, to overcome common fatigue, hunger, and thirst, Coca Tea is particularly effective against altitude related sickness and headaches ( US Embassy web site in Bolivia recomends coca tea !! ). Concentrated coca drinks and the like have been reported as a treatment for malaria side-effects, asthma and respiratory tract problems, help to improve digestion and to treat ulcers, prevent digestive problems, as an aphrodisiac agent, and credited with improving general health and longevity.<br />As previously mentioned, coca is also commonly used as a general anaesthetic to alleviate various pain of headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, rheumatism, topical wounds and sores.

review/summary: Shipping Issues
review/text: I love this product.  It has truly been a life saver for me.  I didn't give it five stars because the shipping is terrible.  It costs 8.99 for each item shipped.  They offer no combined shipping charges.  If you want expedited shipping for two items I paid 27.99.  I placed the order on 9/14/12 and it is now 9/19/12 and I've not received the tea.  I paid the extra to have it shipped quickly.  The original person I emailed back and forth with was very nice and accommodating.  He understood my frustration and tried to help any way that he  could.  The person I am presently dealing with is patronizing.  Otherwise, man this is good stuff and I highly recommnend it especially if you have trouble with depression.

review/summary: Great product; extortionate postage made a �25 item cost �75!!
review/text: The product is fantastic - a lovely tasting tea that brings clarity, peace of mind, and a really positive natural energy.  I would buy it regularly except for the ridiculous postage and customs charges.  The postage was MORE than the actual product itself - �27! However I do believe the tea is very reasonably priced, at around �23 for 100 tea bags (no more than any other herbal tea that you can buy at health food stores).  And there's NO MATCH for coca tea ;-) so I thought ok, i'll do it this once its worth it... And then I was hit with A FURTHER �25 customs charge that I was forced to pay or my product would be going back to sender.  I was not going to let it go back when I'd already paid double for it!  I wasn't informed that there was a possibility of this happening, and my TOTAL CHARGE FOR A �25 PRODUCT NOW CAME TO �75!! It wasn't at any point told what the postal costs covered. What exactly was I paying for if not the ensuing customs charges? I was also not notified that my package was even being held anywhere, it just didn't show up and I had to contact the seller to ask what was going on. I was further unimpressed by the defensive attitude of the response I got, which stated that THEY had to pay an extremely high postage to get it to ME(?!?!).  I'm sorry but I have a hard time believing that when I'd just paid �50 to get a �25 item delivered!! Are they telling me that it cost MORE than �50? That they too paid high postage prices on top of mine? I don't think so, whatever they had to pay they would have made sure they covered it with what they charged me. If I am wrong I strongly suggest they investigate the postal services that they are using for over-charging as I have never heard of anything quite so unreasonable. I've given it a high rating only because the actual tea is such a GREAT PRODUCT, but I won't be buying it here again. I don't know what other sellers are like for postage but i'm disappointed with Amazon & with this seller after that experience. I THINK PEOPLE NEED FOREWARNING ABOUT THE CHARGES BEFORE THEY MAKE A DECISION TO BUY. :-)

review/summary: Safety instructions
review/text: All NovoAndina Products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br /><br />NovoAndina products do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All our Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br /><br />Do not store NovoAndina products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Our teas are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

MacMate es una marca solo hecha para exportaci&oacute;n y es casi imposible encontrarla en Bolivia.

review/text: I personally wouldn't order from this company. Here's my story. Today is 29 Jan 08. I placed my order 8 Nov 2007. I ordered 2 bags of this tea. I received one bag after about a month. I contacted the seller by email and they said they had made a mistake and another bag would be shipped immediately. Anyhow, I waited another month and still no tea. I contacted them yet again and they claim a mistake was made! I'll say. There was no offer of a refund. Indeed communication seems to have ground to a halt for some inexpicable reason. Anyhow, today I called my bank and requested that half the amount I paid be refunded. So, that's my story. I think if you look at the comments page for the sellers page you will see other tales that make this more than just an anomaly. So, you've been warned.

review/summary: MacMate ... a new experience!
review/text: MacMate deserves an obvious five stars rating, not only because it is our house brand but because this is a new, natural, sophisticated and eco-friendly coca tea.  Most boxed coca teas, Bolivian or Peruvian, are more or less the same as the techniques used for production are very similar with the same contents and weight per tea bag.<br />I have been drinking coca tea for 32 years and have tried them all and liked most. But with MacMate Air Tight Bag, we tried to create an exquisite gourmet tea which is produced differently versus the traditional techniques used for 100 years in Bolivia (Windsor celebrates its 100 anniversary this year).  Specifically, we have obtained the finest selection of organic coca leaves which are free of pesticides and chemicals and arranged for them to be tested in US laboratories.  Thus we have pioneered a top-notch process encompassing all steps in the processing of raw coca leaf to the final tea bag. The coca leaves go through a slow dehydration process similar to that of slow roasting coffee beans to get a humidity free product to prevent bacteria or fungus from developing and then we crush them into large flakes instead of the powdery-like content used for most brands.  Our filter paper is bleach free and recognizable by its beige-like color instead of the traditional bright white.  We opted for the golden Air Tight bag (Double Saran Coated Polyester) to guarantee the absolute freshness of the product and discarded all paper wraps that can interfere with the coca tea flavor or over dry the delicate tea bags. Our Air Tight bags do not "breathe".  The technology used is similar to that used to pack electronic components.  They have a zip lock system and can be recycled or reused.<br />The best thing about MacMate is it freshness.  The tea is only produced one time per week in Bolivia and only for the American market and as soon as it leaves the factory it is packed and sent by air cargo with a three to seven day transit time.  After that it is mailed from Charlotte, NC to all of our customers worldwide.  Enjoy MacMate Air Tight Bag Tea!<br />Sincerely,<br />Carol Blenda Reyes Avila<br />The employees of the Reyes-Avila Corporation

review/summary: WARNING***COCA LEAF WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***
review/text: My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com, people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as "illegal" by the US Government.<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c technically you DID INJEST Cocaine, just in it's natural form.  The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.<br /><br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com

review/summary: Ok decaffeinated coffee
review/text: I have been roasting my own coffee for quite a few years. However, due to blood pressure concerns, I decided to drink more decaffeinated coffee. I purchased this St. Ignatius coffee based on the two good reviews.<br /><br />True, I am new to decaffeinated coffee, and I have never roasted any decaffeinated beans. However, I was surprised at how utterly 'black' this St. Ignatius coffee is (it is also very finely ground).<br /><br />The color could be due to the decaffeinating process, I suppose, although I suspect it is some type of food coloring (one reason I started roasting my own coffee was due to the number of coffee manufacturers who add not only coloring to the ground beans to give it a better 'color', but also add 'fresh roasted scent' to the can, whic quickly evaporates after you open it the first time).<br /><br />The first day I filled up my thermos with this coffee, and subsequently washed it out upon returning home, I was amazed at how many times I had to rinse out the thermos to clean it out: something I never had to do with regular coffee, and which I suspect is due to coloring. The only way I could get coffee this color via roasting is to burn it. Of course, the St. Ignatius does not taste burned.<br /><br />The taste is 'ok'. It is not as 'strong' tasting as the black color of the grounds would suggest. I am now experimenting with mixing in some St. Ignatius coffee with my own coffee to lessen the amount of caffeine.<br /><br />At the grocery store I bought a decaf Community Coffee, which I think tastes better on its own, and is a more normal dark brown color.

review/summary: Decent plant but not from Bonsai Boy, no free shipping
review/text: I ordered this from Amazon recently and it just arrived.  It was packed well and survived fine, however it's nowhere near as well trained as the one shown in the picture- it's more or less a ball of leaves and branches, less bushy than the photo.  It will need a lot of time to turn into something decent, but then again that's half the fun.  Note that it's 12" from the base of the pot, not the base of the soil.  (The container is about 10" by 8" if you're ordering a drip tray for it)<br /><br />There are two oddities: first, the plant is marked as having free shipping.  It does not- it was $4, which is cheaper than most trees but not free.<br /><br />More oddly, it's not from Bonsai Boy.  It's from a company called Lou's Bonsai.  I'm not sure if they are linked- they use the exact same picture of the tree.  I don't really care who grew it first so long as it's healthy, but Amazon could clear up where it's coming from.

review/summary: I am very pleased
review/text: I received my tree today. I ordered this tree on a Sunday and received it on Thursday. Very quick shipping. It was very well packed and only has a few leaves that fell off. I am surprised at how green this tree is. Very green. The soil is still wet too. It looks very similar to the picture. This only downfall is that it is just about 12 inches tall at its highest point. It isn't a big deal for me though. It still looks amazing. I would reccommend this for anyone who likes plants or bonsai trees. I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The link is a picture that I took a couple hours after I received it.

review/summary: What a find!
review/text: Finding these on Amazon was truly a treasure. My wife and I used to roam the streets of Manhattan searching bodegas and corner stores selling the coveted Haribo Roulettes.  We'd often leave home empty handed, but when luck struck and we found a seller, we would buy the remaining candies in the case for upward of $1.50 per roll.<br /><br />Amazon's deal works out to $0.27 per roll. What a deal! The candy came lighting quick and were very fresh. We are extremely satisfied with this product and Amazon.

review/summary: best haribo product
review/text: these have long been my favorite Haribo product, even more than Gold Bears. The chew is stiff, but not too stiff. The flavors are strong, but not overpowering like Jolly Rancher flavors can be.  I even like the packaging in a roll. However, when I bought these, they were Amazon Prime - now, 3 days later, they are not. These are NOT worth a $9 premium on top of the excellent price for shipping. It's a relatively small box for one thing. Put these back on Amazon Prime, make them eligible for a regular subscription, and I'm there again.

review/text: OK, so these are the original gummy bears.  I've had these when I was a kid and the taste brings be back to that time.  They taste just like Haribo's gummy bears, but are in round format.  Here is what I really like about them....they come in rolls.  So, I can take a roll with you on the go.  But...most importantly...since they are in rolls, it limits me to eat just one roll a day!

review/summary: Best gummy ever!
review/text: I came across these gummys at the video rental store, my wife and I quickly became addicted. The store went out of business and closed a short while after. We were in crisis mode. I quickly scoured  the internet and found this little gummy, gold-mine on Amazon. I bought two cases and after devouring them with my wife and dog, I am about to order more.<br /><br />The candies are just like they were at the video store, same quality, box and everything, the only difference is that they work out to about HALF the price on Amazon than individually at the store. If you love Haribo gummys then you'll especially love these.  While the flavors and texture of the Roulettes are exactly the same as the traditional Haribo Bears in the gold pack, these gummys are a more solid, concentrated, chunk of gummy goodness. They are just a little more chompy than the Bears with all the same juicy flavor. One warning once you buy them: YOU WILL FIND THE EMPTY WRAPPERS EVERYWHERE :)

review/text: I first ran across Haribo Roulettes candy when I was in high school on a school trip to Germany.  These candies were amazing then. However, I hadn't thought about them in a while becasue I didn't find them in the gummi candy aisle.  When I found these on line I was ecstatic!  I just received them, opened them up and they were exactly how I remembered!!  They come packaged in a small roll (approx 10 small round pieces per serving), but can be purchased in a larger box for convenience.

review/summary: Too Good For My Own Good!
review/text: I am not a huge fan of some of the Haribo products, but I do love these roulettes for several reasons.  The chew is just perfect.  Not too soft and not hard enough that it makes my jaw hurt, which leads to the real problem with the Roulettes.  I can eat three rolls at one sitting and I want them to last awhile, not to mention, I don't want my waist expanding!<br /><br />There are four flavors in the roll:<br /><br />White - Pineapple<br />Green - Strawberry<br />Yellow - Lemon<br />Red - Cherry<br /><br />The green is my favorite, then the white.  The flavors in the roll are not divided evenly but frankly, that is fine with me as sometimes I feel like more green and sometimes I feel like more white or red, so I can grab a roll based on the ratio of my preferred flavor of the day.<br /><br />I love the individual rolls as I can easily keep them in my purse and grab a roll on the go.  The shape of the Roulettes is quite nice as well as they just fit and feel really good in the mouth and are very easy to eat.  So far, the Roulettes are my favorites out of all the Haribo candy I have tried.<br /><br />The box arrived securely tucked inside a bigger box and I have a monthly deliverly subscription.

These are no exception.  And with Amazon pricing & S&S discounts you cant go wrong!

review/summary: This is OK but so so. If you like FIRM gummies, these are for you.
review/text: The Haribo Roulettes are OK. Its nothing great though.<br />And the flavors come in:<br />-Yellow: Lemon. It was ok<br />-Clear: Pineapple. I usually don't like pineapple but I like how these tasted<br />-Orange: Orange flavored. Not strong but theres enough flavor in it<br />-Green: I think this is suppose to be apple but I can't taste it no matter how many times I eat it<br />-Red: Strawberry (Very slight hint of it)<br /><br />I ordered a box of these but I don't think I will again. There was nothing wrong with em but there was nothing special to me about them either.<br /><br />If you've tried Haribo Gold Gummy Bears and noticed how FIRM the Gummy was, these are exactly the same.<br /><br />You have to chew these quite a bit so they can make your jaw sore (mine was after the third roll).<br />If you like something to chew on thats firm then these are for you.<br /><br />Unfortunately I like soft gummies that don't require too much chewing so these aren't exactly for me.<br /><br />Each of the Gummies are about the same size as a penny but about 8cm thick. I thought they would be a little bigger too from the Amazon picture.<br />The Entire Roll has 10 pieces each and is about 3 inches long (not counting the twisted wrapper ends).<br /><br />If you've never tried Haribo before, go the grocers and buy a bag of Haribo Gold to get a general idea of their firmness before spending any more money on larger quantities.

review/text: The first thing I noticed when eating these for the first time is that these taste exactly like the Haribo Gold Bears - which are fantastic. So basically they are Gold Bears but in a different shape - little roulettes or little hockey pucks. My biggest problem with these is I thought they were too hard. They might taste like the Gold Bears but they are not as soft. I don't think I'll be buying these again. But I will buy more of the Gold Bears.

review/text: They are made in GERMANY.  That's the origin folks of gummy bears, as most of you already know.  What you do not know is that most all Haribo gummy bears, and many other haribo gummy candies you get in the states, and here on amazon, are NOT made in Germany. They are certainly good but they are made in other countries and are not near the same quality and taste as the German ones.  My mom's best friend is from Germany and I always ask her friend and her family to bring/send German Gummy bears. If you want to have good gummy bears, look for one's made IN Germany.  You will pay more for them, but they are worth it!  Enjoy!

Haven't been able to find them since, until now.<br /><br />These are quite like the Haribo Gold Bears in texture and flavor.  They have a nice firmness that is missing in a lot of gummy candy.  They will take you a while to chew!  The flavors are true and don't have any odd aftertastes.<br /><br />Note, the rolls are not uniform in the flavor selection.  You may get a roll without any green, or a roll with a lot of red, etc.  I find that makes it more interesting.<br /><br />Since I don't allow myself to have these often, the box lasts quite a long time.  And you can't beat the price!

review/text: If you're going to complain about the firmness of these Haribo Candies then obviously you've never had other Haribo products. They are meant to be firm so it doesn't take half a second to gulp one down. Take your time eating them instead of shoving 10 in your mouth at once. Maybe then you'll realize gummy bears are better firm. They last longer and you don't have to eat as many to get the same satisfaction. Typical American mentality, you want them soft so you don't even have to chew them right?

review/summary: Not fresh
review/text: I purchased this product at the end of November. It had a very bland taste. The flavor you get at the bottom of the coffe can after a month of opening and closing it. I checked the freshness date. It was dated Feb 2012. So it should have still tasted good. I love the instant coffee that they sell in the jars. Too bad this is only available in drink straws. I'll never buy again.

review/summary: coffee on the go
review/text: I cannot locate this item in local stores so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  I ordered one box of the Hazelnut Coffee and enjoy taking a packet to work each morning.  I have now made a second purchase but of the larger order.  Won't be surprised if some of the packets find their way into some Christmas stockings.

review/text: The shipping was fast. But I don't like the flavor of this. It smells good but the taste of this coffee was not good at all, based on my opinion.
