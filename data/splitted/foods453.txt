review/text: Just got back from a Christmas party that had these out. They are absolutely the best gummis I have ever tasted and when the host told me she purchased them here, I couldn't believe it. They are juicy and have good flavor. Not too much of a sugar taste. If you enjoy gummi candy, try them.

review/summary: Haribo is the only Gummy Bear worth buying!
review/text: As I stated in the title, Haribo is really the only great gummy bear. I have tried a significant amount of gummy bears from different manufacturers and Haribo just tops them all. My biggest complaint about Haribo's competitors is that they all tend to taste like Jello after chewing/absorbing them into your mouth. Haribo has a distinct and unique flavor between each of the colors unlike others that only distinguish the difference by food coloring alone.<br /><br />My only complaint about this specific 5lb bag is that it does not contain the nutrition information (not that there is any nutritional value) like many food products should.<br /><br />Would give these more than 5 stars if I could.

review/summary: Haribo Gummi Bears are the best but these don't taste the same as the gold bags
review/text: First, let me admit that I'm a Haribo Gummi Bear addict. I can give up all junk food except for this. I even went through the entire P90X program very religiously but still cheated by eating these (disciplined diet, 60-90 minute workouts, no skipping days, etc).<br /><br />I usually buy 3-pound bags at Target but every once in a while, they are out of stock. When I saw these available for Subscribe and Save for about the same price per oz (these are 5-pound bags), I thought I was in heaven. However, these do NOT taste the same as the bears in the 3-pound bags. Those come in gold bags and for some reason, taste sweeter. These are blander and have a little bit of an after taste.<br /><br />That said, I still prefer these over any other type of gummy bear. I still buy the 3-pound gold bags when possible and only buy these when those aren't available.

review/text: High fructose corn syrup or real fruit juice aside, I love haribo gummy bears.  I actually went to a shop in Germany called gummy bear land and bought a rather large bag while on vacation.  If those were the fruit juice kind, I actually didn't like them as much.  But to have "healthy candy" would be nice.  This is a great deal for a great gummy candy, can't go wrong.  And with Prime, when you get the craving, they show up nice and fast.  :)

review/summary: The Best Gummi Bears
review/text: I have enjoyed Haribo Gummi bears for over 30 years and now they are enjoyed by my family as well.  Haribo makes the best gummi candies.  This 5-pound bag is a great value compared to the smaller packages you can find in retail stores.  The 5-pound bag is also the perfect size for my 20 year old son to enjoy with his roommates while he is away at school.  I recommend immediately transferring the gummi bears to an air tight container as soon as you receive your shipment.

review/text: This was a good purchase. Though it may seem excessive to have 5 pounds of gummi bears, I assure you, It is not.  Great for just busting open the bag and eating big handfulls. It seems never ending.  It was both an accomplishment and a disappointment to eat that last gummi. Would definitely purchase again.  For now though, I'm just about gummied out.<br /><br />P.S. Fun tip: Lick the back of a gummi bear and stick it to whatever you want. Great for walls or any other flat surface. They just hang there forever.

review/text: I have enjoyed Haribo gummi bears since I was six years old, so I might be a little biased when I say that they are easily the best gummi candies that I have ever tasted. I have not found any other gummi product which consistently tastes the same, holds well in storage for long periods of time under both high and cold temperatures, and can work well with almost any other food product as a dessert or snack. I purchased a bag of this product over a month ago, and am still slowly working my way through it - your mileage may vary, of course.<br /><br />As soon as I found out that they could be delivered I immediately purchased a bag. I will definitely be purchasing another package of these from Amazon when I begin to get low on my current supply. If you have never tried a bag of Haribo gummi bears, you should most definitely look for them in smaller bags in your local grocery stores.

review/text: I have a candy dish at work for my coworkers, I got this on 3 month recurring order for that.  They have been a popular so far and the first bag went pretty fast.  However, 5 pounds is a lot of gummy bears and they will dry out and become stale if left in open air for just a few hours, so keep the bag closed well and don't expect them to last forever in a cabinet.

review/text: Cmon guys, we have to admit that Haribo gummies are the best!!!! True for kids and adults. You cant ever compare this to any other brands, even my kids won't take anythng other than haribos. They are just so soft and chewy at the same time but better yet, not sticky to the point where your jaw gets tired. I've been addicted to these since I was little and now my kids loves them too. All their flavors are yummy, and their shape and color make me happy. They make a great good snack either at work or when my kids go to school or for big gatherings. this huge 5-pound bag lasted for about 3 months (inc Christmas times when a lot of friends and families stopped by) for a family of 5. And the price is definitely a true value.<br />You gotta have them

review/text: I have to be one of the biggest customers for Haribou Gummie Bears, which I have been purchasing for nearly 10 years now. I am not a big candy officianado but I can tell you that Haribou is the 'real deal!!" I have tried others, too soft, medicinal tasting, and like Baby Bears Porridge, Haribou's is ....just right!! I love that they sell them in 5lb bags and I always order (2) at a time as they have a way of disappearing very fast...I've gotten my grandkids hooked on them. Easy to transport for snacks and fun to eat!! One drawback might be if you have dentures....these will definitely do a number on these so watch out and maybe stick with the cheap immitation!! I have never had a 'tooth problem' so to speak so for all other's, enjoy!!

Like the other reviews...I think it's the tart that makes them so good, and the smell...so fruity.<br /><br />I tasted them on a deployment in Spain, it was sent as part of our care package from the States.  After we ate all of our little bags.  I found them again in of all places..Walgreens.  I was sooo excited and unfortunately our love affair began.<br /><br />I then got to go to Sembach AFB in Germany and I got a package on my pillow every morning... That was like heaven... Imagine someone putting your favorite candy on your pillow...like they KNOW that's what you want.  Luckily I did save them for souvenirs and I just bought my own very fresh bags while I was there.<br /><br />My hubby and kids know they can't go wrong... I think when I die they are going to open me up and find one big gummy bear...I'm not sure what flavor...

review/text: I really love these.  They are fruity and tasty.  I received them fresh.  The only problem with buying such a big bag, is that you must put them in something to keep them fresh if you are not going to eat them right away.  These are also nice to fill canning jars and put a bow on them to give as inexpensive gifts.

review/summary: These truly are the best gummi bears in the world!
review/text: The first time I encountered Haribo Gummi Bears was when I went to Germany for a semester overseas. I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.<br /><br />At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.<br /><br />During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their "Gold Bears" are the best.<br /><br />When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.<br /><br />I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.<br /><br />If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Edit: Nov 2, 2008 - When I wrote this review two years ago, Haribo was still quite difficult to find at grocery stores. It seems today that I can find them just about anywhere. In this case, Amazon still provides a really great deal on 5 lb bags. If you don't want 5 lbs, you can shop at a local grocery store.<br />But I must recommend this: if you will not eat all of the gummy bears right away, transfer them to an air tight container. If you leave the gummy bears exposed to the air, they will get very stiff after a while.

review/summary: The Perfect Bears
review/text: Haribo's Gold Bears are the best gummy bears I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of different gummy bears.<br /><br />A lot of brands are way too sweet and way too soft - they're almost like slightly firmer Jello, but Haribo's are just right.  Not too sweet, not mushy-soft.  Just right.  The perfect bears.<br /><br />Haribo's flavors are yummy, mellow, and not so sickeningly sweet as cheap-o brands.  The crappy super-sweet bears are so sweet that my teeth feel funny after I chew them (like they're instantly rotting from the excess sugar), and they give me a stomachache.<br /><br />Haribo Gold Bears!  The perfect bears!

review/summary: Nice little treat for the kids--and yourself
review/text: These gummis are by far the best; the taste is tart and sweet, and the consistency is yes, gummy but not sticky. The bears resist the teeth with a pleasant rubbery consistency. And the outside is lightly dusted to prevent sticking together--however, they will melt with high temperatures in the Texas summer. They are nice mixed in trail mix for hiking, by the way.<br /><br />A five pound bag is a lot, but if you pack a few every day in the kids' lunch bags, they will disappear. They are great for teaching counting, too. Or getting things done. Put a bowl of gummis out and an empty bowl next to it. When one task is done, put a gummi in the empty bowl. At the end of your list, eat the gummis. Yummi.

review/summary: Five glorious pounds of GUMMI!
review/text: I can't open this bag.  It is just too beautiful.  Five glorious pounds of gummi.  It sits on my kitchen table.  The rainbow of colors twinkling in the sunlight.  Every time I get close to picking this HUGE bag up, my heart starts racing.<br /><br />These Gummis were made in Turkey and imported into Baltimore.<br /><br />The bag is not resealable so ensure you have some tupperware or a resealable bag when you open it.  A resealable bag is a must.  Gummis that have been exposed to air will harden and lose flavor.  To waste a single, solitary gummi would be a crime.<br /><br />For those who track such things, the average gummi serving is 17 pieces.  That serving will get you 140 calories.  With FIVE pounds of gummis, you will be counting all night long.<br /><br />It takes, on average, approximately 45 minutes for a gummi to melt away in your mouth -- that is, if you can keep it in your mouth that long.  Most people, myself included, will immediately start chewing on the gummi to get at the tasty fruit flavors.<br /><br />Speaking of flavors, let's talk about the goodness that goes into a gummi.  There are many ingredients:  Corn Syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Caarnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating, and Artificial Colors -- Yellow 4, Red 40, and Blue 1.<br /><br />I'm not sure how they cram all those ingredients into a gummi less than an inch tall and a 1/4 wide...but they do...and it tastes amazing.<br /><br />Even now, as I write this review, I'm enjoying a pair of gummis.  My mouth is doing a dance as I type.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: A bit harder and more stale than Haribos generally are
review/text: I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.

review/summary: Bears BURSTING With Flavor!
review/text: First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies.  It's true. If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor!  They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)!  I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy!  You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a "chocolate-type candy" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious.  To keep them this way, I put them in two "Freezer Bags" and of course, I kept some out.  Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK.  I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound!  And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag!  That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal!  I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds.  We all have our favorites!

If you buy some of the smaller packages in the store, the quality is not as good and the price is so much more expensive! Amazon delivers these lightning fast.<br /><br />The hardest decision to make is what kind of Haribo to buy next...

review/summary: Great Buy!
review/text: These are my absolute favorite gummy bears.  They aren't soft and spongy like most brands; instead they are chewy and melt in your mouth.  Also, all of the flavors are delicious-- i usually don't like eating cherry or lemon flavored candies because they tend to taste very artificial, but in the case with Haribo brand gummies, it feels like all of the flavors taste great, and it's hard for me to choose a "favorite."<br /><br />The reason i decided to buy this 5 pound bag is because I realized halfway through the school year that i've been buying at least one or two bags of the bears at the school bookstore per week, and decided that it would be a better buy to buy the candy in bulk.

review/text: Delicious!!  These are cost effective and perfect for when I have a sweet tooth.  I travel a lot so I put a handful of these in a ziplock bag and throw it in my briefcase.  Perfect for a snack now and then.<br /><br />If you buy these at the airport at the nut stand - you'll literally get a handful for $10 no joke.  This way, you'll get 5 pounds for that price.<br /><br />Also, these bears are very good - the best ones I've ever had.  They're not soft and squishy but harder yet chewy.  Very good!

review/summary: Best gummi bears ever...
review/text: Gummi bears don't get better than this! If you've never tried them before, they can seem quite hard at first, but I think this gives them a nice texture that doesn't melt in your hand or your mouth. You can chew them and the flavor lasts and you don't end up eating as many. A great fat-free, though high sugar and calorie, candy that will last forever in the 5-pound sized bag. I recommend immediately transferring them into a gallon-sized Ziploc (or other brand) freezer bag so that they stay fresh. If they are exposed to air for a prolonged period of time, they will become even tougher and eventually impossible to chew! Enjoy the best gummi bears ever!

review/text: I read the reviews of others who bought this 5 pound bag of gumi bears after i purchased mine. I was concerned they would be hard and not as good as buying them in small bags. I got my bag and surprisingly i left them open to harden them up. They were extremely fresh! I am not saying others dont know what they are talking about, but my shipment was excellent.

review/text: Oh my, how can anyone live without some gummi bears to chomp on?  I have been enjoying gummi bears for fifty years with the first being in Germany when I was a child. Through the years I have tucked some in a plastic bag while going to meetings, traveling, etc..  I have even been willing to share with people I like!  Haribo makes the best on the market today. Best flavor and texture by far.  I have a war with my self daily to not simply gobble up a handful of gummi bears as I pass through the kitchen.  Sometimes I resist and sometimes I don't.  I just keep my fingers crossed that Haribo will keep selling them just as they are now.

review/text: German Haribo's are the best but the Hungarian one's are just as good as the German ones.  If your ever in Germany, visit an ALDI or PLUS supermarket and purchase these Haribos at 300g for 85 cents EUROs. And if your in Bonn, Germany go to the Haribo plant where it all started!!! Otherwise, Amazon has the best price when you choose the free shipping after $25.

review/text: These gummy bears are incredible.  I bought them because I received a gift certificate from work so I figured why not.  My co-workers ate half the bag in about a week.  Good thing I took the other half home for my roommate and I.  They are pretty chewy and flavorful (which i like).  Its sweet to stick about 4 of them together and bite down all at once. I call that the quad-bear stacker.  yeah... the quad-bear stacker.

review/text: I have seen other reviewers claim that these bears are "too hard".  Well this is exactly why I like them.  I don't care for chewy bears and often put these in the refrigerator to harden them a little more.  In all fairness to Haribo if you don't keep them in the fridge they get more chewy.  I carry them around in a ziplock bag for the much needed sugar rush at school and they get more chewy after about an hour out of the fridge.  Another bonus is that unlike some other bears they taste like candy and not fruit snacks -  and hey, why pretend to be something that you're not.
