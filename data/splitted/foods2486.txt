review/text: Cat loves it, and she's on a high protein, grain-free diet healing from cancer. She'd been extremely picky about eating anything other than feed mice or shrimp(expensive taste). Was giving her canned innova evo, but she seemed to tire of it and this is good quality and cheaper and she LOVES it.

review/summary: My cat goes crazy over this stuff.
review/text: Out of all of the various types of cat food I've bought, the Tuna and Bonito is definitely the best for my cat.<br />He likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken</a> more, but given an equivalent amount of this BFF vs the Chicken, he tends to stay happier longer.  He tends to beg for food, and after eating this, he won't beg for almost the full 12 hours between feedings (vet's orders!), while with many other foods, he'll start begging way before that.

review/summary: BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others
review/text: I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/text: After reading the other review for this wonderful cat food,I wondered why the previous reviwer had decided to give it less than 5 stars? She mentioned that her cat didn't care for the salmon in it, however, the concept of the food is excellent. Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand. And they are very finicky too.<br />I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future.

review/text: My four kitty cats are in love with this food. I have been feeding it to them for about a week. You can tell they enjoy it way more than their old boring moist cat food (nine lives). You can actually see yummy chunks of chicken in the chicken recipes and smell the fish in the fishy recipes. So far my cats have tried the following recipes and they loved each and every one just as much as the other.<br /><br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br />Tuna and Tilapia Twosome<br />Tuna and Bonito Be Mine<br />Tuna and Salmon Soulmates<br />Tuna and Chicken Chuckles<br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any person that loves their cats.

review/summary: My Cats Refuse To Eat It
review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/summary: Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand
review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!

I found that it has a very strong smell of fish compared to other brand. In other word may be the food is too concentrated.Despite the much higher cost I would have given my cat this brand if he would have liked it.Sorry "Best Feline" but I did not decide.

review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either.

Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!

review/text: My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/summary: Easy to follow instructions....
review/text: I read the instructions several times and followed them exactly.  This was my first homebrew so I was a little nervous.  I finished the brewing at 8:00 AM on 6-11 it was in the fermenter. By 7:00 PM the air lock was bubbling about every second. I was a happy camper!  By Monday 6-13 it was no longer bubbling.  Is it done?  I don't know for sure.  I'm going to read the instructions again to make sure.  I will update review when I find out more info.<br />Update: After confirming instructions, it appears to be working just as stated in the instructions.  I will let it continue to ferment for 3-4 days and then bottle.  Stay tuned!<br />6/18/11 Update:<br />Took final gravity readings (for 3 days) and with no more fermenting, I bottled everything up.  Made 46 bottles.  So far everything has been working to plan.  I can't wait to taste test in a few more weeks.<br />7/11/11 Update:<br />I tasted Amber Ale for the first time last night.  It was pretty good but a little hoppy but I think in 2 more weeks this will be a nice tasting beer.

review/summary: First True Brew Kit
review/text: This was the first True Brew product that I have tried. I prefer to buy my own ingrediants and create my own extract recipes, but in a pinch I would try True Brew products again. The fermentation was really quick on this kit. Started after about 8 to 10 hours and finished up at about 72 hours. SG was 1.044 and FG was 1.012 so slightly over 4% ABV. I fermented in my primary for one week, then moved to a glass carboy to let everything settle for two weeks, and then to the bottles which I will let condition for three weeks. Sample taste at bottling produced a slightly bitter hoppiness which reminds me of an English Bitter rather than a Sam Adams or a Dos Equis which are the commercial brews that the manufacture compares this product to. Reason for only 4 stars, in my opinnion, nothing like either of the commercial comparisons. However, a great Amber Ale in it's own right. After a full three weeks of conditioning if there are any changes worth mentioning I will be back to update.

review/summary: Nothing special...
review/text: I bought this kit for a friend.  We brewed it.  It was alright.  There are definitely better things to make beer out of.  For starters, I don't like using malt extract out of a can.  I've tried it a few times, and it's never really been good.  Drinkable, but not very good.  I'm also not a huge fan of powdered extracts.  When extract brewing, I prefer to buy from my local home-brew shop.  A local home-brew shop will likely have a bulk supply of fresh extract that they can sell to you in a food-grade plastic container.  Personally, I feel that this does affect the taste of the finished product.<br /><br />Next, the hops pellets.  Okay, these things can go stale and produce off-flavors.  Any good home-brew store will keep their hops and hops pellets in a refrigerator to preserve freshness.  This is not something you can do with a kit in a box.<br /><br />Finally, the yeast...does what it is supposed to do, I guess.  While there are some really decent powdered yeasts out there, I have been happier with the beers I've made using liquid yeast from White Labs.<br /><br />In short, yes, you can brew beer with this product and yes, it will have alcohol in it and you can get drunk off of it, but seriously, if you are into home-brewing to really make a great beer, then you should probably pass on this product.  You owe it to yourself to go to your local home-brew store and spend a few extra dollars on a good recipe with fresh ingredients.

The way the description reads it should be a case of 12 boxes with 20 individually wrapped sticks in each box (equaling a total of 240 sticks).  Instead the item I received is one box with two cellophane bags in it.  The facts on the bottom say a serving size is 4 pieces with about 24 servings (equaling a total of only 96 sticks).  Needless to say I feel like I got jipped.  Had planned to add a box of 20 as a sort of "stocking stuffer" with gifts for Christmas - don't know that it will quite work as I had planned the way they are.  Plus only about half the amount it should have been for the price.  I love Bogdon's reception sticks but don't feel I got my money's worth or the correct packaging.  Receipt of item was timely.

review/summary: Smooth and full bodied
review/text: When I was in Turkey a few weeks ago, I was impressed with their olive oils. So I thought I should give the Turkish ones a try. First off, it is next to impossible to find just pure Turkish olive oil. I have tried brand name oils that have ingredients from different countries including Turkey but I was not impressed. As for this olive oil, I like that fact that it tastes smooth and full bodied. By the way, some of you may have tried Zoe, the Spanish olive oil. I tried it because it got great reviews from Amazon.com. But I have to admit that it tastes too fruity and somewhat peppery. I still use it when cooking but not when preparing salads. The Anatolian Extra Virgin Olive Oil, on the other hand, works great on salads and breads. The acid content is 0.8%, which is very low. This low level most likely accounts for its great full bodied flavor.<br />  As you can see, this olive oil is somewhat pricey for the half liter size. That was my concern when deciding whether to buy it. But I was searching for a great salad and bread olive oil and it appears that I found it.<br />  By the way, there are 2 different olive oils that this distributor sells in addition to this one; a Northern and a Southern Aegean one. I have not had the opportunity to taste the others yet. My hope is that someone will try them and share their thoughts about them to the readers.<br />  I don't go through olive oil fast, but you can be sure I will give one or more of these olive oils as gifts to friends. They will certainly appreciate it. If they like it, which I am certain they will, I will be sure to tell them where to order more. This olive oil is unique.

review/summary: Perfect quick breakfast option for kids and strawberry lovers
review/text: I usually buy the huge variety boxes with multiple flavors for myself. Whenever my kids see me eating oatmeal, they always want a bowl for themselves. As it turns out, strawberry & cream is their favorite flavor.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- It's not the same as the non-instant version but it's close enough and it's a lot less work. I can make it in less than a minute.<br /><br />- You can "adjust" how intense the flavor is by adding more water or milk. I always use milk since I think it not only tastes better but also provides a little more nutrition in the meal.<br /><br />- I love how I can buy all one flavor. We went through the last case (40 packets!) in a few short months. All my other flavors basically went untouched by the kids.<br /><br />- Perfectly portioned for an adult snack as well.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- If you're looking for authentic oatmeal with no artificial flavors, pass on this.<br /><br />- Since this is slightly sweeter than regular oatmeal, by adding more water or milk to offset the flavor, you will dilute the product and lose some thickness.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />It's instant oatmeal! It's exactly what I expect: a quick, tasty, and inexpensive way to eat oatmeal.

review/summary: Warm, yummy goodness.
review/text: While this may not be most healthy option, it sure does taste good and is a better alternative to some of the other junk/snack foods out there.<br /><br />This oatmeal just tastes so good, as do the other fruit flavor varieties that we have tried. With just a tiny bit of milk added in, after it is cooked with water, it really turns into such a nice, creamy, yummy treat. It is sweet enough to satisfy the kiddos, but yet not overly sweet - I am not much of a fan of sweets myself, but I find these oatmeals to be a nice dessert too.<br /><br />We go through oatmeal like crazy in this house. Myself and all 3 kids love flavored oatmeals as snacks or breakfast. It can be an expensive item to keep stocked up on. When I bought it here at Amazon, it was SO MUCH cheaper than the grocery store! I stocked up on several flavors/varieties.<br /><br />If you have never tried it, I say go for it. It is a great treat to have over the winter months to warm you up and satisfy a sweet tooth all at the same time.

review/summary: Are you kidding me?????????????
review/text: What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I bought them in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I also bought peach&cream flavor and noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe. I found blueberry flavor with REAL blueberries, cranberry with REAL cranberries. So it is possible to make a great product you just have to make an effort QUAKER and stop fooling your customers.

review/summary: Bull Stick Cane
review/text: A 36" steer pizzle -- this was worth buying just because it is so unusual. For those who might be unsure, it doesn't look....well, "graphic". The dog seemed to enjoy it, but I had to watch him in order to stop him from eating the whole thing at once (which would probably give him a stomach ache due to its size).<br /><br />The size of the product did cause the dog some frustration. You see, the length of the product is greater than the width of the doorways in my house. Every time he tried to carry the "cane" from one room to another, *clunk*, he would get stuck in the doorway. I tried laughing at him, but somehow that didn't seem to help. I guess I'm just easily amused.<br /><br />I did have to take one star away because there is some odor when the dog consumes the product. The odor is similar to that given off by the cow hooves I have bought in the past. I assume readers have some idea of what I mean, since if you don't own a dog you wouldn't be looking at this product. Also my wife thought it was disgusting, but then again she doesn't care for the whole "bringing-home-pieces-of-animals-for-the-dog-to-eat" concept.

I subscribe and save to these like a mad woman.  Sometimes I even breakdown and ask for an extra delivery in the middle of the month.  It's so nice to be able to provide a somewhat healthier alternative to gummy snacks found in the stores.  My 3 year old has been hooked on these since she was 2 and I don't think we'll be letting go of the subscribe and save on these anytime soon.  My 13 month old is already eyeing them...

So far the other soup from them, had half the cans dented as well. Not a good sign.

review/summary: best dog food!!!
review/text: I've been giving this brand of dog food to my small dogs (10-12 pounds each), since the tainted dog food incident a few years ago (it takes them probably 6-8 months to go through 30 pounds).<br /><br />When I got a new puppy (doberman), I thought this would be a little expensive, since he eats a LOT.  I looked through PetCo at just about all the different dog foods around this same price (I didn't really look at the ones that were more, since I'm pretty happy with the food). I found that this was the ONLY dog food in this price range that had the first TWO ingredients being meat (or meat by product). In fact, many of the dog foods (the kinds that you find in the grocery store) actually had the FIRST ingredient being filler. In case you don't know, the largest quantity ingredient is listed 1st and so on down to the smallest.<br /><br />He did have diahrea for the first couple of days, but that is because I did not transition him to this food.  Sadly, he had moved from one house to another house to our house within 36 hours, and I did not get information from the original owner about what he had been eating. I mention this mostly to refute the other lower rating - most dogs need to transition in foods or they will get diahrea. So typically, one should mix the old dog food with the new one, in decreasing increments over about two weeks, until the dog is eating 100% of the new food.

review/text: Our "puppy" (90lb Rhodesian Ridgeback) has been on Blue Buffalo since she came home with us from the breeder almost a year ago.  The Blue Buffalo brand is synonymous for quality in my opinion.  We will continue her on Blue Buffalo for her adult and senior years.  I have price compared buying from Amazon and the "big-name" pet store and more times than not Amazon has been less expensive.  I do have a young child so getting the 30lb bags delivered to my door (FREE with Amazon Prime) has been a real blessing.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: We got a beauceron puppy when she was 12 weeks.  She was on Iams at her first home.  Her coat was kind of dull, but we transitioned her to Blue large breed puppy as soon as she moved in.  Her coat was shiny within a week or two.  She likes the food, although the feeding guidelines have been a little low for her activity level so I feed her about a half a cup more.  She has a bit of a sensitive stomach with treats, but she has been fine on this brand of food and treats.  She is now just shy of 8 months and I'm still loving this food.

review/summary: Shiny puppies!
review/text: We started buying this food which was recommended by our vet.  When we brought our dog home from the shelter at 4 months old we knew he would be a good size -he's a Weimaraner mix. He transitioned well to this food.  He became a shiny, beautiful, happy boy. Eight months later when we adopted another 4 month old puppy (Black Lab this time)  as a playmate there was no doubt which dog food he would be getting. The Lab seemed to have had a harder time before being adopted. He was underweight, with his ribs and hip bones showing. He also had quite a case of dandruff. After a couple of weeks eating this food he was putting on weight and became more sleek and healthy.<br /><br />Months later, both dogs are in peak physical condition. Bright eyes, shiny coats, energetic and full of life. This truly is the best dog food I've ever used in all my years as a pet parent.<br /><br />/even the poop is better<br /><br />Buying on Amazon is great, too. The big box pet stores don't keep enough in stock to be sure you can always get a bag when you need it. Amazon never runs out and brings it to your house. Brilliant!

review/text: Blue Buffalo is one of four brands I rotate through with my four big dogs.  This puppy kibble is on the small size, and the cats steal a few of these from the dogs when the dogs aren't looking.  None of my dogs has ever gotten sick or suffered from loose stool with this product.  There are no cheap food colorings.<br /><br />My German shepherd dog actually eats this stuff, too, and she's known to shy away from dry food.<br /><br />Amazon will periodically have this on sale for under USD 38, so watch the price on this.  When it sells for under USD 50 you are getting a better deal through Amazon than from the big pet store, but pet food retailers and your local feed store may offer this at a better price.

review/text: Great ingredients and solid stools. Our puppy loves it and it's nice to know that I am giving her something that does not contain a bunch of corn and fillers. Make sure to transition very slowly, especially if previouse food is lower in protien and nutritional value, as a fast switch can lead to upset tummy and loose stools. We transitioned slowly over about a 2-3 week period and our pup had no problems. Her coat is soft, fluffy, and shiny.....Blue Buffalo is a great product.

review/text: I can't say enough good things about this food. Our puppy (American Staffordshire) was on Puppy Chow when we got her. After reviewing many different foods I decided to switch her to Blue Buffalo. We did a slow transition mixing first a quarter cup, then half, and so on until she was fully switched. Her stool was fine and her coat immediately began showing the difference. Her energy picked up and she loves it! We also mix in a tablespoon or so of the Blue Buffalo canned food which just adds to the flavor for her. This is a great product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality dog food at a reasonable price.

That's good enough for me. I'll plan on using this until it's time for some adult food.

He initially was eating Eukenuba from the breeder, but once we got home we found that the large pieces were hard for him to break up at 8 weeks and he didn't seem to be too excited for meals. While he was in a new place away from his litter mates, once we starting mixing his food with the Blue Buffalo his appetite really picked up. We transitioned him over the past 15 days and soon he will be on Blue Buffalo 100%. Luckily, Amazon sells this great food at a reasonable price and with free Prime shipping.

review/text: I started feeding my puppy this food when he was a few months old. He LOVES it.  Currently I feed him 3 1/2 to 4 cups a day and the bag lasts 28-29days. It's a little expensive, but the quality makes up for it and the health benefits in the future. Another plus he doesn't seem to poop as much!!! ;)

review/text: Did research on this food and heard it was a great foodd. My GSD puppy started get diarrhea that turned into bloody stool. Don't think there is anything wrong with this food just that it is not suited for my dog. Off to try another brand and see how that works. And yes I did transition foods over slowly.

review/summary: Gave my puppy very loose stools
review/text: We began feeding our 10 week old German Shepherd puppy Blue Buffalo Large Breed Puppy food, transitioning her from Purina very slowly over the course of several weeks.  Initally she seemed to do fine but then began getting very loose stools. We couldn't even pick up after her.  It was terrible. We took her to the vet for tests, added pumpkin to her diet, vet gave her probiotics, nothing seemed to help. After about 6 weeks of this (and working unsuccessfully with my vet to find a solution)I switched foods.  In about 3 days her stools were nice and solid.  While the ingredients in Blue look good on paper , it just wasn't good for her digestive system.  Now feeding California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and she's doing great on it.

I must not be the only person who thinks those are the BEST part of Gardetto's snack mix, because Gardettos made a Special Request bag containing nothing else but these Roasted Garlic Rye chips. Now you don't have to share - you can hide a bag in a drawer for whenever you need a garlic rush.

review/summary: MSG, No problem...
review/text: Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing have MSG.  Well here are a few others taken straight from a review from The Observer:<br />When you next grate parmesan cheese onto some dull spaghetti, what you will have done in essence is add a shed-load of glutamate to stimulate your tongue's umami receptors, thus sending a message to the brain which signals (as one neuro-researcher puts it) 'Joy and happiness!' Supper is rescued - and your system has added some protein and fats to a meal that was all carbohydrate.<br /><br />Ripe cheese is full of glutamate, as are tomatoes. Parmesan, with 1200mg per 100 grams, is the substance with more free glutamate in it than any other natural foodstuff on the planet. Almost all foods have some naturally occurring glutamate in them but the ones with most are obvious: ripe tomatoes, cured meats, dried mushrooms, soy sauce, Bovril and of course Worcester sauce, nam pla (with 950mg per 100g) and the other fermented fish sauces of Asia.<br /><br />So, I am keeping my Hidden Valley Ranch products.  Thanks for making my life easier and better since I now know what is going into my dressings because I had 90% of it myself.

I will not buy this product or any of their products ever again, and I suggest nobody else does either. We don't need MSG in our products!

review/text: These cookies look very cool and smell divine. I spent a good minute just inhaling the opened package as the chai spice really comes through. However the taste... leaves a lot to be desired. It's great that it's not too sweet, but there's a slight, unexpected bitterness to it that detracts from the cookie. The consistency of the center is strangely the same as the consistency of the outer layers. It looks like a beautiful cookie, but tastes more like a not very successful nutritional bar of some kind. It was all right, but I won't be ordering more.

review/text: I was glad that Podravka made a new, improved Vegeta without MSG. Unfortunately they substitute MSG with two other flavor exchangers, Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate, who are leading to the same harmful effect to our bodies through their by-products, just like MSG. So don't waste your money, search for other healthier alternatives.

review/text: I've been feeding my 16-month-old son these sammys as snacks, and he loves them.  Heck, I think they're pretty tasty, too.  The strawberry filling isn't so much yoghurt as it is "jam", but they're very handy to stick in your purse or diaper bag for a quick snack when you're on the run or just too busy to make something from scratch.  The one note I have is that the individual packages are difficult to open - they don't tear at all, but you CAN open them if you take an extra moment.  (Or apply a pair of scissors.)  And what's inside is well worth the effort.

review/text: After reading the reviews for these I thought I would add my two cents. First, they are kids snacks, they are individually wrapped for easy portability (aka chucking in into your diaper-bag/purse)and are specifically made for children. Yes they are small, again they are a kids snack, so they are the perfect size, nutritionally, for them. The price on these are high, Revolution Foods brand is pricey, but you get what you pay for, no JUNK. If you can take advantage of the subscription plan these come down dramatically in price, to $2.97/box. We have one child and have found that getting a shipment every two months works for us. Just my two cents!

The box is the size of a poptart box, but is half air.  Not a lot of flavor either.  This small box was shipped to me in a carton easily large enough to hold 12 or more boxes of 5.  Maybe if they used an appropriately sized carton, they would not have to charge $10 for shipping. One dollar each for these tiny snacks is already ridiculous. I notice there is no place to leave seller feedback for this company.  -Annoyed

review/text: I actually found a box of these at a discount store.  They seemed interesting, and I wanted to give them a try.  I love seeing organic ingredients.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Organic, no questionable ingredients<br />- Provides a little nutritional value.<br />- Individually wrapped, easy to take along in the car, to work, in a purse, etc.<br />- Decent flavor, no chemical taste.<br />- Good consistency and texture.  Not too dry.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- They're a very small snack.  Adults are left disappointed.<br />- Flavor is decent, but there isn't a lot of it.<br />- Very thin layer of the strawberry yogurt stuff in the center.<br />- Box is the size of Pop-Tarts, so you think you're getting more than you are.  It's a waste of cardboard, as the Sammies only take up 1/2 of the box space.<br /><br />Overall, I'd only recommend them to those with children and if you happen to come across these for a dollar a box like I did.  They're not going to fill an adult up or give them lasting energy.  I like the organic ingredients, but they're too small.

review/summary: Great value!
review/text: Amazon has a great price. We buy a lot of pumpkin, since our dog likes it.<br /><br />Some complain about the dings in the can.  I had one tiny little dent in one can.  But, quite frankly, why would anyone complain about a few dents in canned pumpkin?  Do they use it as a decoration???  I'm happy to have a couple small dings here and there and save the money.
