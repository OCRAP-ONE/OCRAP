review/summary: Good starter
review/text: I am new to the "coffee pod" world. I recently bought a Hamilton Beach dual coffee pot (single and carafe service) and I read the coffee pods were a good option. I wanted to find out if these would work and if I liked them. I do! The Caramel Cream and French Vanilla are very nice. I only used one pod as I just wanted a hint of the flavor not a strong brew. I really liked them and they worked beautifully in my new coffee pot. I haven't tried the Hawaiin Hazelnut and Jamaica Me Crazy yet. If you want to find your favorite, this is a good place to start.

review/summary: Terrible coffee
review/text: I have been using pods for two different coffee makers for about three years now and have tried many brands, this is by far the worst one yet.  I fell for the Wolfgang Puck name in ordering them.  He should be ashamed to have him name attached to such an inferior product.  I have used both coffee makers and neither produced anything but something that had the color of tea!

review/text: I'm not a coffee expert in any way but I know what tastes good to me. I purchased these only after not being able to reorder my regular senseo pods and boy am I glad. Just the smell alone while these are brewing is something I never had with the Senseo pods. And the taste, forget about it! delicious. Will never go back even if senseo become available later.

review/text: You've just located the most healthy, tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today! As a long time user, I can tell you that Amazon offers the best possible price for this item.  I use it for everything:<br /><br />a flavoring for plain rice, as a broth for stir frying (instead of oil), as a base for complicated stews and soups.  If you find it a bit too salty, just add more water.  It has no mysterious chemical additives. It is perfect for heart patients, diabetics, vegans, and folks who just like a fast soup treat.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: I've been using this for a couple of months.  I usually have a small mug of broth in the evening with slightly less than a teaspoon of mix in 8-10 ounces of boiling water.  Very refreshing and only about five calories a serving.  I haven't counted how many servings per cannister I get, but I would guess that it is at least the 40 indicated on the label, so this works out to be a very inexpensive as well as refreshing drink.  I've also used it a couple of times in rice-cooking water and it is very tasty, if not quite up to my home-made vegetable broth for this purpose.  It's a lot easier, of course!

People love my nabeyakiudon (Japanese noodle soup), matzoah ball soup (Jewish dumpling soup), golden lentil stew (Indian bean stew), all of which have Seitenbacher as the base. It works for people with allergies and food sensitivities (no gluten, no lactose, no MSG, no soy). It's all natural and vegetarian (no gelatin). And I can't emphasize enough the rich, deep flavor.

review/summary: The Best Soup Powder in the Universe
review/text: I'm a vegetarian and we veggies have a problem; finding tasty bullion that is not chock-a-block full of hydrogenated oils, MSG and/or animal fat. If you go to the "health food" store or section of the grocery you usually get something that has a lot of soy and tastes, well, healthy, if you follow. Seitenbacher has made a soup that utterly rules. I buy it from Amazon, by the case. Why? Because it is cheaper than buying it by the can at a local store (if you can find it locally, good luck with that). Seitenbacher calls it Vegetarian Vegetable Broth and Seasoning, and a fine seasoning it is. There are four flavors that routinely find their way to our dinner table: salt, vitamin C powder (for tang), Tobasco and this powder. Mix it with rice, in sauce or put any mix of beans and veggies and you have a soup that will attract even the finickiest 7 year old. [...]

review/text: I am a vegetarian living in a carnivores' world.  I frequently have problem buying the veggie foods I like.  When my vegetable bouillon ran out, I was distressed to find that my favorite grocery stores no longer carried them.  I was very happy to find this Seitenbacher Vegetarian Vegetable Broth and Seasoning at amazon.com.  It is a powdered broth; it can be mixed in with any food, solid or liquid, and hence more versatile than bouillon.  I use it in my instant soup bowls, macaroni, Ramen noodles, etc., and most of all, my famous Big Al's mushroom veggie rice soup.  It adds a delicious favor to my food. Yum!

review/summary: The best vegetable broth mix
review/text: I've tried a number of other brands of vegetable broth and broth mix, some much more expensive than Seitenbacher. This is by far the best for my family's taste. It's delicious!!! I not only use it as broth in my soups, but I'm using it as seasoning  by adding it to my rice when I add the tumeric or safron during the steaming phase. I'm sure I'll find more uses for it.<br /><br />The mix has 430 mg sodium per 1 tsp mix (or 1 cup of broth), and although I'd like a little less sodium, it's within my tolerance. It would be good if Seitenbacher made a reduced or no-salt version.

review/summary: This stuff is great
review/text: This stuff is fantastic!  As a broth, it's delicious and quick, and if the ingredients label is to be believed, completely natural.  The only improvement I could suggest would be for them to make a salt-free version, allowing people to add their own (e.g., non-industrial) salt to taste, but this may be a preservation issue.  Oh, one other thing: once unsealed, it's easy to spill the powder if you're not used to this kind of European packaging; just go slow and easy and you'll get used to it.<br /><br />Pricey?  Not really, when you figure that you can make several dozen cups of broth from a single can, you're really paying just pennies a cup. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAPM2Q">Seitenbacher Vegetarian Vegetable Broth and Seasoning, 5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Surprisingly satisfying!
review/text: I was looking for a delicious, yet healthful vegan vegetable broth powder and came across this brand.  I did my research online and almost every site had favorable reviews for this product.  Reading some of the other reviews for other brands (*cough, Vogue, **) I found them suspicious (always need to be careful with reviews, since companies hire people to write positive reviews).  I was torn between buying this product or Rapunzel... I was not familiar with this brand, but was familiar with Rapunzel because I bought it in the past at a local Whole Foods and thought it was adequate but did not like the fact that the cubes contained so much palm oil (took forever for a cube to dissolve into boiling water).  I am in no means a crunchy granola vegan and think that I am pretty discerning when it comes to taste.<br /><br />I followed the directions of this product and dissolved 1 teaspoon into 1 cup boiling water.<br />*Pros* The result was a fine tasting broth... some of the yeast extract did not fully dissolve into the solution (I stirred quite a bit) but the broth was good nonetheless... surprisingly, the broth was not as salty as I thought...<br />Additionally, you can see all the bits and pieces of the herbs that this product contains.<br />*Cons* The container is a bit flimsy - it was hard to pull off the inner aluminum foil.  If not careful you will have vegetable powder all over yourself.  This may be trivial, but the packaging is very outdated.  It's 2012 and the company can surely hire a graphic designer that can produce better packaging design than what they have now...<br /><br />While I was researching, it seemed as though a fair amount of people make their own vegan vegetable powder.  Almost all recipes use nutritional yeast as its base, but differ on the rest of the ingredients (for instance, once used powder versions of many ingredients, while another recipe basically took whole vegetables chopped up, cubed, and dehydrated and food processed into powder form).<br /><br />I prefer powder broth over cubes - it's a lot more convenient, and you have better control and adjust the strength of your broth.  With this said, the broth does in some way feel like it is missing something...  I might purchase the Rapunzel powder to see how good that product is.  I predict that I might get tired of this broth (considering Amazon sells it to you in a pack of 6) it isn't a bad idea to have a back-up brand to change up the flavor.  The Rapunzel powder however has more salt, and seems to have less vegetable ingredients (I like the fact that this brand has a lot of vegetable ingredients, and some that are not common in the U.S., like lovage).  What Rapunzel has going for it is that it is organic, while this is just "all natural" (which is fine).<br /><br />Buy all your vegan broth products on Amazon - you will get an amazing price.  I can't find any of these products at a normal supermarket, and Whole Foods charges an arm and a leg for these things.  Even with many new Trader Joe's that just opened up in NYC giving Whole Foods competition and a run for its money, TJ just doesn't have the wide variety of niche products that Whole Foods has.<br /><br />Update**:  This product tastes BETTER than the Rapunzel vegetable broth powder (I have both).  Using the recommended directions for both products, Seitenbacher has a deeper, more complex flavor whereas Rapunzel's tastes very salty (salt is the #1 ingredient in Rapunzel).  If you want flavor, go for Seitenbacher - if you are obsessed about everything being organic, then go for Rapunzel.

review/text: The product information misses the following important piece of information - the high sodium content in this product.  According to the information on the can, 1 tbs contains 420 mg of sodium, which is equivalent to 17% of the recommended daily value.  Note that 1 tbs is actually very little, and most people would end up using more than that.

review/summary: Great product- my kids' favorite
review/text: This broth powder is great. We used it for years and then Whole Foods stopped carrying it. I was so happy to find it on Amazon!<br /><br />It has a great flavor and is not oily, which is what I hate about boullion. My son even likes to drink it plain when he is sick. Makes a great base for soup, risotto, etc. I don't even really measure it anymore- once you use it for a while you will know what the right color is.

review/summary: The best vegetarian seasoning - so I thought
review/text: As a fussy vegetarian, I have tried many vegetarian seasonings to use with my homemade soups, and this is the BEST!<br /><br />Update: One star. I had based my previous 5-star review on the taste and the natural ingredients. Well, after receiving my shipment and reading the label, I was disappointed to find Nutritional Yeast Extract as the number one ingredient. From my research, Nutritional Yeast is good for you, but Nutritional Yeast Extract is not good for you - in fact, Nutritional Yeast Extract has the same negative effect on your body as MSG. So even though the taste is great, I won't be recommending this product any more!

review/summary: serviceable, but there are better out there.
review/text: I use a lot of veggie broth powder as a staple of my cooking, and love being able to buy several jars at once here on Amazon.  Sadly, the last time I came for broth my favorite brand (Rapunzel) was out of stock, with no ETA on offering it again.  I bought the Seitenbacher sight unseen as it were (have never seen it offered locally so I couldn't taste test) based on all the positive reviews.  I guess it's okay but frankly I don't like it as much.  It doesn't dissolve as easily and the flavor is pretty drab in my opinion.  Fortunately [sic] I have to use a lot more of it to even get a flavor so I'll be done with this case before too long.  It's certainly better than MSG-ridden fakes and would be very handy to have if one is allergic to many things, being an entirely *acceptable* vegetarian broth.  But barring necessity, I would not choose this one first.

review/text: I wanted to find a broth/soup base that does not have MSG. As it turns out after I purchased this product, I found out that MSG comes in so many different name, one of them being Yeast Extract, the number one ingredient for this broth seasoning. Just google "other names for MSG" and you will see.  I now stop using this product, and always scrutinize all the food labels before buying as almost everything prepackaged/canned/processed food contains MSG.  I now make my own broth from meat and vegetable. It's more expensive for sure, but well worth my family's health.

review/text: After doing tons of internet research on carnivorous plants, I felt ready to start my own CP collection.  I ordered a Sarracenia Flava and Drosera Spathulata Sundew on July 12 and they both arrived on July 16.  The plants came with care instructions, as well as pots and moss.  I followed the instructions to the tee, except I decided to make my own CP soil mix wth plain 50% perlite and 50% sphagnum peat moss.  I e-mailed JoelsCarnivorousPlants on July 17 with a question on one of the plants, and they got back to me the next day.  Overall it has been a great experience, and the plants look healthy and happy!

review/text: I recently bought this and received it in the mail a couple of days ago. I was rather impressed at how it was boxed! I've never bought a plant online so I didn't know what to expect. There were three stems in the bulb. The plant was wrapped snugly with plastic wrap. But unfortunately, one had a tear, and another had the top leave completely torn off, but the third one was good and healthy. The directions were very informative and helpful. I have a Venus Fly Trap so I was lucky to be in good supply of distilled water. I put it in its pot as soon as possible with water, and it seems happy except that the tear one got made it weak. But I'm satisfied overall!

review/text: Gevalia's attempt to capture Sbux Breakfast Blend is a lot closer to the real thing than they did with the 'Dark Italian / Verona'.<br />I am enjoying my second cup this morning very much; it is flavorful and smooth but definitely not strong.  It doesn't have the awful metallic aftertaste that some other Gevalia blends have. I would situate this blend as a medium roast, much contrary to their packaging and marketing of 'extra bold' which is far from it.  This coffee will make it to my must have inventory.

review/summary: Not EXTRA Bold but it is OK
review/text: When I see coffee labeled has having "extra bold" flavor I expect just that - a very powerful flavor of coffee. That is not what you get with this. The Dark Breakfast Blend is medium, and it does not really taste good unless you add cream to it. It's not that the coffee is bitter or strong if you were to drink it black, it just tastes like something is missing if it's not sweetened and creamed. I will say that this coffee tastes better with a wider variety of flavored creamers than the other "extra bold" tassimo coffees do but not enough to make me want to buy more.

Just to be clear, if it was just the soda I would give it 5-stars, but because the price is essentially doubled, I am driving the point home that the pricing is outrageous and hopefully giving it 1-star will get people to read this.

review/summary: Great wine from an underappreciated winery
review/text: Ella Valley is one of the only Israeli wineries that actually blends their varietal Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot to punch it up (in this case, 15% of Merlot), but given their incredibly powerful Merlot, it makes sense and the addition does contribute nicely to the final wine, resulting in a rich and voluptuous similar to the Vineyards Choice version reviewed below with a little less retrained elegance.  A rich ripe nose of black fruit with some red notes added including cassis, blackcurrant, blackberries and ripe plums, together with some spicy oak from the 16 months it spent French oak (a bit more new oak than the Vineyard Choice edition), some mineral flintiness, crushed Mediterranean herbs and some bakers chocolate.  Much of the same follow the round and mouth filling full bodied palate with plenty more crushed black fruit; toasty oak and slight notes of pleasing greenness all on a solid backbone of robust tannins that still need some time o settle down and play nice.  Drinking nicely now, give the wine 15 minutes to open up in your glass first and then enjoy through 2015.

review/summary: Gevalia Extra Dark House Delivers
review/text: I've tried all three new 'Dark' offerings from Gevalia and I think this is the best one from the three. Gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests.<br />Coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste; it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after taste.<br /><br />The pack comes with 12 big T-discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee. This coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts.<br /><br />Update:<br />I am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me (changing from a 4 to 5 stars); it is quite tasty and smooth. This is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that Sbux left. There will be some that will say that this is not the same as Sbux and it isn't! Try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings. Highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again.

review/text: these discs have the same shape as the Starbucks discs, and make rich, strong, dark coffee.  there are 2 kinds: blue and red/purple.  they are comparable to kitamu and columbia, respectively, from starbucks, (thus a little more robust than verona).  thank goodness, I don't miss Starbucks anymore.  The Nabob columbian and the Gevalia columbian are also good, full cups of coffee. for a half cup, try maestro lorenzo, with a nice crema on top.  happy sipping!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Starbucks. When they decided not to continue making coffee for t-discs, I was very disappointed. I like bold and extra bold coffees and I think Starbucks has the best... until I tried the Dark House Blend from Gevalia. The flavor is so rich and bold (but not burnt) that I can't wait to get up in the morning so I can have the coffee! I still have some starbucks t-discs at home (from 6 months ago), and comparing with Gevalia Dark House Blend, the starbucks tasted like water. I rarely say this... but thank you, Gevalia, for making this great dark blend coffee. Definitely my favorite Gevalia so far.

review/summary: Woot, finally a good Tassimo coffee!
review/text: I have been in something of a coffee depression, ever since Tassimo lost the Starbucks brand to Keurig. I kept trying different substitutes, but none would live up to that nice, bold, rich flavor - many of them are downright watery. But this one is excellent, bold but not too bitter, full-flavored and has a nice extra kick to it. I may even like it better than my old Starbucks fave.

Of the two I like this one the best.  I may also try their Italian Roast.

review/text: I have never written a negative review but I just had to comment about this product. It is absolutely the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted. First it is weak and watery and does not make the larger cup as stated. It is nowhere near the claim, "If you like Starbucks, you'll like this." I tested my Tassimo brewer to make certain that that was not the problem. It brewed another type of pod just fine. What's more there is no recourse to return this utterly awful product. Don't waste your money.

I CHOse Orgain because i liked the ingredients. i wasnt interested in losing weight by eating chemistry-based non-foods. (my other WMR is an every-morning Macrobar- coconut.) those 2 WMRs plus 2 snacks and 1 meal in the middle of the day has been working great.)<br /><br />both the vanilla bean and the chocolate Orgain shakes are delicious, filling and satisfying.  they really are best **cold**.<br /><br />the nutritional stats are good-- my dietitian was happy i discovered them and has added them to her list of recommended WMR shakes. i'm happy to report i've lost 6 pounds *each* month these past 2 months!

review/text: I tend to be a very picky eater. When my appetite is too low to get enough food/fuel in me, I have been inclined to ignore the ingredients in Boost and Ensure and drink them to help me keep "meat" on my bones. How delighted I was to see Orgain on my grocery shelf! It looked similar to the other brands, but I can read the label without as much cringing! I like the organic ingredients. I use this for rehydrating after a workout outside or at the gym. The consistency is thinner than Boost or Ensure, but the flavor is similarly pleasant. It would get 5 stars if it was creamier. I drink it frosty with ice crystals in it and enjoy it as much as when it is room temperature. The flavor is smooth without the weird protein or chocolate/vanilla/sweetener flavors of other supplements.

review/summary: I've tried them all...This one's a winner
review/text: I've had muscle milk, myoplex, unjury (which was tolerable), anything whole foods, central market, or the vitamin shoppe had to offer...GAG.  Then I tried Orgain.  YUM.  I am no having one of these and one Blueberry or Mango Mix 1 Protein shake per day and actually meeting my protein requirements each day.  My nails and hair are finally looking better and I'm actually starting to have more energy.  I'm so glad Amazon carries these, as my Whole Foods tends to run out of these.  I do however wish that they would put them on automatic subscription, as they have with the Mix 1 shakes.<br /><br />It's great that it's still whey protein, I've definitely never found a whey shake that tastes this good, only the soy ones, which don't have the best absorption.<br /><br />Also, it's great that you can travel with these shakes and not have to refrigerate them or mix them, as they are ready to drink.  I'll just get a cup of ice while traveling or at the office and I'm good to go!  You can even add supplement powder to it if needed, and it dissolves well in it. I actually recommend this flavor over the fudge one, and I'm a chocolate nut.  The fudge just was a little too cocoa-ey for my taste.  The vanilla is pretty sweet, which I like.  I think it might be yummy with some Starbucks Via added in it for an iced latte too.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/20/2011<br />I saw where another review stated that they had received curdled milk!  I did too.  Amazon sent 2 new cases immediately, but unfortunately both of them were curdled as well.  I had ordered the mocha from another online retailer at the same time and it arrived without incident.  I'm not sure why 4 cases arrived curdled, but it was pretty gross when I got lumpy milk instead of my usually amazing Orgain breakfast.  I wanted to do the subscribe and save, but cancelled it, until someone makes sure they know why it was curdled and can ensure it won't arrive in that condition.

So now he has one every day after practice and said he can tell the difference in the way his muscles feel after a work out or how tired he is.  I would recommend this to any athlete or parent of an athlete, as a great way to get the nutrition needed.
