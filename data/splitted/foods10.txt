review/summary: Best taste ever!
review/text: I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the "sweet" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!!

review/summary: Perfectly, naturally sweet!
review/text: I have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is, hands down, the very best out there.  I use Nu-Naturals NuStevia for all sweetening purposes.  It can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium.  I was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order.

review/summary: The Only Sweetener I Will Use
review/text: NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other brands and this one is the best! It hasn't any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.

review/text: I find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands; vs using/opening sweetener packets.  This product works well both in cold & hot things like homemade lemonade & in coffee.  Easy to open lid. Product dissolves more easily in cold liquids, than many other types of stevia.

review/summary: Best stevia product I ever used
review/text: I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.<br /><br />I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good.

review/summary: Sweetly satisfying...
review/text: NuStevia's White Stevia powder is amazing!  I have been on a low-carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and NuStevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  I love sweet things, and without them I don't think I'd have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.<br />NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.<br />I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again.

review/summary: The Best Stevia
review/text: The first time I tried this product  was 2 years ago at the Venetian spa restaurant in Las Vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends. We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  We've been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison.

review/text: Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7" inches long and a little less than 1" inch wide.  Flavors are comparable to Flavor-Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, I'm not sure if we'd choose these over another brand, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ;-)

review/text: We first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in Costa Rica while on vacation.  We bought a few bags and brought them back home with us.  Costa Rica grows arabica coffee beans, fantastic.  We enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning. It's strong, flavorful, full bodied, and not bitter.  In our 12 cup drip coffee maker, we use two rounded scoops (about 5 tbs).  When we finished the last of the coffee, we looked on Amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in Costa Rica.  We bought four bags and will be getting more.

review/text: Are you familiar with the Hormel Compleats line?  If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  "Light" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK.

review/text: I've tried several of the Compleats line, including this one, and they all have one thing in common: the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it, but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it.<br /><br />The Chicken and Rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice, carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce. It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. Overall, I'd say it's fine in a pinch - these shelf-stable meals are easier to find than most - but if you have other options available, these are only fair-to-middlin'.

review/summary: Tasty, Quick Meal
review/text: These radiation-treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken-filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, I'll mark them down.

review/summary: Neither great nor bad
review/text: Like the majority of other meals in the Hormel line, this one is excessively salty. That alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasn't swimming in sauce. This ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it.<br /><br />But it's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill. It's not my favorite of this type of meals but I wouldn't turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of "Chicken" but the horrid taste even<br />overshadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog.

review/summary: Not a lot of flavor, not a lot of chicken
review/text: This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.<br /><br />It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.<br /><br />The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot.

review/summary: Okay price, fast easy meals
review/text: This is ramen, a cheap, easy, and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap. Its got its pros and cons, but mostly its pretty alright. The chicken flavor is good. Some people find it too salty, I like it as is. The price here on Amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale, higher than others. Still, if you're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible, maybe paying a $1 more for 24 isn't such a big deal. Nutritionally its pretty meh. You could do a lot better. But its also a versatile base- you can always add lots of veggies, meat, other spices, pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option. We keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves.

review/summary: Good
review/text: Im on a quest to try all the Ramen Flavors. Ramen is a good lunch for me, being easy to make, cheap and versital. The Chicken flavor is one I remember but I havent had it in a long time, its one of the only flavors sold in stores where I live. I made some recently. Its better than I remember, salty but good. This is one of the more americanized flavors. I recommend NOT adding 2 cups of water. I added a bit more than 1 1/4 cup. and it was perfect. 1 1/4- 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 seems to be the perfect amount. I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain. Or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings. Whatever you like. This is a great product, I recommend if you want easy, cheap lunches.

review/summary: A Good Choice
review/text: This is a classic ramen choice.  Our kids, 3-6 love this.  When we're RVing, we have a case of this on hand.  A bowl, some water, and 2:30 in the microwave, and we've got our instant meal. We break up the noodles while still sealed in the package.  This helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them. They don't seem to tire of these; and we're not overly offended by the nature of the just-add-water-product. We each had our ramen-eating-college-days. These also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch, etc. at work.  Just make sure you have a pack of paper (not styro-save the enviro) bowls and some fork/spoons in that drawer, too.

Also, microwave a spoon or two of vegetable...left over/frozen/canned. After noodles cook/add season packet...pour over meat/veg...after a minute pour some of the liquid out...you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out! College kids live off this meal because it is CHEAP/quick and can all be done in microwave if need be. You can get a case of Libby's carot/peas from AMAZON for about$11! Since you are using only a spoon or two...lasts a long time!

It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor.

review/text: I love the McDougall Asian Entr&eacute;es and although I haven't tried all of them this one is amazing. It has a really peanutty flavor that you wouldn't expect in a product containing only 3 grams of fat per serving. I would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stir-fry vegetables...I am buying a case now to test just that! The peanut flavor is strong enough that I bet it'd distribute among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you wouldn't get very saucy noodles and dry veggies.<br /><br />I recommend this product. The best-tasting peanut noodle you'll be able to find for only 3 grams of fat.

review/summary: Great for a healthy, hot, great-tasting vegan meal on the go!
review/text: There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little "twigs" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's "standing" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!

review/summary: Glorified Cup of Noodles
review/text: For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles. However, if you're not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all.

However, I will not order it from Amazon again.  I ordered a case, two different times, and the first time 6 of the 12 cans were dented.  The second order, the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because 2 cans were busted open, the other 10 cans, were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans.  It was a huge mess to clean up.  They need to package items better.  Amazon did issue a full refund, but after having 2 out of 2 shipments being damaged, I am not willing to order soup, or any other food items from them.

review/summary: Best sauce tomato (canned or fresh) period
review/text: Long ago I discovered that San Marzano tomatoes were unparalleled for flavor when it comes to making sauces. I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I haven't been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos.

review/summary: Applesauce Spice Cake
review/text: As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!

review/summary: Can this really be gluten free?
review/text: I served this wonderful cake at a Christmas party at my house.  As the only celiac in the crowd, I decided to wait until the others had tried it, before revealing that it was gluten free.  Everyone raved over the great taste!  The package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake, which is how I served it.  My own two boys said it was the best cake I had ever made, including the traditional wheat flour cakes I sometimes make for the rest of my family.  It was moist, spicy, and rich.  It reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when I was growing up, and she was a terrific cook.  I highly recommend this one!

review/text: Not wanting to pay $9 per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans, I came to my favorite online store, Amazon. With free shipping I could not beat the price. I went from paying $9 per pound to $3.50 per pound. I was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious. I bought them for my mother for Mother's Day because she did not get a chance to buy any for Easter. With 10 pounds, I had plenty to share with my friends too.

review/summary: BEST Licorice Jelly Beans EVER!
review/text: Licorice Jelly Beans use to be my absolute favorite in the jelly bean flavors (I no longer eat sugar).  These were bought as a gift, so I did get to try a few just to see how they  are.  I've had many over the years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor!  Also their customer service is excellent! I needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even ONE customer is happy - something lacking in most companies these days.<br />To compare - I tried a couple Jelly Belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong - not enough of a licorice taste.  Gimbal's is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean.  This is a LARGE quantity!! Keep that in mind when purchasing - either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life, or a large family or collection of friends to share with - unless of course your sweet tooth won't stop and then, just savor them all yourself ;-)<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA
review/text: MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One�.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic� formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic� formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic� falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic� formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic� formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials� DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials� DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, "The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children," Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic� formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]

review/summary: Colic/acid reflux babies...try this!
review/text: HANDS DOWN the best formula on the market.  Sadly, my breast milk dried up so I had to fine a formula.  My poor son has so many GI, stomach, gas, crying, reflux, etc issues.  We were on Alimentum for over a month.  We even tried the ready to eat b/c I heard it was corn free.  I also tried the hypoallergenic version by Enfamel.  Nothing made him better.<br /><br />After researching DHA/ARA...I found some scary things.  Basically, it is made by using chemicals.  There are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this b/c of the toxins.  You can google it.  Anyway, I found this organic formula that didn't have it in it (you can buy DHA/ARA seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals).  I was nervous...b/c my son had so many issues...I didn't want to make it worse.  But I tried it!  Seriously, it has changed my son's life!  He is a completely different baby!  I no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymore...I mean of course it is still there...but that is how much better it is.  My son has been on this since he was 6 weeks.  I know it says toddler, but if you go to their site it is FDA approved for infants.  They say toddler b/c they fully support breast feeding for the first year.  It has the same cals, fats, nutrients, vit, minerals pretty much as the other leading brands...it's just organic...no DHA/ARA..and they don't use corn syrup.  Seriously, try this formula!

After consulting with the pediatrician, we started searching for a suitable alternative.<br /><br />Whilst Soy formulas are being offered as the "lactose free" alternative by many, our first preference was "non-soy" alternative. We also wanted a natural & organic product, free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients. After a considerable amount of research and shopping around, we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and natural/organic.<br /><br />Our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula.

review/summary: Best Organic milk out there..my baby switched from Similac Soy
review/text: Our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot. We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Baby's only for making an excellent product !

review/text: When my daughter was an infant, she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on Neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis.  For my son, we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk.  His stomach does react when I have accidentally had more dairy than I can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula, especially given our Asian background.  I wanted something organic, not soy, lactose free, and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria.  My son didn't like it at first, but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula.  He has not been gassy nor spit up on it.  I really wish Amazon stocked it.

And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box! :-)

review/text: Each box is 8oz and usually I make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and I, and if we have leftovers, it's rare.  This time however, I had half of it leftover only b/c we felt full and couldn't eat anymore.  I wonder if this is b/c of the high amt of fiber. Whatever, this morning my hubby tells me he's down 3 lbs. too.  I'm jealous. Also, I've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks, always feeling unsatiated. Last night I had no strong urges to eat snacks.  I ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b/c I was truly hungry. I won't say this is the outcome for everyone, but I thought I'd share.  I'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight. I'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now, too.

review/text: Wow ... this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the brands labeled as whole wheat pasta. I tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta-eating experience.  I eat half the box at a time, which is about 4 ozs, and it's so filling I can't eat more if I wanted. It keeps me satiated all night. I don't even get the urge to snack. This is like a miracle to me.  Even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the "real" (and unhealthy) alternative. The other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2 - 5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says.  I'm not sure if Amazon will like this comment, but it is much cheaper on the Fiber Gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day I am writing this review.

review/text: It is a good tasting product.It does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still can't eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal.

review/summary: I will never go back to Senseo pods as long as these are available.
review/text: First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: This coffee is absolutely horrendous.  I cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees.  I cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  The best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals.  I am really bummed I cannot returned this.  A complete waste of money.  It all went in the garbage.

review/summary: Big pods, great value, delicious decaf coffee!
review/text: These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One-One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand-up box dispenser which is nice too.  I can't understand the other reviewer here who didn't like the coffee - I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod I've found.  Also the value here can't be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you won't be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto-delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum.

review/summary: These are absolutely revolting
review/text: The flavor of these pods is horrid.  I ordered them only because Senseo was out of stock for so long, and I needed some decaf pods, and these had received a couple good reviews (which I now suspect were written by Baronet employees).  I have never tasted such awful coffee before. A big "YUK" for Baronet.

review/summary: Nice strength, maybe too much vanilla?
review/text: I am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering.  The strength of the coffee itself is very good.  I can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the Senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money.  Plus, it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning!

review/summary: Rich and Flavorful.
review/text: I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YE">Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>. Although the Senseo coffee is very good, I wanted some variety. This is what I found and its excellent. The vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly, leaves no after taste. I drink tall cups, 16 oz, so what I am doing is using 1 of each type. The vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great. The Senseo decaf is a little cheaper, so I do that as a cost saving measure. I also signed up for Subscribe and Save to further reduce cost.  If you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer, I am confident you will love this coffee.
