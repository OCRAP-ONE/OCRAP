review/summary: What a waste of time.
review/text: I purchased the 2 pack, so I could gift one set. I decided to buy lemons, oranges, grapefruit, apples and pineapple. I sat the tablet on my tongue and let it dissolve completely, moving it around on the surface area to "coat" all of the taste buds. Well, there was no effect when I ate any of the fruits I bought. I followed the directions, and used foods recommended. So, I am just disappointed that this didn't work.

review/summary: Iffy
review/text: People differ greatly when using this product. It has indeed changed flavor drastically for many people, and left others feeling less than enthused. I did notice changes (lemons tasted like candy and I could eat Strawberries, which I can never do because I find them too tart), but it wasn't overwhelming and most things still tasted exactly the same. My friend and I tried first with one, followed 5 minutes by a second. 2 hours later we did three at once and drank. The alcohol still taste the same, which was surprising given the number we had consumed. All in all, a fun product to definitely try but don't get your hopes up - you could be one of those people who is not affected by it at all.

review/summary: not  helpful for weightloss
review/text: I bought this because Dr. Oz said that it could help people eat more fruits and veggies, which I hate. Unless you douse it with vinegar or lemon juice, it does not make them more tolerable. If you do not like red peppers to begin with sucking on these little pills will not help. Sure it may taste like a cross between a pepper and a sweet tart, but who wants to eat that. Save you money, buy a bag of sweet tarts and chew them along with your red pepper, you will have the same thing at a far cheaper price.<br /><br />This product is good for teenagers who want to do those tasting parties with their friends.

review/summary: Ick, why is it so sweet?
review/text: Just had my first salad with this dressing, and I struggled to get through it. Italian dressing should not be this syrupy sweet! I decided to try this dressing because it was advertised as "with lemon and feta" and I guess I was expecting the original Wishbone Italian, but more tart and more savory. It's neither tart nor savory - just cloying.

review/summary: non gluten flour
review/text: Tapioca flour also known as cassava flour, yucca starch is made from the  cassava root. Tapioca is gluten free but can sometimes cause mild tummy upsets if too much is consumed by some people; others have no problem and can use as much as they want.<br />Tapioca starch (flour), and tapioca pearls are from the same cassava root, just processed differently.<br />I use this flour in mixtures with others gluten free flours and starches in order to have a basic flour base blend on hand at all times.<br />Tapioca flour, (starch) by NOW foods is usually affordable and of excellent quality. Finding this product locally might be a challenge so look at the local ethnic based shops, or order on line.

review/summary: Really Disappointing! Poor Product!
review/text: After reading five reviews that were all positive, I bought these for wedding favors for our Las Vegas reception. What a disaster!!! We had to quality-check every one. One out of every six were either missing part of the foils or the foil fell off! Some of the chocolates that were missing foils were cracked. And the foil quality was poor on some of the chocolates (appears smudged on printing). These are priced well, but I would pay the extra dollars to get a better quality product as these were terrible. Definitely not good for a wedding (we ended up having to buy other favors to put in our boxes as there wasn't enough "good" product after all the defective chocolates had been removed)!

review/text: The problem with this Angel Hair Pasta is the texture of the cooked product. I boiled my first box cooking it on the low side of the recommended time on the box and the pasta still came out somewhat gummy. I ate half and saved the other half for the next day. It was still gummy the next day but I managed to eat it anyway. I will continue to experiment with times and see if I can improve on it, but unless I crack this nut, I won't be ordering it again.

review/text: I've just recently switched to GF cooking after my doc ran sensitivity tests (soy, milk, peanuts, the usual suspects). Gluten popped positive. Lucky me. Well, as one who still has recent (fond) memories of wheat pasta, believe me when I tell you that this tastes identical! Cook it, RINSE it, and smother with your favorite sauce. It can't be beat. I've tried a bunch of different GF pastas and this is the one I'm ordering in bulk.<br /><br />As with other GF pastas, it should be rinsed after cooking.  Then it's perfect. As a side note, this blend (brown rice with flax) doesn't leave nearly as much starch in my pasta pot as the others do. Not sure why, it's just something I noticed.

review/summary: Good Stuff!!
review/text: I've tried all types of GF pastas and since we are limited by other allergies as well we have a limited selection. This spaghetti is awesome. It's really more like normal spaghetti - not the super thin angel hair pasta the name implies. The poster "Lisa" may not know how to properly cook GF pasta, I'm not sure, but when this is cooked and rinsed properly it has the exact same bite, chew and feel as regular gluten-y spaghetti. Well, I guess that's relatively speaking. Nothing tastes as good as wheat pasta IMO but when you're GF this stuff wins in my book!

review/text: I bought this because it seemed healthy, and I am an angel, or fine/thin pasta person.<br />Maybe I need more practice, but even cooked al-dente it seemed chewy and mushy. I'm sure it is a great product, but I guess I am used to a little gluten for bite.  They make great little token gifts, since it is not readily available in this neck of the woods.  I love my Thai thin rice noodles, and get my flax (or omega3) in other ways.  But - hey, it was worth a try.  Just my humble opinion.

review/summary: Yellow Labs - the Ultimate Chewing Test
review/text: Loquat and Leonard are brother and sister labs. I've been searching for the perfect edible chew toy since they were born (perfect= lasts an hour or so, dogs like the taste, inexpensive).<br /><br />The Himalayan chews got 1 out of 3 in my rating system. While the dogs clearly enjoyed their yaky goodness, my more chewy dog ate hers in under 10 minutes. She's a monster, granted. My other dog took his leisurely time licking the treat and lightly chewed it until it, too, was gone in under an hour. To give you a better picture, my dogs are both around sixty pounds and are under a year old.<br /><br />The chew toys that we've found work are hooves (cheap, but super stinky) and braided bullysticks. They last about as long as these crazy Himalayan cheese sticks, but they're like a dollar each (look for them online or at Costco).<br /><br />Final verdict, if I were rich, my dogs would get Himalayan dog chews, imported Spanish silver dog dishes, Italian wool beds and personal massage therapists. But as it stands, I can barely afford Ikea for even myself so hooves it is!

review/text: This is the best chew ever.  My dog won't put it down and they last a really long time.  The first time I gave her one she immediately ran away with it and hid it, now that's the sign of a good bone!  They are also all natural and good for your dog's teeth.

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: We had originally loved this Himalyan chew bone for our GSD.  She is about 8 months old, but she is one powerful chewer.  We got her a large bone, and at first, it took her a little while to get through it, but the last one we gave her (probably our 4th or 5th one now), she swallowed chunks of it and puked those up later on, and we had to get x-rays to make sure nothing was blocking her intestinal tract.<br /><br />Pros - GSD loved it, can last a while.<br />Cons - Due to her powerful jaw and teeth, she can bite off chunks and swallow them.<br /><br />So, long story short, we no longer give these to her!  Peanut butter filled hooves it is!

review/summary: Not digestable
review/text: My dog loved this treat, and it took days for her to get through it.  However, once she was 2/3 of the way through the bone, she swallowed the remiander.  She seemed fine until 4 days later, she vomited up the entire piece of the bone in tact.  This sat in her stomach for 4 days and was not digested one bit.  Fine for a chew toy but not for consumption.

review/summary: This review is actually written by my dogs!
review/text: These treats are great! They're yummy! They have such a perfect consistency, not too hard, not soft at all. They don't get gummy when they're chewed for awhile so mom doesn't mind picking them up after they've been chewed on for a bit. Sometimes she has to do that 'cause we get obsessed with chewing them on occasion and we just won't put them down! (OK, I admit, that's me..."Banshee". I am a Himalayolic but I don't need help. I just need more Himalayan Dog Chews and mom found them at Amazon.com for the best price anywhere!)<br />These treats are hard and crunchy and stay that way, they only get a tiny hint of softness as chewed. We have to work at it but small pieces flake off and we get our tasty reward! They make great dental bones because they have more flavor and have stiff edges to help rub along our teeth and break off the tarter. Oh, and they don't have the foul odor of hoof chewies or some others. Mom and dad gag when we chew hoofies but they love the Himalayan Chews.<br />Did I say they are great? Well I meant they are outstanding! They are wonderful and all three of us love them so much that on occasion we have fought over them. That's because "Zac" likes to horde them and tries to hide them all. He's stopped that now since mom worked with him. That's great because now she can leave 4-5 out, (more than the number of dogs is smart), without worry of a fight.<br />One warning is that you should watch your dog as they get down near the end of the chew. "Li" is a real aggressive eater and when he gets to that last inch he'll swallow it whole! One of these times I'm worried it may get stuck in his intestine and require surgery since I'm uncertain how well a large chunk will be digested. Regular chunks appear to be fully digested since it never hurts going poddy and mom never complains about chunks in our poops, BOL (Bark out loud).<br />We've been receiving these fine treats since they first came on the market and we've had no trouble. We (mostly) are average to above average chewers with lots of experience with these chews and we'd recommend you try them with your dogs. Like any chew, you should stick around and observe us as we chew but for light to moderate chewers you might be watching for hours and even then we may not finish one since it's highly dependent on the aggressiveness of the chewer. Crazy mad chewers like "Li" have been known to bite down on even the large ones and snap it in two, which is great 'cause then I get another one! Our mom watches us well and picks the chews up when she cannot watch us. I think that's smart for ALL chews. Now, go on! What are you waiting for? Go buy some for "Max" and "Hannah"!

review/summary: Dogs LOVE Himalayan Dog Chews!
review/text: Yes, Himalayan Dog Chews aren't cheap.  Yes, some dogs won't like them.  Yes, some dogs will devour them in a few days (must have jaw muscles of STEEL!).  I gave my Siberian Husky grandpuppy a Himalayan Dog Chew summer of 2010.  I thought I'd get him another one for Christmas, but my daughter said he's still gnawing on the first one.<br /><br />Try it.  For most dogs, they will LOVE it.  For many dogs, it will last for months and months. Some crazed dogs will devour it in a few hours, still loving every minute of it - and some dogs will walk away wondering why you bothered.  But if YOUR dog is in the first 2 categories, it's a major treat.<br /><br />Go to the website and read the reviews.  It's very clear that some dogs chow them down and other savor every minute.  It's my grandpuppy's favorite toy/chew.

review/summary: On the fence about this one
review/text: I bought a package with 2 or 3.  I had a hard time finding my girl a chew that she enjoyed that wasn't edible or would at least last longer than 10 minutes.  Although my girl is a medium size dog, she is one powerful chewer, she can devour the largest Buzy Bone in under 30 minutes. So, I thought she might enjoy these, she did have minimal interest and would chew on it maybe a couple of minutes after she saw the cat licking it once in awhile, but then would leave it.<br />  I started fostering a chihuahua pup, he found them and fell in love with them. So, of course now that my girl saw he liked them she had decided after all this time she needed just to go a head and eat one.  Now she has thrown up twice so far and what was in the vomit was the pieces of the chew.<br />  After all the searching I did to find something, it was a 3 dollar hollow white bone, that doesn't seem to splinter, at Petsmart.  I put a spoon full of a wet food in there for a treat, she will grab that bone quite frequently and stay occupied for up to 30 minutes just chewing, she still has the original bone, plus a new one.  That's what I wanted, just something she enjoyed chewing without feeling like she was getting too much junk food.

review/summary: Incredible long last dog chews
review/text: With all the tainted meat dog treats in the stores lately, I started looking for a long lasting dog chew.  My terriers love this and it keeps them from chewing up valuable stuff around the house.  The medium chew lasts about a week (at least with my chewers) and when it gets down to a small size where you worry it might be a chocking hazard, just put it in the microwave for a minute and it puffs up like a hard cracker that they can chew on like dog food.<br /><br />Also, it is not a meat product so my dogs don't fight over this treat like they do the bones.

review/summary: Large Himalayan dog bone - arrived broken
review/text: I recently bought one of these at a local pet store and my dog went crazy for it. It lasted a few days with chewing about an hour at a time. So when I saw this product on Amazon for $2 cheaper I jumped on it. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was I ordered 2 of the large bones one was fine and the other arrived broken in half. It is not a cheap bone and they should ship it with more packaging to make sure it does not break during shipping. I am a little apprehensive to give the broken one to my dog as she tends to swallow smaller pieces whole and I do not want her to choke on it.

review/summary: Finally, something he doesn't get bored with!
review/text: My 30-lb. Canaan dog mix came from a rescue with an unknown history and still doesn't really know how to play with toys. We've given him stuffed bones, hooves, and antlers, and as soon as he got out the good parts, he'd ignore the rest of the chew. Right away, when he got this chew, it became his favorite thing in the world -- he carries it around with him everywhere, takes it to bed, and was even smart enough to drop it in his water bowl to try to soften it up (that took most of the color out, but it must not have hurt the flavor because he seems even more interested in it now). Better yet, he seems content to sit a room away from me and chew it for hours, which has helped a lot with his separation anxiety. It's down to just a nub now, but I'll definitely be stocking up on more! So glad to finally find something he'll play with like a normal dog!

review/summary: Great bone.....for your you're outside!
review/text: We first got this bone at a family friend's dog store - they tend to stock all natural, very healthy product. When I initially asked for a bully stick, I was given a little education on what exactly makes up a bully stick....needless to say I haven't bought one since! I was instead shown these Himalayan Dog Chews - what immediately caught my attention were the ingredients. Yak Milk? Lime Juice? Salt? I have to say, I wasn't too sure my pup would be into this, but boy was she ever! The unfortunate thing about these bones is that they crumble, and crumble BIG TIME. What we've started doing with them, though, is giving them to her outside when we are trying to relax at a park w/ a good book or are up on our roof-deck and need something to keep her occupied. They are magical for that purpose! She is a 30lb. pup and it takes her quite a while to get through a medium size bone. I would highly recommended them for this purpose if you want to treat your pet to a delish bone but want to avoid the huge mess in your home that they tend to leave behind!

review/summary: Great Doggy Time Consuming Purchase
review/text: My dog doesn't digest rawhide, and I found out the hard way that her body doesn't digest the elk antler chew toys. The Himalayan dog chew was a great alternative. She's a small breed dog, but I give her the 2.5 oz chew, because it lasts longer and keeps her busy. She'll spend up to an hour at a time chewing on it. When she's chewing on something she shouldn't, I give her the himalayan chew as an alternative. It's all natural, and Jozi easily digests the chew. Great product.

review/summary: not what I was hoping for
review/text: my dog is a 3 yr old 70lb American bulldog/German shepherd mix. after buying the thicker 12 inch bully sticks for her I wanted to try something that might last longer. (she goes through a 12 inch bully stick in about 20 mins.) I also wanted something that would be good for her teeth. I started w the large bone but she got down to half of it in about 15 mins. i had read that its not a good idea to feed one that's  too large for your dogs size because it could fracture their teeth but i decided to try xl bone anyway (i think it says 80 ir 90+ lbs on the pckg) shes chewed on some pretty hard things before with no issues. but the XL (19.99 where i bought it) she managed to bite chunks off of so I had to take that away and trade her for a bully stick because I was concerned about her trying to swallow the large pieces. I'm sad it didn't work out for us because it is healthy and definitely would have been good for scraping her teeth. back to bulky sticks we go.

review/summary: My NON-Chewer loves this!
review/text: We have a 3 year old German Shepherd / Australian Shepherd mix and we had yet to find a chew toy that she would use at all.  She has some separation anxiety, so I was hoping that this would be something we could toss into her crate for her to enjoy for a couple of hours if we left the house.<br /><br />I ordered this 3 days ago & got it today!  When I gave it to Pixie, she paced around the house with it in her mouth for a few minutes - I don't think she really even knew what to do with it!  Finally, she flopped down onto the floor and held it between her paws and went to town.  She chewed HARD for about an hour and it still looks almost brand new.  When she went to get a drink, I grabbed it and put it away for another time.<br /><br />Then I logged into to Amazon & ordered the XL size.  I'm thrilled!

review/summary: Great SAFE Chews
review/text: Both our Havanese puppies like to chew these dog chews.  We had purchased one but it broke in half due to a fall on tile.  That made it less desirable because a small piece is harder for them to hold in their paws.  We now have two longer pieces and each one can chew one.  Although my dogs are much smaller than 20 lbs, the length of this size is preferable than the shorter pieces.  They can chew many hours to wear down the pieces we have.  The teeth marks can be seen but the size decreases very slowly. I have not seen any pieces breaking off that could be choking hazards or bowel obstruction hazards.  We do monitor their chewing of anything, however. To give an idea of their chewing capacity, the 8 month old can take down about 1/2 inch of flossie in about 15 minutes. The price is worth the chewing time for us.  I do not allow them free access because the older dog has a tendency to hide things and we grew tired of rushing around the house searching for the second chew when both wanted to chew.

review/summary: A different chewing experience
review/text: My dog had an unusual reaction with this one.  She hid this item twice while she normally consumes edibles immediately.  She was guarding it with her life, so she must have known it would be good.  I finally smeared some peanut butter on it and she settled in for a chew.  I have a beagle that's a little bit of a power chewer.  She worked on this chew for about 2 hours straight, leaving a small nub perhaps an inch long.  I'm sure she'll be back for the nub later.  I don't expect it to take much more than a half hour or an hour to finish the nub, so this chew yields around 3 hours of quiet time for us :)  While I was hoping for longer, this is a record in terms of edible chews.  If my dog were not possessive I would likely put it out for a smaller chewing break and then put it away for later.  I may try the chews for smaller dogs next time as I don't believe these are meant to be eaten in one sitting.<br /><br />Also, check out the (short!) ingredient list.  My dog is allergic to just about everything but this chew contains none of usual offenders.  It's basically made of milk.<br /><br />Two downers for me would be the price and the sound effects.  It sounds like teeth are breaking in there, although I don't think any harm was done and haven't seen any reports of breaking teeth with these chews.  Still, it's a little nerve-wracking to listen to.  I do anticipate buying these again for an occasional treat.

review/text: If you love chocolate you will love this mix. The only problem I have with cooking this mix is it will cook faster on the edges and slower in the middle, but this is common cooking gluten free mixes (bought or home made) and you learn to adapt cooking different gluten free foods.  I love my brownies a little moist in the middle so this works great for me.  I just had to learn how to set the oven so the brownies would not over cook on the edges and yet be just right in the middle.  Do I continue to purchase this brownie mix, Yes I do and I do recommend it.  Just remember as with all gluten free cooking it is a learning process at first so don't be discouraged if the first batch isn't just the way you want; take notes and keep trying because if you love chocolate you will love this mix.

review/summary: The BEST GF Brownie Mix
review/text: This mix was my first adventure into gluten free baking, and they turned out PERFECTLY. I actually think they are better than regular brownies. Rich, moist, and decadent, even my gluten-eating friends couldn't get enough.

review/summary: Yum...
review/text: Yes, you need to play with the liquid amount and your cooking time... But hey! Once you get those things pinned down, it is well worth it. The flavor is absolutely the best for any GF treat I have come across. You can either make according to directions, or play with it a little to enhance it further. I added mascarpone cheese (and reduced some of the butter) to this to make it even more rich and yummie. And the cooked texture is not like most GF mixes. It is solid and cakey versus sandy and crumby. I just talked myself into going to bake some more!!!! Enjoy!

review/summary: Remember "real" brownies before the gluten-free days?  Well...
review/text: My wife learned to make gluten free brownies about 20 years ago (I thought I'd gone to heaven with those and pizza - entirely lacking for more than 10 years at that point).  She's made them from scratch, used various mixes (some not so good, some great), but this is about as close to what "real" brownies tasted like in my pre-gluten free days.  And if Amazon is out of them, there are other sources at reasonable prices (Wal-Mart in many locations, for example).  I still prefer Amazon, of course - no tax, no shipping if over $25, etc.  There is not much more to say - these are GREAT!  Just as with many gluten free items, they don't stay as moist as "regular" (gluten-containing) brownies, so they won't last quite as long.  But it'll likely be difficult not to finish them all in a couple of days anyway, so that hasn't been a problem.<br /><br />Note: we won't give 5 stars unless we consider a product at the top of the "best" list.  This is more than just a very good product.  Gluten free?  You'll love these!  Family of gluten free relatives?  You'll hardly be able to tell the difference if at all.  Just enjoy.

review/summary: GF Betty Crocker!!
review/text: At first when I saw this in the grocery store, I wasn't sure it would be a good idea.  But since I have been recently diagnosed with gluten intolerance and I also LOVE brownies, I decided I would give it a try.<br /><br />I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!<br /><br />I followed the directions to the T but also added in some chocolate chunks (about half a bags worth - I LOVE chocolate too!! and some Madegascar vanilla bean paste about 1/4 tsp) and I made this mix in a mini cup cake tray that had about 24 mini cupcakes in it.  The entire batter made the 24 mini cupcakes.<br /><br />The texture was on point - it was moist, tender, decadent and the small mini cupcake servings were just the right portion sizes - two mini cupcake were enough to sate my sweet cravings.  And the remaining brownies freeze well.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has done an awesome job.

review/summary: YUM-better than regular gluten filled brownies!
review/text: I was diagnosed Celiac 6 weeks ago and just started trying to bake gluten free treats the past week (I am a chef so I figured I would be able to make something decent!). I tried the Betty Crocker yellow cake mix and was not successful. Next, I baked some tollhouse chocolate chip cookies with Domata Flour (gluten free) and also was not successful. I was about to give up for a while but my boys asked me to make the gluten free Betty Crocker brownies I had in the pantry. I added some chocolate chips and waited.....not anticipating good results at all. I can tell you, I am in heaven! I have been taking little pieces from the corners before dinner (don't tell the boys!) and just cannot believe how great this is. If you want a brownie that tastes....yes....BETTER than what you have had in the past, try this. We have some birthdays later in the week and I plan on making another pan and serving with vanilla ice cream. I do not think my family will even know it is gluten free! Buy and enjoy, be happy!

review/summary: Awesome Tasting Brownies!
review/text: These are some awesome tasting brownies when made when following the directions on the package.  I'm pretty sure no one can tell that they are Gluten Free, even my picky sister.  I like to substitute geletin for the eggs, and that worked well.  No real different in taste or texture.  When I tried to substitute applesauce for the butter like I do with other mixes it didn't bake correctly.  It got sticky and didn't want to come out of the pan.  The only draw back to this mix is that you need to use the butter which makes it high in saturated fat.

Even if I wasn't trying to follow a wheat free diet, I would make these brownies any day!

review/text: I've been GF about 1 year now, and to be honest don't miss cakes, brownies and the like that much. With that said, the novelty of these (buying GF items in a regular grocery store) meant I had to try them.<br /><br />The batter turns out VERY thick. It's okay, just spread it out very well. I used a 9x9 square pan. If I make these again I will cook them a few minutes less than the box recommended as the edges were a little tough. With that said, these turned out GREAT, just like regular brownies.<br /><br />I bought the chocolate chip cookies next - I can't wait to try them!

review/summary: Yummy..with some adjustments
review/text: First, let me say that I can sympathize with the reviewer who gave this a low review because the first time I made these brownies, they were so hard they almost broke the knife when I tried to cut them!  The second time I made them, however, I added an extra egg and also waited a little longer for the melted butter to cool.  They turned out a little more cake-like and were thicker and easier to cut.  These brownies are the best of all the gluten free Betty Crocker mixes I have tried and are comparable in taste (and a little cheaper) to other gluten free brownie mixes I have bought in specialty and health food stores.  In fact, I always had to doctor those mixes a bit by adding extra chocolate chips, but, with this mix it is not necessary.  This mix is easy and quick, which is really nice when a yummy dessert is needed and time is of the essence.  Good job on this one, Betty!<br /><br />I keep experimenting with this mix to make it "just right."  My latest experiment worked out the best so far!  I sacrificed my last can of pumpkin for this one! (Pumpkin seems to have disappeared off store shelves this year!)  Use three eggs, 1/3 cup canola oil, and 1/2 cup of "sacrificial" pumpkin puree.  Beat together well before adding the mix.  Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees in a 9 X 9 pan sprayed with baking spray.  These turned out really moist, cake-like, and cut easily!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These brownies are simply amazing, especially considering that they're gluten-free. I've tried a few gluten-free brownie mixes and these stand out above the rest. The great thing about gluten-free brownies is the fact that the chocolate usually masks the fact that they're gluten free. So, taste wise, gluten-free brownies tend to be fairly comparable to regular brownies. These are rich, chocolaty, and delicious. As for texture, typical gluten-free brownies are dense and feel more like fudge than brownies. These brownies, though a little dense are a little lighter than most mixes and gives the feeling of a standard brownie. If you're eating gluten-free and looking for a dessert fix, then I'd suggest indulging in these.

review/summary: Moist, Chocolate-y, Heavenly Brownies!
review/text: My neighborhood Kroger just started stocking the Betty Crocker GF mixes, so I bought 3 mixes on Friday, prepared the brownies this morning, and took them to a church event today.  There were 4 celiacs in attendance, plus one who has decided to eat wheat-free.  They all loved them, and two of the celiac women have been living gluten free for 20 years, so they've tried every mix and every recipe out there. Everyone declared these brownies to be the very best they have ever had anywhere.  All the husbands (who eat wheat) tried them, too, and the guys are anxious to have them again!  The batter is very stiff, but so easy to make (just add melted butter or margarine and 2 eggs, stir and bake).<br /><br />I also like Gluten Free Pantry Truffle Brownies, but it is so wonderful that another major name-brand manufacturer is coming into the gluten-free world (Chex paved the way!) with such an excellent product.  The availability of the Betty Crocker mixes will be a big plus, but the price on Amazon is certainly far better than my local store.  Oh, it is so nice to have delicious options!<br /><br />Thank you, Betty Crocker!

review/text: If you have to substitute eggs in the recipe, this mix is not for you.  The brownies turned out to be a sludge which became as hard as a rock.

review/summary: Terrible product in all ways
review/text: Firstly this is NOT gluten free. Secondly the mix is terrible, very very dry as batter, and very dry and crumbly and rock hard around the edges when cooked. Ate 1 and threw the rest away. NOT WORTH BUYING!

review/summary: Best GF brownie mix
review/text: If you have missed the ease and familiar taste of a boxed brownie mix try these!  Betty Crocker's GF brownies are an amazingly close contender to their original brownies.  They smell the same, look the same, and taste pretty darn close.  It was lovely to add butter and eggs and have yummy familiar brownies in under a half an hour. We are thrilled that a major brand has jumped on the gluten free band wagon, we hope many more companies follow!

review/summary: AMAZING
review/text: I recently went gluten free and I tried another brownie mix that cost $7 or $8 and wasn't impressed. I learned about the new Betty Crocker mixes right at the beginning of June before they were available, and kept checking in the grocery stores around here to see if they had them. I found them at Price Chopper last Friday and made them today, and the batter tastes like regular batter, even though it's a lot thicker. Once I baked them, the whole house smelled like chocolate, which didn't happen with the other mix. They taste SO good. They're really chocolatey, and a little bit chewy and are just like regular brownies. The Amazon price is a deal - I paid $4.49 at the store, and I would pay that much again, but with the Amazon price SO much lower... I'd rather buy them here. DEFINITELY worth the money.

review/summary: Play With Your Food
review/text: I regard this as a good starter for something more.  By itself, it makes good brownies, with a regular consistency that's neither cake-like nor brittle.  But there's nothing distinguished about the product.  Indeed, if you make it according to the package directions, it runs a bit dry (add about a tablespoon of oil to keep it from getting crispy).<br /><br />Instead, use this as a foundation and build on it.  I've had success turning this into something special by mixing in a few spoons of mint or raspberry jelly.  Or add a quarter cup of dark instant coffee for a special kick.  With either of those, consider adding in a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I'm not kidding: cayenne really brings out chocolate's hidden qualities.<br /><br />If you simply make these brownies according to the package direction, they'll be okay.  Nothing much stands out about them, but theyre better than bad.  But if you grab this opportunity to get adventurous and play with your food, you can really turn this adequate mix into a fun dessert that will keep your family coming back for more.

review/summary: yummy brownies!!!
review/text: These make delicious brownies.  SO easy to mix and bake.  I made mini brownie muffins and baked for only 15 minutes and they turned out PERFECT.<br /><br />They were soft, moist, chewey and SO chocolatey.  Really good.

review/summary: Excellent Brownies
review/text: I make these for my daughter, the only member of our family that needs to be GF.  These brownies are EXCELLENT!  Even my husband and I can't help but have a few ourselves--they are really quite indistinguishable from the "real" thing.  My daughter also has allergies to casein (milk protein) and I've had no troubles substituting a casein-free margarine for the butter called for in the recipe.<br /><br />The only downside to these brownies is that they don't hold up very well after a few days (they get quite hard).  This isn't usually a problem and we manage to eat them pretty quickly (the recipe makes a 9x9 pan, which we cut into 9 brownies).  I have not tried freezing them to preserve them longer but that has worked well with other gluten free brownie recipes in the past so you may want to give it a try if longer term storage is necessary for you.

review/summary: Made me very sick!!!NOT Gluten free
review/text: Just like some of the other posts, its made me and my 3 yr old daughter very sick. I cant handle small amounts of gluten. Were 100% gluten free. We ate these for our bedtime snack and both of us felt so bad in the morning we went back to bed and slept 2 1/2 hours and had all the other symptoms of eating a large amount of gluten! the chocolate cake from Betty CRocker did the same thing!<br />General mills cereals that says GF do the same thing to us! Beware! Make your brownies from scratch!

review/summary: Very good, but there is better
review/text: These were good, but tasted comparable to regular gluten brownies.  Gluten-Free Pantry Truffle Brownie Mix, on the other hand, is moister, has more flavor, and is hands down the very best brownies (gluten-free or not) we have ever tasted.  The Gluten-Free Pantry Brownies always receive raves wherever we bring them, and our non-celiac friends are willing to go out of their way to find them.  It's a shame to think new celiacs will purchase these because they are more conveniently found in grocery stores, rather than experiencing the best in gluten-free baking.<br /><br />They're good, but not the best.

review/summary: Not totally GF - celiacs beware
review/text: My husband is a long-time celiac, and we manage just fine by being careful.  He can tolerate trace amounts of gluten -- in soy sauce, for example. But this Betty Crocker brownie mix gave him the tell-tale gut-ache that says -- IT'S NOT TOTALLY GLUTEN FREE.  Celiacs beware.

review/summary: Thank you Betty Crocker
review/text: Thank you Betty Crocker for a product that is simple to prepare and one that might soon be available in mainstream markets.  Received mine through Amazon yesterday and promptly made them up as directed.  Super easy to prepare, directions clear, but flavor was just okay and thought there was a slight chemical taste (thinking maybe it is the cocoa used in the mix).  There was also mini chips in the mix which I am not sure really improves the flavor.  In the future for a better result, I will still reach for my standard brownie recipe using "Pamela's Gluten Free Baking and Pancake Mix", unsweetened chocolate baking bars, and "Pamela's Products" Brownie recipe (found on their website).  But, for friends who wish to mix up a batch of brownies for my child without a lot of fuss, this Betty Crocker Gluten Free Brownie Mix would be just the right product.
