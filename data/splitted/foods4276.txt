review/text: Package arrived squashed. Very poor mail pack. There was actual liquid vanilla that was squeeezed out of beans. When I reported it to Beanilla I was told that" that just shows how  moist the beans are" ? UNTIL THEY LEARN TO PACK CORRECTLY I WOULD NOT BUY FROM THEM. They also package in a vacuum bag without any documentation that it is food grade container.

review/text: Bought this for my wife. We'd recently bought a Celestial Seasons variety pack and had been stunned by the over-a-dollar-a-cup price tag. This was a much better buy and is now my wife's favorite K-Cup tea, regardless of price. I just wish Amazon would offer it as a subscription so we can shave off that fifteen percent!

review/summary: Best instant coffee hands down!
review/text: I've been buying CC Dark Roast instant for a long time and I love it!  It is by far the best instant on the market.  The instant comes in very handy when I don't want to brew a lot of coffee or when I only want one cup.  It's easy to adjust the flavor to your own personal taste according to the size mug used and it has a very rich coffee flavor without the "bite."<br /><br />One of my favorite ways to use it: I heat 16 oz. fat free milk to boiling in microwave; add 2 tablespoons of sugar free coffee flavoring (fav is white chocolate, but vanilla and/or caramel is good, too!); and 2 heaping teaspoons of the instant coffee.  This is a really good alternative to Starbucks' more higher priced lattes and I don't have to make a trip to Starbucks to get it!!

When I moved away from the South and couldn't find it in the grocery store, I tried whatever instant coffee was there.  It was terrible.  I've also tried Starbucks' Via.  It's doesn't work for me either.  So far, this is the best instant coffee I've found for adding caffeine and coffee flavor to smoothies.

review/summary: Useless as Coffee
review/text: Considering that it is one of the cheapest available coffees, it tests a person in more ways than one. In my case, the first hurdle, which may or may not be a common issue, was not even related to the taste, aroma, and all the other coffee centric factors that are used to ascertain the quality of a coffee, but the questionable hygienic conditions of the place where the coffee is packaged. The coffee jar's lid contained what seemed to be animal hair, and I must admit that the first reaction was rather unpleasant. Although cheap, it did not come for free, and a person expects a product produced at industrial scale and for human consumption to meet certain minimum standards of hygiene. In that respect, this product has proven to be an utter failure.<br /><br />In terms of taste, it has a predominantly barley like taste, which in my case was another great disappointment. Just as another reviewer has said, if you can make it work in your chocolate or coco smoothies, then the bought product would probably won't go to waste. However, as a coffee, it is simply useless; if you're a person on a budget who likes a strong coffee with some aroma, then instead give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IES">Taster's Choice French Roast Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce  Canisters (Pack of 3)</a> a try. Although the suggested item is slightly more costly, but in terms of taste, quality of packaging, and ease of use, it definitely is satisfactory.<br /><br />P.S: As another reviewer has shown an interest in knowing the type, quality, and color of the hair, then it was short - probably 1.5" to 2" inches long - brown in color, had a very poor texture with splinters all along the shaft, and was very brittle. Concerning the apathy towards the hygiene, most people expect professionally produced products to meet certain minimum standards. An overly finicky or fastidious person would have considered it to be reason enough for a suit in the small claims court.

review/summary: Disgusting, tastes soapy, salty, bitter. esp when cooled down.
review/text: What a disappointment. I started with one table spoon in a large mug (16 oz), was horribly tasteless. Added another spoon, was still fairly tasteless, so I added two more, finally some coffee taste. bit bitter, but not too bad. however, after about 15 minutes (got distracted with work), I took a sip, and almost had to spit it out. somehow it turned salty/soapy/very bitter taste. Even tonight over 12 hours later, I still have this horrible disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. YUCK!<br /><br />I noticed that other instant coffee brands I tried do tend to taste a bit more bitter if left standing, but only after a very long time (over an hour) and even then, just a bit more bitter, and never salty/soapy.<br /><br />Note, Amazon will not accept returns on food items. recommend that you look elsewhere if you drink instant.<br /><br />At work we only have a cold/hot water dispenser, but I like dark, strong coffee, and drink it black, no sugar. my favorite when I go out is a triple (some time quad) shot espresso. Initially at work I tried using water directly on ground coffee, let it stand a while, then filter into a different cup, but it is bit time consuming and can get messy... so I switched to instant, trying several different brands in an attempt to find a favorite. found some tolerable ones, but nothing to write home about yet. But now, after this experience, I'll probably switch back to ground coffee, this time will try a very fine Turkish style grind which settles to the bottom, so I wont need to filter.

Now I have 3 and 3/4's jars and have to decide what to do with them.

review/text: Delicious little bears!  Nutrition information and ingredient list both check out pretty good.  Seems like the flavors are cherry, strawberry, orange, and lemon.  There are two red flavors that are definitely different (cherry and strawberry?).  No mistaking the orange and lemon.  There are whitish ones whose flavor I have yet to identify.  These sweets are probably best described as jelly bean centers shaped like bears and coated in a little dried, granulated sweet product that's not labeled as sugar.  I've tried Annie's and Yummy Earth in addition to these.  All are good, even though these aren't gummy bears.  Given a choice of the three, I would pick these.  These are about two dollars per 2.75 ounce bag at my local store, making Amazon's price good by comparison, if only I actually needed 12 bags of these at a time.

review/text: Great tasting product, but they are more like sugar-crusted gumdrops than gummy bears. Maybe that's why I prefer these to the regular Surf Sweets Gummy Bears, although their Gummy Worms are the best of all (they pack the most flavor). All Surf Sweets are allergen-free and have 100% RDA Vitamin C. I only wish they weren't so expensive for how many you get in a bag. Basically one bag equals one serving, maybe two if you're not very hungry.

Check the sellers feedback, I am not the only one complaining!!!<br />How is possible that Amazon can aloud sellers without licencing for controlled substances and food in its pages??? I called the other seller whom also sells coca tea at Amazon "Bolivia Stores" and found out that they are an American company with all paperwork, licences and permissions while this is a different seller from Bolivia not linked to them in any way.<br />I presented a claim to Amazon today with all the detail<br /><br />I want my money back, I receive a product that cannot be used and I will contact my credit card company with the complain also but now, who fix the problem I have with Customs US???

Nearly $20,000 in legal fees has proven that you drink this tea and take a drug test you will have no grounds to fight it.<br />Buying it from Amazon was no defense!<br />Enjoy it if you don't have to worry about drug testing, but if you have any concern, steer clear.

review/summary: Very tasty - but may not be what you expect!
review/text: Although described as a Jerky, this is a wet (clear slightly viscous liquid, just enough to make it that you need a napkin to eat it) product in a vacuum sealed pouch.  So if you are expecting a dry, crispy jerky you are likely to be disappointed.  However, the product within the pouch I found to be very tasty, and the fat portion of the bacon did have a bit of crunch associated with it, as opposed to a rubbery/fatty texture.  Great smokey/bacon flavor, reminded me more of sliced preserved bacon, as opposed to dry jerky.  I have not tried the other bacon jerkys yet to compare it.<br /><br />The delivery timing and packaging were first class.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br /><br />Pros:  Tasty, true bacon product, well packaged, great shipping including a small pack of toothpicks!  Very similar to candied bacon.<br /><br />Cons:  Product is wet, no something crispy, eat easily from a pouch or to cut up over a salad (although this would be good in one!).  Price is relatively high - to cover labor and packaging costs I'm sure.  A home consumer could make candied bacon that would be very similar at a much lower cost - but no shelf life or convenience!

review/summary: Perfect addition to minestrone
review/text: These end up looking like little cucumber seeds. Toss them in to soak up extra water in soup. Cook in broth and stir into tomato soup. You can even cook them in highly flavored water (I like pepper corns and some smoked paprika) and stir them into quiche filling for a change of pace.

review/text: I've been using this sauce almost daily for more about 15 years. Not once have I wondered if someday I'd get tired of it. The sauce isn't really "hot," but is loaded with flavor and has a snappy tang. The complex mix includes raisins, mangoes, and some sugar for sweetness, peppers, onions, and cane vinegar for some bite, and thyme and cloves for subtle spicing. It's wonderful on meat, fish, fowl, and is great for marinade and more elaborate sauces. Made in Jamaica!

review/text: Recently, while dining out at a fine local Italian restaurant, I had the Pappardelle Bolognese. It was delicious. The sauce was terrific, but I had never had pappardalle before, and this pasta interacted with the sauce to wonderful effect. I decided that I had to purchase some pappardelle and serve it with my own meat sauce.<br /><br />I was happy to discover that the combination worked well together for me. I really enjoyed the taste of a nice pappardelle. And this brand tasted quite good. The pasta had a nice smooth taste and texture to it.<br /><br />All in all, I am a satisfied customer.

If my son eats something with flavorings or colors he reacts violently so I am eternally grateful that products like this exist that are yummy but still natural! I wish every company would use ingredients like Indie does! For instance, you can use beet juice to color something red. Why use FD&C red when you could use beet juice? Because it's cheaper or easier? Our kids deserve better! Indie Candy gives parents the ability to choose products that give their children a "normal" childhood while still considering their health and well being.

review/text: Reading the ingredients I was amazed this product, at least at this time had no corn or soy products. Another great factor no hydrogenated, or enriched and modified, substances. The oil is not man man made.<br />The only drawback possible peanut contamination. It is probably one of the healthier chocolate candy bars, that people know well.<br />I could say it ma give some allergic children a break, if soy, and corn aren't on their safe list. I've browsed several processed foods, and haven't found too many items without the allergens.<br />Even the natural, and even organics usually contain corn or soy. Maybe, more so!<br />Allergies involving food restriction, are not easy! I have had to deal with it, almost my entire life. Finding safe things cab help a child cope. Some normalcy is needed, especially with young children, and teens.<br />Give them a break with this delightful cookie like chocolate treat.

In China you should never have things in groups of four... it's bad luck because the word for "four" sounds very similar to the word for "death." I took the fact that it broke as a sign that the universe was looking out for me. ;)

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: My vet had recommended Royal Canin for my older cat because he had slight tartar buildup and because I was told it would lower the p.H. of his urine. Unfortunately, it was over $30.00 for an eight-pound bag, it smelled awful, and it contained by-products. Next, I tried Nutro, but I was shocked at some of the things I read about the product (such information can be found via a Google search). Finally, I picked up some Wellness, which was much less expensive than the vet's stinky stuff, having read multiple raves about the product.<br /><br />As soon as I opened up the bag of Wellness, my two fellas darted towards me. They scarfed down the Wellness, ignoring the Nutro in their bowls.  The cats did not have any digestive problems, and they continued to ignore the other food, so after a few days, I simply gave them Wellness. Needless to say, they absolutely love it. One time, I left the bag open on the counter while I went to refill their water bowls. I heard a strange chomping sound intermingled with rustling, and turned around-- I could only see the behind of my older cat, as he was shamelessly snacking from the bag of Wellness!<br /><br />And my two boys look absolutely amazing. Their soft fur is so shiny that it sparkles under the light! They have not had any issues with this food at all. Every time I come home or wake up, their bowls are always empty; my younger cat has even tried to lick his empty bowl in vain for any crumbs.<br /><br />I won't be using any other products. Wellness is a little pricey, but our furry friends deserve nothing but the best.

My cats all love this food and have done quite well on it.<br /><br />The food is pricey, but they do eat less by weight, so it stretches out pretty well.

review/text: we just adopted a healthy 3 years old house cat and I was told by the previous owner that he was a fussy eater, and with the food we were given from them, that was indeed the case; I was suspicious that perhaps he just doesn't like the food he's given; after some serious research into healthier options, I went to my neighbourhood food coop and tried the smallest quantity bag of this stuff and he loves it! he goes through 2/3 cups easily per day (suggested serving size), which is far more than her previous crappy run-of-the mill meal. I was particularly impressed that it was soy free, which is a pet peeve and health alert of mine.

After trying several other premium brands that he didn't care for I pucker up some of this. He loves the dry and the wet and so do the other two cats. We have a new food and will never go back to the garbage I believe whole hearted made him sick to start with. Thank u Wellness!

So I did some searching online I started out giving her Friskes and then I got Fancy Feast, I read that to give her the best I should try Wellness. Well I did, Wellness Indoor Health is wonderful. She is a short-hair but I was combing her almost everyday and she could get very hairy. I noticed immediately she is less hairy, and her fur is softer, and she is much more happier. My girl never complains about much with one exeception she will not eat chicken, beef, just fish, fish, fish. And I rather keep it that way, that's what cats should eat. Wellness works well her system. I mixed Wellness with a little Fancy Feast (since I purchased it might as well make use of it) and she gobbles it up. She is so healthy and happy with Wellness Indoor Health.

review/text: My wife is allergic to garlic so naturally, most Asian style sauces or quick meal ideas go down in flames because garlic while good is definitely the most overused seasoning out there.  When we first found this in our grocery store, we were exstatic to find it and hoped it would still taste good.  Well, it certainly does and ordering on Amazon with Prime makes it a no brainer in the cost department.  We can add 1-2 packs of this to a GIANT pan of chicken and tons of veggies to make a nice light stir fry.  Mixed with lots of vegetables in the dish, the calories can be maintained to stay low enough to have a big portion.  1 package covers a lot of food and it has a strong flavor so do not use too much if your dish is on the smaller side.

review/summary: I love this ginger tea!
review/text: I have tried other brands of herbal ginger teas and this one is definitely the best one by far! Other brands had funny tastes and I had to force myself to finish the box up. Traditional Medicinals organic ginger tea tastes great all by itself, which is how I drink it every day now. I also mix it with my favorite organic green tea every day. It really gives it a nice "bite"! I find green tea too bland when it is not mixed with something else. The health benefits of ginger are well known and it is great to be able to consume it every day in tea form!

review/summary: Wonderful for nausea.
review/text: Last year an internet search on home remedies for nausea/indigestion lead me to try simmering peeled, minced fresh ginger.  I was thrilled with how well it worked and how quickly.  Always happy to find a natural alternative to drugstore potions whenever possible, so yay! and buh-bye, nasty pink liquid and gross, hard-to-choke-down chalky tablets.  Personally, I love the slightly lemony, peppery 'bite' of ginger so that's a bonus as well.<br /><br />The problem with the fresh ginger is that it's not something I use every day and therefore a lot goes to waste and I've found that the quality of the roots available in local stores can vary a great deal from store to store and from one shopping trip to the next and - unfortunately - I can't always tell the good from the bad and the ugly until AFTER I've gotten it home and peeled, minced, and even sometimes tasted. The time/labor element of peeling, mincing and simmering for 15 minutes and the subsequent clean up of cookware and utensils is also something nice to avoid when not feeling well.<br /><br />Having been happy with other varieties of Traditional Medicinals tea in the past, I picked up a box of this at the store fully expecting it to be much inferior to the fresh but was very pleasantly surprised to find that not the case at all.  I love this tea!  Brewed covered for 13-15 minutes in a pre-warmed mug, it comes out still warm.  Not exactly the same peppery intensity of the fresh and sadly lacking any real hint of lemon, it's still very good-tasting in its own right.  Plus, it's always handy, don't have to worry about spoilage and it's portable.  It also works very, very quickly to relieve the occasional nausea and to aid digestion when I've overeaten or eaten something a little too greasy/spicy for me.  It also seems to work well in heading off potential problems when consumed shortly before a meal.  So happy when I can get relief from the pantry instead of the medicine cabinet.<br /><br />The price for the six pack here represents a considerable saving from my grocer's occasional sale price, too, so what's not to love?

review/summary: Very zingy
review/text: I first tried this tea several years ago when I had a lingering upper respiratory infection, because I read that ginger helped relieve mucus.  I'm not sure if it helped the mucus, but I have found that it helps relieve stomach discomfort caused by overeating or making unwise food choices.  Ginger tea was an acquired taste for me.  At first I didn't like it much and had to add honey or sugar, but now I like it plain and strong.  The tea has a definite zing, and the longer you brew it the zingier it is.  I have tried another brand of ginger tea but it didn't have the zing, and didn't taste as good.

review/text: I love ginger tea and usually just boil ginger root in water to make tea.  I tried this brand for the first time when it was on sale at my grocery store.  Of course this is not as strong as drinking tea made from boiling the root, but it is still pretty strong.  I also like that this one does not combine the ginger with other things.

review/summary: Great ginger tea!
review/text: This tea is so good when one's stomach is uneasy.  It seems strange, because it's very strong flavored and doesn't strike me as soothing.  To make it, boil the water hard and let the bag steep for a long while in a covered cup.  I use lots of sweetener to soften the sharp gingery taste.  I wouldn't drink it every day, but when I'm in the mood for something very different, or have an upset stomach, it's the perfect thing.  It beats out pepto-bismol, maalox, or the like.

review/text: This product in theory is great...if it replaces packets in fast food joints! I understand it is a new idea and Heinz is all about making money, but if I want to dip my fries at home I'd squeeze from the bottle and until these are out at fast food places I will not use them. I'd be willing to pay an extra 25 cents or something around there for this option. But why would I buy 10 oz of Ketchup for around $4 (which is around what I've seen this 10 pack going for in supermarkets) when a 40oz bottle is around $2...and a 64 oz bottle on sale can be gotten for around $2.50-$3.00. So for me this is a WHY BUY?!?

review/summary: Not your father's chestnuts
review/text: This sweet and smooth spread is a delicious topping for your morning brioche or your evening ice cream alike. If you have never tried this before, it is like a honey of creamed chestnuts. Even that description does not do it justice. Perhaps try to imagine a cross between Nutella and honey, but with no hint of chocolate. It spreads easily over breads, though I highly recommend you try it on something that is not coarse like American toast and not too sweet like a muffin. Let the flavor of the spread speak for itself by trying it on a sweet roll, brioche, or similarly basic bread. It is difficult to find in the United States, so I am delighted that Amazon sells a variety of Creme de Marrons.<br /><br />The container itself is good, resisting cracks or damage during daily wear and tear. Since this is a food that appeals to children, it makes sense to not have it packaged in glass or another breakable material. This tin and its classic paper label are so darling that I cannot bear to part with it so I wash it out to reuse as a pencil cup.<br /><br />This food product is not recommended for someone with blood sugar tolerance issues or trying to lose weight.

I never tried a mix that transforms my grilled chicken into something so great before. California BBQ will surely become one of our favorites. The other kind in this package that we tried is the Kansas City BBQ Rub. There is nothing like the smooth, spicy and sweet taste of Kansas City's barbecue. Whenever we have a craving for this awesome barbecue, we will always turn to the Kansas City Style rub by Bbq bros. We haven't had a chance to try the Texas version yet(but will VERY soon) but everyone knows Texas BBQ is one of the best so I'm sure this rub will stand the test too!

review/text: I've long been a fan of grass fed beef, so when I saw this listing, I decided to give the mail order thing a try. I received this shipment packed in dry ice, and immediately noticed that the packages were a little small for 1 pound packs of beef (upon weighing each of them individually, only TWO of the packages weighed a pound - the others were less than one pound, though the packaging stated they were a pound each).<br />The shipping cost combined with the high cost of the beef itself (much more expensive than anything I've bought at my local organic market) was - in my opinion - not worth it. The beef was decent, but nothing spectacular (and for the price, it SHOULD be spectacular - and weigh as much as it states on the packaging).<br />I think I'll stick to my local grass fed beef. I don't mind the drive if it saves me $25.

Nothing has been able to replace the habit until Mate Chocolate! The gentle sweetness and light caffeine hit the spot so well that I can finally kiss my calorie/chemical laden coffee + creamer goodbye and wake up the way I want to! No crashing or blood sugar spikes these days. I even enjoy this tea cold. I ignore the steeping directions and simply let the bag hang out in the cup the entire time I drink.<br />I should note that the tea bags themselves are mighty thin. Often times when squeezing them out at the end of the cup I tear them open.<br />This is one of the few teas I can also drink on an empty stomach.

review/text: This is a very pleasant tasting tea.  For those who find unadulterated yerba mate to be a bit off-putting, this tastes very different.  I just happen to love them both.<br /><br />The packaging includes good instructions to not get your water too hot for steeping, which is important.  I tend to just let it steep until the water has cooled, then drink it whenever I remember.  Steeping in cold water works as well, just throw it in a 1L bottle with water and shake it around for a while.  Very refreshing, and convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended, it makes a great alternative to a second cup of coffee.
