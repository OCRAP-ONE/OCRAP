review/summary: Great quality Raspberry Leaf
review/text: I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.<br /><br />Also check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ">Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: This is great quality tea
review/text: I drank this tea after my first trimester of pregnancy for its numerous health benefits.  It is pure red raspberry leaves and great organic package.  They are  not individually packaged, they come in a foil lined paper lije package and there are no strings or tags, just steep add agave or honey to sweeten...it is a little bitter but not bad and drink!

review/summary: Good Things Come in Stinky Packages
review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!

It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Best  Peppermint Tea I've Ever Had !!!
review/text: I have been drinking this brand of gourmet peppermint tea since I was a child. It is imported from Germany and has a very clean taste. I have used one teabag allowed to steep a little longer to yield an entire small pot of tea, which also makes it quite economical.<br /><br />Have tried many other brands of peppermint tea when I couldn't find this one and none measure up. This is the best!

review/summary: Not a good experience for amazon service but soup was fine
review/text: The soup was fine, it'w what you buy at the grocery store.  However, I bought this in february and UPS left it at my door, which is what they usually do.  However, I didn't bring it inside for several hours because I was at work.  By then at least half of the cans had exploded due to the soup freezing.  I had to contact amazon customer service because they do not allow the return of food, so they had to make a special exception for this.  I would not buy this from amazon again.

review/summary: Not Chinese restaurant-style hot mustard
review/text: I was hoping that the Roland Chinese Hot Mustard would approximate the ubiquitous and very, very powerful hot mustard served by Chinese restaurants with egg rolls and such. Alas, it was less like that than I'd hoped, and quite a bit like standard supermarket prepared mustard -- a slight kick, but nothing that will open your sinuses or tear up your eyes.<br /><br />After doing more online research, I'm next going to try something made from a mustard powder; several sources indicate that as soon as it's mixed, the potency begins to fall, so perhaps the Roland product is as good as can be found pre-mixed as a liquid or paste.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Cadbury's is by far my favorite brand of chocolate. I've tried all different types of chocolate from organic stuff, to imported stuff, to exotic stuff, to domestic brands to the very expensive stuff so it's funny that it's the proletariat everyman's Cadburys, which is in my humble opinion the best tasting.<br /><br />In their fruit and nut bar you get hard and soft. The nuts are crunchy and the fruit (raisins) is soft. Together you not only get gustatory pleasure but you get a textural pleasure from the mixture of something crunchy as well as something soft in your mouth. I have to admit that Cadbury's, which is tailored to the American sweet tooth is a mite too sweet and it isn't dark chocolate, which is "good" for your health. But who wants to live forever anyway? Chocolate is for pleasure, it's a hedonistic pleasure, if you're into health you should be eating sprouts and doing yoga, not eating this.<br /><br />But taste is in the end subjective, all I can do is to ask you to try it. For me, it is the best.<br /><br />These are the single bars. Unfortunately, they really should be two servings per bar because they are so big. I did buy this pack and you really should only eat 1/2 bar each time.

I purchased it to give as a gift but when it arrived there was more shredded paper than product, so I kept it and bought something else for our friends. I'm glad I did because the chocolate was "waxie" tasting and did not have a pronouced, rich, deep chocolate flavor one would expect from a company with the reputation Godiva has. The only thing worth while in the basket were the coffee mugs.  Do yourself a favor and buy some See's, Fannie May's or Rocky Mountain Chocolates instead.

It was still in liquid form and not crystallized like raw honey often is. I won't go into any of the many great medicinal qualities of Manuka honey as I'm sure that if you're already looking at this item, you're aware of it. I can say that the taste was interesting. Personally, I prefer the taste of Ulmo honey (why a four-star rating instead of five) - but I will be keeping this honey on hand for any medical ailments it may help.

When you review an item and give it 1 star, you are rating the product as bad and it gives the wrong impression when you are simply upset about being ripped off. I agree with you though, this is currently outrageously overpriced considering I was getting three packs for something like 50 cents per serving.

What I got was pizza size pepperoni in about 7-1.75oz packages. So, maybe I got more pepperoni per ounce, it's still just not what I wanted. It cost more, too, than from the other seller. What I bought was from a different seller. Somebody needs to explain to me, why, after purchasing from the other seller, I go to my list of purchased items, and click on that item, it takes me to this page of, supposedly the item I wanted, at a much better price from a different seller! If the other seller couldn't fulfill my order with exactly what I wanted, why wasn't I notified? Now, this pepperoni will probably last till forever, except that it expires the end of the year.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: This is a great tea! I usually drink a green tea at night after dinner and alternate between this one and another I have. It has a great flavor, which to me is a bit on the nutty side. It kind of reminds me of Genmaicha (spelling?). I did ask my nutritionist about using it more frequently but she warned me about an ingredient in it called senna and advised to be cautious about taking in senna as it is a bit of a "laxative".

review/text: Seriously, this (& the other donut house coffees) are simply the best. The chocolate flavor is there but not overbearing and no weird chemical taste that some flavored coffees have. Way better than Timothy's "german chocolate cake". All of Timothy's coffees have a bit of a weird chemical aftertaste to me. Gloria Jean's "swiss chocolate" isn't bad but it doesn't compare to this coffee. If you like chocolate and like flavored coffee, you'll love this coffee!

I have been very disappointed by flavored coffee made for Keurig machines.  Overall, many other flavored coffees have forgotten the flavor, with many tasting not only bitter, but day-old too!

review/text: This Chocolate Glazed Donut flavored coffee is honestly the absolute best chocolate flavored coffee I've EVER had in my 60 years on this earth! I made a travel sized mug of coffee and it was perfect! I should point out that I don't like very strong coffee (like expresso), so this was just right for my tastes. I do buy the bold Keurig coffees, however; mainly because I like making the travel mug size.<br /><br />I just wish this came in decaf so I could have it at night for dessert!

review/text: First off, I am not a fan of flavored coffee.  I usually find flavored coffee to have an artificial or chemical taste.  However, I am a fan of donuts and I will admit that the packaging made me think of a delicious chocolate donut.  I wanted to try it.<br /><br />I read the reviews here, which were mostly positive, and I picked up a variety box with this in it to try it.<br /><br />I was not disappointed!<br /><br />The first thing you notice as it's brewing is the smell.  It really does have a chocolate donut smell.<br /><br />I also like bold or dark coffee, and this isn't as strong as I'm used to, but this does well as a flavored coffee.  It has a slight cocoa flavor that is not overpowering.  I recommend brewing this on a small setting to get a more concentrated flavor.  Give it a try!.

review/text: I am constantly trying new K-cup flavors/brands and while I won't go as far as saying this is the absolute best overall, it is one of the best I've ever tried.  As soon as you brew that first cup you will smell the amazing chocolate glazed donut aroma and it tastes just as good!  If you add creme and/or sugar to your coffee you will still enjoy the brewed in chocolate glazed donut taste. It is smooth, not bitter at all and just a great cup of coffee for everyday or for a treat to mix it up from a non-flavored blend.

review/text: The chocolate is more aromatic than flavorful.<br /><br />This is not a strong coffee, if you make it with using the 9 or 11 ounce brew setting on your Keurig brewer it is weak.  Using the 7 ounce setting it is okay but not strong.  5 ounce brew setting seems to be the best for coffee strength.<br /><br />I prefer a bit of kick to my coffee and when I make flavored coffees I want to taste the flavor as well as smell it. I'm glad I purchased a 5 cup sampler through Keurig direct and did not buy a box of 48 as sold here on Amazon because I will not be purchasing this flavor of K-cups again.

review/summary: Almost five stars
review/text: Our office recently (and possibly misguidedly) voted a Starbucks machine off the island and replaced it with a couple of Bunn airpot makers. They're great for commercial coffee but that is also the problem: it tastes like mediocre diner coffee even when good beans are used. So I've taken matters into my own hands and picked up an Espressione Cafe Novecento espresso maker and have put it in the kitchen "on loan" to the company.<br /><br />My first few attempts at pulling a decent shot with fresh ground coffee convinced me that I simply don't have the patience to learn the proper technique so, as the machine came with a pod portafilter, I decided to give that a shot (so to speak). Illy had the highest number of positive recomendations so I settled on them for my initial foray.<br /><br />Simply put, I am impressed. The flavor is excellent, the output takes in the ballpark of 20-30 seconds a shot and has very good crema on about three out of every four shots. It can be tricky to properly seat the pod in the portafilter but moistening the pod first does help and that's a more a reflection on the filter design than the pod's.<br /><br />The primary reason I can't give five stars (although I'd do four and a half if I could) is that even the Amazon price works out to almost a dollar a shot so my double Americano in the morning is only slightly less than I'd pay my favorite barista. And she has a really cute smile.<br /><br />All in all, though, a very positive experience and I recommend the Illy pods.

review/text: Illy Dark Roast Pods provide a great-tasting cup of espresso with crema and without the mess of cleaning up all those grounds. The tin packaging is compact for easy storage, but I recommend keeping the opened pods in a vacuum container to maintain freshness. If you're willing to invest in two 18-pod tins, you can't beat the price on Amazon!<br /><br />For a slightly different great taste and individual packaging to maintain freshness, try Espressione as an alternative, though the individual packaging requires additional storage space in your cupboard.

review/summary: Easy to use, cheap, and actually makes pretty good espresso.
review/text: So, I'll start by saying I'm sort of an espresso snob. I got an espresso machine after spending 3 days on the internet checking out the best ones and ending up with a great deal on a Francis Francis X3 FrancisFrancis! X3 Espresso Machine, Black Matte.<br /><br />I was wary of the pod idea and couldn't imagine getting real espresso from an air packed pod of really old espresso. Francis Francis had a canister to try in the package, so I broke down one day and just tried it. I must say, it was actually really good. The canister was a little old so the espresso was a little bitter but it had better cr&egrave;me and consistency of most any of my pulls.<br /><br />The Francis Francis machines are made for pods so I just put the little guy in and turned on the machine. Clean-up was easy, just pull the side paper and throw it away. I didn't have to wipe-up espresso dust off everywhere, clean espresso off the machine...nothing really. Not to mention the price of these little things is much better than having to pay for ok/horrible espresso close to home or pay outrageous amounts for shipping. Also, Lilly makes many different varieties of espresso like medium (I left this same review for that variety), dark, decaf, etc. (not sure about other brands, I've just stuck with Lilly)<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I've converted... I'm a closet pod user and the ease of use and the fact that I can get 36 pods for less than a dollar a piece is great for me.

review/summary: Not Up to illy's High Standard
review/text: I am disappointed. They work as advertised: quick, clean, and easy. However, more important to me is taste.<br /><br />While individually wrapped, the freshness of beans ground just for that moment is missing. The pod itself uses less coffee than I would in a single shot. Since I more often will make lungos, the sheer lack of coffee volume produces a weaker drink. Instead of pulling twice as long, I pull it 80% as long for a short shot, but it takes longer to get it all into the cup.<br /><br />The crema is impressive, equal to any regular Illy.<br /><br />The cost-per-drink is poor. I already knew this, but hoped I would be impressed enough by the quality so as to tolerate the price.<br /><br />I regular buy cans of illy's dark roast whole beans for grinding into espresso. These ESEs are not as good as the real thing. Because of the high standard illy otherwise supports for its products, I cannot give my full support to the illy Caffe Scura Coffee, Espresso, (Dark Roast, Black Band), 18-Count E.S.E. Pods.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I'm pretty particular about my expresso and I much prefer fresh ground to the pods. But fresh ground is messy and takes more time. I have tried a bunch of different pods on the market. These are by far the best I've had. They give a rich bold flavor that's still smooth and enjoyable. Compared to the Starbucks pods these are one star above at least. They are a bit more expensive, but after going back and forth between these, the starbucks ones, and a few other brands the price difference per pod is usually no more the $0.20. In my opinion it is well worth the extra $0.20 for a delicious cup of expresso. Often better even then what I get at various coffee shops. If your an every day espresso/latte/cappuccino drinker then you will appreciate the subtle yet noticeable higher quality of these pods.
