review/summary: Absolute rubbish!
review/text: I have a cat and dog.  I had a flea infestation so bad that I got bitten during my sleep all over - hands, feet, neck, body.  I thought it was mosquitoes initially.  I got this flea trap and placed it under my bed, and near the dog and did everything they said.  My animals were itching a lot all the time as I had run out of flea meds and vet was out of supply temporarily.<br /><br />I DID NOT CATCH ONE SINGLE FLEA AT ANY TIME FOR 2 MONTHS OF USE IN VARIOUS ROOM, NEAR DOG, UNDER CABINET, UNDER BED - NADA, ZERO, NIZ, NYET, NON!!!  This manufacturer needs to be reported to FTC for making false claims on products.  Utterly useless, DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />Here is how to eliminate fleas:<br />do it myself pestcontrol Online - Order Talstar Pesticide and Ultracide for spraying your mattress.  Do not spray pet bedding - wash it instead.  Smell is too strong for animals.<br /><br />Vacuum your house as if your life depended on it!!  Vacuum floors, carpets, crevices, mattresses, under cabinets, etc.  Throw away vacuum bag at end of first vacuum, then weekly.  spray Ultracide inside vacuum bag to kill fleas as they hatch and store vacuum outside your house.<br /><br />Spray house and yard with Talstar using a 2-3 gal pump sprayer like Chapin.  Mix and spray.  Kills all bugs outside too!  Do not spray flowers or edibles.  Spray perimeter of house, driveway, cracks in concrete, ant hills, etc.  Avoid earthworms.  Repeat in one week to kill hatchling fleas.  Let dry before letting pets back in.  Has no smell.<br /><br />Spray your mattress with Ultracide and under cabinets.  This has a strong smell. Do not spray this near animals as they have sensitive noses!  Let dry and aerate house.<br /><br />Wash animals with Eqyss Microtek Shampoo and Eqyss Premiere Conditioner. Give dogs Comfortis orally once a month.  Give cats Revolution applied to skin once a month.<br /><br />On Amazon, buy Nitenpyram ($1 per tab) from Little City Dogs, which is generic for Capstar ($6 per tab).  This works for 24 hrs only and kills fleas instantly. Give animals orally (2 sizes) at the same time you are spraying house so all fleas die that day!  You can give them Nitenpyram same time as other flea meds, no problem.  Give animals another dose next day then after one week, so you keep zapping new hatchlings.<br /><br />This should eliminate fleas for 6 months till the next spraying.  I spray 2 times per year and keep my animals on monthly flea meds plus Nitenpyram as needed.

review/summary: Flea traps are great
review/text: I take care of five cats and I give them a flea treatment every month, so none of the cats had fleas on them (and they're all inside cats.)  When I noticed the floor of a bathroom had fleas, I purchased these traps.  Within an hour of putting them out, they were covered with fleas, even though there were no fleas anywhere else in the house (where I also placed traps).  This really gives me peace of mind because I want the cats to be comfortable and healthy, so I'll always put these traps out; if no fleas are ever discovered, then I'll know I'm doing my job.

review/text: This trap did not attract fleas like I had expected.  The bulb burnt out in less than a week.  I had this trap close to the dog beds.  After 2 weeks it had only 2 fleas it.  I have 5 dogs and 2 cats and they all have fleas, in spite of monthly applications of Advantage.  I also ordered another brand when I bought this.  It was placed on another floor, and caught about a dozen fleas in the same 2 week period.  Simple pie pans with soap water and a desk lamp caught more during this same 2 week test.  It is not as neat looking, but does a better job.

review/summary: Didn't work for me, but maybe I didn't have enough fleas
review/text: My dog was having a serious flea problem and I figured it was the whole house since I could see the fleas jumping off my bed.  Our house is very clean and I vacuum once a week so I was surprised to see so many fleas.  I bought this trap with enthusiasm, as I really wanted to see it work. My husband laughed at me and rolled his eyes when he saw me setting it up. I put it next to the dog bed.  Two weeks and not a single flea! Everyday I would check it and my husband would just laugh at me. I think I was more upset that my husband was right about it being a waste of money than it not working. But, it did make a good night light.  Other than that, it didn't work.  Maybe I didn't have enough fleas. Bummed.

review/summary: Works, Sort Of
review/text: This is a review of the refills, followed by the same review as the trap.  The refills are easy to use, they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old, flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill.  Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.<br /><br />For the trap itself:<br /><br />I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.<br /><br />The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.<br /><br />If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.

review/summary: Inexpensive, non-toxic, and it works!!!
review/text: I love this little gizmo. I wouldn't expect it to rid you of fleas all on its own, but it is a great assist. I think it is most valuable in letting you know how effective your other efforts are, because if you have fleas, they *will* find their way into this trap. When I first started treating this season, I put this trap out. Overnight, it was covered in fleas, just like in the product pictures. As things started to get better, I noticed a decrease in how many fleas were being trapped. The last time I changed a disk, I caught several moths and such and one flea. Success!!!<br />I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ3FP6">SentryHOME Household Flea and Tick Spray, 20-Ounce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051GCTAW">Fiproguard Fiproguard Topical Flea and Tick for Cats, All Weights</a> as two of the most effective products for ridding your home of fleas.

review/summary: works terrific
review/text: I've used these for 4 years. Just can't seem to get rid of fleas, but these work great. I use a few of them as I open my windows and no matter how tiny the holes in your screens are, they get in and also come in on my family as well. They work better at night when the house is dark as fleas tend to gravitate to the light. It's amazing how many they catch, one refill lasts a very long time as the surface is large compared to the size of a flea and it remains sticky. The only other alternative would be to bring my chickens in to take care of the problem, but then there's a different problem to deal with. If my town zoning law allowed my chickens to wander, my flea and tick problem would virtually disappear.

review/text: If the directions for use are followed, this works very well - in a dark room, where there's little activity. Especially in combination with Advantix (or another, just not Hartz - that stuff is dangerous) flea and tick drops for the pet. My son and I made it a math game (he loves math) for him to keep track of how many fleas were found each morning, added to the previous flea count. Even during daytime and evening with the lights on, if there's no one in the room so the fleas don't jump on you instead, fleas would jump in. Not in hordes, thank goodness, but it did help to clear the fleas from the floor and furniture without having to use stinky powders or chemicals. I would recommend this!!

review/summary: Worked great for me.
review/text: I left my garage door open while mowing one day and a stray cat decided to bring her 5 small kittens in. When my wife and daughter saw them they made a bed for them and that led to the sister bringing another 5 kittems in. Needless to say shortly thereafter the garage was full of fleas. Once the kittens were big enough, I got my garage back except for the fleas. After spraying and spraying with no good results I found out my son had used one of these traps and it worked, so I bought 2. I'm on my 3rd pad in each trap and I can tell you they are working great It's not an overnight fix for a big infestation like mine but I just leave them on and as new fleas hatch out they go to the light and die. I can now walk into the garage and leave without any unwanted guest on me.

review/summary: sticky flea trap disks
review/text: I have had Victor flea traps set up in my living room and bedroom continuously for several years. I live in an area where fleas are a problem all year round. They work extremely well at capturing fleas however as others already noted, they don't kill the eggs so other measures are needed in addition to the flea traps. Unfortunately, I also trapped a large lizard one time, and had a heck of time getting him unstuck while trying to keep his fingers and toes attached to his body (I shook sand over the flea paper and kept shaking it so it stuck to the paper every time I pried off a toe/leg). I wish changing the paper could be made easier. It can be very difficult to replace the flea paper without it sticking to my fingers over and over and over. That's the only reason for the 4 rating vs a 5.

Yes, it can stink; however, when I look at how many hundreds of flies are in it and how many thousands have been therefore prevented from reproducing I have no problem holding my breath when walking by the traps.  I dislike our throw away society and do force myself to add water and dump the dead into a bag, tie it up and toss it in the dump then just re-bait and hang.  We have a herd of horses and the difference with these traps around is happily noticeable.  Get these and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Amazing (and gross!)
review/text: These traps are simply amazing - they take a few days to kick in, but they fill up quickly after that. I've had at least a hundred flies caught in a week, and it makes you think "where did they all come from?" (we live in a suburban area)<br /><br />YES, it does stink - the dead flies start to decompose, obviously, after a few days. While you *can* empty and re-use, I just throw it out with the garbage and use a new trap. For this reason, best put them someplace where you don't pass often (or eat close to!). This will also attract flies in the local area, so you'll see a lot of activity near the trap.<br /><br />It takes a few weeks of use to clear our the fly population, so buy more than one. I guess the lifespan of a common fly is about 2 weeks.<br /><br />Definitely worth getting - I try to buy a few at a time and use proactively.

review/summary: Above and beyond any reasonable expectation.
review/text: I live in an urban coach house where the rear faces the alley. The alley is filled with trash, so as one might expect, I get my fair share of rogue flies in my house. I first tried the sticky fly tape stuff inside, and while it worked decently, it was more of a situation where it would catch a fly if it just happened to land on the strip. I still found myself killing more of them via shoe than the tape managed to catch. Not to mention having fly tape in your house is disgusting and messy. So I decided to try the Victor Fly Magnet outside by the garbage.<br /><br />If this thing caught 30 flies I would be satisfied. It caught, seriously, thousands. They are literally jam packed in it all the way to the top, and more are still trying to muscle their way in. I'm not only amazed by how well this trap works, I'm amazed that this many flies live near my home. My only question is, what do I do with it now? Set it on fire? Tape a grenade to it?<br /><br />In the 4 days since I put it outside, I have not had one fly in my house. Not a single one.<br /><br />Oh, and it doesn't stink that bad. The bait, when your mixing it in, smells like a barn or perhaps a dead fish. I can barely smell it when I'm standing next to the trap full of flies in the hot summer air.

review/summary: Works very well
review/text: I live in an urban neighborhood and I hate flies so I'm starting to buy these things by the crate.  Everyone should use them, they work.<br /><br />Pros - I've killed literally thousands of flies.  Gallons of flies. Eventually I think I'll manage to wipe out the local breeding population and get ahead of the curve.  Trick is to start early in the spring - what one is really trying to achieve is population control not just killing a few flies.  Otherwise (depending on your landscape of course) the neighbors flies will just move in.  Bottom line if you use it according to the directions this flytrap works extremely well.  Many of the negative reviews here clearly didn't read the directions.  It really needs to be in sunlight.<br /><br />Cons - it reeks.  Seriously.  I can't imagine anyone using this inside their house - when it gets going you don't really want to be within 20 feet of it.  Unbelievably strong smell of rotting garbage. And though it's theoretically reusable, you are unlikely to do so unless you have a really strong stomach.  Think a big jar of rotting dead and half dead flies.  It's really foul.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you use it properly - think some form of perimeter defense, with targeting of fly hot spots like garbage cans with loose lids, you can make your world fly free.  If you have really few flies, one jar properly located will take care of them, but you should actually spend some time analyzing what you need.<br /><br />Anecdotally and by observation, btw, this seems like the most effective fly trap on the market

We used 2 at a time, placing them on each side of the back yard in convenient hanging locations.  They are 3/4 full of flies when we replace them with the new set.  They are terrific.  We use our back yard all the time for BBQ and family gatherings and these have really made a difference this year.  They are easy to hang, no offensive odor, not difficult to look at either.  The size is useful but not offensive to see.

review/summary: Best fly traps EVER!
review/text: We are currently living in Africa, and so I wasn't sure if these traps would work with the flies here, but I bought these anyway.  I received them very quickly from Amazon.  I hung 2 of them up, and literally within  a few days we had a lot of flies inside.  It's been 2 weeks, and there are a THOUSAND flies in EACH trap!  I have just ordered bait refills for these.  They are amazing!!!!  I was concerned with the smell mentioned in some other reviews.  While there is a "fishy" odor in the traps, it wasn't noticeable once they were hung outside.  One was hung fairly close to the house in a tree by a patio, and another on our pool fence on the other side of the patio.  After the traps were filled with flies, I realized the smell became a little more pronounced due the decaying flies!  It's not a big deal, and it would be worth much more of a nasty smell to have that many flies trapped anyway.  We've noticed less flies in the house (we like to leave our doors open since we have 2 dogs that go in and out, and the weather here is so nice).  If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would!

review/summary: Awesome Fly Killet
review/text: This trap works.  The bait smells a little like dead fish - really, this is a plus! Other traps I've used smell like strong, old, damp poop; I find that worse than old fish.  On top of that, the other traps I've used all have warnings on them attached to their bait - the Victor traps are made with food-grade material, and are non-toxic. they make refill baits as well, so I don't have to keep spending money on new traps. We use it in the yard where the dogs and chickens are, so inexpensive, non-toxic solutions are a must. The smell is dissipated outside, and I can't really smell much once it's outside unless I'm standing right next to the trap.  It takes about a day for the bait to start working - the instructions say to give it several hours - but once it's really activated, it catches hundreds and hundreds of flies in a couple of days.<br /><br />I'm very happy with Victor Fly Magnet traps, and so are the animals.

review/text: I tried using this product in the garage after purchasing at a farm store.  The traps made it smell like something died in the garage.  Two traps got 2 flies in 3 days and there were a LOT of flies around.  My kids swatted a lot more flies than these traps caught.  Then I placed them outside where one trap caught maybe 100 flies and the other caught 1 (in addition to the 2 it got in the garage).  But even outside the odor was so bad my husband asked me to get rid of the traps.

review/summary: Not worth the effort and smell(?)
review/text: I bought four of these from Amazon to get the free shipping since I don't ever want to pay shipping, and I was too lazy to drive to a retail store and buy just one to try.<br />Flys really bother me inside the the house, or in the garage. Now, I'm not so dumb as to think I could use these inside the house, but I thought inside the garage might work. The bait when mixed in warm water doesn't initially have much of a strong oder.<br />I put a trap in the garage and had no catches within a couple of hours, even though the garage was buzzing with critters. I then moved the trap outside, about 20 feet from the open door. That day I had several flys trapped. The next day I had even more. The trapping accelerated each day until on about day five I had a layer of 1+ inch of dead flys in the trap jar. Unfortunately, the stench of rotting flesh was now detectable at about 50 yards away, downwind. It appears that the bait is only to get the trapping started, and it's the dead flys that really draw more flys in. At this point I had to get rid of the stench; I could either bury the god-awful mess, or pour it into the sewer system (my choice). I then employed two traps with the same smelly results. I again used the two traps but started with left-over canned cat food (in water) as the bait. The cat food seemed to do as good as the purchased bait, and the end results were again the same.<br />After thinking it over, the removal of several dozens of outside flys that are immediately replaced from the countless numbers existing in the environment is hardly worth the trouble (and smell) of using the fly traps.

review/text: I've just installed the third unit in our garage or outdoors on a tree branch.  In each case, after a few hours, the trap is surrounded by a swarm of flies practically going frantic to get inside.  They are ordinary house flies.  The numbers are shocking - they must be coming in from all over the county.<br /><br />The plastic bottle, screw-on lid, and little roof are quite rugged and would probably last indefinitely.  The unit comes with a length of wire that works nicely for hanging it from a ceiling fixture or small tree branch.<br /><br />The bait is a powder that you mix with water.  The smell is quite foul, rather like - well, you know what flies enjoy sitting on most.  It's definitely for outdoor use, although with ventilation you might place it in the garage or shed.<br /><br />My experience indicates it is wise to empty the bottle before it fills up completely with dead flies, living flies, and maggots.  This will be a disgusting task and the stink will be formidable - not something you'll want to do near the house.

review/summary: Humiliation and Disgust
review/text: Monkey enjoys sitting out on the patio during the day, and sometimes evening, but she is averse to having us close the screen door as she is concerned about possible encounters with the gardener or the white cat from next door.  The white cat is recent addition to our neighborhood, and seemed pleasant at first, but then I saw him peeing right in the middle of an agapanthys in the garden, and since then, I dislike him as much as Monkey does.  Since Pocket died, we have not had a flea problem, which is a blessing.  Not Pocket dying because we miss her, even though we no longer have to block access to the pantry with a 5 gallon pail of expired mayonnaise (A national brand, no less, but I won't mention the name as it is known, either East or West of the Rockies) but the part about not having the fleas.  But for some reason, we have had an abundance of black house flies.  I always tell Monkey "look, you let your big black buddies in again," and "Stop letting your big black buddies in."  She is not persuaded by this and only rarely seems to patrol the window sills for dying flies like the dog we had when I was little did.  (Dog's name, Princess Leia.)  I bought some kind of insecticide at Big Lots, two kinds, and though one or both actually harness the power to kill houseflies, neither is the light aerosol type that is effective for spraying on flies.  One left a wet mess all over my office, and the other was a white powder which only served to crud up the carpet and attract undesirable teenagers to my apartment.  I recalled that one of my school teachers hanging a jar with a piece of steak in it to catch flies in the goat pens.  Armed with this information, I acquired the Victor M380 Fly Magnet 1-Quart Reusable Trap With Bait.  I was pleased that I did not have to supply my own steak, as I am vegetarian, and would have to have borrowed some from the neighbor.  It is difficult to imagine how I would explain what the piece of steak was for and I am really not certain at all if any of my neighbors would want me to return it when i was done using it.  I mean, I get along with my neighbors really well, including the ones who rent a large Dora The Explorer bouncey house for every imaginable event, and they are rather nice about letting us get in there even after we have had a heavy lunch and it's ill-advised.  (Veggie corn-dogs with relish and lots of cole slaw and grape soda just do not look good painted all over the inside of a bouncey house.  Not even the Spongebob one.)  I carefully read the instructions, and added the recommended amount of water, more or less, with the enclosed packet of fly attractant.  The fly attractant looks a bit like what comes out of a packet of guacamole mix or taco seasoning, but I suspect is freeze dried meat and dog poo, or poo of some sort, perhaps horse or pig.  I hung the jar prominently in the middle of the front garden from the decorative plant hanger that I bought at big lots several years ago, which despite being some sort of sturdy metal when I bought it, has become flimsy with age and bends easily, but not weighed down too much by the fly trap jar.  I thought no more about the trap until my mate mentioned it.  The other morning when I came home from work just after sunrise I stood very close to the trap and looked at the mass of struggling near dead flies bogging themselves down in the mire of poo water now filled with dead comrades.  I stared at it for quite some time, set aglow by the distinct rays of the rising sun.  I stared at it until I was rather tired.  I stared at it until I realized that there is a rather unpleasant looking fungus spreading in the garden, up the bases of the sago palms.  I kicked the fungi around.  I went to bed.  I have considered the humiliation and disgust that someone wold feel if I were to pour the contents of the jar on someone.  I am certain the manufacturers would strongly advise against this.  I am not recommending you do that.  I am recommending the Victor M380 Fly Magnet 1-Quart Reusable Trap With Bait.  It has really cleared up the fly problem in just a matter of a week.  I haven't noticed any odor, but it is in a well ventilated area, and my sense of smell is rather poor owing to a genetic predisposition to sinus allergies.  I have been tested.  I am not allergic to cats.

review/text: I live in Panama and for three or four months each year we have fly season. I mean flies like you have never seen in your life. I hung several of these traps outside my house and in just a couple of weeks I had at least 4 or 5 inches of dead flies in each one. I don't know how many that is but it probably a thousand in each trap. I got a lot more than most as we have Toucans and parrots in cages outside and they attract a lot of flies. Be sure to keep them at least 30 feet or so from your house so that the flies stay away from your house. Plus the traps have a highly unpleasant odor for people but the flies love them.

Instructions say it takes a few hours for attractant to activate so you don't have to worry about smelling up the house.  Comes with everything you need.<br />We hung ours about 25 ft. from porch and as stated was full in a week.<br />You actually probably could reuse this trap if your not too squemish about dumping dead and dying flies and cleaning the cup all you'd need then is more attractant.  We just took down the trap and tied a plactic grocery bag around it and tossed the whole thing. At 5.99 not that bad of a loss but we'll probably move up to a larger size seeing it worked so well so quickly.

review/summary: Watch out for the smell!
review/text: This product works exceptionally well-you will catch more flies than you ever thought you even had. HOWEVER-beware the smell! It will start to REALLY stink-like feces-when it is only half full and from feet away. DO NOT just toss it into regular trash or containers that are porous like plastic garbage cans because it is very hard to get the smell out. Bag it-double bag it! in plastic to get rid of it before adding to trash. So you only want new ones anywhere near where you sit-or eat-like a patio.<br /><br />I would not stop using them due to this though because as noted-they really work. But is why we changed from re-usable ones to disposable ones.

review/summary: This fly trap works
review/text: Unlike similar products of several other brands, this fly trap is one that really works.  I hung the unit from a hook in my garage ceiling two days ago, and there are already two inches of dead flies on top of the water.  The bait is somewhat smelly - vaguely like liquified barnyard manure - so it's best used outside of living areas.

review/summary: chamber of doom
review/text: The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but I can only smell it if I'm right nearby (within a few feet).<br /><br />I just uploaded some photos. Be warned: they're pretty gross. But they show how effective the M502 is as a chamber of doom. I shot them after maybe a month and a half of use, just before I threw it away.<br /><br />Pro tip: the water can evaporate, so splash a little water in the top after a week or two, and then spin the trap a few times to mix it in. Really kicks the aroma back into high gear and gets another couple weeks of life -- I mean death -- out of it.

review/summary: NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS
review/text: I live near the woods and have a very large back yard that my dogs and kids love to use, so it's no surprise that we can get a lot of flies. I wanted to test out three different fly traps to see which would work best for me. I tried this trap, the 20,000 rescue fly trap bag, and a larger bag. This one came in second place in my mind, which is why I rated it with three stars. First, the amount of flys caught was not bad, but it wasn't very good when comparing it to the 20,000 rescue fly trap. Second, I saw that some flys were able to get out (which was not the case with the previously mentioned product). Is this a good trap? Yes, it will catch flys. However, it's not the best from what I saw. It's recommended if you can't get the 20,000 rescue fly trap bag.

We compost - everything - and when you include meat/fish scraps in your compost you get a ton of flies. I've tried everything: salt, baking powder, lime/vinegar solutions and nothing really worked. I put out this trap and within a day the trap was a quarter full. I highly recommend! Only one word of advise - don't open the powder packet in your house, it stinks!!! Do it outside and you'll be all good.

review/summary: Amazing - smells w/in 3' radius & downwind, but soooo effective
review/text: I bought two types of traps, this (Victor) and the "Rescue FTA-SF4 Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant" with the green screwtop. The Victor one filled up with flies in just 3 days while the green lidded one had &lt;10 flies in it. The baits smell differently....so, I've order the Victor bait to put into the green trap to see if that works any better.<br /><br />I've been re-using the traps and bait water by sieving out the flies, pouring the liquid back into the trap, and adding more water. Four re-uses later, it's still going strong.<br /><br />Note - this trap traps those big flies that look for stinky stuff - not the smaller flies that just fly in circles!

review/summary: Too small? Not smelly enough?
review/text: I purchased this for my patio a month ago. We filled it up like instructed and can see it slowly filling up with files but we're still being swarmed around mealtime. I just can't figure out when you would need a fly trap this small. For me, although we live in downtown Austin, TX, flies can make our outdoor living experience miserable. I thought because it was a small space we'd need a small trap. But now that it's up it seems too small for the job. And for the smell I would think you'd have to have a decent problem to make it worth getting one of these guys. I'm going to get a bigger one next time. Hopefully that will do the job!

review/summary: Fly Trap Magic
review/text: We bought one of these in August & it worked so well that we just bought 2 more. We have 3 Dachshunds & a small back yard in the "burbs". We tend to get a lot of flies in the summer that ultimately make it into our house. We put the fly trap in a tree & filled it with water. The next day we checked & it had not only flies but a few wasps in it! None of the other products we tried worked this well. It will be cold enough soon in Colorado so we won't have to worry until next spring but we will be prepared. I would highly recommend this product. Just don't put it next to where you would be able to smell it. That's what attracts the flies, the smell. The flies go in and they don't come out. We stored the 2 we just bought and will have them on hand for next Spring. This is a product we don't want to be without.

Be careful not spill it, or as unfortunately happened to me, let your dog get into it.  Not the worst smell know to mankind, but not something you'd want to voluntarily put up with either.

Buy same brand, but not disposable type (Even this one you have to throw away after it is filled with flies because bait pack is not so cheap and it is nasty to empty it out - you would see thousand of flies and may be maggots)  However, the other unit by the same company works really well.

review/text: I LOVE THIS THING! I moved by the lake recently and have been having a problem with all kinds of bugs, but the flies piss me off the most with their diseases. I followed the simple directions and left this outside on my patio. After 1 day the entire top was almost filled with about 1 fly deep! So I'm guessing about 30-50 flies on day one.<br /><br />It's been about 4 days now and there are hundreds of flies in there! the new ones push the old ones down and the top layer is about 6-7 flies deep!!! There is also a layer of flies that floated all the way down to the bottom of the cup. This thing WORKS I'm about to order a 2nd one just for double the fly killing power!<br /><br />Just note it does smell like crap, but good thing this is an outdoors trap!<br /><br />TIP:<br />I bought this and the clear glue patches. Placed this trap on a big white cardboard poster. Then placed the glue traps around the cup, it's not pretty to look at, but adds to the fly stopping power.

Only trouble is that I've never had that many flies in my yard. It seems that the odor (like in stench)attracts flies from far and wide. Admittedly I live downtown, surrounded by rowhouses but as I said, this works too well. In fact, we had a garden party last evening and I had to keep all the food covered. Maybe if I put out a hundred fly traps I'll eventually trap every fly in Baltimore. Other than that, it's back to the good old spray.

The price is such that I'll just buy new ones.  ;)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RBDZ">Victor M502 Disposable Fly Trap</a>

review/summary: Cheap plastic and difficult lid
review/text: This is meant to be reusable but after staying outside last summer the plastic just became flimsy. What this means is I couldn't get the lid on it at all this year, it buckled and bent and ended up with a couple holes from the bending. Of course getting the lid on was a nasty struggle before once it's filled, the bait filled water will splash and I don't particularly like the idea of bacteria spores hatching on my hands. If the lid screwed on all this could be averted. It didn't come with a rain guard either.<br /><br />The bait itself works like a charm, can't complain about that. I think I might make my own container and just buy bait.

review/summary: Works... but it blew away!
review/text: This works.  I will order it again.  But I will anchor it better so it doesn't blow away.  I lost it in a wind storm.  It smells pretty bad, but it also works in the house.  I brought it indoors and set it in the bathtub when the flies were particularly obnoxious inside.  Opened the (screened) window in the bathroom, and they flocked to it in there.  I set it back outside after a while, when I could begin to smell it.  I wouldn't keep it in the house with windows closed, however.  Phew!!!

review/summary: Best fly trap ever
review/text: I was using another fly trap-the one with the bag.  Tried this one because fit was half the price.  It's more than twice as good.  The results were unbelievable.  It doesn't smell either.

review/summary: A very poor fly trap
review/text: It was clumsy to  use, very smelly and did not work well. I ended up throwing it  away as it was no longer catching any flies after only a few weeks. It was promised to last for three months but it quit catching flies after only two or three weeks.<br /><br />The older Victor fly traps worked much better but are now unobtainable. They had a black screw on cap with a bright yellow dome shaped cover and a little black fly that perched on top and held it together. For the bottom they used a quart mason jar which was easy to fill. They were also easier to empty and start over when they did begin to smell. I wish that someone would manufacture them again.

review/summary: Perfect For Its Size... But Bigger Might Be Better
review/text: I put this trap up with about 1/4 of the food they tell you on the instructions to put it. The flies and hornets have been all over it for 2 weeks and I haven't even changed the food and water yet! All I see are black nasty dead flies and bees in the bottom of the cup. Only thing is the cup is a little small. Luckily, I also bought a larger fly trap: Flies Be Gone Fly Trap Kills Up To 20000 Flies Per Bag for $15 and I do like this alternate larger one better. They give you WAAAY more food and I only used 1/10th of the required food, so I have tons left over. I like the bigger bag because it fits more flies in and seems to attract slightly more. :D But either one are good. The small one looks better, the big one fits more flies and bees.

review/summary: great trap
review/text: I have two dogs in my back yard and I can never seam to keep the flies off of them. This year was really bad, before I got this trap they had 3 types of fly repellent on them and they still were getting over ran by flies. I got this trap because the only bad review was about the small and I was willing to try anything that was only around $6. I have to say that I love this trap when I first mixed the trap the water was green and for the first day and only got 1 or 2 flies, but after that the water turned yellow and then the flood gates opened. By the end of day 2 there were at least 100 and within about 3 maybe 4 days there were so many flies that they went able to get to the poison but still were stuck in the cup. After that the fly around my house were gone for about a week but are starting to come back. I will be getting many more of the Victor fly traps for the rest of this year and all of next.

review/summary: Great Fly Trap
review/text: I installed this trap in my backyard and it is working great. It was installed on Friday and within 4 days, it's trapped probably 100 flies and is still working away. It takes a few hours to activate but starts working almost immediately. If you have a fly problem, try this and you'll be happy.

review/summary: It worked, but very slowly
review/text: It didn't catch any fly in the first 3 days, only after I took the top off it started to catch a few. Less than 2 a day, which is really not that good, I kill 3 a day with my fly paddle. Now after a week I see about 10 or so died fly, but I can't say that it doesn't work, but its just slow, and the fly just stay on top of the cup, they just don't fall in.

review/summary: Didn't work for us!!
review/text: We opened it and set it up and put in on the counter while we were gone for the weekend.  When I came back there were no flies inside it.  I had to use a fly swatter to kill a few flies before book club ladies came over.  I then put the fly trap in the garage on a shelf.  I forgot about it.  For days afterward I smelled a dead sort of smell and thought a small animal died somewhere in my garage.  I looked for days.  Then I realized what the smell was and felt pretty stupid.  The thing stinks!!  You don't want it in your house or around kids.

review/summary: Didn't work.  Poor Design.
review/text: My fly trap did not come with the white cover as pictured, so when hung outside it collects and fills with rain water.  However, before or after being filled with excess rain water, it failed to catch any flies.
