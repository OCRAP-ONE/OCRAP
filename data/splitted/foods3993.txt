review/summary: The spiciest chips EVER!!!!
review/text: I love eating spicy foods and so I was looking for chips that were really spicy because you can't find it anywhere besides dipping chips in salsa. I have tried all kinds of spicy chips, but this tops it by far. Usually it takes a while of eating the chips to feel that burn on your tongue, but after eating one chip of the Blair's habanero, you instantly get that kick of hotness on your tongue. The chips are nice and crunchy like the kettle cooked chips. I recommend this to any lover of spicy foods. I have already bought this twice on amazon and I will soon have to buy another box because it's just that good.

review/text: I got a taste of these in a 2 oz bag and was told they weren't being made anymore. Imagine my surprise when I found them here!  I purchased the 5 oz bags and shared them with co-workers.<br /><br />From the first bite you get a nice smokey flavor and then the heat starts to kick in. After a few more chips you just can't stop crunching while beads of sweat pop out on your brow and your sinuses start clearning out.<br /><br />Love these chips!

review/summary: Hottest on earth
review/text: I am a hot food junkie and found these chips at a local grocery store.  I got addicted and kept searching for them again and again, but they must have been on a trial run, never to return.  Amazon fortunately had them, but in palette sized orders rather than a couple bags.  Oh well.  This is simply the most nuclear, face napalm, gastro grenading potato chip I have ever had.  If you're a sadistic snack aficionado like me, try these.  A half bag into it, you will be paying the price.

review/summary: Fire Burning
review/text: *Warning* These chips are like eating a raw habanero pepper.<br /><br />This is literally the hottest processed food product I've ever eaten. I use to think what I normally ate was pretty hot, until I tried these. They taste pretty good, but good luck trying to eat a whole bag in one sitting. I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.<br /><br />I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends. Only takes one chip to set your mouth on fire. =D

review/summary: Outright dangerous
review/text: I love spicy snacks and was looking for something a bit spicier than Flamin Hot Cheetos.  I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth, were spicy, but more flavor than I expected.  So I ate a couple more.  Then the heat intensity starts to kick in. Unlike other habanero foods, this one had a bit of a creeper affect rather than hitting you like a freight train from the beginning.  Then my mouth started to burn and the tears started rolling.  God, how I love that feeling.  Sadistic, I know. They really do make you feel alive.  I keep several bags at work so I can have something to get over the afternoon hump around 3 pm.  They do the job well as I get a level of alertness that caffeine just can't deliver.  It also makes me appear like a more sensitive guy since I am crying the whole time.  Eating these chips has also produced a nice side effect for me - I am unbelievably hydrated throughout the day.  My skin has never looked better.  The only warning I would give when eating these chips is that the pepper powder they use is extremely light. So when you pop them in your mouth, you will inevitably get some up your nose via your nasopharynx.  It will make you sniffle like a coke addict from the 80s. A bit annoying but great for clearing up sinuses. Oh yeah, my best advice is that you should really wash your hands thoroughly before using the bathroom - like 2-3 times.  Otherwise a fate that I wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy will await you. Let's just say I am prone to learning life lessons the hard way. i won't go into details but it involved milk and was something like a scene out of American Pie.

review/text: Bought these wondering how hot they'll be.. The habanero flavor is hands down the hottest potato chip I've eaten. I'm one who lives for the spice so ive grown madly in love with them.  Definitely would recommend if you like the spice. For those who thinks products like Tabasco or tapatio or siracha is hot, this product is not for you. Very nice blend of heat as its actually a bit sweet if you get through the bag.

review/text: Fell in love with these chips years ago when I got outta a vending machine at a previous employer.  They are hotter then any chip I've tried but tastey as all heck.  I research and found out u can only GE these via internet not in any store,  which is a bummer but extreme food website and Amazon always have great special.  So I recommended purchaseing a lot so you don't run out.<br />These are a great conversation piece at parties everybody always says same 2 things<br />1.  OMG THESE ARE SO HOT.<br />2.  I can't stop eating because these are so good.<br />Definitely have milk around to help the heat factor.  I now have my boyfriend hooked and a fan.  This last purchase I orders him the 14/5oz bag set.  He is in 7th heaven.  Definitely will last a while cause u can only eat so many cause of the heat but so tastey u wanna keep going back for more.<br />Remember have milk on hand LOL enjoy.

review/summary: WOW...
review/text: I rarely do product reviews on Amazon BUT after having the 1st bag I knew I had to say something!<br /><br />These chips are not for the faint. They have a wonderful kettle cooked crunch to them and the bag size is the perfect munching snack to watching a movie.  These are not only going to make a good snack for me (as I really like spicy foods) but will also make the perfect laugh when I let friends try them...<br /><br />These chips have a wonderful flavor and not too much spice (if any at all) when you first chomp into a them, but wait for it, after 5-10 second the burn starts to come usually about the time you reach for your second or third and by then it is too late.<br /><br />The burn lasts for a solid 10-15 minutes after eating a few handfuls and personally made me sweat a good deal as I finished off my first bag while watching a movie.<br /><br />These I would easily buy again and recommend them to ANYONE who wants a good laugh at someone else's expense OR of you really like painfully spicy hot sauce. Although they were a good deal spicier than I expected. If you know Blair's they are know for the very hottest of hot sauces and NOW I think they can also brag they have the hotest snacks!

review/text: As a long time fan of Blair's death products, I am familiar with Blair's other spicy items like his sauces. However I had never tried any of his chips.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />These are the tastiest, crunchiest, and easily the spiciest chips known to man. Everything you love in a chip all rolled in to one.<br /><br />Do not be deceived by the fact that it says chipotle on the bag. This is some concentrated stuff here. Personally I can only eat 2-3 chips per serving. It's that hot.

review/text: I have not been a fan of kettle style chips in the past, but for these I'll make an exception.  2-3 chips in and you've got a burn going on.  I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short.  For those not "appreciative" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste.  Not for me!  Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment.  Good heat, great with beer.

I agree, I bought them since he knows that the now extinct Habanero Dorito chips were the best ever, finally found a chip that I could not eat the whole bag at one sitting.  My sons are happily eating Blairs Death Rain Habaneros and feeding them to unsuspecting people and animals to watch their reaction.  The chips are crunchy, not greasy, and HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT as claimed,  these chips are not for patsies.

review/text: I first ordered the Chipotle flavor.  I didn't enjoy the flavor very much, but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect.  There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some brands are.  It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor.

You can adjust what you add for different outcomes.  The cappuccino flavor is subtle.  Cinnamon is a wonderful addition as well.  The mix is fat free and relatively low cal (about 100 cals per brownie) so you can indulge and add chocolate chips! : )

review/text: Fat free is really a deceiving thing. Since fat alone doesnt make a person fat oddly enough. Fat is actually good for you. Fat free diets or low fat diets don't help an individual lose weight.. Unless its resulting in a lower calorie intake which often it doesnt. Enough about that. Read Dr. mercola's website regarding that.  4 stars because this stuff tastes fantastic, the yogurt with this brownie mix makes a super moist brownie that tastes amazing. No really low fat since there is sugar and sugar converts to fat later. Humans were not designed to consume sugar, same for white flour. But its so good, right?  Still yummy stuff.

review/summary: Cheez-It Baked Whole Grain Crakers
review/text: I love these and I think they are one of the better flavors. I find several of the flavors leave me with a slightly acidic aftertaste. Not so here. Do not get confused by the BIG PRINT on the front of the box about 5 Grams of whole grain per serving. That only means it is contains 5 Grams of flour (whole wheat). Most people think it contains 5 Grams of FIBER but it does not. Only 1 Gram of fiber per serving. Now if they only could lower the fat content by 10 percent and double the fiber this would be much healthier as a snack. I won't hold my breath but will still enjoy these and have them on auto-delivery. Peace!

review/text: The amount of whole grain these Cheez-its contain is a joke. 5g whole grain is less than 1/3 of a serving of whole grains, PLUS there's more oil in these things than whole grain.  I think it's because Cheez-its wouldn't taste good anymore if they were mostly whole grain, that's why enriched flour remains the first ingredient.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is more healthy for you, it's still junk food, but with just a very tiny amount of whole grain added...

review/summary: Excellent product - price/shipping charge not so much
review/text: These whole grain Cheez-its taste a lot like the original flavor, except they have a little bit of a sharper cheese taste, which I like much better. I bought these when they had the 'subscribe & save' option thinking I would be able to have them around at a price just a few cents per box lower than purchasing them at the grocery store. I received the first shipment as ordered, but they were listed as out of stock then it came time for my second shipment to arrive. My shipment was canceled and rescheduled for next month supposedly for being out of stock, so I came here to look for a replacement and I see that the same product/quantity is actually in stock at the same price, but with an additional $8.92 shipping charge. It's understandable if they can't keep the previous deal going, but it would be better to be honest about it instead of not honoring it and stringing me along letting me think I might actually get some some day when there appears to have been no intention to ever deliver. I canceled my sham of a subscription, and I won't be buying these here again, at least not at that price + shipping.

I guess I never got over it and to this day have to have a Chuckles fix periodically.<br /><br />The sugar coating keeps them from being sticky. The artificial flavors are seductive.

The thing that makes them so good is excellent flavor: they actually taste like lemon, cherry, lime, etc. I am not a licorice fan, but the black licorice flavored ones are very good.<br /><br />They are pretty much pure sugar, so moderation is required. I sometimes take a pack on long bike rides and they make a great energy boost.

My wife has Celic and can't eat things with Gluten, and I prefer to eat low in Carbs aka Atkins.  This dressung works for all of us in the home.  It is very low in Carbs, and it's Gluten free.  It has 1 Carb per serving so you can use it even in the induction phase of Atkins.<br /><br />As you would expect for a bulky and heavy food item, if you can find this locally you will probably save.  Our big box grocery stores and even our local brand stores all carry this.  Check it out; if you like Ceasars, you'll like this version.<br /><br />5 stars for a great Creamy Caesar dressing

review/text: Product was exactly as advertised.  It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.<br />The taste is spot on.  I put a few drops of the pure maple extract, along with a couple of drops of pure vanilla extract in my oatmeal (with 1/4 chopped walnuts) every morning.  It's a great way to start the day. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QQA4KK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title

review/text: We go through a lot of syrup in our house and I was concerned about the corn syrup.  When I searched the local stores for maple extract, all I could find was imitation.  We are now on our second bottle of Cook's and it works perfectly for what I wanted.  The only complaint I have is the price and shipping are a bit expensive.  Other than that, the product is great.

review/summary: Razzles Sorta Dazzle
review/text: These pale in comparison to the ones of the early 80's. Flavors please with the exception of the lemon, which has a chemical note. And I swear that they are smaller in circumference. Does turn from candy into a gum, just as in the past. Something is missing; I just can't put my finger on it. Yes, I still have my teeth and taste buds. Can be found at dollar stores. Bring back my candy heyday- go back to the original recipe/specs, guys! I want my childhood back for three minutes.

review/text: For those new to Razzles, they start out like a crumbly/firm candy, and become gum in your mouth. They are very sweet (along the lines of bubble gum) but in various flavors. I remember these from when I was a kid- so like them because of that.  :)

review/summary: Very Effective
review/text: This was my first time trying this type of product and i must say that it is very effective. I didn't have jitters and didn't have any problem sleeping at night. It REALLY does suppress my appetite. I make sure that I eat but it's a lot easier to eat less. The only thing that I don't like is that it makes my mouth really dry. I'm drinking at least 64 ounces of water a day. That's a good thing but I have to get up in the middle of the night for water also. I'm thinking of only drinking a half of a pack each day. I'm excited to see what my weightloss will be after 2 weeks.

review/text: We have used arrowroot flour successfully in our gluten-free cooking/baking before but this brand has a very strong odor to it - like a mixture of chili powder and spices.  Normal arrowroot flour/starch has no odor to it.  The smell affects the flavor and my daughter, who has always been fine with arrowroot flour/starch, had an allergic reaction to this brand.  I can't use this product.  It smells so bad I can't even use it to make gluten-free play clay for my younger son.

I smartened up right after that and checked out Amazon...Hooray!  Great product, awesome price and best of all, it is fresh and works perfectly in my recipes!

review/text: I found Heinz baked beans on Amazon by chance a year or so ago and since then, my British-born husband and I have been thrilled to see all the latest offerings that have turned up from over the pond.  My husband has been here for 15 years now and really misses his Branston Pickle, HP Sauce, Ambrosia custard, so it's absolutely marvelous to be able to buy these things at a reasonable cost from Amazon -- and certainly saves money versus searching the small imported foods stores around.  Item was very well-packed, arrived quickly, and was the original.  The six packs will last us for awhile and are a quick and easy alternative to full blown gravy.  My husband loves this stuff!

review/summary: The Axe Effect in Action - This is the PERFECT Deodorant for Me
review/text: Two swipes under each pit and a strait line down the center of the inside of my shirt is my version of "double pits to chesty". It's my fail-safe secret to smelling amazing. I can't tell you how many times I have been cuddled up with a girl or in the middle of a simple "hello" hug with a female friend only to find her head buried in my chest sniffing me like a dog in heat. The most frequent compliment I receive is, "You smell so good!" and the most common question I'm asked is, "What cologne are you wearing?" Both of which are usually prefaced with an exclamatory remark like, "Oh my god!"<br /><br />The reason this stuff works so well for me (and you'll have to take the following into consideration, as I'm sure this product won't be right for everyone) is because I don't sweat much and I usually shower twice a day. As a result of my hygienic habits, I don't produce a lot of body odor, if any noticeable amount at all. I love Phoenix because it is not overpowering when applied as directed above, and it is only detected at close proximity (which prompts the ladies to want to move in even closer for a better whiff). I can't claim that this will reduce perspiration nor mask body odor if you are a human rain machine with a stink that can make a skunk wince, but I can state that unlike the Axe Dry version, this product does not contain harmful chemicals like aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycene, a known neurotoxin found in most antiperspirants. All of the ingredients in this "Fresh" version of Phoenix are safe (this coming from a chemist and wellness buff), so I have no health-related qualms with slathering this on daily. I also think its somewhat sweeter scent is far superior to Axe Dry.<br /><br />What it comes down to is this - the Axe effect is no joke, nor is it something that only 15-year-old boys are sporting. I'm not only turning 30 this year, but the heads of every woman in Los Angeles who gets close enough to me to pick up on my secret signature scent. I've probably spent thousands over the years on high-end colognes, only to get mixed reviews and allergic reactions. However, $4 and a quick trip to any local supermarket results in unanimous praise and a lot of face-to-chest loving.<br /><br />If you're a guy with good hygiene who doesn't sweat much, Axe Fresh Phoenix will be your perfect partner in crime.
