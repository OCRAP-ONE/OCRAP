review/summary: Very Impressed
review/text: After a lot of research, i decided to switch my 3-yr old Doberman from Iams to Canidae and have been very impressed with the product. Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less "filler", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a "super-premium" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan. When you look at it like that, I believe it's one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today.

My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula.  Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull.  Change it back Canidae!!!

review/summary: Not recommended after they changed their formula
review/text: I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good).

review/summary: Excellent, AMERICAN MADE, nothing imported
review/text: I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called "made here." I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy breath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I'd recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.<br />It used to be when I opened a bag of food I'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I'm not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.<br />This product is on my wish list at Amazon. Anyone who wants to get me a good gift, get me a bag. It is definately a gift I'll use!

review/summary: The best product for the price
review/text: After reading the book "Deadly Feasts" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!

review/summary: Canidae is the best!
review/text: Just bought a bag of Canidae with the new formula.  I had some of the old Canidae formula and am mixing in with some of the new formula.  The new formula has more meat in it and my puppy loves the new formula!  He jumped on it!  It's unfortunate that Canidae didn't announce that they were going to change the formula because it's making a lot of dogs sick due to the sudden change in food.

review/summary: New formula
review/text: My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.<br />*********<br /><br />I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.  And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?!

review/summary: Something's Changed with Canidae food
review/text: I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats.

review/summary: Why mess with success?
review/text: My 20-month-old Toy Fox Terrier mix has been eating Canidae since I adopted her and changed her over from Science Diet, so I don't have an amazing transformation story.<br /><br />However,<br />1. She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like.

review/summary: The best food and can save money!
review/text: I have 2 jack russells and a Papillon.  As many people know Jacks are an extemely active breed and keeping weight on them can be a problem.  We were feeding Flint River, a very high quality food,  both of my jacks were getting 2 cups a day just to maintain a slightly below average weight. My papillon was at the proper weight but still getting 1.5 cups of flint river a day.  We decided to switch foods and after much debate we chose canidae.  During the time it took to slowly switch foods(14 days) my jacks had already gained weight and were looking much better.  After 3 weeks we had to reduce their food becuase they were getting fat!  now my jacks eat 1/2 a cup twice daily and they have never looked better.  My papillon eats 1/4 cup AM and 1/2 cup PM.  Just the reduction in food alone has saved so much money.  Because we are feeding less there is less poop to clean up.  I really cannot say enough about this food its has made my dogs more balanced mentally and physically.

review/summary: Long Time Loyal Customer NO Longer!
review/text: I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a "hot spot" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an "allergic reaction."  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems.

review/text: We are told to improve our diet. The same is true for our pets. You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name brand foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing. Canidae is not cheap either, but it is because of the quality ingredients. My sons Collie gets it since a few month, and now the fur is much shinier, the dog does not smell and it loves the food.

review/summary: I actually heard about the formula change and properly transitioned my dog without issue
review/text: I have been using this food for 4 years since I read raving reviews on many sites. I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.<br /><br />On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula.

review/summary: Excellent. Product HAS NOT changed.
review/text: I have been a Canidae (PAWS) customer since Feb 07 (7 lg dogs). I previously fed them Purina One, switched to Blue Buffalo in Dec 06, then Canidae in Feb 07 (food scare for Blue Buffalo). I am very particular about what I give my dogs: dog of 10yrs died/cancer and had 2 knee replacements due to arthritis/joint issues. My Dogs are doing great on Canidae. I just spoke w/ Canidae less than 2 mins ago and they HAVE NOT changed their product at all. I read the review from the person that once gave this product a great review and now thinks the product has changed due to her dogs' digestive issues (or something like that).  I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire. I drive 2 hrs to re-stock on Canidae. Highly recommend.

review/summary: My Black Labrador throws up the new formula of Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food
review/text: My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket."<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car."<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The "Canidae Team" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?

review/summary: Outstanding super premium dog food!  The best in my opinion!  I couldn't be happier!
review/text: I have been researching dog food for a few years now.  I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.  I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.  It is just not right to feed our pets the crap that they sell in the stores.  I used to think that Eukanuba was a great dog food.  Thank God for the Internet!<br /><br />Buy this food, you will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Excellent food for all dogs
review/text: I have used Canidae products exclusively for my dogs for many years, with great results. They have healthy shiny coats, and are active and beautiful. However, my Sheltie-Chow mix had recurring ear problems all her life. The vet couldn't identify the problem--her ears weren't infected--but they always looked red and irritated. We tried everything, but nothing really helped. One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain-free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy. To test the theory, one day I fed her a piece of bread (wheat) and the next day she was tugging at her ears. Back to the grain free Canidae! The dogs love it, and the Sheltie mix just passed her 15th birthday and is going strong.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Food made my dogs extremely ill
review/text: I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on.

However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way, what WAS wrong with the old formula????

review/summary: Hot spots galore while on Canidae
review/text: I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing.

review/summary: I will never use anythign else for my pets . . .
review/text: This food is amazing.  When I got my dog she was being fed Canidae.  I saw how clean her coat was and how healthy she looked.  So I went and got the cat version.  My big cat has lost weight and looks the best he has in years.  My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight, but not getting plump.  It is not like other cat foods that are like McDonalds for pets.  No sudden highs and lows after eating.  I thought pet food was just pet food, but I will never change this food for my pets. It is so amazing!!!  Give it a few weeks and you will see the same.

review/summary: Excellent quality food at an excellent price.
review/text: Canidae is an excellent food that is meat based and is great for people who are looking for a top quality dog food, but don't want to break the bank. I know a lot of people who can not afford dog food that is extremely expensive, and yet they don't want to feed cheap fillers or grain based foods. If you are a person on a tight budget Canidae is worth a try. You will notice a big difference in energy as well as skin and coat. A lot of senior dogs switch to the ALS formula and have more zoomies and more energy than on other lower quality diets. Canidae is worth every penny.

review/text: I found this dog food after doing research to help my dogs allergies (2 goldens).<br /><br />My dog had terrible allergies,  she has been on Canidae all life stages for about 5 weeks now.<br /><br />No more itching, scratching, ear infections and vomiting. Their fur is silky & they are so happy & healthy.<br /><br />Use the food cost calculator. your dog eats less of this than many of the garbage filled brands. They also offer coupons on their web site. It really isn't that expensive.<br /><br />If you have cats we have switched ours to the felidae and can also highly recommend it.

review/summary: Made My Dog Sick!!
review/text: I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just "something she picked up," but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!

I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.

review/summary: Best dog food!
review/text: This is by far the best dog food I've given my dog! I was having problems with my dog eating for almost a year before we started this dog food. She just wouldn't want to eat. We feed her twice a day, splitting up the daily amount. She just wasn't interested and would eat just a little bit once a day. When we switched her to this food, she has eaten her dog food (the whole amount) every day. I also read on a dog food rating website what the best dog foods were and Canidae was one of the top dog foods on the market! This makes me feel good about giving my dog something she loves and it's also very healthy. Let's just say, she has more energy than all of her doggie friends. She can play longer and harder than any of them and I know it's because I give her a quality dog food.

It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for! When Amazon upped the price $10 a bag we switched to Diamond Naturals, but not only did their coats begin to lose their sheen, but that awful smelling gas came back as well!! We are putting them back on Canidae. It's worth it!!

review/summary: I have a brand new dog!!
review/text: Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT. I AM STILL THRILLED WITH THE FOOD AND WITH AMAZON'S PRICE AND THE FREE SHIPPING!

review/text: Ok i have been through several dog food brands (all high end holistic fancy stuff)and have been through some ruff (lol) times finding just what works perfect for my  female Rhodesian Ridgeback. Now i wont bash any brands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog, be a good owner and look for things they like and react well to :-)..... now that being said i had a neurotic on edge dog with huge shedding issues and RR's don't shed. This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better.

review/summary: Canidae and Felidae
review/text: Pretty scary reading some of these reviews. I learned about the switch to new formulas from Canidae quite a while back but stuck with it. I have a German Shepard and a cat and both went through the switch just fine. What baffles me is how there can be so many great experiences listed here and then see those bad ones. I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway, my kids are very active for their age and doing great on Canidae and Felidae. It seems to be the best combination of high-quality ingredients and reasonable price out there. I'm a big fan and receommend both to anyone. In fact, my cat loves the new formula even more than the old. She's getting a little fat.  :-)

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.<br /><br />I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff.

review/summary: Feeding it in my boarding kennel....excellent investment
review/text: Although I do not buy Canidae through Amazon, I wanted to rave about it's quality.  I am a dealer and own and operate a pet boarding facility.  I switch dogs everyday to Canidae without mixing diets due to the nature of the business and it saves me tons in labor.  The dogs not only gobble it up - they do not get upset tummies.  I have been feeding my pack of competitive working dogs (Border Collies and Australian Shepherds) for 6 years and about 30 boarding dogs per day and I have not found anything even close to the quality and value of Canidae.  Many kennels try to cut corners on feed but I believe paying a little more for Canidae has made money.  The dogs feel great, the kennels stay clean, and the owners have peace of mind. (Less poop to scoop is a big deal around here) I am a strong supporter of any feed company that puts together an all natural - excellent ingredient product and have tried many, but I'm completely sold on Canidae.

review/summary: The best for the money........
review/text: I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side.

review/text: I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts.

review/summary: Food is Great, Delivery was BAD!
review/text: I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online.  The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall.  The only issues I have had are with the delivery.  One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.  Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly.

review/text: I am a first time dog owner and wanted to ensure that my 2 Presa Canarios were fed a good dog food.  From my research Canidae dog food was one of the best listed.  In addition the "Grain Free" caught my eye, since I was contemplating going to a raw diet.  From my research the Canidae "Grain Free" formula is as close as you can get to "natural" diet without committing to raw food.  Great product and my dogs love it.. Now I must admit there will be flatulence, and it can be rough at times... (Ha!, Ha!). But the overall health and well fare of the dog is my main concern....

review/summary: Best dog food ever!
review/text: I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.  I hope you found an alternative that you were happy with feeding.

Our dogs coats are very shiny with no allergy issues and our 13 yr. old lab has had issues since she was a couple of years old but with Canidae she has had no issues and she has been on it for over a year now.She had issues with TSC's new brand and Chicken Soup.Would have given 5 stars but is kinda expensive but you get what you pay for!

review/summary: canidae excellent!!!!!!!!
review/text: This dog food is the best!! Excellent price. Free shipping, and above all high grade quality ingedients. No fillers, no by products, no wheat, no corn. I have a puppy that started out looking like a beagle puppy, 3.lbs 6 oz when I got him at 8 wks. He turned out to be just barely 4 wks old and is now 45 pounds and growing. I think he is actually a coon hound. He has itchy skin so I wanted to find a product he could eat and my 13 yr old wonder dog (we wonder what he is)could also eat. Canidae is the perfect answer. Since I have been using Canidae my puppy is far less itchy and I still am at the 3 parts Canidae to one part of his other food, which was Pedigree for puppies.  My older dog is less stiff in his joints and his coat is softer too.  I am looking forward to a long time relationship with Canidae. thanks

review/text: I was so ecstatic when I purchased two 44lb bags of canidae dog food.  We have used this food for years and my dogs love it. They have  beautiful coats. On  August 15, 2011 for 41.99 each with free shipping from amazon. The actual shipper was Petcare RX. Since I am feeding 4 large dogs (including a rescue) we go through a lot of food. Its nice to have it delivered to your door. I just signed on to reorder and noticed that amazon increased the price from $41.99 to $55. In theory, there goes free shipping. They rolled it into the new cost of the food. Now, it is no cheaper for me to purchase it on amazon since my neighborhood pet store sells it for $54.00 and I don't have to order it 7-10 days ahead just to make sure I get it before our current supply runs out. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!

review/text: My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before, she was always itching and scratching. Especially at the base of her tail. She used to get so sore at times that she would actually bleed. Her coat and skin now are perfect!!! No more itching, scratching and chewing. All of my dogs are also eating less and maintaining their weight nicely. Less food means less waste in the yard. All in all I couldn't be happier with this food and my dogs will stay on it as long as they continue making it. I also just switched my cat over to their grain free Salmon cat food.

review/summary: Was a little nervous trying it, but my dog does well on it
review/text: I was a bit nervous trying this kibble after reading all the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go since it's one of the only reasonably priced wheat & corn free "premium" kibbles available where I live.<br /><br />The ingredients list looked respectable (first 3 ingredients are human grade meat meals), as did the nutritional information (meets AAFCO profile for All Life Stages).  Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).<br /><br />We're on our 3rd bag now - my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.<br /><br />I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.  But I can honestly say I've had no problems with this kibble at all, & will keep feeding it.

review/summary: Affordable Premium Food
review/text: We adopted a mastiff mix puppy last year, and after some research, I threw away a 90% full bag of Puppy Chow because it's just not good for dogs.  We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.  I'd love to feed them Orijen or Taste of the Wild, but they are very cost prohibitive.  I'm glad this one fits the bill without draining my bank account.

review/summary: Made 1 and 2 dogs sick - make that 1 and half
review/text: Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.

review/summary: WARNING!!!!
review/text: I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html

review/text: I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2-3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.

There has been a lot of negative attention recently with the formula change but I have yet to have any trouble with my 4 on the new formula. They continue to eat it and do well. They had no stool problems, itchiness, vomiting that others have suggested. I am still quite pleased with Canidae and will continue to use it for all of my dogs.

review/summary: Canidae Lost Another Loyal Customer!
review/text: Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???

review/summary: New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good
review/text: This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.

review/summary: Great dog food.
review/text: I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.

review/summary: CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!
review/text: If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the "customer service representative" if you can call her that, simply said "if you don't like it then don't buy it." And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any "stickers" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.

review/summary: Despite Title- this item is NOT Beef and Ocean Fish Formula
review/text: Upon receiving my order for the Canidae Beef and Ocean Fish Formula 30 lbs I found I instead received ANOTHER formula (the original formula with chicken, turkey, etc.).  If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again.

review/summary: serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower
review/text: I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools.  We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.

review/summary: Great Food!!!!
review/text: I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were "healthy", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of "junk" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before. I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26, 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too.

I wanted chocolate or soft centers specifically so there isn't a hard bite to anything on the cupcakes. I ordered several colors only to find they are like sweet tarts inside. They do taste good and they are beautifully made with pretty color and sheen, but overall I am dissapointed because it isn't what I ordered.  If you order these, just be prepared they are NOT chocolate!!!!!

review/text: The tea wasn't light green as it was shown in the picture, but rather a dark green-brown. That might be attributed to the flash of the camera, but I'm not certain.  The tea itself definitely has a bit of a smoky flavor as desired by a gunpowder green tea, and is mostly in a pellet form, so I give it a 4/5 stars. Definitely worth the price.

review/summary: Great quality, petty decent price
review/text: I bought this in lieu of running to the supermarket every time I run out of mandarin oranges--which is often. On Amazon's subscription plan, the cost per can is somewhat better than what I pay in the store. it's even better than the typical price for generic mandarin oranges.<br /><br />The oranges themselves are great. Of course, it's pretty hard to find bad canned mandarin oranges, but the Del Monte oranges are definitely a notch above generic oranges. They seem more succulent. The light syrup is in fact very light and not at all obtrusive. It's not quite as light as packing in fruit juice, but it seems very close in terms of flavor and texture. The calorie count also isn't too bad. Del Monte estimates that each can has 3-4 servings, and each serving has 80 calories. A can has a total of about 270 calories.<br /><br />You can eat these oranges straight of course. But I prefer to mix them with banana slices, pineapple chunks, peach chunks, and fresh grapes (if I can find them). Even if some of these things come out of cans, the resulting fruit salad is still better than the canned kind.

review/text: I had become almost addicted to the garlic and sea salt grinder that the Dollar Tree used to sell. Of course, (as is the case with almost everything they sell that I really like) they quit carrying it, and that led me on a search for a replacement product. The Olde Thompson is very good, and I would purchase it again; however, I wish it had more garlic and less salt in the mixture. It isn't possible to add dried garlic flakes to the grinder because the top is not removable. (At least I couldn't figure out how to get it off.) The vendor's service was outstanding.

review/text: This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well. I don't think I'll purchase this particular product again, and I'll more than likely give the second tea box away to someone else.

To me, it tastes like a black tea; I hardly taste the ginger at all, and it's not as pepperminty as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I realize tastes are just so personal, but that's how I view it anyway.<br /><br />Oh, you should know that it comes in a regular box (as pictured) and not in a tea box at all. So, you will want a cannister, tea tin, or something to put it in.<br /><br />In the meantime, I do like the White Tea with Pear..
