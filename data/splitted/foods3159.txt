review/summary: No thanks!
review/text: I bought a 10 pack sampler directly from Stash of the Decaf Vanilla Chai Tea, and I am glad that's all I bought!  This is not real vanilla flavor; it has very strong notes of chemicals and artificial flavors.  I tried this tea chilled with milk and sugar, and it has the same qualities of brewed potpourri. I'm not sure who could like this tea.  A much better tea is Stash's Organic Black and Green Chai tea, or Green Chai tea by the same company.  At least try the sample pack before buying 120 bags of this.

review/summary: This Tea is Even Winning over Non-Tea Drinkers
review/text: This is the first product that I have ever felt strongly enough to write a review on.  This tea has definately gotten some undeserved bad reviews.  It is a Chai Tea!!  It is supposed to be spicey, have a fairly strong flavor, and you are supposed to add sweetner and milk to it.  This VANILLA DECAF CHAI is fantastic!  My kids love it, my guests love it, and I love it!  Everytime I serve it, everyone wants to know where to get it and how I made it.  Even non-tea drinkers get hooked on it.  It is wonderful cold or hot, and has a lighter spice flavor than most Chai teas, but they added a touch of vanilla instead.  This tea really is one that you can enjoy everyday.  It really is worth a try.

review/summary: Elegant white tea AND raspberry . . . so very good!
review/text: After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.

review/text: I've been drinking Stash brand Decaf Earl Grey Tea for years now. Very few stores in my area carry this brand, so I decided to order it from Amazon. I think this is the best decaf earl grey out there. It has just the right amount of bergamot oil, and is more flavorful than most other brands of decaf earl grey I've tried.

review/text: This is my favorite tea ever, I drink it daily iced. It has a nutty rich flavor almost like a coffee. I used to drink Celestial Seasonings Dessert Teas but as usual another company has discontinued the products. I originally ordered a cse of this from Stash last year and was hooked and hopefully they won't take it off the market. It seems like all that's out there is fruit flavored teas, which I don;t like, so if you like a rich bakery flavor tea, this one is it.

review/summary: Perfect Dessert Tea - Baby Bear
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker and got tired of not having something to drink with a dessert. This tea is perfect with milk and sugar! I feel like a grown up when I drink it. Don't get me wrong I know I could just drink hot chocolate and I do but sometimes depending on what I have it with or when, hot chocolate is too sweet. Which feels hypocritical for me to say because that's how I like it, but only when it is the dessert. So this is my perfect medium. It's like a term I like to use, it's baby bear! We all know the story of Goldie Locks and the three bears. Well coffee is pappa bear's bed, too hard to get over the bitterness. Hot chocolate is mamma bear's bed, too soft or sweet for everyday. This tea is baby bear's bed, just right. Now I'm no Goldie Locks but I'd like to think of myself as that content when I drink this tea. Love it!

I happen to love it...am here to re-order.<br /><br />Last year this product disappeared from local stores so I reluctantly ordered this box of 6 ... good grief-so many! Surprisingly, barely a year has passed and I'm out (in spite of having an average of 4-6 other favorite boxes of tea open at any one time).<br /><br />As with most teas, the flavor definitely improves with a bit of milk or cream (my favorite) or honey (with the milk or instead of ...). Sometimes I brew two bags at once...my favorite: this vanilla nut with Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Smooth and delicious
review/text: I've been drinking Stash teas for some time now but usually stuck to their caffeinated versions.  Once I found out I was pregnant, I made the switch to decaf and was happy to find that Stash has a nice selection of flavored decaf black teas.  However, this tea in particular is a favorite.<br /><br />In order to really bring out the flavors, I would suggest adding some milk and a sweetener (I usually use honey and if I do use sugar, I use turbinado sugar).  This makes the tea very smooth and creamy, something close to a tea latte.  The flavor is nicely chocolaty with just the right touch of hazelnut, which I find to be overpowering in large quantities.  I often drink this tea as a dessert-like indulgence but it would also be good in the morning in place of a flavored coffee.

review/summary: Good, mild green
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply.

review/text: This is a great tasting Tea that is unfortunately no longer on the store shelves in my area.<br /><br />It tastes sort of like a creamy hot cocoa. So it's a great replacement if, like me you're lactose intolerant. It also comes in regular I believe for those who need their caffeine fix :)<br /><br />Also of note is that each tea bag is individually sealed in a foil package so the last bag is as fresh as the first. I've seen a lot of tea companies switch to loose bags and they get old quickly after you open the box. These are always fresh.

review/summary: chocolate hazelnut tea
review/text: The first time I tried it I was kind of dissapointed. It just tasted like chocolate flavored water. I brewed it a second time and got better results. You have to steep it till you get it kind of strong, add quite a bit of sugar and milk, and it is quite good, for a tea. I think that was the problem, I expected hot chocolate - you can't get hot chocolate from a tea. I would rather drink ovaltine, if I want something that tastes chocolatey. It does smell wonderful. I gave it four stars as a tea, and not especially as a hot chocolate drink.

review/summary: Not bad for a decaf green
review/text: As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh "green" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.

review/summary: My cure for morning coffee
review/text: My doctor recently suggested (strongly) that I cut out my 3+ cups of coffee per day. Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid! I get my STASH with the regular subscription monthly. Can't be without my STASH Decaf Chai!

review/summary: Taste Okay
review/text: I ordered way too many boxes of this tea. I ordered several boxes before trying this tea, I had to give some of them away. It is not as good as I thought it was.  The key is to put more milk and a sweetener in it to improve the taste.  It taste okay, but not good enough for me to order this product a second time.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I didn't like tea very much until recently, and to me sugar and milk make tea taste disgusting. I've enjoyed a few flavors but when I got my hands on this, I knew it was meant to be. You take the teabag out of its pouch and it smells delicious, better than any tea I've ever smelled. Seriously, they could make potpourri out of this stuff! Compared to other chai's that I've tasted, this is my favorite. It comes in both decaf and caffeinated, so you can have it anytime... and just, yum. I highly recommend this tea!

review/summary: An office favorite!
review/text: All the ladies at my office LOVE this tea. I introduced a coworker to it and she convinced me to buy several boxes for the office. I just bought a box last Friday and today (Monday) it is half gone! The flavor is not super chocolatey, but has a delicate chocolate taste to it with creamy hazelnut notes. It's great with a splash of almond milk and a tiny bit of sugar. This and Mighty Leaf's chocolate mint truffle tea are my two favorite afternoon teas. When I'm craving something sweet, I just have a cup of this tea and it satisfies my sweet tooth and my chocolate cravings all at once. Again, if you're looking for a really chocolatey drink, this tea isn't anything like, for example, hot chocolate. It's just a hint of chocolatey and nutty flavor.

review/summary: Disappointed in STASH PREMIEUM TEA
review/text: STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used.  The Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea has absolutely NO flavor even when I try 3 tea bags to a cup of boiling water. I purchased 6 - 18 count boxes.  I had tried a hot chocolate tea in one of our little delis and it was wonderful.  I don't remember the name of the tea.  I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch.  I'm sitting here with over 100 tea bags with absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tea with flavor, I would discourage your using this tea.

review/text: One thing I like about Stash teas is the packaging. Each bag is sealed in a foil pouch which retains the tea's flavor. I also like the box because once I take the plastic wrapper off, it becomes a dispenser that I keep on my counter. I love the fragrance and taste of bergamot which is added to quality decaf tea to make Stash Premium Decaf Earl Grey Tea. I often breathe in the scent of the tea while waiting for it to cool. Heavenly!

review/text: I make Stash Premium Decaf Raspberry & White sun tea to drink iced during the warmer months. I make a half gallon at a time and add a quarter cup of sugar and store it in the fridge to drink through the week. The raspberry adds good flavor to the mild white tea. It's also good hot, but I prefer it iced. I get this once a year through the Super Saver program at Amazon which I'm very happy with as it's simple and saves me money. Since I drink a lot of tea, it's a good value.

That being said, be sure to not allow this tea to steep for more than a minute, and the water should *not* be boiling. Following that, the tea is most pleasant.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tucker

review/text: This Chai tea has such a great flavor. I drink it year round. In the summer I make iced tea out of it and always keep a container in the refrigerator. Once it cools off outside and I need to warm up I switch to hot tea. I've tried several other brands and always come back to this one. My grocery store stopped carrying the decaf version which I like since I drink so much iced tea in the summer, so I'm happy to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: THE ONLY TEA I DRINK!
review/text: Like others, I too have a big issue with caffeine.  And, most decaf teas are dull. Even the other Chai Teas (in other brands) didn't taste as good as Stash's Chai Tea decaf does.  So, this is the only tea that I drink!  It starts me off every morning.  I add 3 packets of the Natra Taste sweetener and some milk and it's just delicious!<br /><br />I love the flavor.  I do not find it heavy in clove, or cinnamon or anything.  I find this a very nicley well-balanced, flavored tea.  Of all the Chai Teas on the market (reg. or decaf) I love Stash's blend the best of all.<br /><br />I was buying it regularly at my Safeway grocery, and then for some reason, it just wasn't around anymore. In fact, there wasn't any decaf tea at all in the store.  Geez!  So, then I went over to the Giant (a longer drive), and was buying it there.  Suddenly, it's not there anymore either. Geez!<br /><br />Thank God I found it on-line.  So, these people have me now as a loyal customer and I hope this is going to be available for a long, long time.

review/summary: First Time Tea Drinker
review/text: I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.  I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.  I have a local store that sells items at a good price.  18 bags were $2.69, so I have no reason to buy it in bulk online.  I think I'd save 8 cents on a 3 month supply, then there's shipping.

review/text: I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural "flavors". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.

review/text: Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.

review/text: Just wanted to say that whenever I need almost anything I go to Amazon for the best prices. I love Stash teas but find them to be a little expensive in the supermarkets but at Amazon you not only get a great price but many times you can qualify for free shipping. I received the tea quicker than I expected which was a nice surprise since I was completely out of my favorite tea, Earl Gray from Stash. Thanks again.

review/text: I can't find decaf chai tea in any stores near me. I was a little hesitant about purchasing such a large quantity at once because I wasn't sure whether I'd like this brand. But I LOVE it! Add a couple teaspoons of half and half, some honey, and some sugar and YUM homemade chai lattes! This has been one of the only things helping with my morning sickness during my pregnancy (thanks to the ginger in it). Mmmm... I think I'll go makes some right now!

review/summary: My Favorite Tea
review/text: Wonderful tea. I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.

review/text: These bouillon cubes are a must-have for winter and the soups and stews that go with it. They're so quick and convenient! They're also really delicious, and not too salty. I will throw in a half cube when I make polenta (to replace the salt but add flavor), and I typically use one cube to every 2-4 cups of water, depending on the other spices and herbs in the soup. They don't dissolve quite as quickly as I would like, but I just typically throw the cube into the stockpot when I add my water, and it dissolves as the soup cooks. It's delish!

If you have an old throw away pan, I'd recommend using it otherwise get ready to scrub, re-heat and scrub some more. The finished product is like normal gum except the flavor doesn't last as long. The texture is normal and stayed soft enough to chew for a while. Her class loved the idea and couldn't wait to try her gum.

review/summary: Sour Rye Oh My
review/text: I purchased this product at my local supermarket and now I want MORE. I was happy to see that it is quite reasonable and in multipacks here at Amazon. I have a prolific sourdough starter that has been going for quite sometime so I have branched out and tried other than plain white sourdough bread. I tried the dark rye flour first and it was a little too heavy but the light rye works wonderfully well for my recipe. I also got a large batch of Bob's Caraway Seeds here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDM7N6">Bob's Red Mill Caraway Seeds, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)</a> so I don't have to scrimp on those like I have been with my expensive grocery store purchase. I now have the perfect rye bread like I have NEVER been able to buy anywhere for any price. 1 cup light rye flour, 1 cup white flour, 1 teaspoon sea salt, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 2 tablespoons warmed caraway seeds slightly ground, 1 cup starter, 1/4 cup water. I mix throughly and knead for 10 minutes in my KitchenAid, put in bowl and let rise for 2 hours in a cooler draft free area (no heat oven), punch down, shape loaf on lightly oiled baking sheet, rise 2 hours in oven, bake at 400 for 30 minutes. You could add 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar if desired, I don't. I only make rye bread now. I might go back to regular white sourdough but not any time soon!

review/summary: The best all purpose marinade in the known universe.
review/text: Chiavetta's is legendary in the Buffalo area. Their entire line of sauces and salad dressings<br />are top notch, but this apple cider based marinade is pure magic.<br /><br />This stuff has transformative power. I've even used it on steak and the results were amazing,<br />but its best on chicken and pork (chops, ribs, and particularly tenderloin). Use it sparingly<br />and don't overmarinate, you'll be very happy with the results. A bottle of this stuff should<br />last you a long time, or maybe not cause its addictive.<br /><br />This is how Chiavetta's Catering makes chicken: You shake the bottle to mix its combination of<br />vinegar, salt, secret spices, and garlic then marinate uncooked chicken in it for at least 30<br />minutes before grilling the chicken over charcoal. During the grilling, you continue to baste<br />the chicken with the marinade, then remove the chicken, place it in a pan, baste it again, cover<br />it and let the sauce steam into the meat for 10 or 15 minutes.<br /><br />Simple enough, right? The biggest tribute to this stuff are the number of copycat recipes on<br />the web. Glad to see the company has expanded their distribution, oddly not down to Florida<br />yet cause there's a lot of New Yorkers down here. Please note, this is a marinade, not a sauce<br />so no pouring this on the finished product, its too strong. Enjoy!

I have been living in California for the last 15 years and just recently ordered a bottle of this marinade.<br /><br />I have to tell you, the smell is intoxicating. It is a little overwhelming if you don't do it right. Basically that means you will marinade the meat and lightly baste the meat when you grill it.<br /><br />It's SO worth it and delicious and reminds me of being a kid again. It's also GREAT on vegetables. Lightly baste an ear of corn when you put it on the grill. Fantastic!

review/text: I grew up in WNY, but moved south at a young age. My parents would travel to WNY every year to visit family, and stock up on our favorites, this being one of them. I have used this marinade on all types of meats, and every one has turned out fantastic. My children prefer this to regular bbq sauce, my husband loves it, and even my in-laws enjoy it, asking for it at every cook out we have. I find that marinading my meat for 3-4 hours gives it just the right amount of flavor without the overpowering vinegar taste. If you prefer the vinegar taste as I do, add a teaspon full to your plate after its cooked.

review/text: If you're from WNY as I am, you probably know Chiavetta's. Fantastic BBQ chicken. But, if you expect this marinade to be just like the real thing, you'll be disapointed big time.<br /><br />I picked up a bottle at Wegman's and couldn't wait to try it out. Not pleased at all - instead of the mellow tang I was familiar with, you get hit with a sharp vinegar taste that overwhelms everything. We're talking smack you over the head vinegar taste. Even the smell is off-putting, and not at all like I remember Chiavetta's to be.<br /><br />If you like a heavy vinegar taste, this might be appealing. Otherwise, stay away unless you need to keep something on hand to jolt people who have fainted back to consciousness.

review/summary: Strange Aftertaste
review/text: This is my second purchase from Pacific Natural Foods. While I loved the Poblano Corn soup, I didn't care for this one at all and neither did my husband. We both agreed there is a very strange aftertaste that lingers after each bite--not enjoyable for either one of us. In fact, I just refused to eat the rest of my portion. Neither one of us could identify exactly what that aftertaste was. I guessed perhaps the lemongrass was the culprit, completely overpowering the flavor of the soup, but my dh said it tasted like chemicals. Who knows? I suggest for those looking to buy in bulk and have never tried the Thai Sweet Potato soup, definitely go buy 1 box from your local store's natural food section so you're not wasting your hard earned money if you end up not liking it.

It is spicy, creamy, and savory. And it is an excellent source of nutrition. The caloric and fat content is a good healthy type of fat coming from coconut milk, which has many health benefits. If you don't like sweet potatoes, spicy red chile's, creamy coconut milk, and a hint of lime - this soup is not for you and I would suggest sticking to the more fake quality other brands tend to offer (with 5 times the sodium and less flavor).
