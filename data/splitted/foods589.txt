review/summary: Dog goes crazy for these
review/text: EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.

review/text: We give Greenies ("Teenie" size) to our 12-year old miniature poodle. Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her breath is nicer, too, since we started giving her Greenies.<br /><br />We give her one every day or so and she will carry it around 'protecting' it for an hour or so before settling down and devouring it. We tried other brands but she will only accept the best. She is terrified of thunderstorms and will come out from under the bed only if we offer her her favorite treat: a Greenie.

review/text: My 60 lb Ridgeback-mix is just crazy about these.  By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie-mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan, too, this is certainly a great price.  Shipping was reasonable, as well ... particularly when ordering several boxes ... and quick.

review/summary: Greenies Lite - Not for dogs who had the taste of regular Greenies
review/text: My little dog who's rather picky about his treats absolutely loves Greenies REGULAR.  As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular.

review/text: My dog really enjoys these as a daily treat. However, until she has her next physical I really can't evaluate these properly. I will try to remember to update after her physical so I can report back if her tartar build-up has been reduced or eliminated. Our vet said they work IF your dog chews them slowly. Our dog goes through them pretty fast, so I am not sure if they are going to be effective. We decided to give them a year and see what happens.

So, if you have small dogs up to say 25 or 30 pounds, the Teenies are the best. I don't think you can find them any cheaper.

review/text: This is a favorite treat of our 7 month old standard poodle puppy. He is an aggressive chewer, so we need something which will occupy him. The Greenie really seems to satisfy  - after chewing through it (which, admittedly, only takes a few minutes) he will lie down and stop bothering us during dinner.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive. Each Greenie costs about $1.50, so it pains me a little to see it evaporate so quickly. But that is a function of my dog, not the product.

Over a three week period we have observed a reasonable reduction in the amount of tarter on his teeth, especially the molars.<br /><br />We would continue to buy them from Amazon if the price were lower. However, a large shopper's club sells essentially the same product (ingredients, and including the capped box and inner packaging), while offering the product at a consistently lower cost: 10%-12% per unit.

review/summary: Freshens breath and my Yorkie loves 'em!!
review/text: When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie "yelling" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!

review/summary: Absolutely fabulous
review/text: I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, "Almost three." And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. "No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned."<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.

review/text: I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the "large or X-Lg" greenie where you get fewer pieces.

review/text: I usually buy these at the pet store, but the price was great, and the product arrived fresh. These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.

review/text: These are a bit expensive but when it comes to your pet, especially one with bad breat like mine, it's worth it. My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh. It's also grt for their teeth, she hasn't had to have her teeth cleaned at the vet once since she started eating these.

review/summary: Greenies teeth biscuits
review/text: I love this product!  My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting brown in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :)

review/text: These are "minis" but seriously plenty for even a bigger dog like a boxer.  We give it to Mocha about 2 to 3 times a week to keep here breath from smelling like the crypt keepers shorts . . .

review/summary: Greenies are the bomb!
review/text: We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!

review/text: My dog goes crazy for these. He won't touch the Virbac dog chews. He's not a chewer, so the fact that he will chew these means they must taste really good. They're expensive, but because my dog will eat them, it's worth the cost.

review/summary: My Lab's favorite bedtime treat
review/text: I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that "tail-wagging drool" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)

review/text: Both my Maltese and Chiweenie pup really dig these greenie's. I break the teenies in half for the chiweenie to spare the money.  Just like the people food, the healthier, the more pricey. But they do like these and would rather the greenies than anything else. 2nd time purchasing from here and shipment is quick and easy.

review/text: My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon, like it's her treat for being such a good girl all day.  So funny!

review/summary: Only thing my dog will eat.
review/text: I have a 3 year old Siberian Husky, who has to be the pickiest dog in the world. He will go days without eating if I don't give him exactly what he wants. I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done.

review/summary: Greenies
review/text: My dog has been eating these after his dinner for years. They keep his breath clean and limit the build up of plac. He waits with anticipation his greenie after his meal, running to get one out of my hand. Digestion has been no problem at all and the formula is soft enough to prevent any form of choking. I would highly recommend this product.

The same package sells for at least $10 to $15 more for the same product. I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.com.

review/text: Greenies are wonderful, my dog loves them and chews them up! I don't notice much as far as better breath, but I already brush his teeth and scale them. He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)<br /><br />(To the bad reviews/comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)

review/summary: Works well but too dense
review/text: My dog likes to chew it but it's "heavy weight" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use--my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here.

review/text: A great treat that your dogs will love. Even our slightly picky dogs love these treats. They clean their teeth too! Also, they don't smell like some rawhides and other natural products. I wish the lasted a little longer - our larger dog eats his in a couple of minutes.
