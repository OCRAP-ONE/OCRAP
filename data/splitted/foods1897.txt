review/summary: Not Too Sweet, Pleny of Whole Grains
review/text: This is a terrific breakfast cereal.  It's made from oats and wheat, and has just a little bit of cinnamon and brown sugar added to make it tasty.  There are a whopping 46g of whole grains per serving, along with 90% of the daily recommended value of iron and quite a few other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />I was initially concerned that the texture would be hard and coarse like shredded wheat, but that is not the case.  Instead, I thought the consistency was closer to a chex cereal than shredded wheat, despite the fact that the pieces are not hollow.<br /><br />I dislike overly sugary cereal, and I love the taste of oatmeal.  Combine that with the huge amount of whole grains in this product, and I'm definitely happy.  I would certainly eat this again.

review/summary: Pretty Average
review/text: For the sugar content I expected this cereal to be much sweeter / spicier than it is. While it isn't super bland it's not super flavorful either. Holds pretty well in milk. The taste is just ok. It's like having mini wheats with a smoother crunch. I tried it on the kids and got mixed results. The one who likes Mini Wheats mixed it with another cereal for a flavor boost while the other just ignored it. This falls somewhere between plain Mini Wheats and Life in the sweetness/ thickness scale but doesn't replace either. You could do much worse than Quaker Oatmeal Squares. If you watch your intake of sugar cereal you can also do better, both in grams per serving and in taste. I'd eat it again if it was on sale but I wouldn't seek it out.

review/summary: I love this crunchy Oatmeal squares
review/text: This is nice crunchy Oatmeal square with cinnamon flavor and tastes at its best if you consume with milk and some sugar. If you add strawberries or blue berries it tastes even better. If you don't add milk, it tastes more like frosted mini wheat. Overall this is a great food for breakfast and it is recommended.

review/summary: Good, but--
review/text: Their description of the flavor as "a hint of cinnamon" is a touch overstated. It's kind of the ghost of a wisp of homeopathic cinnamon-water having been wafted over the cereal at some point, perhaps.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're not worried about the cinnamon, this is pretty good stuff. Love the texture, and man, is it filling; a regular-sized (for me) bowl of cereal actually proved hard to finish because this stuff is BULKY. That's never happened to me before. And as long as you don't mind the taste of oats (without, or with only a ghost of, cinnamon), hop to. ***

review/summary: Not your Mother's cereal.
review/text: I loved Mother's Cinnamon Oat Crunch.  It was my all-time favorite cereal.  Even though I don't like honey (the cereal was sweetened with honey) and feel neutral about cinnamon, the stuff was special and made me look forward to breakfast each morning.<br />My grocery store was recently out of Cinnamon Oat Crunch, so I went looking for it online. . .and discovered a notice on the Quaker site that the cereal had been discontinued.  What a bummer!  Then I saw new Quaker Oatmeal Squares and how similar they looked to Cinnamon Oat Crunch in the photo.  They even have the tilted heart logo that recently appeared on Mother's boxes.  Here's Quaker's replacement, I thought.<br />Not as good.  Oatmeal Squares are sweetened with sugar instead of honey.  Somehow, the sugar tastes separate from the cereal, like I took a bland piece of unsweetened cereal and put it in my mouth with a sugar cube.  Cinnamon Oat Crunch was all-natural; I see no such claim on the Oatmeal Squares box.<br />You can make your own call about which cereal is better for you; I'm going to post a user image of the nutrition facts side by side.  Some areas have improved; others have gotten worse.  Oatmeal Squares are all right for taste--I don't mind them--but they just aren't quite as delightful as Cinnamon Oat Crunch.

review/summary: Cinnamon Toast Crunch for Adults
review/text: This cereal reminded me of nothing so much as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, except with less crunch and less flavor and less sweetness.  Physically, it's the form factor of Bite-Size Mini-Wheats, except at about 75% of the biscuit size.  The recommended serving size of 1 cup, with skim milk, gave me a 250-calorie breakfast, more than my usual 200, but the extra calories are pretty evenly distributed between protein, carbs, and fat.  Overall, I found it bland and largely uninteresting.  I'd eat it happily enough if it were put in front of me, but I won't be bothering to buy more of my own volition; I like other things better for my daily starter.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares are a little bland with a touch of cinnamon for flavor.  Had them with milk and thought it was crunchy but nothing special.  It was quite filling, so if your looking for a quick breakfast to last you till lunch, this will do the trick.

review/summary: Delicious Oatmeal Cereal
review/text: I like the taste of oatmeal for breakfast. This product is a cold cereal, but it tastes like oatmeal.  The hint of cinnamon in the cereal makes it even tastier.  The texture is also pleasant, like miniture shredded wheat. And the little squares remain crispy even in the last few spoonfuls of milk.  With the addition of milk and raisins, it makes a very nice breakfast.

review/text: I hope they are not trying to mimic shredded wheat because they have failed.  I have always loved Quaker products but I must say this falls short.<br /><br />There is really not enough cinnamon, but the sweetness is fine, I do not like a breakfast cereal too sweet. It stays crunchy but that is the problem, the crunch, it is more like cardboard than whole oats. It just doesn't cut it for me, the shreds are not like that of shredded wheat but more of a thick hard strands of oats.<br /><br />I tried snacking on them but the are a bit too hard for that also.

review/summary: Pretty darn tasty!
review/text: Here's the thing: I can't have dairy.  So I can't tell you a thing about how this cereal behaves in milk.<br /><br />However, I LOVE cereal and my thought is always that if it's good in milk, it's good to eat other ways too.<br /><br />Such as: trail mix, on blueberry crumble, baking and just loose by the handful.<br /><br />This cereal is awesome for all those uses. It holds together in the 'miniwheat' shape pretty well: you can crumble it for a nice dessert topping, but it also works with a nice sort of granola like trail mix.<br /><br />It's not too sweet (something that cereal often is when you eat it loose) and has a really nice crunch and just the right amount of cinnamony flavor.<br /><br />I would definitely buy again

review/text: I received this item through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />If you have had Quaker Oatmeal Squares before, you know that it is a pleasant cereal that has a lot of crunch and stays relatively that way in milk.  This new version adds an extra dimension of flavor by adding a hint of cinnamon to the mix.  The taste is definately there, but it is NOT overwhelming.  You also immediately recognize it as cinnamon as oppposed to some cereals that claim to have cinnamon and you cannot really recongnize it.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering these again!  I would also recommend them to anyone looking for a tasty cereal made from oats that has a crunchy texture.

review/text: These cinnamon oatmeal squares are fine--not great, but not terrible, either. On the plus side, they stay incredibly crispy in milk--way crispier than a shredded wheat or flake cereal.

review/summary: similar to Shredded Wheat; stayed crunchy
review/text: This cereal is very similar to Shredded Wheat in size and the way it really fills you up after eating.  I found this cereal to be really bland with no flavor to it at all.  Yes, it says cinnamon on the box and it smells cinnamon-y when you open the box but once it hits the bowl it is like all flavoring washes off with the milk.  I think I was expecting a sweeter product and this was not at all sweet.  On the plus side, if you like a crunchy cereal these squares stayed solid and crunchy the entire time.  I found this to be really filling and didn't even finish the bowl I had poured for myself.  This cereal was too bland and heavy for me to want to eat it on a regular, daily basis.

review/summary: Needs More Cinnamon Flavor
review/text: These little biscuits are a great snack by themselves, or you can eat them as a traditional cereal with milk added. They do not get soggy in milk, but be careful of getting too many on your spoon, they are rather large. They have more of a graham-cracker texture than the similar-looking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037MVZMA">Post Shredded Wheat ' Bran, Spoon Size, 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a> (which has a straw-like texture in my opinion).<br /><br />However - and this was a BIG however for my tasters - the cinnamon flavor fades away in milk. They end up tasting like graham crackers with just a hint of cinnamon. I would like something with a lot more cinnamon taste.

review/text: The plain Quaker Oatmeal Squares is one of my favorite boxed cereals so I was happy to try this cinnamon version.  This version has good cinnamon flavor; not fake & not too strong.<br /><br />I usually eat plain shredded wheat cereal (no sugar added) with a small amount of a sweetened cereal like this one, on top for added flavor.  This Quaker Oatmeal Squares is not too sweet even on its own although 9 grams of sugar is more than I like to see in my morning cereal.  It has 5 grams of fiber per serving.<br /><br />It stays crunchy in milk & tastes even better if you add fresh fruit.

review/summary: Review for Quaker oatmeal squares, cinnamon flavor
review/text: This cereal reminds me of frosted mini wheats. When eaten without milk, it is not too sweet but is still sweet enough to avoid being bland. It's crunchy, and I can definitely taste the cinnamon. Unfortunately, once milk is added, the not being too sweet part became a disadvantage. I usually complain about foods being too sweet, but this time the sugar got diluted by the milk and the cereal became a bit bland. I would only buy this if you're planning on eating it without milk added or if you want to add extra flavoring to your cereal.

review/summary: Very tasty, not too sweet, just a hint of cinnamon
review/text: I've loved the brown sugar flavor of this cereal for years, but hadn't tried the cinnamon version until recently.  It's quite similar to the brown sugar version, except for the hint of cinnamon, and I'll warn you that it is just a hint; if you're looking for a very strong cinnamon flavor, this is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy. But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals. It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for "healthy" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats. And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any but not so much that I feel like I'm eating candy.  The main problem I have with it is that my kids love it so much we go through a box in no time (unlike other "healthy" cereals, which the kids wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole).

review/text: Its similar to Mini-Wheats but not quite as stiff since it is more oat flour than wheat. It definitely has a cinnamon flavor but not over powering. It is nice and crunchy if you don't let it get soggy in milk. I think that this would be a great item to add to a Chex-Mix style of snack along with nuts and dried fruit.<br /><br />I also tried using the Oatmeal Squares to flavor some non-sweetened cereal and found that really helped stretch the food dollar. One thing I really like is that it does not have the over powering sweetness of say Kellogg's cereals. That was a pleasant surprise.

review/summary: Nothing to get excited about
review/text: My wife is the member of our household who eats cereal of this sort. She eats shredded wheat and other cereals I personally don't care for, so I considered her my primary resource for an opinion on the consuming side of this cereal. Her viewpoint was that it wasn't bad, but it was a bit too sweet.<br /><br />Looking at the nutrition label, I can see why. While it does have whole grain oats, ingredients three through five are sugars. That is why a cup of this cereal comes in at 210 calories per cup, which far higher than I like to see in a cup of healthy cereal. This cereal is definitely off the list if you are trying to lose weight.<br /><br />If you are currently maintaining a healthy weight and have the room in your daily calorie budget, then this cereal wouldn't be a mistake if you like it. However, Kellog's Cinnamon Oat Fiber Plus cereal ALSO has whole grain oats, and almost double the fiber content of these Quaker Oatmeal squares. It has less sugar. The only downside in comparing the two is that this cereal has more protein. However, it is more common to have trouble getting enough fiber in your diet than it is to get enough protein.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product for most people.

Somtimes I do hit a square that is more cinnamony than the rest, but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed with these considering how much I enjoy the blue box kind.  Maybe it was the milk, but I have tried these on their own too and find that they're kind of short on flavor.  I still like these Quaker Oatmeal Squares and they're still great for just about any time of day.  Still crispy inside even if the outside's a little soggy and still good for you too, just not my favorite.

This cereal, despite looking quite a bit like shredded wheat, does not have a similar texture.<br /><br />I love cinnamon, and this has a good sweet cinnamon taste, but not too overpowering.  There is a fair bit of sugar, plus other unnamed carbs, so be warned if you're on a low carb diet.  There are twice as many calories as a bowl of Cheerios, but that's pretty comparable to most other cereals.  If you're looking for something relatively high fiber without the high fiber taste, and you like cinnamon, give this one a shot.<br /><br />It also comes in brown sugar flavor.

review/text: As an oatmeal lover, I enjoyed this product. The oatmeal squares look a lot like Frosted Mini Wheats but they taste a lot better! I think it would taste better if there were more cinnamon on the squares because when you add milk, you really can't taste much. The milk tends to get inside the holes of the squares and you get a mouthful of milk. Therefore, I prefer to eat these as a healthy finger snack because they taste better that way to me. When you eat them dry, you can definitely taste the cinnamon. Overall, it's good tasting and healthy, but for the price you pay, there should be more in the box...lots of air space and not as much cereal.

review/summary: Subtle cinnamon flavor for a filling breakfast
review/text: This cereal is an excellent way to start off the day.  With a subtle cinnamon flavor, I did not feel this cereal to be too sweet or overpowering.  It has a nice crunch and did not get soggy in milk, although honestly it did not stay too long in the bowl.<br /><br />It is a nutritious cereal as well as tasty.  It is high in fiber (5g dietary fiber, 2g soluble fiber), iron (90% of daily values) and folic acid (100% of daily value).  It is low in fat (2.5g total fat, 0.5g saturated fat, 0g trans fat, and 1g of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat each), sugar (9g) and sodium (190mg).  It also has protein (6g) and potassium (200mg).  It is made with whole grain oat flour and whole wheat flour too, so it is not empty calories without nutritional value, which is important to me.<br /><br />It is a quality cereal with a good taste and good nutrition to start the day.  Health conscious and flavor conscious cereal connoisseurs will both be pleased with Quaker Oatmeal Squares.

review/summary: Very enjoyable
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon fulfills all my cereal needs: crunchy, just sweet enough without being overwhelming, with a nutty quality and a flavor factor that made this cereal good enough to serve as dinner the night I got it. (Well, the fridge was not bursting with suggestions and I didn't feel like stopping anywhere, but cereal for supper has been done before.) It is faithful to what you would expect from Quaker, a robust, satisfying oatmeal cereal with the addition of cinnamon, and cinnamon takes almost everything up a notch. It doesn't get immediately soggy with the addition of milk, and is also pretty darn good as a snack food to answer cravings between breakfast and lunch at work. One of the better cereals on the market today.

review/summary: Kids love it.
review/text: I was going to wait to review this product until after I've had a bowl of it, but given the response of my young family, I see no need.<br /><br />The night I had the box of Quaker's Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares in the house, my daughter (who's five) asked for it as a snack before bed. Then after she tried it, she asked for it as a snack in her lunch box.<br /><br />When my son (who's seven) saw what she was eating, he wanted some too, liked them, and asked for some in his lunchbox as well.<br /><br />Hard to argue with that reception.<br /><br />Here's a cereal that not only tastes good (think a heartier and less sweet version of Cinnamon Life), kids like it, and--with 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein--it is good for them too. I recommend it for you and your family.<br /><br />** One word of caution, this cereal does have barley in it. We have one family member who is allergic to that particular grain. (Causes mild hives.) You might too, so be aware of food allergy symptoms!  **

review/summary: I've always like Quaker Oat Squares
review/text: I've always like Quaker Oat Squares, and these Cinnamon Quaker Oat Squares are no exception.  The texture of the oat squares themselves resemble Life cereal a bit but with much more substance; they are crunchy and filling, and hold up to milk quite well (they don't get soggy in the bowl as quickly as many other cereals do).  They also make a handy snack without the milk (as I'm eating them right now).<br /><br />The Cinnamon variety adds a touch of cinnamon flavor - not overwhelming at all, but blends in well with the oats.<br /><br />Coupled with the relatively low sugar added (9 grams per serving) and 5 grams of fiber, this seems like one of the healthier mass market cereals available.  That plus its good taste make this an easy product to recommend.

review/summary: Great straight from the box, and healthy to boot!
review/text: I am always looking for a quick and easy but nutritious breakfast or snack for my family, so I welcomed the opportunity to try out these Cinnamon Quaker Oatmeal Squares. I've tried them now with milk for breakfast as well as just straight from the box, as has my family. The verdict? These oatmeal squares make a terrific snack for those times when you're hungry and need a little something to tide you over until dinner.  The squares have a satisfying heft and crunch to them, and it makes you feel like you're eating something substantial, even though the actual calorie count is highly reasonable.  The slight sweetening and added cinnamon make them taste gratifyingly close to an oatmeal cookie, only crispy.<br /><br />I had my husband (eats anything), daughter (sweet tooth), and son (notoriously finicky) sample the cereal as well.  Hubby liked it, but then again, he likes anything.  Daughter said she liked it, but "it would be better if it had frosting."  The biggest surprise was my picky son, who usually eats nothing but mac'n'cheese and PBJ sandwiches. He gave the oatmeal squares a big thumbs up, and I even spied him later in the pantry grabbing a handful.<br /><br />So I think I will stock this cereal regularly. I like that it provides a way of getting the health benefits of oatmeal into my kids, who shun the mushy hot stuff.  I like even more that it gives me something healthy but satisfying to point to as a snack when they come to me and say that they're hungry. It beats potato chips or crackers by a long shot.

review/summary: Good flavor, but not quite hearty enough.
review/text: I generally stuck with this cereal for a similar taste <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X0TRGW">Barbara's Bakery Shredded Oats Original, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Barbara's tends to stay crunchier and has a better "mouth feel" or texture to it. Otherwise it's a very good comparison for these Oatmeal Squares.<br />The oatmeal squares are cinnamon flavored, which was a very nice hint of flavor and was not overbearing at all. It was not sugary sweet (which I hate)or artificial tasting at all.<br /><br />It's pretty good in terms of nutritional value: 210 calories, 2.5 g fat, 5 g fiber, and 6 g protein. It's also high in iron and folic acid. I appreciate a cereal that is a true "good source" for something, rather than just saying "it has fiber!" and contains only 1 gram. This cereal is not that way, thankfully. It does have 9 grams of sugar, but compared to other cereals that seems acceptable to me.<br /><br />The one drawback in comparison to Barbara's is the crunchiness. The oatmeal squares just don't stay crunchy in milk.

review/summary: Too much sugar for my taste, contains wheat
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this cereal, as I am getting pretty tired of Cheerios.  Nothing against Cheerios, of course, but variety is the spice of life.<br /><br />Speaking of spices, I thought oatmeal with a dash of cinnamon sounded darn good.  Well, dang, was I disappointed..  It's more like sugar with a dash of cinnamon.<br /><br />I kid you not.  It is not readily apparent from reading the blurb on the box that this is a highly sweetened cereal.  I was anticipating something more subtle in its sweetness: "Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon is packed with a hearty crunch that wakes you up and has just the right amount of sweetness to help fuel you up to conquer the morning."<br /><br />I do not generally eat sweetened cereals.  (I just don't care for them.)  However, the first bite had me grabbing the box to look for the list of ingredients.  The box reads "whole oat flour, whole wheat flour (what?) brown sugar, sugar, maltodextrin, malted barley extract, cinnamon, molasses, salt," and then all those additives with polysyllabic names.  You can see that sugar is the third and fourth ingredient.  Maltodextrin is a starch that your body breaks down into glucose (sugar).<br /><br />This cereal contains 9 grams of sugar in one cup - just over two teaspoons.  (According to various sources on the Web, two teaspoons of white sugar weigh 8.4 grams, brown sugar weighs a bit more.)  If you like a sweet cereal, you might like it, but that's way too much for my taste. (See product images.)<br /><br />On the positive side, I bet this cereal would be really good mixed in with a batch of trail mix.<br /><br />Additional caution:  People with wheat allergies, beware.

review/summary: Subtle Cinnamon Flavor Yet Tasty
review/text: I'm a cinnamon lover, especially when eaten at breakfast. This cereal could be better described as a "hint" of cinnamon. It's not very sweet; if you prefer a sweeter taste like I do, I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top and that did the trick for me. However, I did like it without.<br /><br />I ate the suggested serving of 1 cup and used 3/4 of a cup of milk. More milk would have had the cereal swimming. The cereal absorbs some of milk, but leaves enough to have some in each bite. I liked that. I did let the cereal soak in the for about three minutes because I do not like eating completely dry cereal.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that I would have liked more cinnamon. Overall, I enjoyed it and would be willing to purchase it again.

This is just as tasty, but better since it comes right out of a box.<br /><br />  I love the taste with a hint of cinnamon, just as promised on the box.  It's slightly sweet and very crunchy.  Don't use much milk if you want it to stay crunchy.  A healthy snack and breakfast.  I do feel good after eating a serving size bow, with a splash of milk.  A good way to get those great grains into your day.

review/summary: Could use more cinnamon
review/text: Considering this is suppose to be a healthier cereal I guess the amount of sweetness is sufficient. Personally, I would like it to be a little more sweet. Once I began eating the cereal, I forgot it was suppose to have a cinnamon flavor to it. So, if you are expecting a good, strong cinnamon flavor from this cereal you are going to be disappointed. Other than those two disclaimers, the cereal was quite satisfying. It didn't get too soggy from the milk. I did get a hearty feel from it. I would say it is one of the better cereals out there if you are looking for a healthier cereal.

review/summary: Cinnamon Delight
review/text: With its subtle use of sugar and cinnamon, Quaker's Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares seems to be crafted to adult tastes, though I'm sure kids would love it too. It's a hearty cereal, equally good with milk or straight from the box. A small handful will stave off your appetite for an hour or two.<br /><br />The squares look like Miniature Shredded Wheat but I find the texture and flavor much more satisfying..  The cereal is fairly good for you despite its nine grams of sugar per serving.  That's a modest amount, but still may be questionable for some people, yet the good news is that there is no high fructose corn syrup, just real sugar, white and brown.<br /><br />The cereal stays crunchy in milk for a reasonable amount of time, too.<br /><br />Normally, I'm a Cheerios and milk, no sugar, kind of person, but sometimes I get a craving for cinnamon cereal.  From now on, I'm going with Quaker's offering; I like the nice, heavy crunch, the perfectly pitched flavors and the simple, natural ingredients.

review/text: * Same as Oatmeal Squares, with just a hint of cinnamon<br />* Less sugar per serving than Cocoa Puffs (!) ... though it has 6 times as much protein, and double the fiber, but also double the carbs (23 vs 44 grams). (What can I say - I had a box of Cocoa Puffs on the counter when this arrived)<br />* Good finger food for little kids, or for snacking during the day<br />* Slightly abrasive on the roof of your mouth, though not as much as Mini Wheats without milk or Cap'n Crunch<br /><br />It's one of our family staples... healthy enough for mom and tasty enough for the kids. Four stars instead of five out of pure bias - I like it well enough and it gets the job done, but it isn't THAT special.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon cereal is one tasty treat!  As a person who can eat cereal for any meal or a snack, I am always looking for something new to try, so I had to taste Quaker's cereal when given the opportunity through the Vine program.<br /><br />Quaker's cinnamon flavored squares are an equal balance of whole grains and sweetness.  The cinnamon flavor is just the right amount and is not at all overwhelming.  I first tried the cereal by the handful.  While eating it dry, I noticed the pleasant texture that similar cereals lack.  In milk, the cereal did not become soggy too quickly.  And it tasted great both ways and was filling.<br /><br />The one downside was that I expected this cereal that have better nutritional value.  While it is healthier than some of the other cereals that might fall in its category (more fiber and protein, less sugar), I found the calorie amount per serving to be slightly high.  The amount of whole grains included in a serving makes up for this somewhat.<br /><br />Overall, Quaker has a great addition to the cereal market.  It will appeal to adults and children alike.  However, while I would recommend this to consumers looking for a sweet, satisfying, grown up cereal, I would tell those looking to lose weight to try another breakfast cereal.

review/summary: One of my favorite cereals now available from Amazon
review/text: While you normally think of hot oatmeal mixes when you think of Quaker, I think of their awesome Oatmeal Squares cereal.  A long time favorite, the super dense smaller squares of cinnamon based heaven are surprisingly good for you too. 46 grams of whole wheat per serving, providing a whopping 20% of your Daily Value for Dietary Fiber.  And unlike many other cereals, the ingredient list is a pleasant surprise.  Whole grain oat flour and then whole wheat flour are the first two ingredients.  And no high fructose corn syrup either, just good ole brown sugar and regular sugar.  Cinnamon and molasses round out the flavor ingredients.  And sugar only makes up 9 grams per serving- the same as the more expensive and worst tasting Kashi Cinnamon Harvest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1YYLW">Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest, 16.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> I bought as a comparison.<br /><br />In fact the Quaker pretty much destroyed the Kashi on the taste test.  It also held up better in milk longer, and the smaller denser squares compared favorably to the bigger looser Kashi squares which crumbled more more easily in the box.  Fiber was a tie, with the Quaker having an extra gram of soluble fiber.  Fat wise the Quaker does have 2.5 grams to 1 gram for the Kashi- but we are still talking 4 and 2% respectively of the Daily Value- so they are both good choices.<br /><br />Downsides- the box is smaller than most at 14.5oz versus 17.5oz for the Kashi.  And its expensive- at nearly $5 a box on Amazon.  But with free delivery and no sales tax its probably close to a wash versus your supermarket. And you will probably eat more than one "serving" per meal, so you can blow through a box quicker than you would think.<br /><br />So one of my favorite cereals with Amazon convenience, now I just would like to see the Amazon price come down a bit more to reflect the quantity we are buying.  But for the cereal itself, I can give an unqualified 5 star rave- its great tasting and good for you to boot.

review/summary: Needs More Cinnamon!
review/text: So, if you are a cinnamon junky like myself, you will eat this cereal and find yourself thinking, "Hey! Where did all the cinnamon go?!" The cereal looks like shredded wheat, but it is more a solid piece than individual layers. The cinnamon flavor is rather faint and muted, but it is still pretty tasty. My husband thought the cinnamon was the perfect amount, so it might just be my insatiable need for tons of cinnamon that left me wanting with this cereal. The little squares aren't hollow, so they are really quite filling. I have been eating them by handful as a snack, but I imagine they would be good in milk like standard cereal as well.<br /><br />Pretty good cereal, but want more cinnamon!

review/summary: Mmmmm crunchy cinnamon goodness!
review/text: I received these cinnamon flavored Quaker Oatmeal Squares from the On The Vine program. I just want to be clear that on the box underneath the wording Oatmeal Squares it states "with just a hint of Cinnamon". Dry or with milk this cereal is very tasty.  Cereal w/o milk is 210 calories, 2.5g of fat, .5g sat fat, 9g of sugar, 5g of dietary fiber, and 6g of protein.  It contains 46grams of whole grains, 90% iron and 100% folic acid per serving. As a dry cereal, it is a cinnamon, slightly sweetened crunchy delight. It stays pretty crunchy in milk, depending on how long it takes you to eat your cereal. It has just the right amount of sweetness, for my taste anyway. I don't really care for the sickening sweet cereals. I'm not sure why on the box it states "hint of cinnamon", I would say it's more than a hint, it is definitely cinnamon flavored. I, for one, love cinnamon so I loved it. If you are one who drinks the milk from the cereal when you are done, the milk was cinnamon flavored but no granules of sugar left in the bottom of the bowl like you sometimes get with more sugary cereals. I would definitely purchase this cereal on a regular basis and recommend this product.

review/summary: Crunchy Oats
review/text: Fans of hearty oat cereals should enjoy Quaker Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares. If you've had the regular Oatmeal Squares, then just imagine them with sweet, rich cinnamon added. I prefer their flavor and texture to the similarly shaped mini-wheat cereals.  This is heartier than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ER1JE0">Life Cereal</a> but not quite as heavy as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AY9UKM">Cracklin' Oat Bran</a>. The ribbed oat pillows stay crunchy in milk for a good long time. I enjoy them as a milk-less snack too.<br /><br />This enriched cereal is fairly healthy and not overly sweet. A half cup serving is good for about 20% of your daily fiber requirements and 90% of the iron. They also contain 96% of your minimum daily whole grain recommendation. It is one of the few *healthier* cereals that my kids enjoy as well, and I even like having a bowl in place of dessert. Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares are not an inexpensive cereal, but I would say their price/nutrition ratio is one of the better ones. I've seen highly processed, overly sweet kids' cereals that cost more. This Oatmeal Square cereal compares well with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1YYLW">Kashi Cinnamon Harvest</a>, another similar cereal that I like.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Sorry to give these up -- afraid of cancer recurrence
review/text: The flavor of these bars is very, very good.  They are filling and have many good nutritive qualities.<br /><br />That being said, we have to stop buying these bars.  They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals:<br /><br />1) Vegetarian/non dairy<br />2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein<br /><br />Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive.

review/summary: Excellent buy
review/text: I am not some kind of caviar snob but I have had the very expensive down to lumpfish from the local grocery store.  I was so surprised at the extremely fresh taste and mild flavor.  It even had the "pop" of the expensive brands. What was so wonderful with this type is I could just get a little spoonful whenever I wanted instead of waiting for a special occasion.

review/text: This brand is not to salty, not to fishy. Great caviar taste with ample pop. The freshness is evident. I have bought this brand over and over and it's never let me down. I've introduced several friends and family members to caviar using this brand and it never fails to impress. Highly reccomended.

review/summary: Very Salty
review/text: When i tried this it tastes very salty. If you like anchovies then this is the caviar for you because it tastes almost exactly like anchovies.<br /><br />It does have a little "pop" to it but the eggs are very small, it kinda looks like blackberry jam. Also Capelin is actually red this is dyed black.<br /><br />ingredients list is as follows.<br />Capelin roes, salt, water, stabilizer (xanthan gum), spices, citric acid, sodium benzoate (0.1%) as preservative, FD&C Blue #1, Yellow #6, Red #40<br /><br />To test this product on a "caviar aficionado" i had one of my Russian friends try it and he said its "ok" but its very salty and tastes fishy. If you plan on using this as a topping for sushi then it would be fantastic.<br /><br />For the price its a good deal if you like salty briny fish.

review/summary: Wonderful Pop, Slightly Salty
review/text: This Capelin Caviar was really quite good--I ate it by itself and with some cream cheese and melba rounds--one of my favorite ways to eat caviar--and it mixed really well with the whipped cream cheese. I prefer cream cheese to creme fraiche, but I like both. The package was very carefully and thoughtfully packed, with ice packs and cushioning, so the product arrive in perfect condition. It came with a gorgeous little mother-of-pearl spoon, that, while fragile, is beautiful and will be something I look forward to using with guests. It was very pretty. I balked a bit at the shipping & handling price at first, but seeing the care they put into it and realizing it was packaged to keep the the caviar at the absolute best possible condition for shipping without excessive cost, it was worth it.<br /><br />If I had paid big bucks for this caviar, I might have been slightly disappointed--but only slightly--but at the price that is is, I'm totally impressed with the price vs. quality. It was just a 'touch' fishy smelling when I first opened it, but it was also not chilled (I had taken it from the packaging and couldn't wait to open it and see the quality until it chilled--and while it was shipped with ice packs, I live in Texas, and the packs were melted--BUT it wasn't burning hot/melting levels, which it very well could have been--it was just slightly warm) so it had a bit of a fishy smell to it, usually the sign of a poorer quality caviar. But after it chilled, there was no fishy smell to it at all. It was also quite salty--I realize anything with 620mg of sodium per serving is going to be salty, but there is overwhelming and then ordinary salty for caviar, and this one leaned to the 'saltier' side.<br /><br />All by itself, it's just a tad too salty for ordinary tastes. But mixed with the cream cheese or with the creme fraiche, it was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />It also has the nicest 'pop' to it, and that is my favorite part of caviar--that nice little pop to it. The color is quite deep, and it does stain a little, so you'll want to be careful with that. It's really quite gorgeous too, for decorating appetizers or amuse-bouche for guests. For me, I ate the entire jar in two sittings--it was really quite scrumptious. I ordered a smaller jar, because I wasn't sure of the quality, but now that I've ordered and am impressed, I will definitely be ordering a larger jar from them again in the future.<br /><br />If you're wanting a caviar for making a dish, for including in decoration for party platters or appetizers, this is a perfect cost-effective version to get. Definitely worth it. If you're wanting chilled caviar to be served all by itself and eaten straight, this works, but it's definitely obvious it's not as high of quality as some of the more expensive varieties. I did, however, eat it straight myself and enjoyed it--I just wouldn't necessarily use it for a party or dinner guests intended to eat it straight--but for recipes and appetizers, I think it's difficult to even tell the difference. Really good stuff.

review/summary: Superior taste!!!
review/text: I basically grew up eating fresh Caspian sturgeon and caviar, until it became scarce in 1980's.  Hence, I have first-hand knowledge of what the real stuff should look and taste like.<br /><br />This arrives neatly packaged in bubble/cardboard, in glass jars with metal lids, and label states it's a product of Island.  Shipping did not take long, only about 5 business days.<br /><br />The taste and smell is unbelievably the very same taste/smell of the real thing.  Texture is nice and pops, although quite a bit smaller than real stuff.  Overall, try the old Russian method of eating this:  Nice, firm slice of freshly baked white bread spread with butter - then thinly spread this caviar all over it.  This is the way we've always ate it, and the experience is unbeatable.  The worst thing you can do is put this on a dry, salty cracker.  Or, eat it in any other way for that matter.<br /><br />I ordered two jars at once and paid the same shipping, so it was $5 per jar.  I am planning to order a lot more, probably 5 jars at a time.  Supermarket sells real Osetra (sturgeon) caviar at $80 per 1.5 oz!!!!  American caviar at $45 for 3oz!!!  Come on guys, this is no rocket science - this stuff is the way to go.  From now on, I'm totally sold and a loyal customer!

review/text: I'm a big fan of caviar, but this is one of the saltiest I have ever tasted.  It's quite a disappointment after all the favorable reviews -- like eating a spoon of tiny black salt tablets.  The price is reasonable, but it doesn't make up for the taste.  It's not as bad if you spread it thinly, but that shouldn't be the case.

It's also much better than grocery store caviar, and the shipment arrived within 3 days of ordering!  The shipping speed was great, but I still think that $18 is incredibly overpriced for shipping costs.  Also, it DOES turn your poop green!

review/text: I love caviar, but can only have it once in a great while because of the expense.  My brother gave me a jar of this Season's brand capelin caviar from the cold waters of Iceland... and it was fantastic.  Some of the best caviar I've ever had and I've had some pretty expensive caviar.  When I discovered the price!  Well, I won't have to do without caviar any more.  The eggs are very small, firm, black, and just the right amount of saltiness.  Delicious.  I highly recommend this brand for anyone who loves caviar and enjoys that clean snap of fresh roe.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDJZEM">Season Black Capelin Caviar from Iceland, 3.5-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 4)</a>

Not that there were a billion ingredients in the product, but from what I read about caviar, I was expecting "capelin roe and salt"...not spices, citric acid, sodium benzoate, and other food coloring. Otherwise, you get what you paid for...fish eggs, ang plenty off it for a low(er) price. Maybe I can save enough money to try any of the big three (sevruga, beluga, or osetra).

These bags are not even a pound (.8 lbs) and each bags comes out to a whopping $10 apiece...that's crazy! A friend of hers was going to surprise her with some of these but when she saw how much they were she couldn't bring her self to pull the trigger.<br /><br />To give Toyhousedeals the benefit of the doubt, these are hard to find on the web and are very expensive if you do find them so that's my reason for giving them 4 stars instead of even lower - although they are still responsible for their high shipping chargers. Bottom line is the product is great and Toyhousedeals performed excellently, it's just about the price.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I have found a solution: Just google "black outback beans amish" and you will find the exact some product in a no-name version for less than half the price - even with shipping. You'll find these people great to work with too. Enjoy!

It was delivered promptly, was quite fresh, has a much more subtle taste, and was vouched for by several people writing reviews on a food recipe website.  What a difference it made in the recipe.  Not that the original flavorings weren't tasty, but i knew this was a more authentic flavoring.  I still haven't gotten up the nerve to tell my friend that her Moroccan-flavored Chicken Pizza isn't Moroccan; sometimes it's better to live to fight another day!

review/summary: Heavenly Blue Diamond Treat...
review/text: The coconut mixed with the almond is a better flavor to me than the plain almond.  I tolerate the almond milk, but the mixture of the almond/coconut has won my vote.  I have been trying to cut back on milk (and I LOVE milk), but this will be very helpful to me.  I also sometimes add a drop or two of Stevia to it and it really makes it palatable to me.  Everyone has unique tastes you might love it just plain. I sort of wondered IF I would be able to drink a package of 12 and when I opened the first carton I was very pleasantly surprised.  I have a winner and will incorporate it into my daily food plans. I also love the fact that the whole carton is just 240 calorie; and to use it as a base to make dessert of any kind or drink it with a meal, or just plain for a snack is very filling and is a far cry lower in calories than milk.  So for me personally it is a winner and I have no regrets in buying the Almond/Coconut.  I have put PB2 Peanut butter/Chocolate powder and Torani Vanilla flavoring in 2 cups of Almond/Coconut milk with a couple of drops of Stevia and added ice and blended it and you have a huge (very filling) milk shake type drink that is low calorie and wonderful. The sky is the limit with all the different things you can do with this 60 calorie cup of heaven's special treat from Blue Diamond Almond Coconut Milk.  :-)))

review/summary: Quality review
review/text: This product was so great and the taste of this product was delicious.  We even sent through door to door to cross the ocean for 30 days and still the quality was excellent.  As long we pack this product well.  The taste and quality never change.  By the way we even ship this product to the Phil. for our relatives over there.  And every member of the family really love this product. I will recommend to a lot of people to buy this product because it is really delicious and better than Mozzarella cheese.  Very good in pizza,chicken fettuccini,and a lot of Italian recipe.

review/summary: the most unappetizing of all appetizers
review/text: I have used caponata from Alessi, Cento, Paesano, Progresso & the Shop Rite brand and now Marco Polo. The first 5 were pretty good, but the Marco Polo was terrible. Taste, consistency appearance, all substandard.  I called Parthenon Foods and they agreed to refund the purchase price of the remaining 4 jars of the 5 ordered, but by the time I pay for shipping, I will have spent the entire cost of the order with nothing to show for my money, except a very bad taste in my mouth and my wallet...if wallets can taste.  I am going to donate my remaining jars of marco polo caponata to the homeless center and hope nobody dies as a result.  A thoroughly negative experience.

review/summary: Happy jelling
review/text: I was very happy to find several sources for bulk gelatin at amazon.  I enabled be to compare prices and pick the cheapest product.  Since I had been using Knox Gelatin for years I had no hesitation in ordering it.  The price was a great improvememt over that charged in a grocery store.  I much prefer measuring the amount of gelatin used in a recipe, rather than just emptying the  the packaged product.  The packages were reviewed several years ago, and it was found that the contents of the packages were not nedessarily aacurate.  I am very happy with the product.

review/summary: great item awful shipping price!
review/text: This is a very good food suppliment. It strengthens your nails and hair and connective tissue. I have been using it for over 10 years. However the price for shipping and handling is way too much!!!<br />You can get this in Walmarts for $7.24 8 oz I would not pay this shipping price in my opinion it is not right. Try Walmart.com. They are premeasured in the 8 oz box 32 packs so you can just pour it in your tea or hot water. This is powered it should be a lot less for not having to package it.

review/summary: Gelatin improves spinal disks
review/text: At the advice of my doctor, I've been taking unflavored gelatin daily for many years to strengthen spinal disks.  Various local sources of capsules, packets, and added-value gelatin in containers were an unnecessary expense of packaging and unwanted vitamins.  Fortunately  Knox unflavored gelatin in 1 lb. cans is available online.  I keep  a plastic teaspoon measuring spoon in the can to add gelatin to morning juice (drink before it thickens too much)or coffee (stir quickly so it won't clump up). In addition to strengthening spinal disks, my "paper" fingernails have hardened.  In addition, the gelatin is on hand for cooking purposes.  Ordering a year's worth at a time stretched shipping cost, also.<br /><br />Older woman

review/summary: Excellent taste... but a bit costly
review/text: The Mint Milano cookies are wonderful. They have a light and crispy texture with a mild mint chocolate taste. The flavor reminds me a lot of the chocolate mint Girl Scout cookies although the texture of the 2 cookies are very different (the girl scout cookie is much denser).<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies usually arrive with very few intact and several of mine were even broken into multiple pieces. They still taste pretty good though.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts copied from the actual package (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 2 cookies (25g/ 0.9oz)<br /><br />Servings per container about 8<br /><br />Calories per serving 130<br /><br />Calories from fat 70<br /><br />Total Fat 7g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br /><br />Sodium 65mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br /><br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamins A and C 0%<br /><br />Calcium 0%<br /><br />Iron 4%<br /><br />FYI, I purchased my cookies during 100 degree weather and except for some of the chocolate melting onto the inner wrapper the cookies were fine (I used 2 day shipping which might make a difference since the cookies weren't in the heat that long).<br /><br />At 15.88 for 4 bags of cookies the price per bag is 3.97 which is 48 cents more than the price printed on the cookie bag (3.49).

The mint adds a refreshing hint to the chocolate, which we like. These are nice to enjoy with tea as a midafternoon snack or something of the sort.

review/summary: OK, but not up to normal Milano standards.
review/text: I guess I should've known: I checked out the prices for the various permutations of the Milano brand name and this was the cheapest.  The cookies arrived in fair condition, with some of them broken already.  Slight breakage is okay, since we break them up to eat them anyway.  However, when they are broken to the point of powder, they become useless.  I believe that these were overbaked or the mix failed.  There was a powdery texture to the cookie instead of the smooth surface.  It's a subtle difference but the 'Milano' experience is very specific.  At these prices, they better be perfect.  These cookies weren't.<br /><br />I know Pepperidge Farm products; my parents lived in Norwalk, CT near their factory.  I have shopped at the company store.  What's amazing is that their products are perfectly good at the expiration date or even one year later.  However, in the case of the product above, they were not good right out of the factory and thus they were discounted.

review/summary: Classic Cookies
review/text: All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that.

review/text: A tasty treat for those who remember what these were like when they used to sell them in the stores, now I can't find this one, but they have the double chocolate, mint, and other random flavors that I don't find quite as appealing.<br /><br />Note that this is a pack of four, but still expensive for such - probably designed to extract the emotional value from people like me. Considering the other kinds can be had for far cheaper at Target... I can do without these for a while again, especially as most of us don't eat through these fast enough to get through four packs by the due date.

review/text: The cookies were delicious, chrisp and whole. I can only say they did not last long.  Pepperidge Farm Mint Milano is the only cookie I realy enjoy and would eat a lot off.  The others, even in Peppridge Farm I would only eat one or two.  But I have found that the Mint Milano is hard to get.  Pepperidge Farm should try selling in Canada and Jamaica,  West Indies.  I actually live in Jamaica, W.I. and can not get Mint Milano there so I either ask friends to buy it for me or buy it on line.  Would recommend this cookie for all those people that like a lite combination of mint and chocolate.
