review/summary: Shade Grown - Save a Tree!...Organic...Smooth...Good Buy
review/text: Camano Island Shade grown and organic coffee not only produces a wonderful and flavorful cup of java but saves trees from being chopped down as well. The Medium Colombia coffee is excellent in both taste and aroma.It is exactly as advertised:"..the perfect combination of nuttiness, sweet caramel tones, along with a touch of spice on the undertone. Your tastebuds will thank you for the rich experience with every sip...." Nice for breakfast or an afternoon pick-me-up as well.Slightly bitter-sweet, I would recommend it to those who love the taste of a real cup of coffee. I found it better then the more expensive designer labels, and this 80oz bag is a truly good buy. The few shade grown/organic coffees at my local market are very high priced in comparison.<br /><br />But as with the other Camano Island coffees I have tried, I was disappointed with the packaging. It arrived in a heavy-weight clear plastic bag. Not very environmentally friendly. Also, it is very hard to keep sealed. It has one of those cheap sticky tabs you pull over to reseal and at that it is not very sticky.By the second use it wasn't working. I transferred my coffee into the largest Tupperware bowl I could find(80 oz is a lot of coffee) to keep it fresh.<br /><br />5 stars for the coffee - minus 1 star on the packaging.. I love it and would buy it again, but Camano Islands - if you are listening- please improve the packaging.<br /><br /> I also enjoyed :<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9SN4A">Organic Camano Island Coffee Roasters Sumatra, Medium Roast, Ground, 80-Ounce Bag</a> - a real eye-opener with a bold rich taste.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy....Laurie

review/text: These are very healthy, natural treats for your dog. About the size of a McDonald's hamburger, but they are really hard. My dog eats them fine, but smaller dogs may like them broken in half at least. They come just wrapped in plastic, so you will want to store them in a ziploc or container after you open the individual packs.<br /><br />They are a bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it for such a healthy treat.

review/summary: Great treat; really poor product description
review/text: If my dog is any indicator this may be the best dog treat there is. It is made in Texas -not China - has pretty wholesome ingredients and from my experience is not unreasonably expensive and the dog loves them. They are crisp and snap easily into smaller pieces if necessary. Now about that product description... it says "Pack of 5" and shows 5 Merrick Chicken Steak Patties just like they would look unwrapped from the pack. The problem is that at $60.99 this comes to about $12.00 per patty which IS unreasonably expensive. Ok, so maybe what they mean is that there are 5 of these 5 packs which would be about $2.40 per patty. This is still more than twice as much as they charge for them retail at the local pet food store. In the product description it says the product weighs 1 lb. Well, one 5 pack weighs 2.5 oz. so 5 would only weigh 12.5 oz. The shipping weight is listed as 4.5 lbs!!! I just don't understand how this can possibly be correct. If you are brave enough to ignore this questionable product description and try this purchase you will get a great dog treat but if you end up paying more than $1.00 per patty you should just buy from the retail pet food stores next time.

review/summary: In need of better quality control
review/text: I've tried four different flavors of the hint water, and -- when the quality is up -- it's excellent.  However I've received two batches that were off:  the pear I bought in individual bottles at the store was good; but the pack from Amazon was pretty much tasteless.  Worse, though, is that the second pack of watermelon I purchased tasted vaguely moldy or musty.  Being a procrastinator, we received our next monthly shipment before I cancelled the subscription, and I can say that the new pack is good.  However, with both the "musty" pack and the "good" pack in hand, the difference becomes even more apparent.  For example the "good" pack has a definite fruit scent when the bottle is opened; the "musty" pack has no fruit odor at all.  Checking the dates the new pack expires about a week after the "musty" pack, so I would guess that a filter got changed at the factory or something.  (Note, however, that both dates are in March of 2013; the "musty" pack is definitely not expired despite tasting like something has started growing in it.)<br /><br />So while the product is great when it's on, the quality control is decidely lacking (all three bottles I've opened from the "musty" pack are identical; I doubt they're the only 'bad' bottles from the batch).  For the price, I'm not interested in taking chances that it'll be undrinkable when it arrives.

review/summary: Not really my thing, I guess
review/text: I was rather intrigued by this, as it promised "water, not sugar". That's good, since there's far too many flavored beverages out there that are pretty much glorified sugar water. I also liked that it would have a taste (aka "hint") of flavor, but that it wouldn't be the main focus of the beverage. This just didn't deliver like I wanted it to.<br /><br />There is barely a hint of watermelon in the water, at least to my palate. I'm willing to say that this is probably due to personal taste, but I really had to focus on the water to pick up the watermelon here. (So if you're planning on having this with a meal, forget it. I had this by itself and had trouble picking out the flavors.) What I did taste just didn't remind me all that much of watermelon, at least not good watermelon. It reminds me of the type of melon that you get that ended up sitting on the supermarket shelf for a little too long.<br /><br />This just wasn't for me. I don't require a strong flavor out of my waters and I wasn't really expecting it to be strong. I was expecting to taste watermelon and I just didn't get this here. I might try the other flavors, but this just wasn't all that great.

The others tasted like the melted ice left over after drinking juice.  For me, this was not pleasant.  It was not enough flavor to taste like anything but too much to make you feel like you were drinking clean refreshing water.  The watermelon flavor was the only one that was drinkable.  It seemed a tiny bit stronger than the others.  All in all, I would drink it if there was no choice but I don't think I would seek it out.

review/summary: HINT ---- Simply the best bottled beverage.
review/text: I started drinking Hint Water a few years ago when Smartwater discontinued its similar line of no-calorie, no-artificial-sweetners, lightly flavored waters.  I find that I drink a lot more water during the day with these than with filtered water.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and refreshing ---- just a tiny hint of flavoring.  No syrupy flavor like all the trendy "fitness drinks" out there and no carbonation or harmful artificial sweetners like with diet soda.<br /><br />I was an absolute Diet Coke junkie for fifteen years until I found this product.  No hyperbole ---- it's literally the only thing that I can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from Diet Coke.  It might seem a bit pricey, but for my health I think it is worth every penny.  I just wish they would stock a larger size so I wouldn't feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles.  Also, this may seem a small point but I am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me.  I always get compliments when I hand these out to guests ---- both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon.  They are very subtle.  My husband's favorite is the honeydew-hibiscus.  I like it, too, but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this product highly enough.

I keep finding I have drinken the whole bottle and didn't even realize it.<br /><br />What some people obviosly DON'T like about it, is that it is NOT a flavored water.

Whatever it is, I enjoy it, and I drink a lot more when I have those. It is pricey, so I use them as a treat for myself.

review/summary: Least favorite of the hint water flavors
review/text: I've tried several of the Hint Essence Water flavors so I always get excited when I see a new flavor.  These drinks are basically water with a hint of natural fruit flavor.  They have no calories or added sugar (or artificial sweetener) so they are great for someone who is watching their calories and trying to avoid artificial sweetener while still seeking out great flavors.  They really are true to the hint name.  They taste more like a water lightly infused with fruit than a strong fruit juice.<br /><br />Sadly, this was my least favorite of all the flavors.  I liked it the least because while the other flavors like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTP12K">Hint Essence Water Pear, 16-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTL2QE">Hint Essence Water Honeydew Hibiscus, 16-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> taste true to the natural flavors they are named after this one tasted pretty artificial.  It reminded me more of a Fruit 2 O drink.  I'd recommend it only if the artificial nature of the flavor doesn't bother you.  Otherwise I'd recommend the Pear and Honeydew Hibiscus flavors over this one.<br /><br />If trying this water taught me anything it's that the flavors can be hit or miss so I think I would definitely not order a case of a flavor without having tried it first.

review/text: I've been taking Salba Oil Omega 3 Gelcaps for over a year now.  Amazon is the most reasonable in price and delivers on time.  This product has helped keep my diabetes in good shape (I'm not too faithful with my diet).  My blood results for both diabetes and cardiology have been staying in proper alignment.

review/summary: salba a new trend
review/text: I had read an ad in my local newspaper for salba. After checking some info thru Google I ordered some.Maybe I am wrong but i feel the salba has increased my energy. I take salba instead of fish oil. I take flaxseed oil caps also.salba is a bit pricey so i am taking 2 a day instead of 3.I am glad to have started using it.

review/summary: Great company and service- unfortunate product
review/text: Ordered flavor ice for my kids that were under the weather and wanted an old school ice pop.<br />Sadly the box arrived with the packages inside all broken up and spilled out. Very sticky, and messy to say the least<br /> I called customer service and in a moments time they understood and refunded me the whole amount. Although this item was a bust, the company is worth buying from again, easily!  Any one can do things right, but the company's true strength is shown when things don't  go smoothly. They were champs!

review/text: I purchased the 24 count "Giant Fla-Vor-Ice" from a Publix Grocery Store for $1.69 a pack.  The word Giant and real fruit juice was the reasons for the purchase.  I should have read the box more carefully.  The pops are in a 1.5 ounce size tube and I remember them being much larger as a teenager. Products seem to get smaller while the price continues to increase.

review/summary: Dangerous
review/text: I bought a carton of these popsicles from Costco ( not from this supplier) and they gave my two year old son massive allergies on his face, eyes and body. When we digged deeply into the reasons for this reaction, we saw that they use red-40, yellow 5, yellow 6 and blue 1 dyes in the product. If you search on the net you will find that there are volumes on why these dyes should be avoided by children and adults. We stopped and my son recovered very quickly.<br /><br />This review is about the product and not the seller. I mean them well but they need to know what they are supporting.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00290W1CY">Flavor Ice Pops 200 Count Variety Box</a>

review/text: First, I Love that it is organic.  The orange has the most flavor and has a nice texture on both sides. Some of the others are sticky on one side and smooth on the other, which has a weird mouthfeel.  I Love orange vitamin C & this gives me the same kind of brightening experience. A new staple snack. :-) Plus, I think that I saw something about Kaia Foods assisting women in poverty, need to check into it. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Mmmm yummy :)
review/text: So I was looking for more snacks and got the gummies. Was pleased to get this earlier than I imagined. I have been looking to lose weight and try and live healthier in general and know fruits are good to try and these low fat gummies can really help me lose weight. I am not at all diabetic and tried the fruit before too I think, along with the mandarins oranges (kind of like those). This is tasty and I want to try this flavor more often. I just have to start being responsible when it comes to my weight and my cholesterol. Not that I am an overeater just am happy to get something sweet that isn't as fattening but very good to have around when I get hungry. I get hungry and reach for more. Very flavorful. I couldn't be happier and I eat candy and sweet things whenever I want so I know what I'm talking about. Do try if you are searching for snacks or candy you want to make sure you have a bag. It's so unique of a flavor and in a good way not like anything you wouldn't really enjoy the flavor is amazingly good.

review/text: These gummies are the most delicious I have tasted. Compared to their American counterparts, these are practically the real fruit. Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.<br />The lychee gummies are no exception. They have the aroma and pleasant aftertaste the fruit has with the hint of tanginess--they taste a hint more like the fresh kind than the canned, for those of you that have had both.

review/text: These are nice because they have a subtle flavor, but I like the flavor to linger on such a mild candy.  I really like Kasugai Litchi (Lychee) Hard Candies better.  This is a nice gummy candy because it does not stick to teeth.  I really like Lychee fruit like the other person.  I have had them at restaurants.  Orange Flavor gummies are really better because they are more intense flavor and that is what I like in a gummy I have decided.

review/text: I urge you to buy this herb if you do not already have it in your kitchen cabinets. Its a great milder tasting herb that I find myself using often. Even if you don't do a great deal of cooking, you will find yourself using this and the quantity being sold fills a standard sized spice jar. Its not a huge amount and you will end up having used it and not throwing it out because it got too old.<br />  I was very pleased to see that Barry Farms carried this, my local health food store where I buy all my other herbs, doesn't carry this one.<br />  I was even more pleased when my shipment arrived and I saw how fresh and fragrent it was.<br />  Make sure when you order that it is being shipped directly from Barry Farms<br />and not from a second dealer. Shipping costs will be dictated by how far you live from Ohio.<br />shipping costs can be held down by ordering say, two or three more things, much more<br />than that and the shipping charge doubles! Its well worth it-their charges for the items are so modest and their selection of items that can be ordered is so vast you<br />will have no problem finding more things to pad out your order!<br />  I have no connection to the company, but I am an enthusiastic repeat customer!

review/summary: Stop the presses: make your own on the cheap
review/text: I make my own percolator filters and they work fine.  And mine are dirt cheap.<br /><br />I simply buy a stack of normal basket-type filters at the grocery store.  When I get home, I clamp the stack of filters tightly together and, using a Forstner bit, I drill a 3/8 inch hole through the center of the whole stack.  I suppose a normal drill bit would work, but I've never tried that.<br /><br />A few filters on the top of the stack tend to get ripped up, but that's not a big deal.<br />The filter with the hole in the center nestles nicely into the moistened perc basket and the lid fits on top like it normally does.  This method stops 99% of the mud from getting into my coffee and makes cleaning out the perc basket a breeze.<br /><br />I used to make the hole each morning in the basket filter using a single-hole paper punch, but that got a little tedious.

For best results, just remember to damp the filter with water after you place the filter inside the percolator.<br /><br />For those who don't want to purchase 2,400 of these filters through Amazon, one can order single packages of them (containing 100 filters per package) from their local Ace Hardware store.  If your Ace Hardware store doesn't carry it, just ask a clerk and they can special order it from their warehouse, and it will arrive at the store within three business days.  There's no extra charge to special order them from an Ace Hardware store.  The price I paid at Ace Hardware was only $1.39 + tax for a package of 100 filters.

Turns out the coffee pot we got doesn't really need filters, and the water backs up a bit with a filter being used.  Still, it does what it says, and its a good bargain for the volume.

review/summary: Melitta 3.5 in. Coffee Filters
review/text: This is the second time we have ordered this item for our Percolator and it works very well.  The filter stops the fine grounds from getting into the percolated coffee.  It also makes it easier to dump out the grounds.

review/summary: Lifetime supply of filters
review/text: There's not much to say - they are coffee filters... Been using a Melita electric percolator for fifteen years and my stores no longer carry the filters; this box ought to outlast the coffee maker. :) Seriously - 2400 filters is a lot, but they don't go bad or anything. I just tucked the box (approx 10" square) in the back of the pantry.<br />For best results, put a filter in the basket and then wet it down before adding coffee grounds. Dump into the compost bin when done.<br />Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised.

review/summary: Very Satisfied with performance and the price
review/text: I originally paid much more for these when I ordered a single 100 pack. I paid much more for the wrap around filters as well. I found that in my particular coffee pot (Farberware Yosemite) these disc filters are superior for both simplicity and price to the wrap arounds. 2400 pots of coffee at less than a penny each pot for the filter works for me. You might see a few grounds in the pot depending on the grind. I grind my beans fairly fine from whole bean, and I use a coffee strainer for the pour. If I leave the last teaspoon of coffee in the cup I never encounter grinds. I'm tempted to say that this is a lifetime of coffee filters, but I'm happy to say that I really don't think so.

review/summary: NOT good in presto percolator
review/text: I tried using these filters in a Presto percolator. Even with less coffee, only 4 scoops, the brew basket overflowed and washed a lot of the grounds out the top. With other pots they may work but not the Presto 12 cup. Too bad - the wrap around filters are a pain.<br /><br />Amazon only sent 1 pack of 100 filters. When notified they refunded the money for the filters they didn't send. This worked out in my favor because of the above. I am glad I don't have 2400 filters that don't work in the pot - 100 is plenty. I bought so many because a friend, who must have a very different percolator said they work for him. He almost got 2300 filters for Christmas!

review/summary: Greatest Hot Cocoa Ever!
review/text: After hearing rumors about full fat, dutch processed cocoa powder, and sick to death of the anemic offerings by Hershey's, etc., I took a chance and ordered the 1kg bag of the Callebaut brand of dutch processed cocoa.  They sent me this brand instead, along with a note stating it's the exact same product, just different packaging.<br /><br />I use this stuff *exclusively* to make hot cocoa, using 2% milk and either dark brown sugar or  blue agave syrup, depending on my mood.  Trust me; I'll NEVER go back to regular cocoa again.  The dark chocolate contains more antioxidants and is more flavorful than the bleached Hershey's offerings, and I use less than half the sugar one would normally put in cocoa (about two tablespoons per 10oz mug).<br /><br />My recipe: Into 12oz warm milk (just past drinking temperature, NEVER boiled) add two tablespoons dark cocoa powder, and 1-2 tablespoons (level) dark brown sugar (to taste) OR one tablespoon agave syrup.  Stir.  Add vanilla or cinnamon if desired (not required).<br /><br />A much healthier, and MUCH TASTIER alternative to the powder packets on sale at the supermarket.<br /><br />Starbucks wishes it had cocoa this good.  **IT DOESN'T**

review/text: I made my mouse with this instead of Hershey's special dark cocoa, it mixed more smoothly and the mouse was great.  It was not as dark as the Hershey's in-between the regular cocoa that I make milk chocolate mouse with and the special dark chocolate that I make the dark mouse with.  The recipe is so easy, its on the special dark cocoas box.  2/3 cups of cocoa, 1 cup sugar, 1 pkg gelatin (mix 1/4 cup of water with gelatin,& add 1/3 cup boiling water to it) 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 cups of heavy cream.  ( I use 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2). You just add the cocoa, sugar (reg or Splenda) the vanilla & mix on low - then add the cream until it is stiff or peaking - add the gelatin mixture and pour into containers!  refrigerate for 1/2 hour and enjoy!

It makes me feel good knowing there's a lot less sugar,  but I do wonder about the fat content as it seems a lil bit on the high side.  This stuff is the good stuff.

Ok, so it's a soup base, I can kind of work with that.  Second ingredient... Mono-Sodium Glutamate, or other words MSG.  That means there is more MSG in the box then any other ingredient, except for of course, salt.  Tried to return it but policy prohibits it, so jokes on me :)  The disodium inosinate and disodium succinate aren't even recognized by the spell checking, but they are in there too ;) Looking forward to finding some without all the added chem, it actually sounds like a wonderful product without the "added touches."
