review/summary: Best food for our baby
review/text: We tried several different formulas for our baby and this is the one that we all like. We like that it is organic and that the price for it is the best we can find. Amazon's price for the 31.75 oz cans is the same as the price for the 24 oz cans at our local retailer.

review/summary: great organic milk
review/text: I love this formula. It's organic and I don't have to worry about the harmful pesticides (in what the cows eat) and added hormones. My baby had no problems transitioning into this formula and it doesn't smell like other formulas. I no longer have to hold my breathe when washing baby's bottle. It also dissolves so much easier than the other formulas that I have tried.

review/summary: Izzie loves Earth's Best!
review/text: After being exclusively breastfed for four months, making the transition to the bottle was really hard. We tried Enfamil and Izzie didn't like it, it made her gassy, and she was throwing up a lot. We looked at all the formulas available at our local Babies R Us and we settled on Earth's Best Organic formula. It was quite the change from the Enfamil - it actually looked and smelled like milk! She took to it right away and now loves it! The best part, she isn't throwing up after every meal and she is less gassy than ever! We will never use another formula!

review/summary: Charlie's Choice
review/text: My 7month old daughter is the reviewer here..  As much as I preferred breastmilk we came to a point where she no longer took and I no longer produced.  Babys Only is another preference, but cost and availability became an issue.  Little Charlie seems quite content with her EB!  A growing gorgeous gal see use for rice cereal, bottles and it is the staple in our home.<br />As a newborn I was floored hospitals and major programs pushed Similac- poor Charlie we thought had colic (we had to supplement here and there) but no it was horrid digestive issues with these chemical additives..... Am grateful for Earths Best!!!!

review/summary: My son loves this formula....
review/text: After trying multiple formulas, we finally found a formula that my son tolerates (doesn't spit up!) A doctor had said that he was suffering from mild reflux which I didn't fully believe and we tried a rice formula and he would spit almost half of it back up. Trusting my instinct I decided to research organic formulas and found Earth's Best. You do need to mix it with warm water in order for it to fully dissolve and shake well - you don't get a lot of excess foam with the shaking. I haven't had any issues with it at all. Now that he's been eating solids, I cook his food but buy Earth's Best jarred food for hard to find fruits and veggies.

review/summary: Probiotics?
review/text: I really like this formula for my daughter.  She is my third child and I fed the older two Nestle (now Gerber) Good Start.  I was feeding my third GS as well but really wanted to feed her Organic milk.  My daughter has transitioned to Earth's Best very easily from a drinkability standpoint.  She doesn't refuse it - in fact, she will do breast and bottle very easily.  The only complaint I have is that she doesn't go poo as often as she does with GS.  GS does have probiotics in it and I'm not sure that Earth's Best has it or enough of it.  I wish it did...  If she were going poo more regularly, I would give the formula a 5 star rating.

review/text: The Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula is a good product. As our pediatrician had told us, there is no significant difference amongst the infant formulas. When our pediatrician's kids were infants, they would get whatever formula was the least expensive. While Earth's Best is not the cheapest, it is priced competitively, and most importantly is conveniently delivered to our door. No complaints from our daughter. :-)

review/summary: Best Formula Ever!
review/text: When my son was born I tried a couple of the well-known formulas but he did not take them well.  Since I really had wanted to breast-feed I decided the best alternative would be an organic formula.  Found this first at my local health food store.  It was VERY expensive but I tried it anyway.  He took it very well right from the beginning so I set out to find it cheaper elsewhere.  Amazon.com had the best price I could find online.  I love the subscribe and save.  I don't even have to remember to re-order as they send it automatically when I'm getting low.  Best formula ever!  Thanks, Amazon.com!

review/summary: Nice product, helped my daughter's reflux
review/text: I had previously been feeding my daughter Similac Organic, but after their recall of their powder products it was difficult for me to find the Organic formula in the liquid form, so I needed to switch brands. I chose Earth's Best and have been extremely happy with that choice. My daughter really likes it and she rarely spits up anymore since I switched. She has reflux and takes medication for it but the difference has been dramatic since she started eating the Earth's Best formula.

review/summary: Great Formula for my picky baby!
review/text: My daughter was exclusively breastfed until she was 6 months. We tried weaning her earlier, but she refused other formulas we tried. She would hold out refusing to eat until she got breast milk. When we tried Earths Best, she took to it right away. She hasn't had any digestion problems with this formula. It is expensive compared to generic, but worth it!

review/summary: Baby loves it!
review/text: We switched over to Earth's Best when Similac had their big recall a couple of months ago.  The first thing we noticed when we switched was that she spit up a lot less and her gas was not as frequent.  Some of the reviews mention that the formula is prone to not dissolving as well but all you have to do is shake it up for 3 or 4 more seconds than the name brand stuff.  Also, when bought in the 4 pack on Amazon it makes it just as affordable as buying at Costco or Sam's and you have the bonus of knowing you are giving your baby a premium alternative to breast milk (which my wife can not produce anymore.)

review/summary: Great deal for amazing product!
review/text: I was weary at first to order this because after reading the reviews I noticed that some people noticed that they were disappointed in how long it took for them to get it. Some mentioned it took up to a week and half for a 2 day shipping. I went ahead and decided to order here on amazon because it is the best price I have found. I planned ahead and bought her a can to make sure she wouldn't run out while we waited for the order. I was very surprised to find that it took very little time after all. It took a few days to process the order and then less than twos days for it to get me after that. I am very pleased and satisfied with my order and with amazon. This really is the best deal around. I live in an area where her formula is hard to find. It is more expensive here than in other cities. Also you cannot find the 20% cans here either. I am very very excited and pleased with this. I will definably continue to order my daughter's formula through amazon. I am also very pleased with the amazon mom program.

review/summary: A fantastic formula
review/text: I chose this formula after reading the reviews and I haven't regretted it. We first chose Similac and then switched to Enfamil for fussy and gassy babies and I didn't like either (the first ingredient in Enfamil is corn syrup!).  My baby was still fussy and had terrible gas (he would cry and scream when passing gas or pooping).  I supplement my [...] milk with the formula but wanted a formula that was good and didn't create a lot of gas in my little one.  You will love this formula!  My baby no longer has those gas issues (and I know that disappears as they get older but we started him on this formula when he was 4 weeks old).

review/summary: Great formula
review/text: We are supplementing breast milk using this formula.  Our little guy likes it very much.  This bonus can size is quite a bit of formula, and I like that we don't need to get more formula every week.<br /><br />Our only "complaint" is that it is a bit difficult to dissolve fully.  If we shake it enough to dissolve it all, our son has more spit-ups than usual.  We started to make 12 oz at a time ahead of needing it and use a stick blender to mix it fully. We let it sit for a bit, and everything is great!

review/text: Our 2-month old baby has been on this formula and breast milk since birth. I do agree with a few of the other reviews that it does take some vigorous shaking to totally dissolve the formula.  We only use boiled water and then let it sit a while to cool down and let the bubbles settle. Shipping does take a while so be sure not to leave it to the last minute.  This is a better deal than Subscribe and Save!

review/summary: Very happy with this formula
review/text: I'm very happy with this formula. We were feeding Similac Advantage to our baby until the recall and then shifted to this after some trial and error. Similac was our choice only because we were introduced to it at the hospital and as first time parents didn't know any better (and since our baby was mostly on breastmilk until the recall we didn't look around much either), though I liked Similac better than other brands sold in the stores -- I always tasted the formulas, some that I bought after the recall as replacements were just disgusting. This one actually tastes good as normal milk powder does if you ever tasted that, I'm glad I stumbled upon it after getting on the internet and researching the formulas. The baby likes it very much as well and the price is great considering the big size of the can. Plus you don't need to run around the stores to find the one and only that sells it. There is no way I'm shifting back to Similac!

I breastfed my baby for almost 8 months and was looking very hard for an organic formula that had all the good stuff in it and was tolerable for baby. The switchover was very easy, he took a few weeks of mixing both breastmilk and formula and then it was no problem at all for him. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a good organic formula with DHA/ARA.

review/text: We've been using this formula since our little one was three months old and she's now almost ten months.  She does get constipated sometimes, but I don't know if that's the formula or the solid foods or just her system.  We tried Similac Organic prior to this and that was VERY constipating!  This is much better and not as grainy as Similac.  The cheapest way to buy this is through Amazon on their subscribe and save program.  Of course conventional is cheaper, but I don't want to compromise my infant's health by giving her formula that can have pestisides, hormones, and genetically modified ingredients!  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone using formula.

review/summary: Love this formula!
review/text: Feeding my baby formula wasn't my first choice, but breastfeeding ended up not working out for me (wasn't able to produce enough so I really didn't have much choice).  So I was glad to find an organic formula that was affordable!  And using Amazon.com's Subscribe and Save program makes it even more affordable.  I get diapers and wipes for my son through that too and it does save me a lot of money.  Anyhow, he loves the formula (the regular milk based one) and is thriving!  I wish I could make his formula as I do his pureed baby food, but I guess this is the next best thing.  And it makes me feel better knowing it's organic and probably as close to nature as possible formula wise.

review/text: I supplement with this formula and my baby loves it.  Subscribe and save is the best deal, otherwise it is just about the same as other vendors.  This is a fantastic quality product, even after the reformulation.  The powder dissolves best in warmer water and will clump if exposed to air for too long.

review/text: I switched to Earth's Best organic after doing a lot of research on baby formula when my son was 5 month old. Junior used to poop every 2 or 3 days and got constipated too. After putting him on Earth's Best, he became a daily pooper and no constipation any more! I strongly recommended this great formula!

review/summary: The best organic choice
review/text: We left the hospital using Similac AdvanceShield but it is important to us that our son's formula be organic.  We switched to Similac Organic.  That product is more widely available (including at [...]) and that was attractive to us.  However, our son became very constipated and his stool became dry and rabbit pellet-like!  We were also concerned with the type of sugar that Similac Organic contains.  Finally, when mixed from powder we found that formula grainy. We switched to Earth's Best and the consipaton resolved quickly and we love how it mixes up.  This is the best choice in organic formulas!

review/summary: Formula has changed for worse
review/text: This formula along with a whole bunch of other "Organic" formulas are made by PBM [...]<br />They recently changed their formulation, and have not changed the packaging, so you must watch your cans carefully for the ingredients change. My baby knew the formula was different and refused the new cans, got really gassy too.<br />I've called PBM Organics twice, first time they denied the change of formula. Second time they admitted it.<br /><br />The cans do not say anything like new formula or give you any indication of this. Whey is no longer the first ingredient, and Corn syrup solids is very high on the list.<br /><br />Very shady practices by PBM. Beware.

review/summary: Organic with Hexane and corn syrup?
review/text: Earth's Best is what I fed my baby after breastfeeding. I am a label reader and noticed they are sneaking 'organic glucose' into the formula. I don't care if the glucose is organic or not - it's CORN SYRUP! Addictive, cheap, non-nutritious corn syrup. The fourth ingredient, no less. In addition, the DHA/ARA is derived from a process that involves Hexane - a possible neurotoxin. Earth's Best claims that testing shows no traces of Hexane in the formula but that is not good enough for me or my baby. Why bother adding an ingredient that requires a process that uses poison when there are other alternatives? Not a good call, Earth's Best 'organic'. I am switching to Organic 'Baby's Only' formula.

review/summary: Good formula but fishy!
review/text: I desperately wanted my son to be exclusively breastfed, but lots of issues resulted in us having to supplement with formula from the time he was a week old.  He's now a month old and eats mostly breastmilk but has 1-2 bottles per day of earth's best.<br /><br />Pros: the formula does not seem to make him gassy, constipated, or otherwise uncomfortable.  He doesn't mind the taste and goes back and forth between this formula and breastmilk without complaint.  And, it's organic, which was a must for us.<br /><br />Cons: it stinks!!!!  I assume it's from the fish-derived DHA.  This really is the only con.  And it tastes absolutely nothing like breastmilk.  That said, my son doesn't seem to mind,  and that's what's most important.

review/summary: Our son does not like it, for now at least
review/text: For 4 days at the hospital, our son had Enfamil. We went home and switched him to this Earth's Best Organic. He started fussing and crying all day long. Two days later, we switched him back to the non-organic Enfamil and he was fine again.<br /><br />At 1 month old, we tried Earth's Best Organic again. Same problem. Baby starts crying soon after feeding with or without Mylicon so we went back to Enfamil again.<br /><br />We have 3 more Earth's best cans sitting there for now. They won't expire soon since they're not opened yet.<br />Baby is almost three months now and we'll try again later cause we do want him to get the Organic stuff. Perhaps his digestive system will develop some more and in a few more months, he can do the organic again.<br /><br />I wonder if Enfamil has some addictive stuff in it or, if there's something in Earth's best that just does not agree with our son.

review/text: I was sad when I wasn't able to breastfeed anymore when I became pregnant again(lost my supply) and picking a formula was hard. After much research I found Earth's Best organics to be a very easily accessible organic formula, the transition was easy and my baby has no trouble digesting it. It's great choice you can feel good about giving your baby. I would recommend it for any mom who is unable to breastfeed, but if your baby's not here yet and you're looking at formulas, remember 'breast is best' and always try that first.

review/summary: Good Product, Bad Amazon
review/text: First off I want to say I have been nothing but happy with this formula for my baby!!! I had always used Similac in the past for my two first children but with the resent recall I decided to try something else for my third. My cousin had used Earth's Best Organic Formula for her baby and had been very happy with it so it was a brand I was familiar with. It also seemed only natural to go with an organic formula since the rest of our household drinks organic milk. I saw that Amazon had it on sale making it cheaper than other brands with the free shipping. This brings me to what I'm unhappy about...<br />Sadly my little guy gave up breast feeding rather abruptly forcing me to turn to bottle feeding. I tried pumping but he was plowing through my supple faster then I could produce it so I ordered this formula from Amazon. I signed up for their new amazon-mom program which allowed me to get free second day shipping (which was how fast I needed it). 3 days after ordering it I got an email (from amazon, not ups) saying the shipment had been delayed and it should arrive 3 days later ... over a week and a half later the package finally arrived. I was pretty upset because this forced me to go to our local store to by other formula which is very pricey since I live on an island. Amazon offered no apology or compensation for the extremely late package. Sadly this is not the first time I've run into this problem with Amazon not shipping things when they say they will, and items arriving far past when they "guaranty" they will. I think I've finally had enough though and learned my lesson not to order from Amazon if you want anything in a reasonable amount of time. Diapers.com has the same product, free shipping and their orders get here when they say they will!<br /><br />All in all GREAT product, I highly recommend it! DON'T order it through Amazon thought!!!

I'm guessing you can blame the added glucose syrups along with my S&S has been going up in price. From 82 to 97 dollars. I hate feeling taking advantage of just because I want the best for my LO. Shame on them for a shitty practice.<br /><br />BTW:<br /><br />Slighty same nutritional value as Walmart's Parent's Choice Organic Formula. Only difference I saw was a slightly higher calcium. I didn't go through the list one by one in ingredient but it is safe to say that they all come from the same manufacture. I will grab a can to find out.<br /><br />$62 dollars for a 4 pack compared to $97.

review/summary: Clumpy and gives your baby nasty-face
review/text: My wife and I purchased this because we wanted to go organic with our baby formula and at the time, our baby seemed a little more gassy than usual. First of all, both Earth's Best regular and sensitivity formulas are incredibly hard to mix. And even when it does finally "mix" it is easy to see the grains left in the formula, not to mention loads of bubbles. So when you have a hungry infant, the last thing you can manage is a formula that could take you minutes upon minutes to shake up. As for the reaction my baby had to it, nasty face is the best description. He did NOT like the taste of this formula. He would scrunch up his face like he was drinking sauerkraut juice or something, and try his best to bear it. But I certainly couldn't. I tasted a little and noticed it had no sweetness and was very unpleasant, which is probably due to it being sensitivity formula, but come on. And another note about Earth's Best in general, it seems like their product is more about being organic than it is about producing a quality product. We tried the regular for a while and my baby's poos became hard and he became constipated. I also noticed that he became hungry so much sooner, most likely due to Glucose being the sugar, instead of Lactose, which is supposed to help digest the milk proteins. We are back to a non-organic formula, which is unfortunate, but I view Earth's Best formula as an inferior product with an organic label slapped on. And that is not good enough for my baby.

review/summary: The best formula!
review/text: I got pregant again when my son was 6 months and my breastmilk stopped coming in when he was 7 months. I started him on this formula and we have had no gas problems, no constipation issues, and he has only been sick twice (and for only a few days each time). He just turned one and is challenging us with a switch to organic whole milk...so, I am here to order more. I could not ask for a better organic formula and I feel I am providing him with the best nutrition possible in this formula if he cannot breastfeed. We tried a couple other brands of regular and organic formula early on and I was suprised that he did not like them. We tried to use them because they were free, but I ended up giving them to my sisters who do not use organic and their babies are sick a lot and one is constipated all the time.

review/summary: My baby developed lump in breast when using this product.
review/text: I decided at 12 months to supplement my breastmilk with what I thought was the cleaner formula option on the market.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the use of soy in this product could have a negative impact on my kiddo.  My 15 month old daughter developed a lump in her left breast during the time I was giving her this product.  I brought her to my "green" pediatrition and he suggested I take her off from soy to see what would happen.  The lump went away, as did this product from our home.  I started to supplement with goats milk and we have had no further issues.  I know that this won't be every person's experience but for parents who are trying to do their research, know that this can occur, organic or not.

review/summary: Product great, shipping problems
review/text: The formula is great.  Our babies like it, it's organic, and the can isn't lined with plastic, so there's less chance of it containing BPA.  Now, although the product is great, we've had problems with Amazon shipping it to us.  They put 8 cans in an oversize box without enough padding so they were moving around and banging into each other.  Of the 8 cans, 6 were dented.  Of the 6 dented cans 3 had opened, exposing the formula to air and spilling some out.  We've ordered this from another online retailer before and the packaging was great.  Four cans to a box and 2 boxes to a larger shipping box.  Amazon is a bit cheaper and they have the subscription service which makes it convenient, but that's only if you don't have to deal with several cans in each shipment being unusable.  If they can improve the shipping, we highly recommend this product, especially the subscription service.

review/summary: What is "Reduced Minerals Whey"?
review/text: I have an issue with the ingredients.  The very first ingredient is "Organic Reduced Minerals Whey".  Um, what is that?  According to Google, it is a by-product of cheese manufacturing.  I can't find anything about the nutritional soundness of this stuff, just other moms going "what is this?".  Most other baby formulas have milk as their first ingredient, or whey protein.  I'm guessing reduced minerals whey is similar to whey protein but I just don't know enough about it for it to be the #1 product in my daughter's diet.  To me, it sounds like a cost cutting measure.<br /><br />I would much prefer to give my daughter organic formula but all the organic formulas I've found have these reduced minerals as the first ingredient, except for Baby's Only, which is brown rice syrup, aka sugar.  So until I find an organic formula with the primary ingredient being milk, we are going with non-organic.  I just don't think it is worth compromising the quality of the ingredients for organic.

review/summary: gas & fussy
review/text: This formula gave my 4 month old daughter gas & she became very fussy while on it. We were using Baby's Only but stopped because it was making her constipated. I did not want to use Earth's Best because of the added DHA & ARA (if you don't know about how these products are made then look it up-once you read about it you will not want your child drinking it). This added DHA & ARA are not from an organic sorce. Last yeat the USDA has banned it from orgainc formulas but it could take years for it to be removed. I blame some of her fussiness & discomfort from this added DHA. I wanted to use an organic formula so we went back to Baby's Only. It seems to be the only option & we will deal with it binding her up.  She is now eating oatmeal cereal with prunes mixed in & I also give her a probiotic supplement that Baby's Only makes once a day. These things seem to keep her constipation at bay. It's well worth it because I know she's on the best formula out there.

review/summary: Doesn't taste great
review/text: I can't recommend this formula.  Prior to trying it, my baby had been consuming breast milk and enfamil formula, each from a bottle, and had always seemed to enjoy both.  When I fed him Earth's Best, he made a sad, surprised face immediately, but soldiered on with the feeding, only to throw it almost all up at the end of the feeding.  I've never felt like I had so failed my baby.  After that, I taste tested Earth's Best, Enfamil and my own breast milk (too much information?).  The latter two were tasty, and quite similar to each other (with a sweetness to them).  When it came to Earth's Best, I had to agree with my baby--it tasted bad, with almost a metallic flavor to it.  I'll never subject him to it again.

review/summary: The ONLY formula to use!
review/text: No one had told me about this product because I am breastfeeding, but when I realized I was going to supplement at night I wanted to find a formula that would work well with breastfeeding.  I tried everything on the market and all of them had added sugars and made my baby boy extra gassy and some even gave him a rash.  I started reading reviews and found out about Earth's Best.  It is amazing! It smells good, it lessened his gassiness and he absolutely loves the taste.  I predominatey breastfeed, but the two bottles he gets a day are always Earth's Best...you won't be disapointed.  (Too much sugar and carbs in the others).<br /><br />I guess people did not understand my reference to carbs, strangely.  I am speaking about the carbs in the vast majority of baby formulas on the market.  They are not complex carbs and they are processeds with loads of white sugar and synthetic starches that are made in labs in china.  My point was that although Earth's Best is more expensive than the other formulas on the market, it is a valuable investment.  Breast milk first and foremost, but Earth's Best in my opinion is the next best thing because of its quality production. I am sorry if this was not clear.

review/text: Buyers beware of this rip off--the Earth's Best infant formula (and Vermont Organic) is produced by exactly the same manufacturer and are the same to the microgram.  Literally THE EXACT SAME STUFF just re-packaged and marked up 40-60%, depending upon where you are buying it.  Go with the Wal Mart Organic brand if you want this formula, because you're throwing your money away otherwise.  I was glad I'd only bought one can of the Earth's Best before I realized this!

review/summary: Hexane in organic formula!
review/text: I am very mad at myself for not doing better research before selecting formula once my breast milk supply dwindled.  Do your own search!  The Obama Admin has said that organic formula should no longer be allowed to be marketed if it contains dha/ara made with hexane.  Organic foods for adults are not allowed to be labeled as organic if they are made with  hexane.  There are several articles out there discussing possible side effects including autism and ADHD from hexane.  I am switching to Baby's Only which is the only organic formula that contains Dha/ara not manufactured using hexane.  It says it is a toddler formula which is why I didn't consider using it to begin with.  Do your own research, supposedly they market it that way to support breastfeeding exclusively for the first year.  It meets. The infant Formula requirements.  I am hoping to return the box of Earth's Best hexane formula I paid so much for thinking I was doing something good for my son.  Red the review here that copies the response from Baby's Only about it being suitable for infants  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009DXVP4">Babys Only Organic Dairy Formula Case (6 cans)</a>.

review/summary: We are satisfied!
review/text: I researched formulas for a long time before deciding to go with Earth's Best. I choose organic formula primarily because I find GMO foods to be creepy and insane. There's been a lot of discussion about the toxicity of hexane, used to process the life'sDHA supplement in this formula. Since the only life'sDHA-free alternative has its own problems (alleged traces of arsenic due to brown rice syrup), there doesn't seem to be one optimal formula to go with... at least from the perspective of a natural/organic mama who can't exclusively breastfeed. What it came down to was my son's preference. He can't digest Baby's Only very well, and just doesn't seem to like it. We have had zero problems with digestion using Earth's Best, and he eagerly drinks it down! So ultimately it was kind of a no-brainer for us to stick with Earth's Best, despite the hexane controversy. I personally have a hard time believing that the process used to make the life'sDHA supplement is a considerable threat to my baby's well being and health, even if it isn't the most ideal thing in the universe (same goes for the controversy surrounding Baby's Only). The modern world provides opportunities to be exposed to toxins around every corner, and I'd probably be more concerned about the lack of a viable alternative if this were something my kiddo had to eat for the rest of his life. But for the next half year, we're gonna do what we must to let this baby thrive!

review/summary: Excellent Formula
review/text: I am a physician and very aware of the importance of breastfeeding. I breastfed exclusively until my son was 5 months old and then very reluctantly because of work and travel started him on formula. I did extensive research on all types of formula and decided on Earth's Best organic sensitivity formula because of a family history of lactose intolerance. I have to say I am very pleased with the product. My baby loves it and has not had any issues what so ever. To my profound dismay, he actually tolerates a lot better than my own milk. There is no spitting, no vomiting, no constipation or loose stools. I highly recommend this formula.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: It is hard to mix with a spoon, but is no problem to mix with a wisk. The instructions say to use warm water. I prefer not to do that because I mix a larger batch in the morning to mix with my breastmilk for my son to have at daycare while I'm at work. If it's warm I think it can spoil faster. I use cold water filtered with a Brita. Again, even cold, it is no problem to mix with a wisk.<br /><br />I chose this formula because the sugar is milk based versus cane based. I had my son on Organic Similac before, but then read about the sucrose and how it rots teeth quicker than any sugar. Similac also has plastic packaging. They may have switched to plastic without BPA, but I wasn't able to confirm that, and preferred the formulation of Earth's Best anyway. Earth's Best's can is cardboard with a plastic top.<br /><br />Initially my son seemed gassier (and stinkier) than usual, but it went away, so I don't know if it was from the formula and he got used to it, or not.<br /><br />Amazon has the best price online, and any store around me. It is even cheaper when you put it on subscription, which I did after trying two cans to make sure it worked out well for my baby.

I was surprised to find that my son tolerates this formula every bit as well as my BF babies....maybe even a little better. No reflux causing spit up. No gas. We tried the leading national brand while on vacation b/c an obscure grocery didn't have any Earth's Best. He was so gaseous and uncomfortable all weekend.  We couldn't wait to get back to Earth's Best. And you can't find a better deal than amazon.com direct shipping, to boot!!

review/summary: Good, but clumps
review/text: We love that this formula is organic!  And the 31.75oz 4-pack on Amazon is the best deal around.<br /><br />We switched from Enfamil and Similac formulas to this when my son was about a month old.  He's been using this formula, along with breast milk, for about a month now.  He seems to like it just fine.<br /><br />We've noticed that you have to shake this formula vigorously or else there are little clumps.  It's best to shake it with a solid top on the bottle, then put a nipple on if you can.  Otherwise, every once in a while, those little clumps get into the nipple and prevent it from coming out.  When this happens we just have to flick the nipple with our finger to get the clump loose.  Also, from the vigorous shaking it gets pretty foamy, so we make it ahead of time and let it set for 10-15 minutes before feeding if we can.

review/summary: VERY BAD and NOT RELIABLE Amazon service
review/text: The product is good, but buying it at Amazon has been a BAD experience.<br />When you buy baby formula, you need reliability of supply. Amazon subscribe&save is NOT RELIABLE!<br />First shipment was lost because "the driver left the package at the wrong doo". OK, at least they replaced it (well, I had to run to supermarket to buy formula though as my baby would not wait for a week without food).<br />Then a couple of months later another bad experience. My order is scheduled to be shipped in 18th of every month. Obviously, I run out of supplies and have to rely on this schedule.<br />But in June my order was still "not yet shipped" on 23rd! So I e-mailed Amazon - no response! On 25th - still not shipped, so I rush to supermarket again to buy 1 jar of formula as my baby needs food! On 27th - still not shipped. I was trying to find a phone number to call at amazon web site, but it simply does not have such option. "Contact us" does not work either - you have to enter a reason of why you want to contact them and manu option does not work.<br />Is the best thing I can do is cancel shipment and find a more reliable vendor?<br />Very BAD experience, frustrating as I am buying necessary food for baby, not some items that can wait!

review/text: There are high levels of Arsenic in this formula from the organic brown rice they use. My pediatrician told me to stop using it because it has high levels of arsenic in it which is a poison! This happens because the organic brown rice used to make the formula soaks up the arsenic from the soil when it's growing and then when they use it, it contaminates the milk. I'm not sure how Earths Best will fix this issue but until they fix it, I am not using this formula.

review/text: When we first started using Earth's Best Organic formula in the fall of 2011 it was VERY bubbly when shaken up in a bottle.  I don't know if they've since changed the formulation or what, but the past couple of months the formula has been much less bubbly when shaken up so our only complaint about it has now been resolved.  We especially love this formula because it is just so much less smelly than non-organic formulas.  We used regular Similac with our first son and it was so stinky when he burped or when you smelled the bottle.  This organic formula is somehow almost odor-free!  When my younger son burps we can hardly even smell it.  We love Earth's Best and are happy to be feeding our babe completely organically through his first year.

review/summary: Great on sensitive tummies
review/text: My son was a very ineffective nurser, and lost too much weight in the beginning, so we ended up having to supplement with formula. At the hospital, they gave us some ready to eat similac, and it was terrible. He threw up almost every time we fed it to him, and the stuff looked and smelled terrible -- thick, dark, sticky, and overly sweet. We try to go as organic as possible, so as soon as we found out we had to give our son formula, we searched for a good organic.<br /><br />This seems to be great. It doesn't have that overly sweet smell to it that the similac had. In fact, my husband being the curious creature that he is has tasted both, and says that the Earth's Best is much better. It just looks and smells much more like something that you should give a baby. WE also have very few problems with him spitting up with this formula. He is now strictly a formula baby, and gaining weight above and beyond what his doctor had hoped to see.<br /><br />I order the formula through Amazon Subscribe and Save. It saves a bunch of money (which is pretty nice at $30 a can!) and it's automatically shipped to me every month (I get 4 cans a month, but plan on upping that as his appetite increases), and don't have to worry about running out and having to make those late-night emergency runs to the store. I love Amazon!

review/text: All infant formulas have the same ratios of nutrients - that's mandated by the government.  However, the ingredients used to source those nutrients, that's what's important.  Earth's Best is organic, and made with wholesome organic ingredients that you would actually want to put into your infant's body.<br /><br />My son was breast fed, but I couldn't make enough to meet his requirements when I went back to work.  I tried Infamil once, and he threw it up.  Earth's Best, he actually looked forward to drinking.<br /><br />Do you know that formula manufacturers used to remove Omega 3's from formula?  Because it decreases shelf life.  So be prepared to use the can within a month of opening it.<br /><br />Also, if your infant is allergic to soy, this product is not soy-free (It has soy oil).

review/summary: Formula is fine, but I'm not so sure I'd call it "Earth's Best"...
review/text: ... in fact it might just be the exact same formula as your closest local/national grocery store brand but with the added bonus of costing about 30% more. We had recently been using this formula until we ran out and I had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement. The closest thing they had was their organic store brand. Funny thing is, when I got home to compare the two I noticed the ingredients are EXACTLY the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date. From what I can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know. Virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store X or Y and it seems that Earth's Best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price. I suggest checking this out for yourself, you might be able to save some money.

review/summary: So disappointed...
review/text: I used Earth's Best 3 years ago for our 1st son. We have a new baby, and I was shocked to find that they had changed lactose to glucose solids (SUGAR). In Europe the practice of adding corn syrup and glucose to infant formula has been banned. All organic formulas in the US have now switched from lactose to a syrup solid or glucose. We are switching to HIPP organic from the UK which is available on Amazon and a british store website. Plus Earth's Best practice of how they get the DHA/ARA is very questionable. #FAIL

review/summary: great
review/text: We just transitioned our baby from breastfeeding to formula and he took to this formula just fine!  I was nervous that he wouldn't like the taste or smell of formula after having pure breastmilk for 7 months and he had no problem with this formula.  It's also so reassuring to know that this is organic and high quality.  It's only a couple more dollars than the non-organic stuff!  It's wonderful and we are VERY pleased!

review/summary: Corn Syrup Solids in Disguise.
review/text: This product gets 2 stars for being organic and having no GEI's. However, when I checked out the ingredient list and saw "glucose syrup", I was suspicious. I contacted customer service and asked them what the glucose was derived from. This is the answer that I got:<br /><br />"The glucose syrup is from corn syrup solids.  It is a source of carbohydrates and is included to meet the label's nutrition claim for carbohydrate."<br /><br />Very disappointing, as I really try to keep our diet free from corn syrup and other unhealthy fillers. I don't want my baby to drink this.

review/summary: If you're forced to use formula...
review/text: My wife and I were avid and determined to breast feed as long as our daughter needed. At 8 months my wife got sick and her supply was shot so we had to supplement. I did countless hours of grudging research and while I believe there is no true replacement for breast milk this was the product we felt best giving. Daughter had no reactions and drinks it fine, milestones are well hit and growth is still on curve. Seems like a decent replacement if you choose or are forced to one.

review/summary: Seems healthy, and my baby prefers it
review/text: My baby seems to prefer this formula mixture over the other bigger brands. If you buy it "Subscribe and Save" it's a lot cheaper, which is nice. I breastfed for 9 months until my baby stopped gaining weight so we had to start giving her formula. She's been growing steadily ever since!

review/summary: Great Formula
review/text: We started using this one after a month of reseach on organic formulas.  The bad thing is that when we run out of this we have to go to a store too far from us to get it as our baby will not drink any other formula and we love that the company is so responsive to our questions.  Now if more mainstream stores carried this I would be a very happy mom!  My 6 month old loves this the foods (she refuses to eat any other brand) and we are just now trying out the diapers from Earths best due to the fact that the pampers and some huggies have caused her to break out in rashes.

review/summary: Favorite baby formula!
review/text: I have been trying to find a good formula when my daughter-in-law could no longer nurse because of work.  When we bought it, I tasted the formula powder against the formula that we had and was surprised at the difference!  The other formula had a bitter, metallic aftertaste. Earth's Best tasted sweet, like powdered milk.  Much better product and the baby responded favorably!!

review/text: After I was physically unable to breast feed my daughter this formula was suggested by my midwives. Earth's Best is excellent and my daughter is growing strong and healthy.

review/summary: Happy baby with Earth's Best formula
review/text: We tried different types of formula before deciding on this brand. Our 6 month old baby daughter was too sensitive to all other formulas out there. One would make her gassy and fussy, others would give her either diarrhea, or constipation. I was getting really discouraged and thought I'd have to breastfeed till she's 1. Luckily after the first bottle of Earth's Best she was fine. Now she's a healthy 11 month old and even though I am excited that we can soon stop giving her formula, I am a little sad because I am so used to relying on just this one product on her complete nutrition. I definitely recommend this product to others especially if they can take advantage of the "Subscribe&Save" option.
