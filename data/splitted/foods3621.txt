review/summary: bad gum
review/text: Let me just say that I normally don't review things that I buy from amazon, but I felt that it had to be known that this gum is less than spectacular. I chew about a  12-14 count pack of gum a day, but the flavor runs out on this in a mere minutes. I find myself eating 20-40 pieces. If you want xylitol gum, I think you should look for other brands, namely Trident.

Once I tasted the gum I knew something was wrong.  It seemed stale or old.  The expiration date was fine .... not bad until 2013 so then why.  I don't know if the shipping conditions were bad and exposed to heat or cold, but I will not be buying this from amazon again.

review/summary: Beware of Xylitol
review/text: Don't let your Dogs get anywhere near gum with Zylitol in it. Don't leave it where a dog will accidentally get into it!!  They have no cure for dogs who eat it and it will, I repeat will kill them. There is nothing that will help.  They don't know yet why but if just a minute portion of a it, will kill your dog, what does it do to you?  I just don't chew gum anymore since it is so hard to find just old fashioned regular gum with sugar and no additives.  Aspartame;bad, Xylitol;worse. They all change motablism.  No wonder obesity is so prevalent now. I would like just regular sugar based gum.

review/summary: Not Very Happy
review/text: These were OK, but I was not happy for several reasons.<br /><br />I recently had some trail mix that had dark chocolate soy nuts in it and since I like to snack on trail mix I wanted to make my own. So I purchased these in order to do that.<br /><br />#1) I did not care for the way these tasted. These do not taste like the dark chocolate I am use to. They taste more like that fake Carob chocolate.<br /><br />#2) These are more like clusters, then individual chocolate covered soy nuts. I was disappointed because clusters just don't work in trail mix, which is why I purchased these.<br /><br />I won't be buying these again

review/summary: Pretty good for a healthy snack
review/text: I love dark chocolate, but these were a little dark for me -- no sweetness to them at all.  The crunch was really nice, like eating chocolate-covered peanuts.<br /><br />Beware... I don't know what it was. I ate only one cluster and there was a rock-hard soy bean(?) in it.  I'm not sure if it was a bean from an earlier stage in the process (are they ever rock-hard?) or if it was indeed a small round stone.  I'll be eating the rest of them with care, so I don't break a tooth.<br /><br />I couldn't decide between three and four stars.  They taste okay, I'd like them to be sweeter (but then they wouldn't be as healthy), but the fact that I found something that could have broken a tooth in my first bite is a pretty big deal.  Since no other reviewer mentioned finding anything like that, I'm really hoping it's a one-time thing.  Consider it 3.5 stars.

The ratio of chocolate to soybeans is perfect.  These treats have a crisp appeal and not a heavy waxiness that I sometimes encounter with dark chocolate.  Two clusters are enough to satiate my chocolate craving with minimal guilt.

review/text: (Mr. Master Reviewer ^.^)<br /><br />This Energy Gel 24 Pack is simply the best buy for any person who is in doing marathons or simply training the body. I have gone through at least 8 orders of this stuff until I finally realized how much of a killer it can be on the average user's wallet. If these things were cheaper or If I could get them for an affordable price, they would trully be amazing but either way, this stuff helps! Flavors and extremely tasty and regardless of the type, they all go down and about.<br /><br />My favorite beyond all the flavors is "Espresso Love" because it has the most caffeine in one gel shot and is a killer (In a good way) for coffee lovers! If interested in discovering which flavor is best, give the "Mixed" combo a shot. I have uploaded pictures of all flavors you get in this pack. Although $6 more expensive than a specific flavor buy, it gives you more variety ^.^

Basically this product works like a charm, but I just don't love the taste or texture. I've looked for and tried other energy boosters, but none of them have worked as well for me as GU. It really does give me an energy boost and keeps me from bonking. It just wish I liked the taste more.

review/summary: Find a flavor that's palatable, and then go for the big box!
review/text: I love that GU has so many different flavors of their energy gel.  For anyone that hasn't tried these before, I would recommend going to a running, biking, or general sporting goods store and pick up a few different flavors to try out.  So far, the chocolate outrage is the only flavor that I find to be palatable (this one actually goes beyond palatable to being TASTY!).  With other flavors, I'm only able to take in about half of a packet.<br />I use these while cycling.  They help me maintain my energy level throughout a long ride and keep me from bonking.  Any long workout requires an athlete to hydrate and take in nutrition along the way in order to keep going.  One packet of GU seems to be just the right amount for a single serving.  It stashes well in a pocket or saddle bag and is easy to eat on the fly.  Definitely wash it down with water (also to keep your hydration up).<br />I am a quite the chocolate fanatic and enjoy the taste of the chocolate outrage so much that during a recent triathlon I was actually looking forward to the point in the race in which I was going to be able to eat the GU!<br />Try out a few flavors and see what appeals to you.

review/summary: Best Training Fuel Out There
review/text: I've tried several of the major gel brands, and many of each brand's flavors.  Without question, GU is superior in the two major areas for reviewing gel: taste and effectiveness.  The texture and flavor of each GU variety (the only one I haven't tried is "plain") is far better than the equivalent of another brand, and frankly just generally tastes good.  This is especially true for the chocolate burst and vanilla bean flavors.  With regard to effectiveness, I use gels for pre-workout "priming" and during longer workouts.  GU provides great, quick, and sustained energy in both phases, without too much caffeine like some products or too little or too slow a "kick-in" period like others.  GU is easily the best.

review/text: I really like the GU's for marathons/long distance runs. It's a great variety box for those who want to try out different flavors. My only advice is to drink a lot of water with them. If I don't, they seem to give me stomach cramps. Almost like a dehydrated feeling. Other than that, I really like these gels.

review/summary: great price and great product
review/text: I love the gu compared to other products I have tried that has similar uses. I have only tried a few so far, vanilla bean, lemon lime and mint chocolate. Thought I would not like the heavier sounding tastes like chocolate but they were great! The vanilla bean and several others have caffeine in them which I was leery of because I do not do well with caffeine. I get shaky and feel like crap but with these, I really did not even notice the caffeine. That is also good because it opens up a whole other variety of flavors.

Empirically speaking I don't know whether Gu works or not (I believe the jury is out there) ... but it sure works for me. I will always have one in my pocket if I am running more than 10 miles.

review/text: I do crossfit and I am an ectomorph by definition. I eat a lot and I just don't put on weight. When I workout intensely like in crossfit, I usually tend to puke or get exhausted very fast. This led to a lack of/slow muscle growth. I decided to give Gu a try after hearing about how it gives runners that endurance to for their runs. On my really heavy workout days, I take Gu right after my warmup and it kicks in about 15 minutes after that. I get to push myself further and harder and I do not leave the gym like a halfdead fish anymore. I am starting to see some gains and I really feel good after a workout. This product doesn't bulk you up and especially good for that endurance you need during an energetic workout.

I have not cared for several of the other flavors, but this one is a keeper, and gives me the same energy that the mint chocolate Gus do.

review/summary: GU Gel is easy to take down, tastes good and works
review/text: Typically cramps, soreness and fatigue are all delayed while taking GU and recovery is enhanced. It brings my legs back to life if I start running without taking one then take one in during the run. For short 5 mile runs I just take one before the run for 10 mile runs I take one before and one about 45 minutes to an hour into the run. My times have definitely improved as GU give just enough energy to push a little harder. I'm making better times and pushing through the wall better with the help of a GU here and there.<br /><br />Additional note: I did a weight workout and core workout then thought I'd run a 5 mile tempo workout. I took a GU before I ran but legs fatigued badly at 3.5 miles from the weight workout before I imagine and not fully recovered from the solid 10 mile run the day before. For running, I find GU really supplements the energy when the body is rested and ready to push for a good run rather than after a hard work out and just trying to get in a good run time after the body is still not recovered.

review/summary: Mixed Flavors review
review/text: I just wanted to leave a note of what the composition of the Mixed Flavors pack looked like.  I had a hard time finding information on what exactly I'd get.  I'm sure they change could change this from time to time, but this is what I had:<br /><br />"Roctane" Gu packets (1 each): Blueberry Pomegranate,Vanilla Orange, Cherry Lime, Pineapple.  These are the high endurance packets.  The Blueberry Pom and Vanilla Orange are both double caffeine and the Pineapple has no caffeine.<br /><br />Regular Gu Packets had 3 of Chocalate Outrage and Vanilla Bean.  The rest had two of each flavor: Strawberry Banana, TriBerry, Expresso Love, Mandarin Orange, Jet Blackberry, Mint Chocolate, Lemon Sublime.  The Strawberry Banana, Mint Chocolate, and Lemon Sublime have no caffeine, while Jet Blackberry and Expresso Love are double caffeine.<br /><br />If you're looking to shake it up or find a favorite flavor, I think this is a good buy.  I don't know that Gu is the best energy gel out there - I actually think everyone just has to find out what they like in taste and texture and what their stomach can handle.  I've had good luck with Gu myself and I look forward to trying all the flavors.

review/text: In my marathon and triathlon training, I have tried lots of different Gels.  In the end, each individual has to determine what works best for them in terms of taste, consistency, and ease on the stomach.  For me personally, Gu has the best consistency as I find some of the other products a little too runny.  It also seems to be the easiest on my stomach and I very much like the taste of Chocolate Outrage and Espresso Love.  For some of my longer workouts (>1 hour) I've noticed a substantial improvement in my performance with Gu in my system.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: not just for cyclists
review/text: I bought these first at the store, single packets, and I started using them before my ride home after work. Usually by that time, after 10 hours, I am a little tired anyway, but I have found these give me that much more energy I need to go the distance without tiring before I get home, especially when the temperatures get really hot, high 90's to over 100 degrees.<br /><br />But I also work out with free weights. So one day when I was doing my leg workout, I did my sets of squats before the leg extensions etc., then decided I wanted to do some more squats. So I took a gel about 15 minutes before I was going to tackle it again and found I had a surge of energy to do 4 more sets with heavier weights, after my leg ext's. So yes, these work quite well. The flavors I love the most are Espresso Love , (strange name but great taste) vanilla and chocolate outrage. But that is my preference since I am a lover of chocolate, and like who isn't?<br /><br />Another note, or update, (4-30-2011), I often use these after my workout (with weights) as an energy boost and recovery. Sometimes during a workout for the extra energy, but most likely to use it after. It works great, and at only 100 calories, it is just the right amount.<br /><br />The box is cheaper than buying the singles at the store, so for me it is the best way to go. I am sure there are other sports that could benefit from these gels. Buy it on Amazon's subscription, and the price drops even more.

review/summary: Go Gu!
review/text: LOVE the Gu! Easy on the stomach, easy to use during training, portable even during long runs or rides.<br /><br />It takes about 8 minutes after fueling with Gu for me to notice a difference during running. I have tried every similar product, and for me, nothing tastes as good and works as well as Gu. The new blackberry flavor is awesome and adds to the caffeinated product line (not all Gu has caffeine).

review/text: I use Gu gels for longer races and training runs.  Mint Chocolate is my favorite flavor, and I have tried a lot.  It tastes like a York Peppermint Patty!  They don't carry it in any sports/running stores around here, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: blackberry gu
review/text: This is my new favorite energy gel. I've tried other brands and flavors of caffienated gu - because sometimes on hard rides or long runs, I need a little boost - and caffeine helps a lot. This stuff tastes great, too. I can't stand coffee-flavored anything, and the blackberry is very palatable and easy to eat and digest. Love it!!

review/summary: Great product, great flavor
review/text: Gu's energy gels are excellent for long distance running and their Vanilla Bean flavor is very tasty. Fast shipping on this product (item arrived in 3 days with standard ground shipping) and exactly as described. Total with tax was about $27 for 24 Gu packs...pretty good deal considering they typically cost $1.50/pop.

review/text: I was hesitant buying so much of this before I had even tasted it, but it has a great flavor, which is really all you can expect from an energy gel in my opinion.  I had previously only bought the orange flavor, so now I have a new flavor that I can depend on.

review/summary: Chocolate Gu is the best
review/text: The fruity Gu's weren't to my liking but I'm a big chocolate fan and when it came to training for the Pittsburgh Half Marathon again, I decided to just buy the box.  I can happily say that I'm still enjoying the stuff and don't know what I'd do without it for longer training runs.

review/summary: The only thing I can stomach down during competitions
review/text: These are the only food I can stomach down during competitions.  Unlike other brands, GU gels are not overly sweet nor too thick.  My favorites are vanilla, chocolate, and plain (in that order).  Although I expect energy gels to be sweet (I think it's to encourage drinking water to offset the concentrated ions), some are too much and it makes me gag.  (ie. powerbar, clif shots...)<br /><br />Side note: a plus side for clif shots is it is slightly more environmentally conscious.  The package is made so that it doesn't litter little pieces of ripped gel package tops.  It's hard to keep track of the small, torn off tops when you're on the run!

review/summary: Nu to Gu
review/text: Until this year the longest race I'd trained for was a 12k.  I never trained for more than an hour at a time, even on my 'long days', so didn't need a product like Gu.  When I began to train for a half-marathon, however, I found that Gu provided a needed boost in energy toward the end of the longer runs.  I usually take it around 45 minutes in (like the package advises) and wash it down with a couple sips of sports drink.  It doesn't take all the pain out of 10 mile+ days,  but definitely helps.  I'll have a couple packets with me on race day for sure.

review/text: Even the "plain" flavor was much better than I expected. I had my heart set on getting the Vanilla Bean, but it was often out of stock. I opted for to try other flavors to test others and was surprised by how good tasting they all were. I actually enjoy matching my workout moods with the different flavors! Now I will just get this mixed flavors box every time.

review/summary: The best of the energy gels
review/text: Tasty but not too sweet, I have found that the GU packets are the most easy-to-ingest and effective energy replacement tools for endurance sports.  The Vanilla Bean flavour is especially easy to swallow without a lingering aftertaste.  I've used these extensively and never had a problem like I have with other similar brands.<br /><br />Buying by the box is economical, too.

review/summary: Good variety
review/text: Like most users of GU, I run marathons.  I chose this package because I wanted to find a flavor that I could stomach later in a race and this let me experiment.  This package has eight separate flavors:  orange, vanilla, espresso, berry, lemon-lime, chocolate, banana, and plain.  I won't comment on the taste because that is an individual preference, however, I do prefer GU to Clif Shots, which to me are pastier and harder to get down without a good amount of water.

review/summary: Likely Product Mix
review/text: I purchased the flavor mix pack a few months back.  It wasn't from this link, but I assume this is the same product.  I will agree that it is very frustrating they don't tell you exactly what it is.  This is the review I posted - hope it helps.<br /><br />I just wanted to leave a note of what the composition of the Mixed Flavors pack looked like. I had a hard time finding information on what exactly I'd get. I'm sure they change could change this from time to time, but this is what I had:<br /><br />"Roctane" Gu packets (1 each): Blueberry Pomegranate, Vanilla Orange, Cherry Lime, Pineapple. These are the high endurance packets. The Blueberry Pom and Vanilla Orange are both double caffeine, Cherry Lime is normal caffeine and the Pineapple has no caffeine.<br /><br />Regular Gu Packets had 3 of Chocalate Outrage and Vanilla Bean. The rest had two of each flavor: Strawberry Banana, TriBerry, Expresso Love, Mandarin Orange, Jet Blackberry, Mint Chocolate, Lemon Sublime. The Strawberry Banana, Mint Chocolate, and Lemon Sublime have no caffeine, while Jet Blackberry and Expresso Love are double caffeine - everything else is normal caffeine.<br /><br />If you're looking to shake it up or find a favorite flavor, I think this is a good buy. I don't know that Gu is the best energy gel out there - I actually think everyone just has to find out what they like in taste and texture and what their stomach can handle. I've had good luck with Gu myself and I look forward to trying all the flavors.

review/summary: These are good
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSCRHY">GU Energy Gel, Chocolate Outrage - 24 Packets</a><br /><br />This is a good product to use when you are training for a half marathon or a full one, and also during the race itself.  I always take it when I run 10 miles or more.  I carry it in pockets in my fitness shorts or shirt (they are coming out with more fitness clothes with pockets, and it's really convenient).  It makes recovery faster and I find my legs feel a whole lot better if I take it.  I also like that the caffeine in it is not that much.  I can't even tolerate a small cup of coffee, but the amount of caffeine in GU is just enough to give me a little fast energy while running, without giving me a "caffeine rush".  The chocolate outrage tastes pretty good too.  It can be messy too, so be warned and have somewhere to put the empty packets (because you wont want to carry them in your hand).  I wash it down with some fluids and stick the empty packet in the empty bottle.  If the bottle is not empty, I put it in my pocket.

review/summary: Great for hypoglycemics as well!
review/text: Unlike most of the reviewers for Gu, I am not a marathon runner, or even much of a runner at all. I'm hoping that I will be one day!  I'm lucky if I can make it to 2 miles.  I have issues with my blood sugar getting too low and it really affects me during exercise.  I take GU about 15 minutes before exercise to keep my blood sugar from plummeting during my run.  It is EXTREMELY effective!  I have made more progress with my fitness level since starting to use GU than in the last 2 years of struggling with my blood sugar issues.  I tried several different brands and flavors of "energy supplements" and came to the conclusion that GU is the most effective and tasty version out there.<br /><br />One caveat - I'm not particularly fond of the taste.  I get the Strawberry Banana and Lemon Lime flavors as those are the most palatable ones for me; however even those flavors are somewhat off.  The flavors are not really all that bad, and since the results are so impressive, I've gotten to where I don't really notice anymore.<br /><br />In short, this is a great way to boost your blood sugar before or during a workout.  It is also be useful as a safety measure for hypoglycemics; I keep one in my purse in case my blood sugar suddenly drops off a cliff.

review/summary: One complaint: opening GU gels are problematic in colder temperatures!
review/text: I highly value GU as a supplement, its the only gel I use in running and cycling. However, most of the popular fall marathons, such as NYC, Chicago, Philly, and MCM, are scheduled when temperatures are cooler -- sometimes downright cold! Well, I'm running Philly, which in 2011 is scheduled for November 20th. To train for this marathon, I run at night when temperatures drop. One thing I've noticed on long runs is that when the temperature is 40-45 degrees, and I reach for a GU at mile 13 (about the time I usually do), opening the package is labor-intensive, and ripping it with your teeth isn't the answer when breathing through a challenging point in a course. Try opening a GU gel when running up or down a hill in colder temperatures. Even the top tab (or nipple as I call it) is hard to open. My complaint: THE PACKAGE NEEDS TO BE PREFORATED AND MADE EASIER TO OPEN! I'll say it again, GU needs to make the packaging easier to open for runners and cyclists. It has nothing to do with hand strength. It has nothing to do with sweaty hands. The package should be easier to open. Period. Other than that its a 5-star product in my opinion.
