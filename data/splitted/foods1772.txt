review/summary: Great Nuts with a KICK
review/text: I purchased these Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds to try out for a snack and they are GREAT.  They are good as a snack between meals and they are quite filling.  My husband really loves the flavor of these Almonds.  I have already purchased another supply.  The price is so much less than at the grocery store and I get them right at my door step.

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

review/summary: Wasabi Soy Flavor is too salty!
review/text: I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/summary: addicted to ... Lime and Chili Almonds
review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: I am so delighted to get these Salt and vinegar Almonds.  None of the stores near me carry them.  They are actually great for my diet.  I can eat as many as I like yet the amount has less calories than if I was eating chips.  I can only eat so many nuts at a time while I can pig out on chips and waste lots of calories. My friends are always digging in my closet to see if I have any when they visit.  Love them.<br /><br />mls

review/summary: Great travel snack!
review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

The company was started by a person who made Frangos on the top of the old F&N building. So these are northwest Frangos in all but name.<br /><br />These are so tasty...

review/text: I'm always trying out different brands of bbq sauce. Today while at the store I noticed  this sauce. Original Bulls-eye is pretty pretty good and the price was right, so I figured I'd give it a show with burgers tonight. Oh man, this is some good sauce. I'm hooked. One of the best I've had on a burger. If you like smoky and sweet you'll love it.<br /><br />I also like how it uses sugar and not HFCS for sweetener. In fact its ingredients list is refreshingly short: Tomato Puree )water, tomato paste), sugar, vinegar, contains less than 2% of salt, modified food starch, natural flavor, mustard flour, dried onions, spice, dried garlic.<br /><br />Not much else to say. I'll have to try cooking with it next, but as it stands I love this stuff, definitely worth a try!

I thought I'd try something a bit different when I found these series of regional sauces: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TBF07U">Bulls Eye Barbeque Sauce - Kansas City Style 1 bottle 18 oz</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNKRJO">Bulls Eye Barbeque Sauce - Carolina Style 1 bottle</a>. We bought a six pack of the Memphis and the Kansas City and really enjoyed both. The Memphis was wonderful on pork and chicken and the Kansas City was sampled on some beef ribs. Already Bulls-Eye fans the variations were very nicely done. The Memphis has mustard adding some light kick, red onions, garlic, white wine, and a bit of brown sugar adding some sweetness. A subtle tangy and sweet sauce. The Kansas City style was a bolder hickory, molasses, mustard, onions, and garlic and stood up better to the beef. My Memphis bottles came with a best use date 9 months from now, the Kansas City bottles just two months from now.<br /><br />Next order will be for the North Carolina (ya'all) sauce.

review/text: I love keeping these on hand because you will find plenty of ways to use them and they are easier to use than buying the canned or boxes because  you don't have to use it right away.  I use them for soups, sauces & many other recipes to give it flavor plus you save money because there is two bouillon cubes in each envelope and it lasts a lot longer than the ones you buy in a jar.

review/text: From time to time I make up a dish, particularly chicken, that needs a little extra flavoring zest so I keep these Knorr's chicken bouillon cubes in the spice rack. I used one just the other day for a chicken with rice soup. They're quite high in sodium so when I use them I don't use additional salt. Good product. it will keep practically forever. I'm not certain why I have the Spanish version. It was just whar the store stocked.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I purchased this tea on a whim... it just sounded so delicious.  And it is!  It is definitely one of the best teas that I've ever had, and it is the best flavor that I have had from Republic of Tea OTHER than their Blackberry Sage (which is OUTTA THIS WORLD!)<br /><br />But I do have to agree with the other reviewer that stated that there isn't much of a ginger taste.  For me, that was okay because I was unsure if I would like gingered tea.  Perhaps it would be better with a more gingered taste... I don't know.

review/summary: Lack of ginger bite
review/text: Let me first say that this is a delicious tea. My problem is that the ginger in it isn't a strong one, and I feel a tea with Ginger in the title should at least taste like it more.<br /><br />I had the choice of buying either the Republic of Tea's Orange Spice for a few cents more than this flavor. The Orange Spice was an herbal tea listed as a digestion aid, while the Pineapple Ginger is a daily green tea. I'm disappointed in this flavor. I wanted a tea like Stash's Lemon Ginger, that really gives you good strong ginger taste. The reason I bought the ROT Pineapple Ginger is because I was driving all around town and couldn't find the Stash. Took a chance on it, because I usually like Republic of Tea's products, even though they're pricey.<br /><br />Well, I'll keep it because green tea is good for me, but I guess I'll just have to find the Stash Lemon Ginger online. Would the Orange Spice have been more satisfying to me? Don't know. Expensive lesson on this one.

review/summary: Fantastic deep rooibos tasting tea
review/text: I love Republic of Tea's rooibos teas. I bought mine at Whole Foods.  Republic of Tea's teas quality rival Numi's but I think this rooibos tea is even higher in quality than Numi's since you get "double" the dose of usual rooibos so that you get a deeper taste of rooibos and you can see and smell the red rooibos powder lightly dusted off the teabags.  And the packaging is compact and attractive, great as a gift.  What I like about rooibos is that it doesn't have that yucky tasting flowery herbal taste of hibiscus, rosehips, etc that teas like Celestial Seasoning are notoriously known for.  Also, you don't have to feel like Superman trying to break into their teabags (like Numi's) since there are no enclosed individual protective packets around each tea bag.  Rooibos teas are nutty and mellow in taste.<br /><br />Rooibos is healthy, great for skin ailments and calming for anxiety/nervous tension (which is why I love it so much), and it has no caffeine.  I double my health with it by adding raw unprocessed honey but it's really already slightly sweetened so that you don't need a lot of sweetener.  The tea is even better iced.  If it weren't so expensive, I'd get it more often but am forced with the lower cost alternative with Twining's rooibos teas which has a more "hay" taste/smell.

review/summary: LOVE this popcorn!
review/text: I love popcorn. We have popcorn about 4 nights a week. I started out looking for popcorn on the cob as I had that this year and it was lovely, and then stumbled upon India Tree. It's the closest that I can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and I love it. It is so fresh and natural tasting. I've been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand. Though the kernels popped up larger, the taste was stale and processed...not to mention, the India Tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand. I'm placing my order for more India Tree right now!

I'll be looking to try other brands for less and will triple our planting next year.

If you can get a deal like this I highly suggest purchasing it right away! If not, no worries and try getting it a little more than my bargain for no more $13.00 in my opinion, seeing as if you were to pay the retail suggested price on bag for $2.49 X 8 = $19.92 would still be a bargain if you look at it this way like I do!

When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up; but make sure<br />you hide your evidence if you want these to be ALL YOURS or otherwise they'll be gone before you get a chance to be a "kid at<br />heart"! Having bought two bags... thinking I would like these very much (how right I was!)...<br /><br />I was downright impressed, while not the traditional S'mores - but gee whiz; I actually ate the whole danged bag in one sitting<br />without even realizing it! *blush*  It was so much fun hunting or is it fishing (?) for one after another and then stacking them<br />together and eating "fishbait" - hahahahahaha!<br /><br />Next day, began to open the other bag (already!) and started to munch away ....<br /><br />Until, my grandchildren saw the "evidence" and wahhh :( - Poor Grandma here - ended up having to "share" and goodness gracious,<br />the laughter and giggles from the little ones were far worth it all!<br /><br />I 10,000 times recommend this ... this is the best ever from Pepperidge Farms! Way to go! Now if they can come up with the big box,<br />I'd buy it on Amazon in a heartbeat! Who would ever dream that Pepperidge Farms would come up with this? Just awesome!<br /><br />Interestingly, the very next day; while I had to babysit the youngest grandchild for a short time; she went off looking for something<br />that I had to inquire what she was looking for and she kept saying Whitey, Blackie and Creamy.  Looking everywhere in my room even<br />under the bed, leaving me totally bewildered until she sulked and said<br /><br />"Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />"Hide what?"<br /><br />"The 3 goldfishies"<br /><br />(puzzled)<br /><br />"The 3 Goldfishes? We don't have Goldfish in the house."<br /><br />(now she is mad with her arms folded)<br /><br />"Yes we do, we ate them yessteday! Grandma, where did you hide them?"<br /><br />(trying not to laugh)<br /><br />"Sweetie, we ate them all up yesterday."<br /><br />"Grandma, buy more. I like them lots! Tummy hungry, says want more goldfish."<br /><br />(points to her stomach)<br /><br />Kids are adorable! &lt;3  If you buy them, make sure you stash some for yourself, they are completely<br />and you just cannot resist them!

review/summary: There is no better Brown Creme de Cacao than this
review/text: This is the secret to making the best Brandy Alexander's I've ever had. I have found that if you use this Cacao it is not necessary to use an expensive Brandy or Cognac to get a great drink. I suggest 1.5 oz of a decent brandy, 1.5 oz of MB Brown Creme de Cacao and 1.5 oz of heavy whipping cream. You can use less cream if you want or even go with more; I have used as much as 2.25 oz and it is still great. Shake with ice and pour into a Martini glass and then grate some fresh nutmeg on top. When I pour it from the shaker I hold the strainer in such a way that I let little slivers of ice through.<br /><br />I have found that it is well worth it to pay the extra money for Marie Brizzard products as they are far, far superior to the Hiram Walker and DeKuyper products that are generally available. The only problem I have with MB is that there is very limited availability locally so I usually have to buy them online. I am more than happy to pay 20.00 for the MB products a compared to half the price for the lesser brands. The proof is in the cocktails.

review/text: Although I've had to do without for a couple months (summer 2010) now while my subscribe-and-save order is held due to unavailability (sigh), I have to say that this is my favorite dried fruit. If I'm not careful, I can eat a pound per week (another sigh). Not TOO sweet, but very flavorful....perfect munchy food. I've tried the dried pineapple (tasteless), the dried cherries (like bitter raisins), and the dried pears (not as sweet as my own dried pears). I LOVE that there is no added sugar! I can hardly wait for this great snack to be available again and my suggestion is to snip up a couple pieces into your morning oatmeal, cook and sprinkle with ginger, cinnamon and chopped almonds. I stir in organic yogurt or kefir as well. Yummy!<br /><br />August 28, 2010 - Just received order and please note that the pieces are small, mostly square as shown in the photo. I liked them when they were larger slices just as well. First bag tested pieces seem to be softer. Same marvelous mango taste but now it's even harder to stop eating them!<br />September 2010 - next order was of large slices again

review/text: All I can say is NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM....I can eat 4 lbs in a couple days. : O<br /><br />To whoever thought this review wasn't helpful. Ok, ok, maybe I could've expanded a little bit on the textures, tastes, things like that. Sure.<br /><br />The mangos come in a vacuum sealed bag so they are fresh as soon as you open the bag, I suggest storing them somewhere air-tight to increase the longevity, although I cannot keep any for a long period of time because they will get eaten. These have a bit of fiber to them and some iron. The fiber helps with regularity. The taste is that of fresh mangos, with a slightly sort of fresh-baked scent and taste. The texture is slightly tough and fibery at the random folded and smooshed pieces or chunks. But over-all the fresh from the bag mangos are soft and chewy easy to rip apart and digest. 2 Bags is enough to last a few weeks if you eat sparingly, as probably should be done. If you eat too much you will probably experience a slight digestive detox due to the fiber content. Again, they do get a little harder if you don't seal them up properly, so I suggest an air-tight storage.<br /><br />Over all an excellent snack and product. Shipping is on-time and the quality various from very good, to slightly as good, but in MHO it's always been very good no matter what.<br /><br />:.  How's that?

Buying them in bulk makes such an exotic treat affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: It's nearly impossible to find Mango in the store that isn't completely coated in sugar, this mango is great because it's not.  The mango is perfectly sweet on its own without needing additional sweetener.  I am so happy with this light and healthy snack.  I have been having it auto shipped to my house every month for the last three, and so far the product consistency has been great.

Price is acceptable market rate at 13.99/lb for no sugar added variety (regular sugary mango runs about 6.50/lb). You would think it would be the same price or cheaper as the sugary mango since they have one less ingredient to add!

But when it arrived, I found it to be too thinly sliced and too dehydrated -- not at all soft or chewy like the dried mango I usually get.  It also wasn't very flavorful.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I won't be ordering it again.

It is very dry, the mental image of eating thin strips of leather form in my mind when I eat it.<br />A bag of dried mango lasts a max of one day in our house.  The first bag is still half full after 3 weeks.<br />As you can probably guess I won't be buying more.

I like their apple chips and enjoy those, but these are just horrible.  So many almost black or grey pieces and plenty of dirt particles on some of the pieces.  No, it's not supposed to look that way since there are pieces that have the proper nice orange or yellow color typical of a mango.  So, I don't know what they are doing, unless they are using over-ripe mangoes.  I will not buy this product again, and I have to throw the rest out since I can't return it.  I will stick with their apple chips.

review/text: I only like the sugar free mango.  The sugar added ruins the taste.  This and Much ado about mango are the best.  This one has a better price but my grandchildren went through the bag like they were woodchippers.  The smaller bags slow down the consumption; as a result, they end up being cheaper per month.  This product had smaller pieces; however, the small pieces were absolutely delicious.  Much Ado About Mango has changed their equipment and their product doesn't taste as good as it used to.  This Bare Fruit actually tastes like the old Much ado about Mango which is delectible.  Trader Joes is the cheapest but isn't consistent at all.  Sometimes it tastes like plastic smells.

review/text: Best natural snack ever. PERIOD.  Delicious.  NO ADDED SWEETENERS. Just pure organic mango goodness.  These are the sweet treats of the Gods.<br /><br />I decided to search for natural dried fruit(no added sugars) when I tasted yet another misleading brand. They make it look natural, but hide the fact that they douse the delicious natural fruit with sugar!  It totally ruins the fruit. I looked on Amazon for the real deal.  Here it is.  Satisfied by the reviews, I bought. I can tell you now I'm totally satisfied, and am going to keep on being that way with this all natural organic sustenance.<br /><br />I can also tell you that as should be expected, the pieces vary with taste and flavor. I can taste different parts of the mangos involved, as well as different ripeness. You'll know when you get a really good piece--you'll want to just put it on your tongue and suck on it :)<br /><br />This is what nature intended, a very healthy snack. Great product!

I had tried other dried mango before, they were either too sweet (coated with sugar powder) or too expensive (my school store sells 4.99 for just few ounces).<br /><br />Ever since I found Bare Fruit bake-dried fruits, they substitutes all other snacks I've ever had!!I like the crispy dried apple; and I LOVE this tasty chewy dried mango. I had expect their dried mango to be as crispy as their dried apple, and only found out that the dried mangoes are just awsome! It's not over sweet, the flavor is sooooo good. No sugar No artificial sustances were added; besides, the taste is really good! It's bit dry and not as moist as most brands, but it's still tender and chewy, making it a perfect snack for movie time or sweet-tooth time :)

review/summary: Delicious organic dried mango
review/text: I read through most of the reviews before ordering this product. I usually buy organic dried mango (no sugar added) at Whole Foods. Yes, it is going to be drier and more leather-like, but that's because it's organic and has no sugar. The dried mango that has sugar is more chewy. Be aware of this before you buy. However, I had found that the organic dried mango actually tastes like real mango. I loved the bite size pieces. The texture and flavor varied throughout the bag, but that did not deter me. It's dried fruit. NOT EVERY MANGO IS GOING TO LOOK AND TASTE THE SAME fresh or dried. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. I am going to purchase it agian.

It seemed as if Bare Fruits puts their unusable left overs into those large 1# packages, you will receive a total of 2# with this order. A complete opposite to the smaller packages which I enjoy tremendously. I will only order the small packages in the future to avoid a debacle like this again. The bite size mango pieces in the small packages are chewy, tasty and a wonderful snack.

NOTHING like the dried mango you get in the 2.6 ounce packages where it is small bite sized pieces that melt in your mouth and are chewy... these are big pieces that will snap in half if you bend them.... i will not be purchasing these again, its worth the extra cash to get the small bags , at least you know what you are getting....

I keep a bag in my desk drawer at work, and one in the cabinet at home, ALWAYS in stock. $20-25 for 2 lbs of dried mango is a fantastic deal, too, especially for organic fruit. These are amazing in muffins, cookies, any sweet snacks, they are great plain, dipped in chocolate, peanut butter, whatever. There are a million things you can do with these. I hope Bare Fruit ends up with more dried organic fruit... I'd love to see papaya, kiwi, etc. For now, the mango and pineapple are AMAZING... have yet to try the apple and others.

review/text: I should have read other comments with 1 or 2 stars!<br /><br />I usually order dried mangoes from other brands and they are a little pricey, so I decided to try this one: It's price looks reasonable and it says it's organic. It's been two minutes since I received it and I already started to feel regret for this product. As other people mentioned it was cut in too small pieces, so too dry, and sometimes hard to chew. Dried mangoes are not supposed to be this dry. I suspect that this company imported dried mangoes from Southeast Asia in big boxes and divided them into smaller bags.<br /><br />It tastes less sweet than all dries mangoes I have ever had: it tastes like dried apricots or apples, more sour than sweet. I don't know whether other manufacturers add sugar when they dry mangoes and this one doesn't or these ones are just a less sweet(worse) kind because the bags don't have any nutrition info. I cannot return it because it comes in an aluminum bag and I already opened it. If it came in a plastic bag I would have definitely returned it.<br /><br />In sum, this is not dried mangoes that I expected. I give two stars only because it's less expensive than other dried mango brands. I know there are many people who like it and I strongly recommend they try other brands: they are more juicy, sweet and flavorful.

review/text: The picture has mangoes in squares and the two times I ordered the mangoes they were in whole pieces. When I asked to know what happened they wouldn't or couldn't tell me and I don't think I am going to order food from Amazon ever again.

review/summary: Strange smell and taste
review/text: I didn't actually taste this, but I thought it had a strange smell.  My husband and my son love the dried mango we get at Costco so I thought I'd try this since it's organic.  Neither one of them will eat it....they think it has a strange taste.  Unfortunately, I might as well have thrown $20 in the trash can because that's where this mango ended up.

review/summary: really delicious!
review/text: I used to be able to buy these at our local grocery store but recently I found that they were no longer on the shelves. Of course I found them on Amazon.com and brought them right away; they arrived in just a few days. And they are just delicious! Hot and spicy but not so spicy that you can't eat them - we put them in taco salads, omelets, on regular green salads, you name it. Buy some, you won't regret it at all!
