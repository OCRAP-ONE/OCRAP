review/summary: Blackberry Delight!
review/text: *****<br />This Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.<br /><br />The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!<br /><br />Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Another Flavor and another thumbs up!
review/text: This is the second flavor from Izze I have tried.  The first was the Clementine.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.<br /><br />This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories.

review/summary: A Really Smart Idea
review/text: If you enjoy pairing tea with honey then the Le Grand Miel might become the favorite honey for French Vanilla Tea. The Bigelow tea has a distinctive flavor and the smooth perfection of creamy rich Le Grand Miel blends effortlessly to create a tea experience.<br /><br />Tasting a spoonful of this honey is truly a revelation. This is how honey should taste. All too often honey is syrupy but mild and lacking in any texture. This honey has a unique creamy almost melted caramel texture with a smooth melting quality that is reminiscent of fresh breezes over open fields.<br /><br />The insightful use of a pail makes the use of this honey a dream. No longer do you have to worry about honey dripping down the sides of plastic bottles or glass containers.<br /><br />The honey is safely stored away in a sealed container inside the pail and travels very well through the mail. I will be ordering this again!<br /><br />Le Grand Miel is not just honey, it is an experience of perfection! If you love using honey in your tea, this is the one to buy because it enhances the flavor and adds a delicate perfume to tea drinking pleasure.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: A Yummy Adventure!
review/text: Don't be afraid to try something new!<br /><br />So this matcha is very earthy smelling in the dry form. When I opened the bag there was really nothing remarkable about the smell other than sort of an earthy aroma mixed in with the matcha aroma. I shrugged and was like "okay" lol I just didn't know what to think. I have never heard of Lucuma let alone had Lucuma before so what do I know!?!<br /><br />I did however want to expand my horizons and the health benefits of Lucuma really interested me as well. Especially helping with skin inflammations and as an immune system booster!<br /><br />So I prepared the matcha of course and took a sip. It just tasted like matcha but of course a Red Leaf Tea quality matcha which equals GOOD STUFF!<br /><br />I added my ice and milk - as in my typical latte preparation of course, but this time did not yet add the splash of vanilla creamer. Took a sip - still the same - wonderful matcha flavor, but nothing else.<br /><br />So then I added my splash of vanilla low fat creamer, hummm now this is an interesting turn of events. I taste a light fruitiness here! Is it my imagination perhaps? Is it wishful thinking? Is it that somehow magically the creamer brought out the fruity flavor? Maybe it is a mental thing since this is now the way I usually enjoy my matcha - I have myself fooled into thinking things always taste better this way? I don't know. I am willing to admit if that is the case but maybe had I just added some sugar (there is sugar in the creamer I am sure - its not sugar free and even if it were it would have some kind of sweetener in it in the place of sugar right?). So I am thinking ... this must be a fruit that is complimented and made more predominant with the addition of some kind of sugar, not the creamer at all!<br />&#8232;So next time I have this I will leave the creamer out and add some sugar which ironically I had considered doing before adding my creamer but I just didn't want THAT much sugar in my matcha. Still for the sake of science next time I will!<br /><br />So then, how does this matcha TASTE? Well, its matcha tasting, with this light juicy like flavor similar to a melon. The fruit looks like an avocado to me. I looked up the Lucuma Fruit and found that it is supposed to have a flavor similar to a sweet potato and maple and you know what I do get that! Its light mind you the matcha flavor itself is the predominant flavor here. It is richer as a matcha though and I think that is due to the Lucuma! Still I get this melon flavor too. It truly is interesting and nothing about it tastes bad at all. I just don't really have my mind wrapped around it yet HOWEVER if you are adventurous and want to try something out of the box this is a good one to select for sure!

review/text: Taste & quality before corporate productivity! Pomi produces some of the highest quality packaged tomato products with the added bonus of being GMO and BPA free.  And it's not just the fact that they are packed in Tetra-pack that makes them BPA free, it's also because they are not stored/transported in any BPA lined containers before final packaging.  As far as GMO's, it looks like we are going to have to source produce from European countries that require GMO ingredient labeling until the USA catches up.

review/summary: Great product and BPA-FREE!
review/text: I had been using Muir Glen Organic whole/diced tomatoes, but after having had cancer I read a lot of research publications indicating that BPA's estrogen mimicking effects can be quite dangerous. BPA found in cans with acidic foods are some of the worst since the chemical is leached out even more. The same is true of plastic containers with BPA -- acid, heat or surface abrasion lead to much greater leaching into the food.<br /><br />Although Muir Glen is promising to get rid of BPA in their can liners, they are replacing it with some unspecified 'vinyl-based substitute'. If you want to get their cans without BPA, look for a use-by date of around the summer of 2013. [This info is per a conversation with their customer service representative.]<br /><br />I had heard about Pomi Tetra-pak products before -- Mario Batali and other foodies/chefs have recommended them so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />The tomatoes are naturally grown in Italy without pesticides and have no salt added. I used them to create a wonderful marinara sauce. They taste great and I am very happy with the quality.

review/summary: No BPA tomatoes!
review/text: This is the only company that I can find that packages their stewed/diced tomatoes in BPA-free containers.  Regular canned tomatoes get BPA from the plastic coating that lines the can.  The acidity of the tomato juice enhances the extraction of the BPA.  This is a tasty product in addition to being safe.  Because it is pricey, I freeze any left-over tomatoes to use in other recipes.

review/text: If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

review/summary: Christmasy heaven!
review/text: Alriiiight I am so glad I decided to get this one now! I definitely debated as to whether I should drink it before Christmas. My curiosity got the better of me and I had to open it when it arrived. Oh! The smell is creeeeamy. It reminds me a lot of Bavarian Cream matcha but with a hint of allspice.<br /><br />I whipped it up and added a bit of sugar. Eggnog as a beverage is usually thick and creamy and coats your throat! I routinely cut mine with milk to make it a little more thin. This technique also makes the Eggnog last longer! The taste of the matcha reminds me a lot of my "milked" down version - the texture as well!<br /><br />For my next cup I upped the creamy ante and added cold milk (I'm not a hot Eggnog drinker, always has to be cold!). This helped a lot with the eggnog taste! It was sweet and just a tad of allspice was present. I'll admit the taste does remind me more of the Bavarian Cream than Eggnog - but that is not a problem in this household!<br /><br />All in all it's a very tasty matcha - does leave a bit to be desired when it comes to associating with the name, but the amazing flavour certainly makes it worth it. Once I get some spiced rum, it'll be splashed in with vigor!

I instantly started singing Fa la la la la ...<br />A huge smile came to my face. &#8232;I knew this was going to be a re-order SOON!<br />Then I took my first sip.<br />It needed sugar.<br />I was a little deflated.<br />I mean it was good and all but its one of those flavors you just know needs a little push to make it POP.<br />So a little sugar was added.<br />Better but it does not have the wow factor I was hoping.<br />Now please, bear in mind, I about had a special moment when I smelled it in dry form. My eyes literally rolled back in my head so my expectations were REALLY high!<br />It is quite pleasing nonetheless but its not going to knock Butterscotch or Macadamia Nut out of my top two list.<br />I will play around with this one some more though to see what I can do with it. It may be better iced as I had this one straight with a little milk which made it sort of luke warm.<br />Still, this is going to score in the high 80' as really there is nothing bad you could get from Red Leaf its just now that I have tried so many I do have my favorites that others need to stand up to.

review/summary: Nog Nog Noggin' on heaven's door....
review/text: Oh, egg nog. When Red Leaf Tea first contacted me, asking what flavors of matcha I'd be interested in trying, my immediate response was this. Egg nog. Oh goodness, egg nog. Please, oh please, egg nog. When the holidays come around, I miss it with a burning passion. There's just too much cream in it for it to be worth the risk, unfortunately. We have been able to find soy nog, but it's just not the same. But I have to say, it does the trick when I'm really just dying for a cup of nog. It certainly brought my father in law and me closer last Christmas when he was always more than happy to get me a glass of soy nog so he had an excuse to grate fresh nutmeg on top. He cracks me up.<br /><br />So this matcha had high, high, high expectations to live up to. It was delicious, very much so, but a little weak. I got a hint of eggnog flavor that was greatly overshadowed by the flavor of the matcha. Which isn't a bad flavor at all, it just isn't what I want when I drink egg nog. Maybe a little soy milk will bring out that creaminess for me and give me that egg nog flavor I crave.

review/summary: Delicious, spot on, Eggnog Matcha!
review/text: While being vegan/vegetarian I've ventured into Soy nog. IMO, the stuff is terrible! It's watery, barely flavored, no depth and the eggy part tastes stale and weird. I've tried a bunch of different brands and never found one I remotely liked. When I saw Red Leaf Tea's Eggnog matcha, hey.. this might have some potential to have an eggnog on my terms!<br />Out of the package, the eggnog matcha smells slightly eggy and spicy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional hot matcha, I can taste the eggnog, but in matcha form! The base of bold green tea is there, with a eggy taste second, with a vanilla and nutmeg hit. This matcha is also slightly sweet. No bitterness or astringency.<br /><br />Now the best part, eggnog matcha prepared as a latte! I made mine cold, whisking 1/2tsp of egg nog matcha into some light soy milk and a little sweetener. I find the eggy taste is the strongest! I love eggy taste! Next is the creamy vanilla and a hint of spice.<br /><br />The only thing missing for this to be perfectly like eggnog is the consistency. This might go well with a thicker soy milk (like the very vanilla Silk soy milk) or whisk in a little instant vanilla pudding mix. Of course, this egg nog matcha latte is green, so more festive!<br /><br />Tea peeps, give this one a shot!

review/text: Eggnog is really a seasonal treat, and most people associate it with Christmas. For me, though, it means fall! Because as soon as it hits the shelves, I buy some. Sadly, though, eggnog is not my friend. It's delicious, but so rich even a small mug can make me a bit nauseous and regretful. Yet I still go back! This matcha is a great way to get that warm, creamy, custardy taste without any of the regretful stares into a fat and sugar filled mug. Because, well, matcha is healthy!<br /><br />This is like eggnog's light, airy and more mature older sister. The grassiness of the matcha cuts through the custard richness, capturing all of the taste but none of that heaviness. The vanilla here is really nice, but my favorite part is the spices--that hint of nutmeg really brings together everything else! This is perfect as a hot latte, though even with just water it's quite delicious and dessert-y.

review/summary: Best coffee ever!
review/text: I'm not a coffee "gourmet", so my review is quite simple. I've tried dozens of K-Cup varieties, and, this is the best ever.  I like strong coffee, but, sometimes the bold varieties are somewhat bitter.  This one is strong yet smooth and has a very pleasant aroma as well.  My very favorite!  Would like to see this one on autoship!

review/summary: not really a dark roast
review/text: I don't really understand why this coffee is so popular.  I like dark, extra bold roasts such as Black Tiger, Emeril's, and GM Double Black Diamond.  However, this coffee tastes to me much more like a medium roast, has a bitter aftertaste and is not very flavorful. If you like dark roasts, I don't think this will be one of your favorites.  However, it has a lot of positive reviews all over the place.  I ordered it twice from two different sites (Keurig and Amazon) to be really sure that I did not just receive a bad batch, but I will not be ordering it again.

review/summary: Very Disappointed in the Flavor
review/text: Totally do not like the flavor of this coffee on it's own. It smells great when you first puncture the k-cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz brew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the "Dark Magic" and "Double Black Diamond" k-cups.

review/summary: Too Weak!!!!!!!!
review/text: My wife is the coffee drinker in the house and we have tried many BOLD blends over the last couple of years. She found the Tullys Italian Roast to be far too weak even on the lowest Kureg setting. The only one we have found that meets her standards is Timothy's Parisian Nights. If you like a nice bold cup of Joe then she would recomend the Timothy's hands down. Amazon no longer sells the Timothy's by auto shipment so we had to go to the Green Mountain website and get the auto shipment there. Good luck

review/summary: Italian roast - just how i like it
review/text: After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup "flavors" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a "bold" coffee - I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire.

review/summary: This is "the one"
review/text: I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.'  The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can "think out of the k-cup."

review/text: My first "pod" coffeemaker was a Senseo, now relegated to the garage. Limited coffee options. Weak tasting coffee. Bought the Keurig based on Amazon reviews and liked it from the first. Now I love it, because I found a dark, deeply satisfying roast that makes my day. Full on coffeehouse flavor with no bitter aftertaste. It's one of three featured varieties in our office-- Timothy's Breakfast Blend, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast. We have all three on subscription and they're a hit with both staff and client partners. BTW, my personal choice is almost always this one.

review/text: You should stop selling these DEFECTIVE Tully's products!<br /><br />I bought 2 packages of Tully's Italian Roast K-cups (48 cups) on July 20, 2011. I quickly discovered that all were defective. The airtight seal on each and every K-cup was broken and, when put into the Keurig coffeemaker, it spilled coffee grounds into both the coffee and the machine.<br /><br />I contacted Tully's customer service line, explained what'd happened and they couldn't have been more rude, condescending and unhelpful. They refused to send a refund or coupon through Amazon (to eventually credit my account) unless I sent these two boxes back and they inspected them. By the time these were opened a month later, the Amazon packing was long gone and these crappy K-cups were despoiling our pantry. My wife tossed them in disgust.<br /><br />Our first and last purchase from Tully's. Shame on them for such lousy customer service and for failing to stand by their products!.

review/summary: A little weak....
review/text: I'm an avid drinker of bold coffees...Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Timothy's Midnight Magic are my two favorites.  I love to sample new flavors.  I tried Tully's Sampler which included Italian Roast, French Roast, Kona and House.  In the sampler package I found the Italian to be the strongest and most flavorful with French Roast a close second. I could get a nice bold flavor with the largest cup setting on my Kuerig.  Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.  You'll get House and Kona which are both very medium along with two good strong/bold flavorful brews in the French and Italian.

review/summary: Great coffee - bad customer support
review/text: This is a great coffee.  This is not in its original packaging.  I will assume this is shipped from bulk as the k-cups are thrown into a shipping box.  The order is for 50 pieces.  I counted the k-cups (only due to the way they were packaged) and the order is short 3 pieces.  The contents were only 47 pieces.  I contacted the seller but got no response.  I will update as this evolves.

review/summary: Almost my favorite K Cup
review/text: I still think that the Keurig idea is the best thing for coffee since the grinder. I have had my problems mechanically with the machines but I put up with them because of the good coffee I can get and Keurig does a great job with customer service in my experience. I've been buying Tully's Itailian Roast for quite a while now and love it's full flaver and aroma. In fact I pretty much only buy Tully brand coffee now. I love the Kona blend and that is my favorite right now although I still haven't tried all the ones I'd like to try. It is of course especially good when Amazon puts the Italian Roast on sale because then I really stock up. Try it, you'll like it!!

review/text: The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.  However, we have an explosion with about every other k-cup.  The foil seal on the top breaks and coffee and grounds spew out the top.  Wouldn't be surprised if shipping in the summer heat weakened the adhesive that seals the foil.  I'd buy it again because I like the coffee so much, but be prepared to clean up messes if you get a batch of k-cups like we did.

review/summary: Good Morning Cup
review/text: Love my Keurig Coffee Maker for convenience, but hard pressed to find a K-Cup that is strong enough for my first morning cup without a bitter taste.  Tully's Italian does the job.  I drink my coffee black and like a rich coffee taste, Tully's Italian does the job. Shipment arrived promptly in good condition, although the packing box was damaged, torn and crushed.  A book was packed on the bottom without padding and was badly bruised and rumpled, but the coffee came through okay.  I complained to Amazon but never heard back from them with a sorry or offer to replace the book even though I explained it had been purchased for a gift and was now unfit to use as such.  I explained it was a poor job of packaging a soft cover book, since there was no padding or buffer under or around the book and it was jammed into the bottom of the box -- Amazon never responds to complaints about damaged goods.

review/summary: WOW! I can taste the difference
review/text: First of all- I am not a sophisticated coffee connoisseur.<br /><br />I actually think that McDonald's coffee is far more drinkable than Starbuck's burnt rubbish.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as K-Cups, I used to buy "Timothys" and it met my needs.<br /><br />But when I tried Tully's Italian blend for first time today, wow!!- this is very appealing and is so easy to drink. Just the right strength and kick.<br /><br />I noticed that the lids on the k-cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit - clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.<br /><br />I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much - but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.<br /><br />I do not know if the "bulge" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K-cups for a long time.

The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee.

review/text: I have been drinking tully's for a while now and I have finally taken the time to type a review. If you are looking for a strong, yet smooth and refined coffee this is it! It is not bitter nor does it leave an after-taste. I have turned so many of my friends and family on to it, that they only drink this brand themselves; many of them switching over to a Keurig just for it. I am an extreme coffee drinker and have experienced the bitter and waterty varieties of coffee, so I know bad coffee when I taste it. Tully's is my favorite coffee and is absolutely the best I have tried and the only kind I will buy.

I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7-11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain). This coffee has a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness and none of the bitterness going down. I could not recommend it more. This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM.

There is just something great about the aroma and taste of this Italian Roast. As mush as I didn't want to give any of mine away, I wanted others to try it and hear if they agree and THEY DID. I had everyone asking where I bought it so they could get their own.  Now I am out and need to buy more.  I thought it would be no big deal b/c I have more of another brand to drink, but it's just not the same, coffee in the morning can make your day and if it's not the right one....well, you know. I will continue to buy Tully's Italian Roast and so will my friends and family whom have tried it.

review/text: The arrival of a K-cup coffee maker in our home has been somewhat controversial because we didn't brew a truly great cup of coffee for several weeks after we got it. We kept working through samples of different flavors, and finally found this.  To be honest, I still don't think it's truly great -- not as good as what we were able to make before w/a conventional drip coffee maker or French Press -- but it's pretty darn good.  But measured against the rest of the field, it's the best we've tried, thus the high rating.

review/text: This is by far the best Keurig coffee I've had! I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I do enjoy a nice bold coffee (9yrs living in Europe will do that). This is the first Keurig coffee to actually give me flashbacks to my time in Europe...bravo Tully's, job well done!

review/summary: coffee
review/text: I like Keurig coffee & especially like the italian roast. The Tully italian roast has a pleasant aroma & no after taste. I like the quantity of 50. I am a real coffee drinker & so this way I don't have to be purchasing real often.

review/summary: K-Cups work great. Coffee Fantastic
review/text: There is absolutely no problem with these K-Cups. There may have been one in the past-but not now. Tried 3 different types, all worked. Have re-ordered, still no problems. Do not pass up trying this coffee. The Italian roast is the best we have ever had.

review/summary: Good for a preground coffee
review/text: I would like have more of a kick, but it's a lot better than most Keurig and superior to our local Dunkin Donuts fresh brew. Dunkin's K-cup is not in the same ballpark.
