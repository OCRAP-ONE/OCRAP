review/summary: Not Quite Everlasting...
review/text: My two Siberian Huskies were able to remove the Everlasting Treat Refill from the ball within about 15 minutes and devour the treat in short order.  I won't bother buying additional "Not-So-Everlasting" refills, but I was able to place different types of treats in the ball - including Iams dog biscuits, Trader Joe's beef rolls (broken into smaller pieces), and freeze dried liver training treats.  The treat balls are a softer texture than a Kong toy, but still quite durable.

review/summary: excellent toy
review/text: I love this toy it keeps my dog busy for a long while.  He has not been able to get the top off without help.  He's a year old Gordon Setter who has broken beef bones open!  When I am out of the refills I use turkey hot dogs and place them inside.  It keeps him busy for quite a while.  He's VERY food motivated and hotdogs are a favorite. He is able to get his tongue inside for a taste and nibble pieces of it, but cannot get the whole piece out easily. We have a large one and I think it will help him through the rest of puppyhood and for a long while to come.

review/summary: Horrible business model.
review/text: I don't know how StarMark makes any money.  Other dog toy manufacturers make weak, flimsy things that my 75 lbs. pit bull chews to shreds in seconds - so I have to constantly buy new ones.  However, my friend (another pitty owner) gave us the large Everlasting Treat Ball and even after three years, its the only toy my dog hasn't destroyed - it's his favorite.  The inner cavity is pretty roomy, and the material is strong enough to withstand some pretty determined gnawing.  If you have a really smart breed, they'll managed to figure out how to free treats after some pretty intense studying, but even after that this toy is useful for many more play activities.

review/summary: Does the Trick...
review/text: I got this toy hoping for something that would last longer than 10 minutes which was the max it took our German Shepherd to chew up any bone ever given to him.  It does!!  It wouldn't last all day if I just let him chew on it as much as he wants but it lasts so much longer than anything else we've ever given to him.  I also have a smaller dog who could chew on it for hours and hours.  Totally worth it.  If you have a major chewer don't expect it to last and last and last but expect it to last a lot longer than any other chew.

review/summary: My Dogs Love This!
review/text: I originally purchased only 1 of these for my Labrador because she loves her Kong so much.  My Border Collie mix could usually care less for such things.  However, when the treat ball arrived, they fought over it so I had to buy another one!  Unfortunately, they still bicker over them, which is odd because my dogs NEVER fight with each other so we'll see.  It may be a toy that only gets put down when I am home to watch them.  But judging by their behavior, this treat ball is the greatest thing ever!

review/text: My Foxhound doesn't go through toys like most dogs do, in that he doesn't shred them.  But he does get bored very, very easily.  He'll play with a new toy and only that one toy for a day or so and get bored with it.  Then I brought this home.  He loves it so much, if I leave it in his crate, he'll keep himself up for hours chewing at it.  It's also his favorite indoor "fetch" toy as it bounces in a lot of weird directions.  The treat caps he can chew and lick on for several days before I have to buy a new one.<br /><br />The best dog toy I've ever purchased, and the only one my dog has ever truly loved.  Wonderful buy.

review/text: My Pit Bull loves this toy.  At first he wouldn't touch it, but I put just a touch of Kong peanut butter on the ball and put it in his crate.  He spent the next two hours devouring the "everlasting" treat.  So the treat ISN'T everlasting, but the fun is!  I put all sorts of things in the ball.  I've put dry cat food, about half of his dinner (dry dog food), treats, you name it.  He even carries the thing around when it's empty.  Great toy for entertaining destructive pups!

review/text: I ordered the small and my little maltese loves it!  She licks it, carries it around, bounces it, etc.  But the other dog tried to get the treat out and when she couldn't (and she's pretty tough)-- she lost interest.<br /><br />I'm leaving off a star because I think the price point is too high.  I've had just as much success entertaining and stimulating my dogs with other treat balls...like the Omega orange ball.  That one can be filled with a treat(food) of your choice and you're not bound to buy one specific filler.

review/summary: Best treat yet!
review/text: I got this treat about a month ago for my extremely active poodle. She can destroy most toys in minutes flat, even other "indestructible" ones. She got the insert that comes with this ball out pretty quickly, but I've found that a Snausage or other large treat in the center will entertain her for an hour easily. The ball shows no sign of wear and tear yet, and my heavy chewer uses it at least 3 or 4 hours a day every day. Best treat/toy I've gotten for her yet, I'd defiantly buy it again.

review/summary: Good stimulation but has its flaws...
review/text: We have both a medium and a large version of this toy.  We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months.  Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole.  As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it.  It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it.  After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.<br /><br />I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up.  Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play.  This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with.  If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it.  Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.<br /><br />One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy.  In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.<br /><br />In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy.

review/summary: Great product, even better customer service!
review/text: I did think this was a little pricey for a dog toy that might be destroyed within minutes, but I took a chance anyway.  I am glad I did...my dog loves this thing.  He was able to get the caps that came with it out quickly, but when I bought replacements they looked to be a little different texture and he has not popped these out yet.  He also loves it when I put treats inside for him to chew out which I do without using the caps.<br /><br />I did have an issue after about a month when I purchased the new caps.  Since he was not able to pop the caps out (which he shouldn't be able to do), he was chewing constantly and did cause a couple of scissor like cuts in the rubber with his teeth.  It's not bad, but it could result in rubber chunks coming off.  I wasn't sure if anything could be done, but I contacted the customer service of the company that makes this and they were extremely helpful.  They replied to my email same day (that never happens!) and they did say that they have had a few cases where this has occured in the rounded edge of the ball.  They also said they were sending me their everlasting fun ball free of charge as that type of toy might work better.  Wow!  That's customer service.

review/summary: Not better than a Kong
review/text: I got this toys for my pom/corgi mix, thinking it would be a nice alternative to her Kong which doesn't really hold onto treats (she's really good at getting dry treats out in 2 minutes flat).  She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last. She chewed them up very quickly.  I wish I would have gotten a bigger size, one so the little everlasting treat would last longer, and two so that I could put more loose treats inside, and three in the hopes that she has a harder time biting down on the treat (which pops the sides out).<br /><br />All in all, I think the rubber is high quality grade, but nothing beats a Kong when it comes to price and the number of ways you can stuff it to make a treat last!

review/summary: Great to keep busy
review/text: All three of my dogs love this toy. I have used other treat toys (i.e. Kong, tricky treat ball, buster food cube, canine genius) but this is their favorite and last the longest. My Mini Aussie is a tough chewer and she has not been able to destroy this. (Wish I could say the same for our furniture, base boards and several toys!) I put disks in both side and fill the middle with kibble or other treats. It takes them a couple of days until all the treats are gone. Great for when we have guests or want to sit down and watch a movie. I love it, love it, love it!!! It is important to get the right size. I use the small on my 8lb dog and the medium on my 14 lb terrier and 17 lb mini aussie. I agree it is not the best for crate training, for that I would stick to the Kong because you don't need space to roll it around to get the treats out. But for everything else, this is the best treat toy!

review/summary: Good, but get the right size
review/text: We got the smallest size for our maltese/bichon mix who is about 13 lbs, and he was able to pop out the 'cap' within minutes... and we are pretty sure he ate the whole cap.  So then we went out and got the large size, and he is IN LOVE.  He's actually so addicted to it, I worry a bit! Moral to the story is, make sure you get a size large enough that your dog cannot squeeze the entire thing to pop out the cap!<br /><br />My other little dog (6 lb yorkiepoo) likes the smallest size just fine, but doesn't seem to care a whole lot for the 'caps' themselves; instead he likes it when I stuff Bil Jac treats into the ball.<br /><br />Both are pretty destructive chewers, but so far so good.  Personally I find the caps stinky and it smells up the room... but if it makes my boyz happy, then I'm willing to tolerate the smell.

review/summary: Lasts a long time
review/text: Got these for my two papillon pups who are always looking for something to get into/destroy.  They love their Ziggies and Lobos but they fly through them so fast - they're gone in under 5 minutes!  I wanted something that would keep them busy for a while.<br /><br />They definitely love the taste of these treats, and they have a fun time playing with the toy.  The only complaint I had was that they were able to pop the treats out with ease, which is why I gave this 4 stars rather than 5. It isn't a big deal, I'll just pop them back in, but I find myself having to do so pretty often.  Even when they do pop the treats out, they chew on them, and they still last!  They finally started destroying the toy itself after a couple of weeks (and a few treat refills).  The inside of the plastic is beginning to rip, but given that many other toys/treats they have last no more than 5 or so minutes, I was pleased with this.

review/summary: Not everlasting - caution leaving dogs without supervision
review/text: I have a Lab who is a moderate chewer (toys only). I gave her the treat ball one day for about 45 minutes and then took it away for bedtime.  The second time I gave her the ball with the same treat, she had the treat out in about a half hour and ate the whole treat in minutes. I would not recommend leaving your pooch with this without supervision - once she removed it, the treat was big enough that my dog could have choked on it while eating it.

review/summary: Looked neat, but disappointing
review/text: I thought this looked like a pretty neat toy, so I bought one.  Like the above reviewer, my dogs couldn't deal with the treat that covers one end of the ball.  They licked it a few times, pushed the ball around a few times, and that was it.  They could not figure out how to get out the little treats inside, because there are flaps covering the opening, which you bend to pop in the little treats.  These flaps keep the little treats from falling out when the ball moves, but they were just thick enough so that my dogs couldn't figure out how to push them aside to get at the treats.<br /><br />In all fairness, my dogs are chihuahuas--the biggest is about 7 pounds -- and a larger dog may very well have more fun with this.  Sadly, my dogs just seem to be too small for the small size.

review/summary: Everlasting Treat Ball - My Dog Destroyed It On The Ride Home
review/text: I bought an everlasting treat ball because everyone told me how wonderful they are, and I have a Jack Russell Terrier who is fairly calm for the breed, but does tend to have a bit of a seperation anxiety problem as soon as I leave.  I got it yesterday, popped the caps on either end of the ball, and gave it to him on the five mile ride back to my apartment.  By the time I had gotten home, he had already popped one of the caps off and chewed it up, so I took that one away and popped the third cap on, and gave it back to him, and both caps were off and eaten within probably fifteen minutes of being at home.  I am completely unimpressed, I spent over $16 on these treats and the ball, and the Everlasting Treat ball was useless in a matter of minutes.  I still really like the idea of this product, but the ball itself needs to be manufactured in a way that would really grip the treats a lot better.

review/text: So I got this for my Belgian Malinois who is ball-crazy and always destroys both plushy toys and kongs alike. A friend of mine who has a large shepherd said her dog loved to toss it around the house, chew on the treat on the inside, repeat. He absolutely loved it. In hopes mine would love it the same, I got it. BOTH treats were out of the ball in about five minutes(not exaggerating!) but lucky me my dog loved the bounce the ball had and continued to play with it. I put some rolled cooked bacon mixed with raw beef in the very center of it, and he is hard at work right now trying to pry it out of the center. Overall it was a good buy, but not because of the "challenge". Only because my dog loves the ball itself. I wouldn't purchase the treat inserts again, thats for sure!

review/summary: Not So Everlasting
review/text: I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs.  One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys.  I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided.  On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them.  In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls.  By three hours there were no treats left in either of them.  Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too.  The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room.  I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name.

She loves the ball so I will probably put her biscuits in the very inside and let her play with it that way. I regret spending so much on this toy.

review/summary: Easily Destroyed
review/text: I bought this for my German Shepherd who is a very destructive chewer. Within 10 minutes he'd popped out and eaten the treat, and then proceeded to tear the ball to little bits. If your dog likes to destroy toys I wouldn't recommend this. It definitely is NOT everlasting or durable and is way too expensive for only 10 minutes of enjoyment.

review/summary: Disappointing.
review/text: I have a shep/akita mix, but I bought this more for my coonhound, who will eat ANYTHING.  Anything!  Especially if it's made out of food.  :)  I put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest.  The problem with this toy is that it's hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing.  The shape is putting them off.  She later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw, but got so little out of it (a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward) that she lost interest - which is saying a lot, since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb.<br /><br />Finally, I took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs - instand results.  They are working away at them right now.  I think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don't break into pieces easily if they do at all.  Some dogs love this!  Not mine, apparently.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to try it with their dogs, email me.  I have one, never been chewed!  Maybe your dog will like it more than mine.  Five bucks!  ;)

review/summary: Dogsitter extraordinaire!
review/text: I paid way more for this than the current sale price at my local pet store ($26).  My bull terrier puppy had surgery yesterday and we were struggling to find something to turn his attention away from the stitches.  I put treats through the other side and only put one of the treat balls on the one end, saving the second for later.  He did manage to finally dislodge the treat, but even eating that took longer than his Booda Bimples.  So overall I'm very happy.  After he finished the treat on the outside, he had to find a way to get the other treats on the inside.  He's a 50# bull terrier puppy, and the large suited him well.  I did not notice any issues with him being able to handle it.  The material is durable and dishwasher safe, so it will provide plenty of hours of fun and the quick convenience of the dishwasher.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great concept - wish it was more durable
review/text: My two Papillons went crazy over these treat balls.  The Everlasting Treats that pop into the ball are extremely long lasting; unfortunately the ball itself wasn't as durable as I had hoped it would be.  It took only three times of playing with the ball for about a half hour each time for one of my dogs to chew a few chunks off of the ball.  Remember, this is a six pound dog; I don't know how long these balls would last with a larger breed.  I think the concept is great and the treat portion of the toy is terrific, but I wish that the ball would be made of a more durable material.

review/summary: Depends on the dog
review/text: This product is either a godsend or a waste, depending on the dog. We got one for our two fosters - an 85-lb Black Lab who could get the treat out of the ball in 10 seconds flat, and a 65-lb Lab mix who will contentedly lick at the treat for days until it ends up as a ring that we have to pull out of the ball. Since the Lab found a home (yay!) the Lab mix has been absolutely LOVING this toy.<br /><br />If you have a dog who can pull the treat out, try putting the treat in upside down - the concave bottom of the plug makes it at least a little harder for them to get their teeth into.

It seems that in less than an hour my dog had destroyed it. He chewed the rubber trying to get to the treat. I threw away the ball so he wouldn't accidentally eat it. It was a good idea but needs to be stronger like the Kong.

review/text: We have a chow mix who's never occupied for long.  I read the reviews on this one and had hoped to keep her busy for an hour or two.<br /><br />She's too smart!  Within 10 min she figured out how to wedge the treat out of the ball and crunched it away.  Total elapsed time the first time we gave it to her - 15 minutes.  Each subsequent time - 5 min.<br /><br />Our other dog can spend up to 30 min on it (if the chow doesn't steal it for herself).<br /><br />We gave some as christmas gifts, and the other dogs took a bit longer (and a chihuahua now loves playing fetch with the empty plastic holder).<br /><br />It's a good product, just realize that the time it will occupy your dog is based on how determined they are to "kill" it and get the treat.

review/summary: Entertains my dog and distracts him from chewing on something valuable
review/text: I bought this toy in medium for my Cockapoo puppy because he is a big chewer and had been destroying blankets and comforters during the night.  Thanks to this toy I haven't found anything else destroyed.  He gladly chews on it for hours and is challenged enough that he still hasn't been able to get out all of the treats I put inside and it's been several days.  Despite this he persists on and is happy to continually knaw.  I also haven't had any issues with him getting the everlasting treat off.  It is still 100% intact.  This toy does a great job of standing up to his chewing and shaking.  While many other toys (including a stuffed bunny) have been distroyed this one is still intact without the smallest sign of a bite mark.  He doesn't seem to tire of playing with it and is as happy to be left alone chewing on it as he is to playing fetch with it.<br /><br />Overall this is a great toy and easily one of his favorites along with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong, Large Red</a>.  He loves both of them equally and they have done a great job distracting him from his distructive behavior.

review/summary: So-so
review/text: This toy was highly recommended by my trainer, so I thought I'd give it a try, desperate to find anything to keep my "little" guy (70+ lb Lab mix puppy) and my adult German Shepherd busy for more than a couple minutes.  The first time, the treats stayed in for about an hour but were devoured 5 minutes later.  I then tried the caps with the screw rod in the middle, my puppy had it disassembled and devoured in under 10 minutes (far less time than it took me to assemble).  Went back to the original caps and this time around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well.  Soon after, my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits.  While both of my dogs really loved it while it lasted, for the price of the toy and the price of the refills (which sell out from my local store so quickly I have a hard time getting them), for my guys, it just wasn't worth it, but for less aggressive chewers, this would be great.

review/summary: Can highly recommend
review/text: The ball arrives with an Everlasting Treat covering one end (side) of the treat ball and the other side open. My puppy was not able to get the treats out until I removed the end piece (which is a treat in itself) and now I can throw it to him and he'll play with it for hours! He isn't crazy about the little flavor treats that are made to go inside the ball, and I found that they crumble and get all over everything or get wet and stick inside, so I started filling the ball with cream cheese or little pieces of bologna or chicken and he'll work forever to get them out. His little teeth are needle sharp, but this ball has amazingly withstood the abuse of his constant chewing! Now that he has figured out how to get the treats out, I am going to replace one of the treat ends to present a new challenge. My only complaint is that the ball is hard to clean because there is a groove inside that makes it difficult to clean thoroughly. Regardless, it's well worth that minor problem!

review/summary: Good toy but could be better.
review/text: I gave my black Lab puppy a large Everlasting Treat Ball as a surprise treat today. He has been enjoying playing with the teething friendly rubbery treat ball a lot, and so far has not been able to chewed it up into pieces that could pose a choking or swallowing health concern, but he made short work removing and eating the two hard chicken flavor treat caps that seal into the rubber ball. The Foster and Smith brand beef and barley meat ball treats I put inside the treat opening in the rubber ball middle for added play fun and enticement have proved more difficult and entertaining for him to remove so far than the hard treat caps I had hoped would last longer as they where designed to do ideally. I think the Everlasting Treat Ball has value for doggie chew needs and entertainment, but so do many other less expensive doggie toy/treat options that don't require special refills, or pricey initial investments in.

review/text: I bought this Treat Ball with my Aussie puppy in mind; I wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate AND something that she couldn't destroy within a few minutes. She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly "Everlasting". Darn it! I was hoping I finally found something that the little herders couldn't immediately destroy!

review/summary: Forget the Everlasting treats, just put regular treats inside
review/text: I originally bought this product to use with the Everlasting treats.  My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure.  But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.<br /><br />I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right "not-too-fast, not-too-slow" rate.  Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours.  The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it.  This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable.  My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear.  I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.<br /><br />So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats.  I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work.  A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.<br /><br />It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.<br /><br />Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XAFTG">Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treats</a><br /><br />www.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1

review/summary: Depends on the dog
review/text: This kept by 150lb Giant Newf busy for an entire day - he couldn't get the treat discs out and because they are so hard he chewed on it for hours without eating them all.<br /><br />Then my 65lb hound dog stole it from him, quickly figured out how it worked and chewed up the BALL portion until the treats were accessible.  Within 15 minutes of her having it the ball was in pieces all over the floor and she had taken out both treat discs. There was $20+ down the drain.<br /><br />The ball and the treats are Made in China - the treats are rock hard, the main ingredient is wheat and I suspect it is closer to some sort of wheat gluten glue that hardens - when  wet it does smell a bit and does leave a mess on the carpet. The ball is a jelly plastic that has a strange odor - I had a really hard time getting the treats into the ball so not surprised that the one dog couldn't get them back out. But if your dog can figure it out, or gets frustrated quickly you'll be surprised at how fast that ball will be torn to pieces when the dog turns its chewing jaws from the treat to the ball. Have no idea what the ball is made of and if it is toxic or not so had take it away (and throw it away) before they had a chance to eat any of it by accident.<br /><br />So -<br />Pro: could potentially last your dog a long time and keep him occupied<br /><br />Cons: expensive, Made in China, wheat based treats (allergy alert) and not going to last long if you have a determined dog.<br /><br />Kongs are the only toys my dogs have never been able to tear apart, they are the only things that have survived from puppyhood to now grown, adult dogs.

review/summary: I Don't See The Issue...
review/text: I have a three year old pure-bred English Bulldog that is THE most powerful chewer I have ever seen. I only bought this toy about 3 hours ago and he's been gnawing away at it. So far, he hasn't put a noticeable mark on it yet and also hasn't popped the treat out of the center. So, I don't know how all these other dogs have managed to destroy their toy or retrieve their treat so fast. As another reviewer stated, I believe the treat ball would probably be best for the "dumb" dogs and the Bento ball for the "smart" chewers.  But, now at the 3.5 hour mark, my bulldog has tired himself out from chewing on the ball and it is sitting in front of him with noticable marks on the treat surface, but the blue ball still looks brand new (well, with a little slobber on it.)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy for your power chewing dogs!

He broke the rubber/gel molding in a few places within minutes such that he easily removed the included treat part.  I had stuck carrots, hotdogs, etc, in the "trap" center of the ball which gave him a little bit of a project.  Thus it seems to work okay as a puzzle for a little while.  However, I would bet this "trap" will only last a couple more uses as he seems to be able to break the product.<br /><br />I was hoping for a "puzzle" product to add variety to the kong he loves.  Unfortunately I wish now I had saved my money!  20+ dollars for 20+ minutes of dog fun, is not within my budget.<br /><br />Save your money.

By the way, my dog is not at all picky. He will play with anything and eat anything so this is a real first!<br /><br />Also, I looked at the ingredients for the treat and it's all absolute junk. The first ingredients are wheat and gluten.

review/text: Both of our dogs absolutely LOVE these and can stay occupied for at least an hour at a time knawing at it.  IMPORTANT TO CHOOSE A LARGE ENOUGH BALL so they can't get the treat out, as many reviewers have been frustrated by that.  If you have two or more dogs (we have a lab mix--loves to chew--and a french bulldog teething puppy),  I recommend getting all of yours in the larger size, so you don't have to keep track of who is chewing which one. Our dogs sometimes switch, and the lab can get the treat out of the medium ball. If in doubt, just get the largest one.  Our frenchie is perfectly happy with the larger size.

review/text: I have a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier.  She has chewed me out of house and home (literally).  She chewed a huge hole in my kitchen floor, all the way thru to the crawlspace, then proceeded to chew thru the back door (yep you guessed it... she succeeded).  Anyway, stuffed toys are a joke to her.  They last all of 2 minutes, no matter how "tuff" they claim to be.  She generally has no interest in the rubber "Kong" types, so I was skeptical about this Everlasting Toy.  Boy was I wrong.  She is completely addicted. She carries it everywhere.  The disk treat inside lasted about a day.  She had more fun licking it than trying to get it out of the toy.  She finally licked it down so far that it pretty much came out on it's own.  I stuffed little treats in the other side.  She could not put it down.  After going at it a full day, she finally got it empty.  I inspected it at that point.  Not a single puncture or tear.  This thing is amazing.  It was a little pricey at Petsmart.  I'll get the refills here.  Definately worth the $$.  She's about 18 lbs, so I got the medium size.  Perfect fit.<br />*** CON:  The Chicken flavor disks do smell a little yucky.  And, after awhile of constant licking, they also get a little slimey.  I would suggest keeping it off the furniture.

review/summary: get the right size
review/text: From everything I've read, you need to get the right size or your dog can pop out the treat.  We have a 16 lb pom/boston mix, she can't get the treat out of the medium.  I can see all the teeth marks in the everlasting treat, she is really working it.  I fill the other side with some of her daily kibble and she'll roll it around and get her kibble out.  I've put in other treats and she'll go after them too.  The flaps are rather thick, which makes it hard for the treats to come out.  Good for keeping the interest, but not so good for younger dogs that lose interest quickly.  She would have ignored this a month or two ago, at 8 months she can play with it longer.  I put in easy things to get out now, I'll make it harder in a week or two.  This treat, and the inserts, are on the expensive side, but it seems durable enough and she likes it.

review/summary: PERFECT Treat Ball!
review/text: There are so many ways to use this treat ball it will be quite awhile before your pet tires of it!  First you can use it with the included treat caps.  Put one in and your dog will lick it and enjoy it for hours. Be sure you purchase the right size treat ball for your dog - buy one too small and the dog will be able to pop the treat out and chew it up in no time.  Purchase the right size and it will be impossible to remove the treat cap, which is exactly how the toy is supposed to work.<br /><br />Another way to use the cap is to fill it with EveryFlavor Treats (sold separately) by the same company. These are small, soft treats, in many different flavors, that spill out slowly while the ball is played with.  Again, the idea is that the treats are metered out slowly.<br /><br />You can also feed your pet his or her daily kibble in it if it's of small enough gauge.  If you need to, you can clip back the rubber on the ball to make it easier.<br /><br />You can also fill it with a mix of kibble and peanut butter for a double treat.<br /><br />We have these in all three sizes because we have pup's that fit all three.  We have to keep the pets separated while they have them or the Brittany heads straight for this one because he can pull the cap out in about 10 seconds and then chew it up and swallow it in about 2 minutes - a tasty treat which we try to keep him from enjoying!<br /><br />Disclaimer:  We sell this product in our store and it's one of our best-sellers but we use it on a daily basis and have since they started making them.  We still have all our original balls, they're that tough!

review/summary: Bichon/Yorkie mix loves it!
review/text: I bought this for my Bichon/Yorkie pup.  She used to get separation anxiety and really hated being in her crate.  I thought having something to do in there might help.  It didn't.  I solved that problem another way.  But in the mean time this treat ball has become a favorite when she's not in her crate.  She loves it!  It keeps her occupied for hours and the treats do really last a long time (days).  I was so impressed I bought a larger version for my 18lb Bichon/Coton mix.  He loves his too! He's a pretty good chewer although his teeth aren't very sharp. We even bought one for our friends' dog, a 14 lb dachshund who can destroy anything.  He loves it so much his parents call it his "precious".  And, so far he has not destroyed it!  I would just caution that even though these may keep your dog occupied, you should still supervise him/her in case they do get the treat out (I always just put it back in) or if they manage to pull hunks of plastic off.  Hasn't happened for me, but I read that some of the larger breeds have managed it.

review/summary: Great concept - wish it was a bit more durable
review/text: My two little dogs absolutely LOVE the Everlasting Treats that fit into this ball.  This is a great concept, but the rubber is quite soft.  As soon as the treats started to wear down, my dogs began to chew pieces of rubber off of the ball itself.  From the description of this product, I thought the rubber that the ball is made of would be a little more durable than it is.  The replaceable treats, however, last an incredibly long time.  My dogs were totally obsessed with this toy.  My only recommendation is to monitor your dog with this toy and check for signs of wear. Had I replaced the treats sooner (before they had worn down and were difficult for the dogs to get to), I think that my treat balls would have lasted a lot longer.  I recommend this product only with supervision, as my dogs are only around six pounds each and chewed pieces off sooner than I thought they could.

review/summary: Not good for Giant breeds!
review/text: I have an Alaskan Malamute (120lbs) who I do not consider an aggressive chewer, but he is powerful. Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.<br /><br />However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days. Well worth it in her case.<br /><br />I think the key is getting a size appropriate for your dog. If your dog can fit the entire thing in its mouth, it's too small. When in doubt get the next size up, and if you have an XL mouthed breed don't bother.

The packaging states, "made with virtually indestructible material" and "great for powerful chewers", but neither of these statements were true.  The Everlasting Treat Ball is a very disappointing product which will be returned.  Do not bother purchasing this product unless you are only looking for an expensive five minutes of fun for your dog.

review/summary: Not for every, dog but nothing is.
review/text: For those of you with champion chewers, I would reccomend this whole heartedly.  I have one destructive chewer that loves it and takes him an hour or so to get the treat out, but if I put little treats inside it takes him alot longer (he even gives up on it).  I have another that has the treat out in 5 minutes and has the little treats out in about an hour (he then waits for the other dog to give up, then finishes that off too).  The blue silicone part is the toy they have had the longest and seems to still be lasting.  I have had it over 6 months.  I have the red fire hydrant one also and it is almost torn up and I have had it less time than this.  I think the configuration of the other allows my dog a better angle to chew (and thus destroy)the toy.<br /><br />I know some people who have destructive dogs complain that it does not last but I would venture to say thier dog is so destructive that nothing works.  I would be interested to know if it outlasted most other toys given to them.  I am not saying it will work for sure for your dog, but I do say it is worth a try, as I considered my dogs hopeless (they tore up everyting in 5 minutes or less) before I found this.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that if you moisten the edges the treat pops in easier (great to know because I was using a spoon to wedge it in).  Just make sure you let it dry before giving it to them so it is more difficult for your dog to get out and (love this tip) put the treat in upside down so the dome is facing inwards and the treat will last longer because it is more difficult for your doggie to get at.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: My dog is very high energy and pretty smart.  She loves this thing, but she always managed to pop out the inserts and eat them whole in under 5 minutes.  What I've started doing instead is inserting a small treat or two into the folds of the center.  This is much harder for her to get out and now this toy occupies her for hours.  It's a pretty durable material, but I'm sure it won't last forever.  I will happily buy another one, though, should it ever fall apart because she LOVES it so much now!  For instance, my dog usually flips out when we say the word "potty" (running laps around the house in excitement) because she knows she is going to get to go outside.  Well, when there is a treat in this thing, I practically have to pry it out of her mouth and hide it just so she will pay attention to the leash!  She almost carried it outside with her the first time I stuffed it with treats.  It's been a long time since I've seen my dog this happy with a toy and remain so content for so long.  Even when she shows interest in a toy initially, she usually gets bored with it rather quickly. Not this though!  I highly recommend this, even if you don't use it as intended!

review/summary: 1 ball, 2 treats = 3 hours for my pit
review/text: My pit mix is a pretty devoted chewer.  I put one everlasting treat into each side of my large everlasting treat ball (and I should mention that this itself took about ten minutes - those things are NOT easy to get in).  My superchewer managed to finish both treats in a marathon 3 hour chew fest. She hurt her leg this week and is supposed to be resting, so it was nice to be able to keep her happily occupied for a while.<br /><br />The ball itself is something we inherited from a friend's dog and we've had it for a while. I don't think it's indestructible but it's one of those toys that she prefers to carry around and play with than to chew.  We sometimes put her kibbles inside the toy and she likes that too - I would say that it ranks fourth in her heart after scented jolly balls, waggle toys and new tennis balls.

review/summary: 24 hours of chewing and licking but wont buy again
review/text: Our lab received this for Christmas. She loved the toy carrying it around all day licking or chewing on the treat cap. A couple of hours into the treat we noticed she would hack / cough as if a piece of the treat was caught in her throat and she needed water. Nothing alarming as her cough quickly cleared what was bugging her and she continued to feast on her treat. We noticed this happened a couple more times throughout the day. I picked up the treat to inspect it and the flavor cap was coming apart in pinch sized pieces. The blue portion was intact and was not showing signs of strain. The smell of the flavor cap was horrible, made me almost vomit but my dog loves it. Then we noticed our dog wasn't feeling so well. She had excessive gas that was room clearing. I looked up what could be causing this and most say its due to a diet change or low quality food being feed to the dog. I saw all kinds of remedy suggestions from rice and veggies to pepto. Her stool is soft but still firm so I am not alarmed. We are just going to ride out the effects and she will just play with the blue portion of her toy.  We feed our dog Blue Buff food so this large flavor cap could be a much lower quality resulting in her digestion issues.

She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!

When I first brought home the medium Treat Ball I was afraid that my three little ten pound dogs couldn't lift it. They had no problem lifting it and they couldn't pop out the treat. I had to buy three so they could each have their own. It was a good investment because they last at least a week and they really enjoy it.<br /><br />A few months after my review....My little dogs destroyed three of these. I still gave the ball four stars because I can't find anything else comparable. I don't like to give them too much rawhide.

Instead it keeps my corgi occupied for ages, and when he has to go in his crate I toss it in there to keep him busy. He loves it.

review/text: My 2 dogs absolutely LOVE these balls and the treats. When they see me pull out their blue ball, they get so excited because they know what's coming! They are both around 26 pounds and STRONG chewers. At first I bought the medium size balls but found that they were able to pop the treats out in about 1/2-1 hour. So, I switched to the large size and now they can't get the treat out and it takes them a LONG time to lick and chew on it until its finished. They cant pop the treat out until its almost completely finished. Thus,I would only recommend the large size for any dog over 20 pounds. These are great when you need to keep them occupied for an extended period.

review/summary: Better for those that aren't chewers
review/text: My dog quickly figured out that just biting this ball sideways caused the treat to pop out for easier munching.  He made quick work of the "everlasting" treat hunk once it was released from the ball and would repeatedly pop it back out if I reloaded it.  I now use this to just stuff regular treats inside of and it is mediocre.  Definitely not the best or longest lasting treat toy I've found.  For the price, it's just not worth it AT ALL.<br /><br />Perhaps smaller dogs or dogs that are less prone to chewing would get more long lasting enjoyment out of this.  It is more like the "10 minute treat crunching bonanza" for my boy than everlasting.<br /><br />The Premier Busy Buddy treat dispensing toys (particularly this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a>) are more durable, offer more options for filling, and are more difficult/entertaining for the dog...and also much cheaper!

review/text: My wife and I have a jack Russell mix (25 pounds) and a high energy Chihuahua mix (20 pounds) who we both adopted from shelters.  Whenever we would go out for a night on the town they would absolutely destroy everything! We were looking for a solution for months.  After spending money to baby proof every cabinet and buying yuck sprays we were at our whit's end!  While shopping for dog treats my wife came across the everlasting treat ball!  We ordered 2 and purchased extra discs because we thought that our dogs would surely go through the discs like they go through other treats.  Well, as soon as we got the ball we decided to try it out. We put their favorite sirloin flavored treats inside the bottom of the ball and put a disc on the top side.  We left for dinner and a movie and when we came home we were afraid at what we might find.  To our surprise and delight, they were still busy working on the ball!!  While they were able to get the sirloin treat out they were trying to destroy the disc instead of our stuff!! We have used about 3 discs in 3 weeks so they last a long time.  This works like a charm.  Each time we have to leave the house to go shopping, visit a friend, or go out on a date we leave them with the everlasting treat ball and they are entertained.  We do not let them play with it when we are home, this way they don't get tired of it!!  I highly recommend this product to anyone with small to medium sized dogs!

review/summary: What do you get the dog that has everything?
review/text: I will admit, my dog is spoiled. Not in a "dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled." Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat "caps." The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official "Everlasting" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it "just right." He eats like a cat (when he's hungry), but likes all kinds of food.<br /><br />Crockett and I both hope that this helps you choose well for your pet!

review/summary: Perfect for chewers!
review/text: I bought a medium everlasting treat ball a years ago when my corgi was a puppy. This toy is one of only two toys that she hasn't destroyed, and shes had it almost 4 years. Shes allergic to the ingredients in the caps, so I never get those, I just fill the blue central ball with treats and food. This keeps her busy for 20 minutes or so. The end caps dissolve into goo quicly anyway, so they really aren't worth getting.<br />Given that she's destroyed "undestructable toys," toys made out of firehose material, every stuffed toy, and even killed a kong, I must say that I am very very impressed with how well the treat ball holds up. The treat end caps aren't worth the money, but the central blue ball toy is worth every penny.

review/summary: Sturdy toy, but pricey
review/text: My dogs have chewed up every toy I have ever bought in less than 30 minutes.  I have two Jack Russells, and they are set on destroying everything that is theirs.  I bought two of these balls last Christmas and both are still 100% intact.  I hardly ever put treats in them and the male dog loves to play fetch with it or even just chew on it in front of the tv.  I give it 4 stars though because it costs a lot and the treats come out too easily.  Although, I would have spent well over $100 on other balls that they would have destroyed in the last year, so I guess when you look at it that way, it's more than worth its cost.

review/text: My dog loves the treats, but they don't stay in the ball long enough and once out they disappear quickly.  The treats are pretty expensive for the short time they last (10-15 minutes).  I was looking for something to keep the dog busy and entertained for awhile.  If you're paying attention you can put the treat back in place and extend the time a little.  The ball itself is quality material and hasn't gotten chewed up.  Unless the treats drop in price significantly I probably won't buy anymore.

review/summary: Finally some alone time!
review/text: My dog Cora - a 50 lb. Boxer/Pit-bull mix - loves any and all treat toys.  I recently broke down and bought one of these toys and she loves it as well!  I've limited her to one treat every two weeks, since they are not cheap and I don't know the caloric density of these treats and like to keep her weight well regulated.  In the between times, I place treats/kibble inside the ball and she flings it around the apartment to get them out.  I've had to take the Everlasting Treat Ball away from her on occasion because she WILL NOT STOP eating the treat and starts to get frustrated that she CAN'T GET IT OUT!  She has popped out the treats occasionally but only after several hours of chewing and licking it beforehand.  It's nice to have something I can give her that will keep her occupied.<br /><br />TIP: Make sure you get the right size!  Otherwise, it will be more likely that your dog can pop the treats out.  I bought Cora a LARGE.<br /><br />TIP: Put the treats in upside-down!  This trick was mentioned by someone else who commented, and it definitely works for my dog.  It is a lot more difficult for her to pop out the treat if the convex side is toward the center of the ball and the flat surface is exposed.  She does get a bit more frustrated with the toy if I do this though, so I have to watch her more carefully to make sure she's not chewing up the toy just the get the treat!<br /><br />TIP: I tried the fire hydrant version of this toy first, but Cora chewed the edges off around the treat in order to get it out faster.  So... it died.  This one is much more durable since it doesn't have the same sort of "lip" around the edge.

review/summary: This is good but not everlasting...
review/text: Just an FYI to all those who have a smart dog like me -- this may not last as long as you hope. I've tried them all and am on a mission to find soemthing that will keep my pup entertained for a little while and won't break. Kongs don't last for Kobe and as much as he loves squeaky stuffed toys, they don't last more than 10 minutes. Gosh, did I mention he's barely 7 months old - can't fathom how much smarter he will get. SIGH. OK, so you've got an idea what my dog is like onto my review.<br />So I've seen these things both online and at pet stores, and always felt a little unsure about these things. For one thing, these things aren't cheap and two like I've described I've got a really smart Lab. So I broke down and bought this at the pet store after a worker I spoke with highly recommended it. Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a "chewer." Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball. Next thing, he had it out again and this time he chewed a good chunk of it so it no longer fit. So I put it in the inner part of the ball and minutes later he got it out of there too. S-I-G-H.<br />I take off 1 star because in my case it was everlasting. I do give it credit for being pretty durable and the treat took a little while longer for him to eat. Also, it's got a cave you can bury treats in which isn't as easy for them to get things out of. I say it's OK.

Two minutes and it was out, four minutes and it was gone. I have resorted to cutting the new Kong Ziggy's in half, and jamming them between the flaps and as of writing this - he's been busy for 15 minutes. :) It's a durable enough toy and he seems to really like the squishy factor.

review/summary: Fantastic Toy!
review/text: This toy has saved my sanity and my furniture!  Instead of my puppy chewing the furniture, he chews on this toy instead.  My puppy, who usually tires of toys in a day, has had this one for over a month and it is still the first toy he goes to each morning and the last toy he plays with before going to bed at night.  It took him an entire week of daily, constant chewing to just get through one of these cookies and when he did, he was very excited and pleased with himself!  Once he finished that one cookie, he went on the attack the second one.  I also put treats inside the ball, under the cookies and my dog loves trying to get through one cookie just to get to the treats inside.  I have never seen a cookie as hard and sturdy as these are and my dog loves every flavor he has tried so far.  I highly recommend this toy!  It has kept my active, hyper puppy amused, occupied and happy, every day.  I can not say enough good things about this toy, which is good for puppies and older dogs alike.  The only problem I have found is trying to keep enough of the cookie refills stocked in my home.  I wouldn't dream of running out of the cookie refills  for this toy !

review/summary: Treats pretty dense but not difficult to remove
review/text: I bought this ball for my dog thinking it would be the solution to her intense chewing but it wasn't. In all fairness the treats are very dense so she didn't gobble it up immediately, but it didn't last over 20 minutes.  I put one of the treats in and she immediately grabbed the end that sticks out and pulled it out and began to eat the treat within 5-10 minutes.  I think the treats should be more low-profile so they can't just be pulled out like a human would.  Also, with just one treat in my dog figured out she could just stick her snout in the opposite end the the treat would pop out the other side again.  I took the treat away when it got flat like a disk and stuck it in the middle compartment (where you're supposed to put tiny treats) and she got that out too.<br /><br />SUMMARY: 3 stars because the treats are dense and using tiny treats in the middle alone might make the toy more functional, but the big treats are too expensive and weren't difficult enough to entertain my dog for longer than a rawhide.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:20 Mins<br /><br /></span>The everlasting treat ball is a soft rubbery ball that can be filled with treats or kibble. One of the ends needs to be capped with an everlasting treat, or else the kibble comes out too easily (so easily it's almost impossible to fill). The medium size ball can hold about 1/4 cup of kibble.<br /><br />This video is of my dog rolling the everlasting treat ball around using her nose and paws. I've filled the ball with kibble and capped one end with an everlasting treat.<br /><br />My dog isn't a big chewer, so I cannot say how durable the ball is. We've had it about a month, and have gone through 1 everlasting treat/endcap. The blue rubber shows no sign of wear.<br /><br />I am quite happy with this toy, and my dog is, too.

review/text: We have a medium size dog who loves to chew. We were looking for a long lasting treat that could keep him occupied for hours and tried the everlasting dog treat ball. I inserted the treat into the toy and gave it to him as soon as it arrived to see how long it would really last. At first it seemed like it was going to work great, but within 15 minutes he had mastered the art of removing treats from the toy and had chomped through half the treat. Once he figured it out the first time, he could remove additional new treats in a minute or two. We went to whole foods and bought 6 bones for the same price as one of these treats; its been an hour and he is still working on the first one.

review/text: I have a 7 month old springer spaniel puppy, and I've been going through toys at a rapid clip. I bought this because I thought it might keep him occupied awhile and that the toy part would last. He wasn't terribly interested in it at first, but later on he made a project of it. I was encouraged when he stayed working on it for about 30 minutes. He popped the treat out soon after that. I didn't mind so much because I thought he'd just keep chewing on the plastic part - and he did. Unfortunately, it only took another 1/2 hour or so before he had chewed little bits off. I give it poor ratings because a toy named "everlasting" should hold up better than that, esp. one so expensive.

We decided that the treat ball would only be given to him during "special" times when he needs to be entertained.  That being said, he's only had it for 4 days during certain times and he is almost through both sides of the treat.  It isn't lasting long at all!!  Also, he was able to get the treat out once, which made me nervous, but hasn't done it since.  I'm not sure if we will keep buying the treats or not.  They aren't cheap enough to justify him going through them in less than a week.  I'm disappointed to say the least.

Really, who doesn't know M&Ms with peanuts?  Pretty, multi-colored candy shells with a layer of chocolate wrapped around a peanut; the Easter edition comes in pastels.  Simplicity is good sometimes.  Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie.  But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one.  Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites!  Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now.  M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl!  Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Cannot get enough of this!!!
review/text: A friend of mine got me hooked on Pad Thai years ago but I had to stop eating it because even places that promoted their Pad Thai as vegetarian I found were using fish sauce in it which I am unable to eat.  Since then I'd occasionally found very few pre-packaged ones that didn't use fish sauce but really didn't cut it as far as flavor goes.  I happened to stumble upon this at my favorite grocery store and bought it and fell in love with this product and soon had to go back and stock up!  This product is vegan and while I'm not a vegan - I think it's great for vegetarians who can't eat fish products.  To speak for the flavor my husband does eat meat and even he loves this product!  I would actually say I think it's the most comparible to the stuff made in my local Thai restaurant- really excellent!
