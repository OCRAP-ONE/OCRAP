review/summary: Mesquite Lime is my favorite!
review/text: I've tried all flavors of Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky and the Mesquite Lime is my personal favorite, but it depends on your taste. If you're a fan of limes as I am, you'll love this flavor. Its a bit tart. It is also a very tender texture as compared with the others. The Hot and Spicy flavor is my second favorite. It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!

review/summary: Seriously Delish!
review/text: WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.

review/summary: Nice taste, pretty healthy
review/text: This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems: the inner packaging isn't that easy to deal with, a knife is needed to cut it open.  So not a great on-the-go food.  Also, there is not a lot of volume for the 400 calories, so it's not a good food if you are watching your weight.

review/text: This is a great product, and the mushroom one, the Seitan ones and the Soy ones do, as mentioned, have their individual flavors and textures.  Each is a great treat during a long day at the office when I want something healthy and reasonably low-calorie (these come in at about 75 calories for an ounce.)  I've tried and enjoyed all varieties.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I found the flavor and consistency of this fudge to just be OK. The consistency was a tad grainy where it should have a smooth texture. I remember when my mom made fudge it would occasionally turn out grainy and she said it was because the humidity caused the sugar in the candy to crystalize. I don't know if that is the case with this fudge or not, but both this and another Gardiners of Scotland fudge I bought have the same graininess. Further the flavors were odd. The Rum and Raisin was ok, but the raisins had no flavor. The apple and cinnamon didn't taste like apple or cinnamon nor did the strawberry and cream taste like strawberries. I think there was one ginger flavored piece in the can and it was flavorless. I won't be buying Gardiners of Scotland fudge again.

review/summary: not a typical American fudge
review/text: I bought this fudge expecting a more creamy fudge.  I was disappointed.  It has a strange undercooked grainy texture that I didn't like.  My canister was mainly rum raisin and that was my least liked flavor, it is made with real rum and I do not consume alcohol.  The ginger tasted odd and the strawberry didn't have any strawberry flavor.  I did like the Clotted cream it was very good, but only 2 in the pack.  I would not buy it again.

review/summary: Amazing & Delicious:  Best Wraps You'll Ever Eat!
review/text: Ever since I was introduced to non-fried, fresh spring rolls at a Vietnamese restaurant, I've been obsessed with them.  Immediately I started experimenting and making them at home.  I have bought a variety of brands from Asian markets to Whole Foods and they are decent, but I've always been a bit bothered by the fact that they are made from white rice which is not nearly as nutritious as brown rice.  I did not think brown rice wrappers existed!<br /><br />Once again Amazon comes through for the consumer and gives us access to great products like these superior spring roll wrappers!  I didn't think they'd actually taste much different or better than the white rice wrappers I usually buy, but I was SO wrong.  These wrappers are delicious--they taste fresher, are not gummy or thick like the white rice wrappers (my husband LOVES them and whenever we make spring rolls for friends, they rave about them).  Also, the ingredients are superior--they are made from premium whole brown rice, unlike the white rice wrappers which are made from "white rice flour" which makes a big difference on so many levels--taste to nutrition.<br /><br />I also read about this company which was started by two women.  They are a small company; they are ethical and care about the quality of their products and farmers that they deal with...unusual in this day and age.<br /><br />One more thing!  Don't be afraid to make these at home!  You can fill these wrappers with anything!  Simply dip the wrap in a bowl of water for a few seconds,  lay it on a table and fill!  I dip 2 wrappers in water at a time (much faster) and spoon in everything from chopped veggies and tempeh to noodles and tofu.  They are simply delicious.

I've been making raw wraps like they're going out of style since I got them, and enjoy them for lunches AND dinners several times a week !  You can stuff just about anything that floats your boat inside !  I just placed my second order, and now I can't imagine how I ever got along with out them.  If you're a Veg head..or not..and just want something easy,  AND fun to make, where you can use your creativity to make wraps a hundred different ways..well, maybe not 100, that are yummy, low cal, and nutritious..look no further !!!  Give these a try, you won't be disappointed : ))

review/text: I purchased this product at a health food store about 2 years ago and I've been buying it ever since. I've recently moved and the health food store is too far away so I decided to buy it off the internet. At the time, I was having major tooth aches. I didn't have insurance so I couldn't afford to get any dental work. This product was like a miracle cure. I can't remember how long it took for the pain to subside but I can tell you that the pain did go away. Well, I've recently ran out of the coconut oil and the tooth aches are back. I would suggest you do some research on the benefits of taking coconut oil. I take 2 TBSP two times a day. There are so many more benefits to taking this.

review/summary: Smells one way, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past. We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book. I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

The Caramel Vanilla is really good, so is the French Vanilla.  It would be better if they would replace the French Vanilla with a different sample though, to give a wider variety of samples.

review/text: Rating 1 star due to price. Too pricey. Loved the coffee, but average price on k-cups is typically 50 to 60 cents per k-cup. Paying $1.18 per k-cup is outrageous (I thought I was getting a 2 pack for the price, my bad). Amazon has many 2 packs of k-cups for this price. Will pay closer attention on future k-cup purchases. Will not purchase this product at this price again.

review/summary: Not as Listed.
review/text: I bought this because it shows that the Hazelnut Dark Roast is part of the mix. It is not. Instead it is the regular version of GMC's Hazelnut. The regular version is weak - I knew it was from past experience, so I would not have bought this product if I had realized it contained their regular hazelnut coffee. Amazon has a terrible time with keeping up with accurate information on their website at least as it pertains to k-cups. (I called in w/a question about product count for packaging on another occasion due to the price point for the qty shown - their C/S people couldn't confirm one way or another. The result - I didn't buy the product from Amazon) You have to change out descriptions and product information and keep it up to date - but instead, I see they put a disclaimer that they are not responsible. That the descriptions and counts may not be accurate. Choosing to make that statement versus the effort of updating their product information doesn't make me want to buy my k-cups from Amazon.

review/summary: A bit different, and wonderful
review/text: These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites.

I may be using these in the nursing home.<br /><br />My package arrived quickly, and was well packed. Looking at a previous review that insisted the package was lightweight, I weighed my bag of peppercorns upon arrival and it was exactly 8 oz. So I wouldn't be too concerned about a lightweight package.<br /><br />These peppercorns are beautiful, with a lively flavor and plump appearance. They are not shriveled like many peppercorns. I used them to make Kung Pao chicken and ZING they about burned my face off! But in a good way. Such peppery, fresh, citrusy hot flavor. Love them!!!<br /><br />If I ever run out (ever)...I will reorder from this seller!

review/text: THE BEST SALT ALTERNATIVE EVER...When Bensons Table Tasty appeared on Amazon I had to quickly write a review.  I LOVE Bensons Table Tasty. I have been using Table Tasty for years and can't be without it. Bensons Table Tasty gives my Vegan taste buds a "TREAT" everytime I use it.  I am never without it.  I eat 90% raw foods an 10% heated (no processed) and eat only organic whole foods, so you can see why I need Bensons Table Tasty to season my foods.  I love Bensons Table Tasty so much that I always buy 9 bottles at atime from the Bensons' website. Glad it made it to Amazon.  Hope it will become prime subscribe and save.  I take Bensons Table Tasty in my purse so when I eat out I use it .  My husband & I use  Bensons Table tasty as our salt alternative as well as our seasonings for everything from veggies to air pop popcorn. Bensons Table Tasty is the "Best" salt alternative in the world. Can't say enough about it.  I can talk about how great it is all day long. Buy it, You will Love it.....

review/summary: The best I've found
review/text: I am on a highly salt restricted diet (and potassium too.) I have End Stage Renal Failure, or kidney failure, so on dialysis. Also diabetic so my overall diet is extremely restricted. This is the first 'salt' substitute that acctually has a salty taste. Most others use potassium which is a poor substitute, or various herbs and spices to make up for the missing salt. They add flavors to be sure, but still no salt-like kick of flavor enhancement. It's too bad Amazon doesn't also sell the 1 pound package, that has to be obtained from the small manufacturer, which right now is extremely backlogged. Took me 4 months to get my direct order of the 1 pound package, but a great price saving for everyday use. If it is hard giving up salt, try Table Tasty, I think you will like it.

review/summary: FINALLY! A salt substitute that's worth something!
review/text: Tired of all the "salt substitutes" that are just shakers potassium chloride with different labels? Those things don't taste like salt at all; they have a slight "bite" on the tongue like a spoonful of salt does, but that's about it. If you dissolve them in water, they has little or no flavor at all, and what flavor they do have is nothing like sodium chloride.<br /><br />This stuff, on the other hand, is the real deal. It doesn't rely on potassium chloride, nor on only "herbs and spices" as other substitutes like Mrs. Dash or the (in)famous Costo seasoning does/do. Instead, it relies on a combination of herbs, spices, and nutritional/brewer's yeast. And it actually tastes (not just feels on the tongue) "salty" despite having no sodium.<br /><br />With this stuff I can honestly say I have no desire for a salt shaker or to add salt as I cook. This is the real deal. Try it!

review/text: I have to cut way down on my salt intake and I have tried so many salt substitutes I've lost count. Some were terrible, some just ok. Then I read great reviews on this Benson's Table Tasty.  It is fabulous and does not contain potassium chloride (which I can't use due to some medication I'm currently taking).  Table Tasty is very flavorful. One could swear there is salt in it but, NO, NO, NO!  It is COMPLETELY SALT FREE and also potassium chloride free (potassium chloride has an odd after taste and does not give you that zing you get from salt, so you wined up using a lot more). I've tried this on eggs, popcorn, cooked hamburger, chicken so far and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who is on a low sodium or sodium free diet.

review/text: I really need to cut down on my sodium intake because I have very high blood pressure - I've been a salt fanatic for MANY years (I put salt on almost everything), so I'm a very harsh critic when it comes to salt substitutes. I recently ordered and received a similar no salt substitute "blend" from another website, and it has absolutely *NO* salt taste. I've tried a few others as well that also tasted nothing like salt...so I really didn't have high hopes for table tasty.  I figured I'd order it anyway based on the positive reviews (and it was shipped very fast).<br /><br />I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted this product.  I thought for sure it would only taste like a sodium-free spice blend like all the rest, but it actually has a salty taste when you try it right out of the bottle.  The taste and smell actually reminds me a lot of those flavor packets that come with Ramen noodles, or the "Cup-a-soup" packets in a box, which are both LOADED with sodium!<br /><br />It's hard to believe - I have no idea how they've achieved this since there's NO sodium at all in the product.  All I know is I will now be ordering a large bag!

I've had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YVQ47Y">San Pellegrino Aranciata</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FR0B6">San Pellegrino Limonata</a> many times, but pompelmo very infrequently. I snapped up a 6-pack of these cute little bright green/blue cans at Wholefoods on sale for $4. It's hot as all get out today and nothing is as wonderful as a cold glass of pompelmo soda! 16% juice and it really tastes like grapefruit. No artificial anything. Made with sugar, not HFCS. The can tops have San Pellegrino's trademark little foil cap to prevent dust. Sparkling, crisp, with that slight characteristic bitterness of grapefruit! Man, this product is a thing of beauty. Try some today!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Calories are on par with regular soda -- 150 calories per can. After having had a few, I find the sugar content high. It could be dialed down a bit on sweetness and still be delicious.

review/text: Just tried this and love it! Perfect refreshing soda on its own. However my sister added this to a glass of cabernet that I had and it tasted like a wonderful sangria! I am going to snap these up and keep on hand to add to red wine for those that don't love the taste of red wine by itself. Add a little fruit and voila...sangria.

review/summary: Decent pump, but not universal
review/text: So I bought this to use with my 750ml Torani syrup because the description states it's a universal fit for these bottles. However, the cap is too wide and the straw was too long. I ended up cutting the straw to fit and wrapping plastic around the top so the cap will fit. The price was cheap so I didn't feel like returning it.

review/text: The product is terrific if you like pink grapefruit.  I'm mainly rating this item because my initial bag I received was torn with some candies scattered in the box (everything else in the shipment was perfect as is usually the case).  I sent amazon an email about the problem and they immediately shipped out a new bag which I received the next day which to me seems amazingly fast.  This is one reason why I do business with amazon and recommend them to a lot of people I know.

review/text: These Haribo Pink Grapefruit candies are yummy!  They smell<br />exactly like a real pink grapefruit and the taste is divine.<br />Unlike Haribo's traditional gummies, these are coated with<br />fine granulated sugar which does make them a little sweeter,<br />but they're a nice change. I also like the Haribo Peaches<br />which are made like these.  What better way to get your<br />daily servings of fruit?  Seriously, we all know that<br />moderation is key with most everything; definitely so<br />with these.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone who can eat sugar and loves the tangy, tart taste of pink grapefruit.

These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!<br /><br />Other people have said that they are good in small doses, but I wouldn't want more than 5-6 pieces at a time anyway, or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!

review/text: I have friends addicted to these now which is fine since the 5lb bag is plenty enough for lots of sharing.<br />I was gifted these and the sender mentioned that she had found them on Amazon.  I was used to buying them by the 1/4 or 1/2 lb at a candy shop near where I used to work. To me they are more like a traditional gumdrop in texture and with the sugar crystal coating but the flavor is sweet and tart just like pink grapefruit without the slight bitterness that the white grapefruit tends to have.  Glad I found these here!

It was perfect for my mid-pregnancy cravings. my significant other must've been having sympathy cravings too, because he helped me devour these things.<br /><br />Great grapefruit flavor. it is coated in sugar as anyone can plainly see, so i dont see how anyone can complain about the sugar. its CANDY! lol.<br /><br />i love these things and will be ordering them again as soon as i get the chance & hopefully share some this time!<br /><br />unfortunately, these do not ship to alaska. i see this as a problem considering this is my home state. i don't know what i'll do when i move! yikes.

What more can you ask for?<br /><br />Now, I know that grapefruit isn't a well known flavor but WOW, I liked it better than the watermelon gummie rings that we bought on amazon also.<br /><br />These were a bit softer too, which is a personal preference, but I like softer gummies.<br /><br />Generally, I'm a health nut, but it was a wedding so I indulged with a few of these. You might have to as well ;)

review/summary: Not as sweet as the average Gummi candies
review/text: It is hard to find candy that is overly sweet. My wife and Granddaughter both love Pink Grapefruit anyway and Pink Grapefruit candy has some of the tang of real grapefruit which cuts down on the sweetness a bit.<br />I did take away one star because I think they have a bit too much of sugar coating on the pieces but you can scrape some of it off to make it less sweet.<br />My wife uses the pieces when she has a low sugar spell since she is diabetic and sometimes when she has her insulin injections and doesn't eat quickly enough after that her blood sugar drops too low. Since I bought this she hasn't had that problem, but has to guard her supply from my Granddaughter though.<br />I have bought a pack for myself as well since I don't eat candy that often since I don't like overly sweet candy. This candy tastes good to me. I want to try the fruit salad next time just to have some change in taste. It has lime, grapefruit, lemon, orange, cherry and passion fruit and I like all of those flavors except cherry. But my wife likes cherry flavor so I can give those to her. Wish they had watermelon instead of cherry in that mix but its no big deal.

You cant beat te 5 pound bag, as the candy store in my town wants $1.98 for a 3 oz. bag. The white grapefruit are also very good, they both are tangy and not super sweet. It is so nice when they come right to your door, I will not buy candy any other way, especially Haribo products. Amazon Rules.

review/text: These grapefruit slices are delicious, but beware on two points:<br /><br />- 5 pounds is a heck of a lot for one person (last time I ordered it lasted for months, even with me sporadically handing it out to others).<br />- The candy hardens with time and loses a bit of its chewiness / gumminess.  (Still tastes good, though).<br /><br />I'm going to experiment with using a more airtight container to see if they stay chewy for longer.

review/summary: Chewy (not hard), sour grapefruit gummies
review/text: Grapefruit gummies I've purchased before have all been really hard and chewy - the Haribo are soft and exactly like a gummy candy.  Each piece is small enough to eat in one bite, if you like, but big enough to take two or three; they have a tart taste which is mitigated by a dusting of sugar on the outside.  I think the sugar coating makes them just a little too sweet for me, but for texture and general flavor, these are the best grapefruit gummies I've had!

review/text: I will second the notion that these are very sour.  I can't eat too many of these like I can the gummi bears.  After a few of these my mouth feels like it has tasted real grapefruit, and in fact real flavorings are part of these treats.  I'm not sure why there is sugar coating on these, though.  I don't find these too sweet at all.<br /><br />The texture is on the soft side, not hard like those jumbo cherry gummis (which I didn't care for), and after trying these now for a week I must say these are quite good.
