review/summary: Interesting chip, but maybe not the best for salsa
review/text: These tortilla chips have an "all-natural" feel to them, and a somewhat unique taste, which is both good and bad.<br /><br />First off, I'll just comment on the packaging.  The singular bag is made of a relatively thick foil-like material and is air puffed tightly.  The result is freshly crisp, unbroken chips in the bag.  A nice bonus and much better than standard lunch-sized chip bags you find from most common companies.<br /><br />As for the taste of the chips, they're pretty good.  I liked the olive and garlic flavor when I was eating them by themselves.  However, when I paired them with some salsa, the olive taste didn't match up that well.  They might go better with a french onion chip dip instead (though I didn't try that).<br /><br />So if you want fresh, never-broken tortilla chips to eat just by themselves with no dip, these do rather well.  If you're looking for a chip to go with your bowl of salsa, you may want go elsewhere.

review/summary: No Olive flavor
review/text: While these chips taste good, there was no olive flavor in them whatsoever. You can even see the real olives in each piece, but the added olive did not add anything to the flavor. All I could taste were plain tortilla chips that didn't taste much different than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011VYFWQ">Tostitos</a>. I just think if it's olive flavored, it should taste like olives.

review/summary: Very nice chip, even better ingredients.
review/text: A good chip, though some folks might be put off. The olive flavor comes from real olives put into the mix. So this means some chips are -Olive- flavor, and some are just a hint of olive flavor.<br /><br />Personally, this was a sizable plus. Not a every tidbit crunched is the same kind of flavor chip.  If you need something more standardized in the way of flavor you're going to want to look elsewhere.  I liked these better than the multigrain to be sure. Still only 4-stars because it didn't -wow- me the way I want a 5-star product to reflect in my reviews. The smaller chip size should not fool you because it's still sold by weight.<br /><br />It arrived nicely packaged from Amazon,  I did not have a bag of crumbs but intact chips. Something of a plus with products like this.<br /><br />To sum up. Wonderful flavor overall, but don't expect every chip to taste the same.

review/summary: Almost TOO good to be healthy
review/text: I had planned to try these crackers with several different toppings, but I had eaten most of the bag before I stopped long enough to try some with Mozzarella cheese.  (A great combination!)<br /><br />Since I try to keep my diet on the healthy side, I have to curtail occasional urges to buy potato chips, which I love.  This product is the first I've found that I enjoy as much as chips.  Was particularly happy they are not high sodium and have no six syllable ingredients.

review/summary: multigrain taste and not too salty; too bad they are fried and not baked
review/text: While I enjoyed eating these chips, I doubt I would order them again.  The positives are that they are not too salty and they have a good, multigrain taste.  (I suppose this latter quality might be a minus for some who don't like the taste of whole grains.)  The negatives are that a fairly small serving size (one ounce) has 7 grams of fat because these chips are fried, not baked.  So while these are made using whole grains that aren't genetically modified, I'd hesitate to call them a healthful snack because of the high fat content.

review/summary: Great taste and healthy too-my kind of snack!
review/text: I absolutely loved this snack!  If you like olives, you will too.  The taste of olives is just right, not to strong and not too subtle.  The reason I don't just like this snack, but love it, is because I'm a label reader and don't buy products with lots of ingredients that I can't pronounce.  These cracker/chips have no trans fat and only a handful of ingredients that you'd have in your kitchen.  My kids tried them, they weren't too excited about them-but I'd buy these just for my husband and me-they are just yummy!

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I have to say, I really like this chip.<br /><br />It's a bit thinner than the flaxseed tortilla chips I normally buy at Trader Joe's, and the flavor is nuttier.<br /><br />The small package size is very nice for diet-conscious snackers, although I will say that I wish it were a little bit easier to open. But maybe the thickness of the packaging and the tight seal at the top is to keep in the freshness better.<br /><br />The price point isn't bad, although I can get chips cheaper in larger bags at local grocery stores.<br /><br />Overall, a very good snack product in a very convenient size.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flower, flax seeds, turbinado can sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz.

review/text: These chips are the BEST out there. Period. Love, love, love them. I haven't tried a flavor I don't like. Excellent with salsa, hummus, taco salads, or just plain. THe multi-grain is great, and I also like the blue corn. This weekend I just tried a couple of new flavors I found in a store, Sweet Potato BBQ and Sweet Potato with salt and pepper. Oh my gosh good. My husband likes the Jalapeno kind. I generally don't care for spicy things and was hesitant to try that flavor, but it wasn't bad spicy, and just had an all around great flavor like all the others. Add in the fact that they are gluten free, all natural, AND non-GMO.....goodness, if they were only organic I think I'd pass out!

What impressed me was that they are made with real ingredients, flax, sunflower, and sesame seeds to mention a few. Since you can find almost anything on Amazon.com, I went online and found that I can order them and receive them every month on auto-ship. I highly recommend them.

I'm actually starting to like these.<br /><br />Update:  Can 2<br /><br />These things just sit there and dare me to eat them!  So, this time I added some pepper and sea salt and microwaved for 10 seconds to take the chill off, and put them on some flat rye crackers.  Better!<br /><br />So, I ordered twelve of these having never tried sardines in mustard before.  I figured "how bad can it be?".  I know that Crown Prince makes a quality product.<br /><br />Well, when I opened the can there was a whole lot of mustard.  Thick stuff.  I mean, if you're into mustard you just entered mustard heaven!  In fact, this can had no fishy smell to me at all because the mustard cancelled it out!<br /><br />So, I wolfed 'em down and all I can say is that I'm not a sardines in mustard type.  I'll eat the rest of the cans but not likely order them again.  But I can say that this is a high quality take on a food combination that I don't particularly like.  Good thing they keep a long time.  I'll eat 'em when I'm really really hungry.

review/text: The basket I received did not contain all of the items as described/pictured. It did not contain the Camembert cheese, but instead a block of orange garlic cheese.  It also contained water crackers instead of the sesame crackers.  It did not contain the butter toffee popcorn or Ghiradelli chocolates at all. It did contain a package of two tea bags which is not pictured or mentioned. Also what is pictured, but not described is a box with a wafer in it. Make  note the product features and product description slightly differ. The description mentions Mrs. Prindables caramel confections which the basket also did not contain. The basket looked nice, but I would say it is overpriced for what I received. Granted it is a small/cheaper basket, but it feels like it is filled with larger boxes with not much product. I gave this to my dad and when he opened the box of wafers it only contained one. The box of toffee only contained two. The truffle box is smaller/different than the one featured and looks like it contains only one or two pieces. The Camembert cheese pictured looks larger, but the garlic cheese that came in it was a smaller 6 oz piece without the fancy box. I was thinking of buying larger baskets for this Holiday season, but now I think I will pass.

review/text: I hate to not be able to say positive and glowing things about items I order, but I was a bit crest fallen when the package arrived and both baskets were not what I thought they should be.  OK, I'll take the hit on that account.  I ordered two of these baskets to give to two co-workers.  Gave them the gifts this last Friday so they could enjoy them (hopefully) over the weekend.  Just be aware that the packages are not as big as you would think from seeing the pictures, but then again, I should have used common sense, my fault.  I will update this after I talk to my co-workers tomorrow.  I would give this 3.5 stars but since I can't, will give them the benefit of the extra star.

review/summary: Very dissappointed
review/text: Not at all what we had hoped for as our anniversary gift from MIL. Tiny packages, often not enough to share - hot choc for 1. Seriously!! Only 2 truffles, no branded products at all. 2 cookies and the Brie is not even the real thing but some 'pasteurized cheese product', please.. I might just as well be eating velveeta. Also shipped on a 85F day and sat in UPS truck for 12hrs in plain unmarked box, then was left on the doorstep in bright sun. All choc products were well and truly melted. What a mess. I would in no way recommend wasting your money on this - it looks nice & tastes OK but I'd do a lot better in the local grocery store & probably save a lot of money.

The best part, in my view, is that each of them liked something different about the Gourmet Food Basket.  In other words, there is enough different stuff in it that you don't need to worry about your recipient's preferences.

review/summary: Excellent Basket
review/text: Got this for my mom for Mother's Day. Although I wasn't there to see it, my family (who are EXTREMELY blunt and honest about these things) said it was indeed a gorgeous gift basket, and beautiful to look at. All the items were accounted for and what they've eaten thusfar has been enjoyed. Seriously...if my family liked it, it was a nice basket!<br /><br />Tip: If you're tired of sending the same ol' tired flowers, and don't want to spend $50+ for a bunch of wilted roses, this could be a good option. This is especially true if your family lives far away and you can't go to a store and buy/deliver it yourself.<br /><br />It turned out to be quite the winner in my family. I hope you find as much joy as my mother did!

review/summary: Good Chewing All Day Long
review/text: I like to eat, so in between meals I chew Xylitol gum. I have been having trouble finding my previous favorite (Xpry Green Tea) so I looked around for other brands/flavors because I wanted something that other than mint but I also didn't want artificial flavors like Xpry fruit flavor.  I am pleased with this gum.  It is true that when you first begin to chew it, if you aren't careful, it has some crumbs that could fall apart.  When I start chewing, I keep it in a pocket of my mouth to keep all the gum in one area until it has chewed up into the normal gum consistency.  The flavor is present in the beginning and fades, which I don't mind.  With both the initial texture and the flavor, I am ok with these because on the rare occasions in which I chew conventional (artificially dyed/flavored/sugared) gum, I am horrified by the ridiculous flavor that annoyingly never goes away and the super-soft texture that never dries out.  I have been chewing xylitol gums for over a year and don't like other gums any more.  So for me, this gum is great. The pieces are round, and about twice as much as Xpry, or even more. The gum stays soft a long time and sometimes I chew a single piece for hours.  The gum also does fine if you take it out, set it down for awhile, and put it back in your mouth and resume chewing later.  (Like re-steeping a tea bag).

review/text: I only see a single 3 star review for this product currently, and that simply doesn't do it justice. It exists as a way to sweeten Teas (and other beverages) without having a strong effect on the flavor itself. I am primarily a Fruit-based Tea Drinker, and its fantastic for sweetening a batch of Tea, Iced or hot, and has no trouble being turned into a simple syrup for later application. It is indeed on the pricey side, but its well worth it for what it brings to the drink. A fine product, through and through.

review/summary: Expensive, but nice
review/text: I was given some of the German Rock Sugar by a friend for my birthday, and I really like it. I usually use Sugar in The Raw, but had wanted to try the rock sugar. So, when I was given this, I tried it out.<br /><br />I do enjoy it, the crystals are pretty in my tea maker or cup, and I love to watch them dissolve. They sweeten without actually adding a flavor to the tea, so I'm not left tasting tea and sweetener, like I do with honey.<br /><br />One drawback I do find with the rock sugar is how Teavana suggests you use it: they suggest you add it to your tea while it's brewing. This is fine and dandy if your tea brews for a while, but if you're brewing for 2-3 minutes for some teas (like they suggest), you'll find the tea is done before the sugar dissolves. And since I use the Perfect Tea Maker, I don't stir the leaves (as suggested). So I've found it works best added to the bottom of a cup and then let the tea maker pour into the cup, agitating the sugar and helping it dissolve before I use mt spoon.

review/summary: Does a SWEET Job ;-)
review/text: I first had rock sugar at an upscale spa as I waited for my massouse and fell in love with it after one cup.  This definitely does the trick for tea.  Unlike granualated sugars that sink, accumulate at the bottom and demand that you stir periodically just to keep the tea & it's contents homogenized, this rock sugar distributes an evenly sweet taste throughout the whole cup.  No stirring needed!  Rocks dissolve gradually from the temperature of the tea water. And like a previous user said, it does a great job sweetening without changing the tea's designated flavor, but rather enhances it.  I'm hooked on thsi product from Teavana.

review/summary: Nothing else tastes as good
review/text: I drink fruit teas as well as the more robust teas, and the German rock sugar will sweeten them without drowning out the flavor of the tea. Regular sugar does not, and neither does Demerara sugar. When I bought the German rock sugar at Teavana, I was told it could be used in cooking, but due to the expense I will only use it in my tea. But it is well worth the expense in my opinion, especially if you want to taste your tea, and not the sugar.

review/summary: Cheaper Substitute FOUND!!!!
review/text: Nothing wrong with the sugar besides the fact it is so expensive, and doesn't last very long but, after fun and time taking experimentation I have found a perfect and cheaper substitute, it's called "Turbinado Sugar"  And I found some at the Whole Foods in St. Louis, but I would imagine they sell it at all Whole Foods.  They sell it in bulk, and it's 1.99 per pound.  So in comparison to what you buy in the store or find on Amazon (after shipping),  1 pound of Teavana Tea costs $13.  For the same $13 you can buy 6.5 pounds of Turbinado Sugar.  And you use it in the same ratio that you use the German Rock Sugar, so you get 6.5 times the bang for your buck

review/text: I bought 3 lbs of this stuff plus jar from their online store. A bit pricey but hey, I'd rather do that than buy something cheap and regret it later. Yep, it sweetened my tea without overwhelming the delicate flavor of my black/green tea. I only use this when I'm making a cup (because it's expensive). I use plain table sugar when I'm making a litre of my favorite tisane iced tea. I give 5 star to table sugar too, LOL!<br /><br />And yeah, the jar that Teavana suggest you put your German rock sugar in is pretty nice, anyone who has complaints about it is not right in the head. I didn't regret my purchases, and even though this store's items are pretty much expensive, I would still buy from them. Shipping's free on $50 up (doesn't take much to reach this total), ships fast too even if it's just standard shipping. Items are packaged well, lots of paper & bubble wrap. And the quality & design of the products are excellent, reflects the reason why they're expensive.<br /><br />But if you really think about it, expensive products that you use well are a bargain. Cheap ones which you throw away are a waste of money.

Now need an ice tea spoon so I can reach and stirr. I can not have to much Splenda type sugar as to much makes me ill and have diabetes 2 so can not have much sugar.  Only things I drink other then ice water is sweet, such as crystal light.  This, IF you stirr, is sweeter then sugar using less of it. So I get the sweet I want, IF I stirr...lol, with less sugar .

review/summary: Versatile sauce works with rice, noodles and ramen
review/text: Simple, delicious, and unlike the sticky Chinese sweet and sour sauces that predominate supermarket shelves, House Foods Chinese Mabo Tofu Sauce is a lower calorie, easy to prepare and extremely versatile dish.<br /><br />Traditionally served with rice, the sauce is also delicious with fried noodles, fried rice, in ramen and can be effortlessly be converted into a vegetarian dish, substituting mushrooms (shitake), bell peppers and onions for ground meat.<br /><br />One serving (1/4 package, 38g, about 1/6 cup) has 30 calories with 1.5g total fat, 470mg of sodium and 4g total carbs. Four servings are in each package. The sauce is made in Thailand.<br /><br />Here's a bit of background courtesy of Wikipedia:<br /><br />"M&aacute;p&oacute; d&ograve;ufu, or m&aacute;p&oacute; t&ograve;fu, is a popular Chinese dish from the Sichuan (Szechuan) province. Mapo Doufu can also be found in restaurants in other Chinese provinces and in Korea, Japan and Taiwan, where the flavor is adapted to local tastes. In Japan, where the dish is called m'b' t'fu, it was introduced by Chen Kenmin who opened the first Sichuanese restaurant in Tokyo in the 1950s. Instead of using only the salty and spicy bean paste, Chen also adopted sweet bean paste in the recipe and make the dish less spicy and less oily."<br /><br />Having eaten this dish served in a Chinese restaurant, I agree House Foods Chinese Mabo Tofu Sauce is less oily than the authentic recipe. Chinese dishes are often much spicier than their Japanese equivalent.<br /><br />Directions (from the package):<br /><br />1 box House Foods Chinese Mabo Tofu Sauce<br />14 oz. tofu, cubed<br />2 oz ground meat (beer, pork or chicken)<br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br /><br />Heat oil in a skillet or wok at medium heat; brown the meat. Add the sauce and simmer. Gently stir in cubed tofu and simmer again.<br /><br />My suggestions:<br /><br />+ Press and drain your tofu before adding it to the sauce. Draining the tofu improves its texture.<br />+ Garnish with chopped green onion.<br /><br />I like House Foods products. I also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V39I3S">House Foods Vermont Curry, Medium Hot</a>, a roux that creates a tasty beef stew best enjoyed as a winter meal. However, that isn't a low-calorie meal, especially when it is ladled over Japanese sticky rice. On the other hand, House Foods Chinese Mabo Tofu Sauce is a lower calorie and more versatile option.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

But if sweetened, it still has a very smooth taste that has them coming back for more and asking what kind of tea it is.  Works for me. At least try it. Can't beat the price either.

review/summary: great chili
review/text: I do not write reviews unless I think I have something very relevant to say. We use to purchase this chili at Sam's. They quit carrying it. First off this is a great product. It is not like the canned stuff you get at the market. We like to make a large batch and eat on it for several days. It tastes better after it sits over night, why I do not know, maybe it marinates? I always go to the market and purchase a lean pot roast and have the butcher grind it into hamburger, We add this to the chili and sometimes a little red bell pepper. Cook it in a large pot and let it simmer on the stove on low. The whole family loves it. Sprinkle some grated cheese on top and a couple of crackers and have at it! This stuff is restaurant quality. Stagg makes several kinds. We prefer the Country Brand.

review/text: I bought this brand for my puppy and he loves it. I recently switched him to the Lamb and rice as these kernels are too small for him and he gulps his food down. He is a beagle and I was initially recommended this size for him but he is not really a small breed, his kind of a small/medium breed.  But I love that this is natural and does not contain corn or ant animal byproducts. He is our first puppy and I want the best food for him. I would recommend it to anyone and the company sends $3 coupons to email subscribers. Good quality food and not too expensive. I gave it four stars because, the largest bag is 8lbs and I wish they made a large size.

review/text: This cake was ordered for my husband's birthday, and despite warnings to order early and snowstorms in the northeast where we live, it arrived in ample time...almost too much time as it sat in the fridge for several days before the big day.  Thus, it wasn't as fresh as it could have been, but it was still yummy with a pronounced key lime flavor.  Adding raspberry sorbet just increased its flavor and made for a delicious birthday dessert.

review/summary: Wonderful Lemon Pie
review/text: You can use fat free cream cheese, fat free whipped topping and omit the butter and it is still wonderful.  It's so good that way I haven't even tried it as a cheeseball.  You can do the same with all of the Wind & Willow mixes I have tried.  Some of the mixes don't suggest making a pie but many of them are still good to use as a pie mix.<br /><br />I would give it a 5 star but I frequently find the graham cracker topping is stale.  I recommend testing it before you put it on the pie.  I routinely toss the topping.  Amazon's price is better that the only store carrying the product in my area so that mean's it's going to be on the shelf longer due to the quantity.  I haven't had a problem with the rest of the mix going bad.

No adding sugar.<br /><br />I got this one and the vanilla chai and THIS ONE- IS- AMAZING! Not too sweet and is more flavorful than the vanilla. I daresay better than Starbucks and for the price and convenience, gives Dunkin Donuts a run for its money. I'd totally get this again.

review/text: This is the same product that I used to buy from the grocery store in little 9+ ounce cans.  It makes a delicious latte with hot water.  The price is certainly less than the grocery store charged, and the quality is excellent.  I'm on my second two pound pouch now, and the flavor is fantastic.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes tea and spices.  The spicing is light and not overpowering.  There is a slightly chalky taste at the end of the cup, I'm not sure why.  It leaves a white residue in the cup sometimes, which can be alleviated by swirling the cup when drinking the last few sips.  It is also good when cooled and poured over ice.  A perfect drink at the end of a long winter's day.

The bags are a way better value and just what I have been looking for. I don't know why the stores quit selling it, but thank goodness for Amazon!!!

review/text: Got my first delivery of this bulk form of my favorite tea on December 2, 2009. It is fantastic!  It has better flavor than the new improved smaller cans that I have been buying for years.  Great hot or cold.  Good seasonal tea, or all year round.  No doubt that I'll be placing another order as soon as this one nears it's end!

review/text: Potential customers for this item need to know that this is NOT the sugar-free form of General Food Chai Latte.  We are talking 160 calories per serving here rather than 35 for the sugar-free form in the small can.  This chai latte is good but it's also high calorie.

review/text: It is good, but different flavor than what in in the little containers of the same thing.  I would recommend this because of the price, but still believe the smaller containers have better flavor.
