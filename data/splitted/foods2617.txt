review/summary: One of the best K-Cups out there
review/text: This was one of the first K-Cups I tried and I keep going back to it. Plenty of flavor without bitterness. I little smoother taste than the Caribou blend which has a "woodier" flavor. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Haci Bekir Turkish Delight
review/text: This is the Turkish Delight you've been looking for, if you appreciate the real deal.  Flavorful, rather than just sickly sweet like so many imitators, Haci Bekir makes theirs Old World wonderful and in serving sizes that can be savored and enjoyed.  It's the delight I remember from my youth growing up in Istanbul. If you've tried others and found them heavy and sugary, you should give this one a try.

The shipment I recieved may have been sugar free. I've tried different sugar free flavors in the past, and the texture is different. This tasted just like vanilla sugar free which I don't care for. Amazon was gracious enough to refund. I had to throw it out.

We use this on steak, chicken and big game; we have tried other seasonings, but we don't get nearly compliments from our guests as we do with this.  I'm glad that I could find a place to pick it up!

review/summary: Follows Melinda's basic winning recipe.
review/text: If you have tried Melinda's Habanero sauces before, or Marie Sharps for<br />comparison, and you like the flavor and consistency, but need more heat,<br />then this is just for you!<br /><br />Melinda's advertising is somewhat misleading, as this sauce is listed at<br />577,000 Scovilles, its not. The lower scale of Melinda's Habanero selections<br />are i.e. XXX, XXXX Reserve, etc. are separated by degrees of heat. No doubt<br />this is the hottest of the Habanero family, but I'd hazard to guess this is<br />no more than 50,000 Scovilles, although I'm not doubting the Savinas were<br />tested and certified at 577k, but this sauce is not going to blow the top<br />of your head off.<br /><br />When I mention the recipe, I mean this..."Ingredients: Red Savina peppers,<br />hand-selected choice red habanero peppers, fresh carrots, onions, lime juice,<br />vinegar, garlic, and salt" The vinegar is not noticeable, but in classic<br />Melinda's fashion you get a pulpy carrot/citrus based blast of pure heat that<br />will satisfy most chiliheads.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying this stuff is not hot, it sneaks up on you. And just as<br />you're noticing the mellow flavor of carrots with a lime-juice underscore,<br />you may suddenly realize that the back of your mouth is on fire. But it wont<br />leave any scar tissue or ruin your evening. So as you move up the heat scale,<br />don't pass this sauce by, its terrific on anything. And do yourself a favor,<br />and remove that little stopper/dropper so you can get a liberal dose.<br /><br />5 Scovies!

review/text: This was shipped overnight via Fedex even though I only used my two-day prime shipping. It arrived early the next morning before I went to work. We could smell that something was not right. It arrived with an outer box and in an inner box. The inner box was wet in one corner. When we opened it, we could see that a few of the cans were open. It had such a foul stench that we just took it outside to the trash can immediately. The smell lingered in our home until we sprayed Lysol. It could not have just opened. This product had been rotting for some time. We will not buy any Roland sardines again. You get what you pay for, so I'm sticking with Crown Prince and Season products.

review/summary: Worried about storage & not a fan of these
review/text: I like sardines and they are very good for you,  but they are so messy in oil.  When I saw the ones in tomatoe sauece I gave them a try.  These are 3 times the size of the ones I usually get, and do not taste the same, they are whole and not broken up in little pieces, so nicely canned.  I don't like these as well, I can eat them if I add lots of spices to hide the taste, and it concerns me that on the side of the can it says to "store below 60�", why is that?  They are canned so why do they have to be below 60.  Which is impossible to do in a normal home, I like it cool and keep my home about 68, but in the summer it will be hard, the winter there are parts of the house that would be cool enough.  I'm trying to find ways of cooking that I can hide the taste.  I won't be ordering these again.

The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future. Sister In Law doesn't know it yet, but she's getting the Halloween special!

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Folger's scores another coup with their awesome Cinnamon Swirl ground coffee. The taste is delicious. It keeps a long time in your kitchen cabinet or your freezer, too. If you do choose to keep it in your freezer, however, remember to let it thaw out a few hours before using.<br /><br />The canisters are very well constructed to keep the ground coffee fresh and the safety seal on the top of each unused canister gives you peace of mind. The packaging overall is excellent.<br /><br />But of course it's the coffee that we're really interested in here. The freshness of that distinct Cinnamon flavor strikes your taste buds and makes you really, REALLY want that second cup of coffee. It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning; and of course it's good at any time of the day or night as well.<br /><br />Obviously, coffee contains caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine in any way you might prefer to drink decaffeinated coffee instead of this product. If you have any questions at all about your specific medical situation consult your doctor.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is one great Cinnamon coffee. If you love Cinnamon flavored coffee you can't go wrong with the Folger's brand. If you like your coffee even a bit sweeter you can always add sugar or any sugar substitute.

Oddly enough, I've tried all of the other Folgers Flavors and they're not nearly as good (Hazelnut, Vanilla, Chocolate...). For a while (because of the increasing difficulty of finding this in stores) I was on a quest to find another cinnamon flavored coffee in another brand and they didn't even come close (Dunkin Doughnuts, Seattle's Best, Market Pantry... everything I could get my hands on). I don't know what I would do if they quit making it!!! :(

It's a very mild cinnamon tatse so it's not over powering, it has just the right amount. I tried the french vanilla, and it smelled terrible while brewing and tasted the same!! I couldn't even stand the smell of it. Back to the cinnamon flavor and I will never buy another flavor again. By the way, the price right now including shipping is at fifty four bucks, it's five bucks at Walmart and you can decide how many you want.

review/text: I originally found this at our local WholeFoods but the supply runs out quickly. I was very happy to find it at Amazon. All the varieties are delicious but this is my favorite. Crunchy, slighly sweet with a touch of salt and heat and hint of tartness or bite. If you love nuts you will love these.

review/summary: Superb -- only the pecans are better
review/text: This product, with spicy almonds / sesame seeds / dried apple chunks, is only slightly less delicious and interesting than the "Valdosta" pecan / cranberry snacks by Sahale.  These two snacks had none of the stale and rancid flavor of Sahale's "Dauphine" (walnut) and "Soccorro" (Macadamia/hazelnut) snacks that came in the same shipment.  "Dauphine"  and "Soccorro" tasted much fresher when bought in a local store.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I really like several of the Sahale products, my favorite being the Valdosta blend (almond/cranberries). This one, however, is not going to be one I'll buy again.  Given all the five-star reviews, I was expecting these to taste MUCH better than they do.  While not too sweet, the strong vanilla flavor overwhelms the flavor of the cashews, pomegranate, and apple.  I love vanilla, but there's just too much in the blend for me.  I bought the pack of six and wish I had bought one pack to try, instead.

review/summary: Overloaded with sesame seeds and too chewy!
review/text: The overload of sesame seeds ruined the taste for me.  The nuts were chewy instead of crispy and it was mostly nuts, not many cranberries.  Thankfully it wasn't too sweet but the texture with the sesame seeds and "chewy" nuts ruined it for me.  They may have been stale but the lack of a expiration date made that unclear so I trust Amazon wouldn't send me expired goods although they have before.

How did this stuff get past the corpoate taste tests?  It is even worse than Emerald brand dry roasted almonds, which are awful because of the garlic and onion added.  I love plain salted roasted almonds, and thought Sahale could find a way to make them even better tasting.  Not this time.

review/text: I bought these several days ago from our local supermarket and was very disappointed.  The nuts were chewy and slightly soft..is this normal and yes they were months from expiration.  Yuck at the softness, however.  Then there was a strange texture of hard, little bumps on this softened nut..another yuck.  The taste of the flavors blended wasn't my thing either..all wrong in my opinion.  I gave it a two because it was edible but will never repurchase.

review/summary: Indulge Your Tastebuds
review/text: About a month ago, I noticed a new product at my local QFC. It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale "town mouse" to my regular, boring "country mouse" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love.

The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.<br /><br />Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!<br /><br />Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!<br /><br />Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!<br /><br />Scrumptious!

review/text: I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third (see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy.  The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit.  Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1/4 cup serving.

review/text: Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday!! It is the perfect blend of savory, tangy, sweet, and a touch spicy.  I know that sounds like a weird combo, but its sooo good, addicting even. I initially  bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store, but amazon .com has the lowest price I've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! It's so conveniant. I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting, so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. I do suggest the multiple 12  2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!!

review/text: Be warned - if you like these, then you are setting yourself up for many re-orders! I personally love the marriage of vanilla and cashews, and while I wasn't sure about the pomegranate - it helps to create a unique blend of flavors. They have become my go-to munchie and the only complaint I have is the relatively high cost. Most stores have them for around $5/bag, but ordering this package saves you $1 per bag overall. Go ahead and treat yourself - they are a great alternative to the usual cookie, cake, etc. type of snacks.

review/text: I got a variety pack of Sahale mixes, and this was the only one i liked. The others just didn't work for me, though i only actively disliked one (sing buri, my coworkers all hated it too, though they gladly ate the other flavors i dismissed).<br /><br />For the reviewer who said it was too peppery, either they're extremely sensitive to black pepper, they got a badly mixed bag, or by chance grabbed a bit that was more peppery than the rest and didn't explore further. I think the pepper is perfect, strong enough to give it a little kick and sting, but light enough that it's not the primary (or even secondary) flavor. There is some variability, though, and once in a while you'll get a mouth full of pepper.<br /><br />While i gladly eat these for a snack at my desk at work, they are a must-have for long plane trips. The nuts make it filling, and the cranberries and glaze give it a nice sweet touch without being so sugary that i get the jitters trapped in a middle seat on hour 2 of a cross-country flight.

review/summary: Great snacks
review/text: I picked up a bag of these on a whim the other day and I was instantly hooked.  I like almonds, but plain almonds do get boring, salted almonds are usually too salty, and honey covered almonds are usually too sweet and too salty.  And it's hard to find almonds that aren't roasted in some kind of cheap oil.<br /><br />Enter these Sahale snacks. A little salt, a little honey, and dry roasted almonds.  Oh and cranberries.  In my bag I didn't get many cranberries, I don't know if that was a fluke but I didn't care because I was mostly after the almonds.  If you are looking for a  big handful of almonds and cranberries this might disappoint.  For me it's been a great snack to keep around the office (it helps me avoid the 3PM coke-and-potato chip craving).<br /><br />The price seems a little high at first, but a single bag last several days, which put's in line with the cost of bag of chips.  Overall a great snack that's actually pretty good for you.

review/summary: Larger sized bags of the Valdosta Blend are available at Costco seasonally
review/text: The ingredient list made for interresting reading. So much so that I almost left my first bag of these treats on the shelf. The kicker for me was that they did not contain any ingredients I am allergic to, so into my basket they went.<br /><br />Once I tried them I became addicted.  These are great right out of the bag.  I also love them in a tossed green salad with crumbled bleu cheese and thinly sliced fresh pears.<br /><br />I checked Costco yesterday for the Valdosta Blend, but they were out.  They are currently offering another Sahale blend with almonds.  I didn't buy it--I'll wait for the Valdosta to come in.  I am not sure if Costco changes the Sahale snack selection seasonally or if they were just out-of-stock.<br /><br />When we were vacationing in Texas, I bought another Sahale blend to sample.  I wish I could remember the name of it. It wasn't as good and I would not go out of my way to buy it again. I will continue to buy the Valdosta Blend regularly though.

review/text: I love salty snack foods, especially cheesy ones, and one of the things that I miss most on a low-carb regime are Doritos. The Sahale Southwest Cashews have all the spicy-cheesy-salty goodness of a Dorito, but are low carb -- 10g carb per quarter-cup. They're addictive. They're quite expensive (one cup of nuts per package), but if you're not worried about what you're paying for your snack food, these are great.

review/text: The Sahale Soledad mix is similar to my Sahale fave mix, Valdosta, in that it's a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and spices, with a varied texture of chewy and crunchy and a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors, but there is something about it that I'm not quite in love with. It's not the stickiness, because I don't mind that except for the it being a bit messy if I'm snacking while on line, which I often am.<br /><br />I guess, as I've said before in my reviews of Sahale nut snacks, I think every one of them pales in comparison to the perfection of the Valdosta variety. In fact, I'm so crazy about the Sahale Valdosta mix that I posted a Haiku in praise. I know, pathetic. So, take my opinions of the other flavors with a grain of sea salt.

Good to eat out of hand, and also good to toss into a salad for some extra flavor and texture."<br /><br />After trying this snack I'd purchased away from my usual shpping spots, I couldn't remember the name of it and bought various nut snacks of other brands that I thought may have been the same, but was repeatedly sadly disappointed. Just yesterday I found the real thing again and decided to see if I could get it from Amazon. I was successful at first, but then after receiving them and wanting to get more, found Amazon was out.

review/text: These are so good. One of my favorite snacks. I don't feel bad munching on them either. I think I will try some other varieties from Sahale now. I first found these at my local health food store and was very excited to find them on Amzn because they are cheaper here.

review/summary: My new favorite snack!
review/text: These are mind-blowingly delicious -- sweet, salty, tangy, and just a little exotic. The balance of flavors is just right; the combined impression is pretty bold, but no single ingredient is overpowering. It's definitely a salty snack, but the other flavors come through beautifully. Every bite has its own character -- you might get a nice little burst of chili (mild; more pungent than hot) and sweet, chewy pineapple in one bite, and then a cluster of crunchy, tangy cashews and peanuts with a hint of lemongrass in the next. Oh, and be sure to give the bag a good shake before you dig in, to distribute all the good stuff that settles at the bottom.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Not so Fresh
review/text: I first purchased these Sahale snacks at Costco, and quickly became addicted to them.  When I couldn't find them any longer at Costco, I searched the internet for these tasty snacks.  I was delighted to find them available at Amazon.com.  When they arrived, I opened a pack, and was surprised at how hard the dried cranberries were.  The flavor was still good...the nuts still tasted fresh, but the cranberries took some effort to chew.  I hope this was just a bad batch, purhaps others are better.

review/text: I got addicted to Sahale's snacks from the Tully's Coffee that was downstairs at work.  After pretty much buying them out they didn't restock in enough time so I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy in bulk from Amazon.  My 3 favorites are Socorro, Ksar and Soledad.  If you want a healthy snack that tastes like you're indulging in sinful goodness then this is the snack for you.<br /><br />I give these a 4 because sometimes the almonds are a little over roasted for my tastes but all the girls at work seem to like this one the most so they must know something I don't.

review/summary: Utterly marvelous -- best of the Sahale nut snacks
review/text: These match the excellent quality of the same product from a local store, as do the "Soledad" almonds.  It is difficult to keep from eating the whole pricey bag at one sitting. These are the Sahale Snacks that sell out first in the store.  Friends likewise agree that these are the best.  For some reason, in my recent shipment, these "Valdosta" pecans and the "Soledad" almonds were as good as the ones from the store, but the "Soccorro" Macadamia / hazelnut and the "Dauphine" Walnut / blueberry snacks were stale-tasting, even rancid, especially the walnuts, this despite being two to five months pre-expiration date.

review/summary: Mostly just really sweet cashews
review/text: The combination sounded wonderful and the picture was enticing but that isn't exactly what I received.  The cashews were crunchy and very sweet but I had a hard time finding the pomegranate like in the photo or even near it.  First 2 handfuls there was nada.  At the end there was a little which added an almost discernable tartness (which was why I bought them) and some sprinklings in the bottom of the bag but all very tiny.  Disappointed as I didn't buy simple, sweet cashews..could have gotten those in a larger quantity and for cheaper (and prefer the usual honey flavor of other brands to this vanilla).  I wasn't impressed. (I bought mine at a local grocery store and they were fresh.)

review/text: I love nuts and almonds among my favorites. When I saw the description of Sahale almonds I was so excited to try it. All the ingredients looked just delicious so I've got a subscription on it. Unfortunately now, when I got my first batch of them and tried, I have to cancel it. Every time I eat them I have a heartburn. Not sure what exactly causes it because I'm fine with pure almonds, sea salt (at least with the one I have at home), honey, cranberries, no known food allergies. It might be salt/nuts/cranberries combination that causes it, not sure.
