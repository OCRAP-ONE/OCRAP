review/summary: Too sweet.. most people will like that
review/text: Its too sweet. A lot of people will like it, but it is closer to a soda then it is to drinking straight out of a coconut...which is why people will like it. I will stick to ONE or naked coconut water.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: No issues with this product, which is my favorite coconut juice. I have to wonder if some of these reviews (e.g., people saying it "must be" sweetened since it tastes sweet) are somehow trying to skew the ratings to support another brand, esp when they specifically recommend another brand. This is a new and growing segment of the market and some players do play nasty!

review/summary: gross - sickly sweet weird taste
review/text: I've tried several of the coconut waters available and this one is by far my least favorite!!!! I hate the overly sweet flavor that makes it taste artificial. Even though its all natural, the flavor just doesn't taste like the coconuts I had in Thailand. I won't ever buy this product again.<br /><br />I prefer the O.N.E product, which is mildly sweet. If you like sweeter, you can try Vita Coco. And if don't like sweet at all you can try Zico which is not sweet at all, but yet still refreshing.

review/summary: Suspicion of sugar or sweetened in product
review/text: After you drink all types of coconut juice including fresh juice from real coconuts you can figure the taste of coconut juice and its slight variations.  This juice is too sweet and most likely artificially sweetened or sugar was added to it.  Or it tastes like it was sweetened severely and its all in my mind.<br /><br />Well, I emailed Amy & Brian and got no response.  Just ignored my inquiry.  Guess a company who wants to be "all natural" does not care what the customers think.  All respect down the drain....literally.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Buy VITA Coco, ONE Coconut Juice and stay away from this garbage.

review/text: I saw the sale available, and even with such a good deal I was hesitant to purchase because of the bad reviews. I have to say, that I'm very happy that I made the purchase. This juice is delicious. My son and I both love it and It's a great drink to have on a hot Phoenix day. I'm a true believer that people are more likely to write a review, if they dislike the product than if they don't and I truly believe that this juice doesn't deserve the low rating that it has. If you get a bad batch please contact Amazon and they will replace it for you.

review/summary: buy a canned coconut water..you do not get all the good stuff
review/text: I have read this about the brand..Amy Brians, like all canned coco water this brand is "cooked" coconut water. Unlike tetra paked coco water (vita coco and ONE)which is only flash pasteurized for 3 seconds, canned coco water is heated at extremely high temp for long time which cooks out all the vitamins and minerals and electrolytes. So there is no potassium left. Its basically like goya (really cheap brand that has been around for years) canned coco water without the added sugar and pulp.<br /><br />If you want all the good stuff and TASTE.. I would rate them<br />vita coco  ..10<br />ONE.......... 8<br />Zico......... 2<br />cans.........-10

review/summary: More chewing sessions for your hard-earned dollar
review/text: I have a sheltie who loves the Dingo rawhide/chicken jerky combo bones, and thought I'd give Wag'n Wraps a try.  Even though Zoey is only 30 lbs and barely knee-high, I decided to get the JUMBO size of the Wag'n Wraps, as Zoey prefers a large chew.<br /><br />Each "retriever roll" is an inch and a quarter in diameter, and just shy of 10" in length.  There are 2 rolls per package.  Zoey chewed on one of these last night for about half an hour and maybe only took off an inch or inch and a half of the retriever roll.  Each roll lasts through six 30-minute chewing sessions for Zoey.  In comparison, Zoey could go through an entire 5" long Dingo Dyno stick in half an hour, and Dyno Stix only come 3 to a pkg for roughly the same price as two Jumbo Wag'n Wraps.  I believe the Jumbo Wag'n Wraps are a better deal, and I store the partially chewed Wag'n Wrap in a large ziploc bag for the next evening's chewing session.<br /><br />When you first look at the end of a Wag'n Wrap, it looks like it's a single layer of rawhide over a thick meaty center.  This would be too easy for my dog to chew through.  I'm glad to say that there are many layers of rawhide to this treat, and that the meaty part appears to run in a thin strip down the middle of the roll, with some of the meaty mixture thinly spread between the rawhide layers.  Much more difficult for Zoey to chew through, but she still gets the meaty satisfaction.<br /><br />The smell of these chicken Wag'n Wraps is of the liquid smoke ingredient.<br /><br />From the package (I really like that there's no meat by-product in these!):<br />Guaranteed Analysis: Crude Protein (min) 80.0%, Crude Fat (min) 1.0%, Crude Fiber (max) 2.0%, Moisture (max) 14.0%<br /><br />Ingredients: Rawhide, Chicken, Pork, Rice Starch, Chicken Flavorings, Water, Corn Sugar, Salt, Liquid Smoke, Potassium Sorbate (a Preservative)

review/summary: Quality food without the unnecessary additives
review/text: Cats are carnivores.  If you check out the ingredients list for many of the common brands you find at the grocery store, you'll see the first couple of ingredients are *not* meat, but rather grains.  As well, the meat typically is made up of by-products, which are not suitable for human consumption.  Yes,  I know, we're not going to be consuming our feline companion's food, but the reality is with cats and their funky digestive tract issues, their food should not contain grain or meat by-products, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are a number of outstanding grain-free cat foods out there, but this one in particular our cats eat happily.  One of our cats was significantly overweight, and with NOW recommended by our veterinarian , my fiancee gave it a try. At the time he began this food, we were actually living on opposite coasts and I hadn't seen the cats in roughly 8 months given my travels.  When I saw our cat after that absence, I was shocked to see how slimmed down he was and how healthy he had become.  Using this food, in combination with that feeding bowl in which the cats have to stick their paws into to retrieve the food (looks like a flying saucer) has been the key to success!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product is not widely stocked at pet care places in our area, but I am delighted that Amazon carries it.  I've been able to order it, trouble-free, and the food arrives fresh and ready to be consumed.  I highly recommend this brand and encourage you to read the ingredient labels on anything you feed your pet-companions.

review/summary: Great ingredients, I think.
review/text: I bought a small bag of this to try with my cats.  One is 16 years old and the other 10.  Both seemed to enjoy it as a snack, so I went back and bough the large 10lb bag, thinking I was doing them a favor.  The ingredients are impressive, however, as I slowly moved them over from their traditional Purina One to this product, both of them developed a severe case of the runs.  So, I portioned them back to a larger portion of the Purina One thinking they needed more time to adjust to this new food, however I can't seem to get them back to normal.  So, I have 95% of this bag and am not currently feeding them any of it.  I also had to get some remedy for the diahrrea, which is taking time to kick in.<br /><br />As I mentioned, they seemed to love the taste, but it has been a big problem for their digestive systems.

review/summary: Great for older cat with sensitive skin
review/text: About a year ago, my 12-year-old cat developed an itchy rash on her forehead.  The vet ruled out more serious health issues, and speculated that it was an allergic reaction or food sensitivity.  And so began a year of cat food experiments...<br /><br />We tried a range of grain-free foods with various protein sources.  Some didn't help the skin; some she didn't like. The local pet food store suggested this.  The big selling point was that it doesn't have any "meals"-- no "chicken meal" or "fish meal" or "turkey byproduct" or whatever.  She has been eating this for the past 6 months or so, and her skin has cleared up remarkably.  And the fact that she taps on my cheek until I wake up and feed her in the morning suggests that it is also quite delicious.<br /><br />It is expensive, but it has helped her skin issues enough that it's been worth it.  (A trip to the vet costs quite a bit more!)  If you have an older cat that seems to have developed a food sensitivity, this is definitely a good option to try.

review/summary: Outstanding food, grain free
review/text: As any cat owner will tell you, cat digestive systems are a royal challenge.  Now! Dry Cat Food is a unique product that doesn't have any fillers, no grain at all, and the meat that is used contains no by-products.  Essentially, it's human-grade.<br /><br />Cat's are carnivores, plain and simple.  And this food addresses that beautifully.<br /><br />This particular formula, for senior and overweight cats, has made a huge difference in the quality of our cat's health.  My cats love the taste, never turn their nose up from this product, and my formerly over-weight cat is now looking terrific, and both he and his brother are very healthy - healthy coat, bright eyes, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately this product is not sold every where (yet)but I am grateful I can get it here on Amazon!  I highly recommend this brand.

review/summary: Great for cat with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
review/text: I've purchased the Now! Grain free (10 lbs) turkey with duck & salmon dry cat food 3 times now over the past 4 months.  Wanted to see how our cat with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) would do on it.  He loves it, and will chow it down to the point where he would get fat, if we let him.  Have to portion it out to him thru the day.  Other cat loves it, too, and she no longer vomits on a regular basis.  Definitely a good quality product which is sold at our veterinarian's office, but I buy it online with Amazon for better price. Sidenote:  we're gradually starting to reduce the amount of budesonide medicine given to our cat with IBS problem to eventually see how he does without the medicine & if he's okay just being on Now! grain free food.

review/text: I love this trail mix -- it's absolutely delicious! Plus, since all of Enjoy Life's products are completely free of the "top 8" food allergens (milk, egg, peanut, tree nut, soy, wheat, fish, shell fish), this trail mix is safe for most food-allergic kids and adults.<br /><br />In my "how to" book [...] I talk about the importance of always bringing safe snacks with you when you take your food-allergic child on outings. This is a great product to have on hand for that purpose!

review/summary: Great for those with Allergies
review/text: I bought this for my husband who has a peanut allergy. This is the first time he's ever been able to eat any kind of trail mix. He loves the taste and it's a great, healthy snack (he prefers the Beach Bash to the Mountain Mambo) . The monthly subscription has been enough for him to enjoy it as a snack each day, and it's substantially cheaper than buying it in the store.

review/summary: Good for my kids allergies & GRANOLA BAR RECIPE
review/text: My kids have many food allergies sensitivities and this mix is fine for them to eat. It is a nice mix and sweet enough to feel like a treat. However, my kids (6, 5 & 3 years old) tend to pick out the fruit pieces they like and leave the rest...even though they like those other ingredients when served separately.<br /><br />This trail mix now serves a new purpose for us. Recently we stopped ordering the Enjoy Life granola bars due to the brown rice syrup and the reports that some brown rice syrup contains arsenic. I have figured out how to make my own granola bars using this mix and a few other ingredients. Here is the recipe in case anyone else is interested:<br /><br />3 bags Enjoy Life No Nuts Seed and Fruit mix (I bet any of the blends would work)<br />1/4 Cup Coconut Flour<br />1/4 Cup Ground Flax Seeds<br />1/4 Cup Cacao Nibs (these are unsweetened, and optional. I'm sure the Enjoy Life mini chocolate chips would be great in here too, or raisins...)<br /><br />In case you are unfamiliar with any of the ingredients here are samples of each:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011MFW4A">Enjoy Life not nuts! Beach Bash Nut Free Trail Mix, Gluten, Dairy & Nut Free,  6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GZ7Z2">Bob's Red Mill Organic Coconut Flour -- 16 oz</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDBQ6A">Bob's Red Mill Organic  Flaxseed Meal, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL9GI">Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />You could add a little honey or other sweetener, but we don't. The fruit in it makes it just sweet enough. However, due to my kids' allergies they are used to this type of food. If you are just converting off a typical American diet, you might want it sweeter. Also, this recipe seems pretty forgiving if you want to experiment. I might try some with sunflower butter. I bet it would good, but this way is tasty and pretty simple, and I'm not sure that I want to add any more $ to these since we already go through 2-3 batches a week.<br /><br />Before you start, preheat the oven to 300-350. (This is important if you want to do it the busy mom way.) Put it all in the food processor and let  it become very fine granules, it will take a few minutes. Add 1/2 cup extremely hot water and keep it whizzing in the food processor for just a minute or so to mix it together. Pour into a pan. I use an 11 inch by 7 inch Pyrex pan. It helps if you grease the bottom. The mixture is very sticky, so spreading it out evenly is a little tricky. I use a large metal spatula-type thing that is actually for cutting dough. The parts that stick to the spatula I take off and put in the corners of the pan. I'm able to get it nice and smooth, just expect it to be thick and sticky. Next bake it for 10-15 minutes, or put it in and turn off the oven so you don't have to remember it. That's what I do and it works great. I just let it stay in there until I'm ready to cut it into bars or squares. It is much easier to cut if you wait for it to cool completely.<br /><br />So, now that I am using this to make granola bars, we are going through a lot of this. But it's healthy and free of all the allergens my kids have. I hope this helps someone.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering about ingredients. The bags I just got (with a new designed tan, orange and brown bag) list this:<br />Raw Sunflower Kernels, Pineapples*, Roasted Hulled Pumkin Seeds (Sunflower Oil (Sunflower Oil, Citric Acid), salt), Cranberries*, Apricots*.<br />*Sulfite-free<br />Also, they expire in September of this year...so, about 6 months from when I got them.

review/summary: Finally a Nut-Free Trail Mix!
review/text: I don't have to tell you how hard it is to find a nut-free trail mix.  And one that is free of cross-contamination, too!<br />I bought these as much for my peanut-allergic son as I did for myself.<br />I love trail mix but am not comfortable having it in the house with his food allergy.<br />We got the other flavor, mountain mambo, in the go picnic! snack kit & loved it.  This one was prime-eligible, though, so we tried this flavor.<br />Not as good as Mountain Mambo, but still good.  I found it a little too sweet with all the chunks of dried pineapple.<br />LOVE the pumpkin seeds for crunch.<br />A 6 ounce bag goes pretty fast in our house, so approx $4/bag is a little pricey for a snack, but given how sweet this mix is, we manage to keep our portion sizes down & it lasts a little longer.<br />I would probably pay even more, though, just to finally have a nut-free trail mix option.  I'd love to see them come out with more flavors.

review/summary: If You Like to Cook Healthy for Your Family.....
review/text: If you want to cook healthily for your family, you'll love this KING ARTHUR ORGANIC WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. If you're looking for a healthy, light whole wheat flour, a nutritionist recommended KING ARTHUR'S WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. It has the nutrition of whole wheat with the consistency of white flour--so it's not too heavy and gritty. I make gravies, soups, muffins, pancakes, cookies etc.--everything with it. I'll never buy white non-nutritious flour again! It's a great way to sneak whole grains into desserts. I never feel guilty cooking with this as I know it's healthy for my family and provides necessary whole grains. It has the whole grain yellow stamp on it, which my son says means it's good for you. I love cooking with this flour and use it all the time.

review/summary: High end take out taste, only made at home by you in minutes.
review/text: If you love Indian food but are afraid of making it yourself, skip the take out and try this instead. The flavors are vey authentic and the meals are very easy to prepare. I was also very impressed with their customer service! I am highly allergic to cilantro so I called to see if it was anywhere in the spice mixes and they took the time to explain that there was no cilantro, only the corriander seed. Even better, they knew about the cilantro allergy and even explained something my drs hadn't. It seems that I'm not alone and they have had inquiries about the cilantro allergy and explained that most people like me are allergic to the juice of the plany, found in the stem and the leaves. After talking with one of the owners of Gourmantra I called my drand he did his own desearch with the new information and we finally had the answer we were looking for.<br /><br />So great product, easy to prepare, wonderful customer service and supporting a small business...and all at an affordable cost. Total win in my book!<br /><br />Note: The kits do not hold back on flavor or spice. I was able to adjust the heat level by not adding in the full amount of seasoning for my kid's portions but added in the rest for my husband and me. Just be aware that even if it says mild, there is still a lot of flavor and depending on your pallet, some may find it a bit spicy.

review/summary: Gourmantra Quality Control
review/text: Good evening.  I purchased the Gourmantra assortment pack and the order was timely delivered.<br />However, as I should the packaged I thought to myself that some rice packages must've broken open.<br />Indeed, two boxes within the package had rice spilling out as their rice bags must've become unglued, rendering two of the 6 packs useless to me unless I now go out and buy rice.<br />I made the Channa Masala recipe pack, and let me just say you do NOT need 28 oz of Garbanzo beans.  So be cognizant when buying this pack and grocery shopping for the supplies.<br />Which brings me to another point--you WILL have to buy additional ingredients for these, whether it be chicken for the butter chicken or tandoori, yogurt, cream, butter, oil, onions, etc.<br />The simplest one to make was the Channa Masala.  Let me tell you if you follow the instructions to a T, you will be AHmazed at what you can do to stimulate your gastric glands.<br /><br />The only beef (no pun intended!) I have is I didn't read the description well enough when ordering it.  The product is different than what I expected I was ordering but to no fault of theirs as I just didn't read the details well-enough.  I thought these were the pre-mixed packages.<br /><br />Bon appetite!

review/text: This is my #1 favorite Haldiram's snack mix. I love the flavorful and spicy blend of shoestring potatoes, rice, lentils and seeds... and most importantly, plenty of cashews! Sometimes I eat it out of hand as a snack, and sometimes at dinner I sprinkle it on dishes to spice them up with a wonderful crunchy topping. Yum!<br /><br />I also really like the "special pack for extra freshness".  The zip bag with inner membrane really keeps the mixture fresh for a long time. The first time I got it at my local Indian grocery, the storekeeper gave me the bag for free because it was past the date marked on it. But the product inside was so good that I was hooked, and I have been buying it ever since.

Of course Taylor's is a respected upper mid range brand (not quite "boutique" but I wouldn't be willing to spend that much money on a tea for everyday drinking), so it shouldn't be any surprise that this one is good too.

review/summary: DELICIOUS MIXED NUTS & WHITE CHOCOLATE BAR!!!
review/text: Okay so I ordered every flavor of these during the summer sale in June were most of the flavors $12, and if you signed up "Subscribe and Save" they were $10.50 each.  So, I will be putting up reviews as I open each box.  They have been in the fridge (keeps me from random snacking) and I opened Dark Chocolate, Chocolate Mudslide, and Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate last night.  I am 5'3" and 118 and I try to add some protein to my diet with bars like this.  My review will only be for the Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate (others on the appropriate product pages.)  I will start with what EVERYONE really cares about: TASTE!  These bar tasted incredible to me!!!! Nutty, sweet, light, creamy white chocolate, chewy consistency, NO chemical taste, sweet but not too sweet. I read the nutrient profile and the ingredient list, and I am really pleased with the ingredient quality.  This is what attracted me to the product.  It is very low sugar, gluten free, and wheat free.  This is great for those watching their waistline.  On the other hand, it has a pretty sizeable fat content.  This one has 12(!!!) grams of fat.  So just be aware of that when including in your diet, too many of these and you WILL gain weight!  The protein is okay (10 grams), as much as 1.5 oz of grilled chicken.  (Although chicken breast doesn't have this much fat, and that's not enough chicken to fill anyone up.)  The sodium isn't bad (110 mg).  There are 8 net carbs, which subtract out the fiber and sugar alcohols (the sugar alcohols are in debate as to whether your body burns them as calories or not.)  The calories, fat, protein, and carbs are equal to: a large plain green salad, 1.5 oz chicken breast, 2 cups broccoli, almost a full tablespoon of oil.  So I say that to illustrate that this is definitely a healthy MEAL REPLACEMENT for those on the go (if you add veggies and soup) and really has TOO MANY calories for a full bar to be a snack. It also doesn't have enough heaviness/volume in your stomach to make you feel full for four hours until your next meal.  It is kind a lightweight bar compared to thinkTHIN's regular 20gram protein bars (Read my review for Dark Chocolate and Chocolate Mudslide, those have a preferable nutrient profile for a meal replacement.)  I don't really think any bar that has more fat than protein is helpful, people will still be hungry and gain weight. They do not really have enough protein to eat as a meal replacement because you will be hungry in less than four hours after eating.  If you do use as a meal replacement, add a broth soup and a large green salad with low-cal dressing, or veggies (most grocery stores sell washed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots that you can eat on the go.)  Another way to incorporate these DELICIOUS bars into your routine is a breakfast.  Perfect for on the go and it's hard to eat more before lunch even if you do get hungry (which most people don't get very hungry before lunch.)  So in summary: EXCELLENT ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS; DELICIOUS, SWEET NUTTY FLAVOR WITH CREAMY WHITE CHOCOLATE (as good as a candy bar); CONVENIENT PACKAGING; WEAK VITAMIN & MINERAL PROFILE (you'll still need a comprehensive multivitamin daily); CONVENIENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN; GREAT SNACK (if you eat half as a snack or the other half later in the day as a snack.)  THE PRICE IS RIGHT too based on Amazon's deal vs. in store pricing on these bars.  They are very expensive in retail stores, Amazon is selling them almost 50% off.  Helpful hint: if you sign up for Subscribe & Save, you get the best price.  You can set your shipments to every six months, and even if you don't want them then, you can delay shipment.  The point is, you really never have to buy more later in order to get the best price now.  You can keep deferring shipment.  Not saying that to scam Amazon, just saying that may help more people be willing to try a delicious bar if the price is right.  I hope this review helped you make a purchasing decision, either for or against the product.  I know I hate to waste my money, and I wanted to give a honest review.

review/summary: Really Good Tasting Snack Bar - Highly Recommended!
review/text: These "ThinkThin Crunch, Mixed Nuts and White Chocolate" snack bars are really good tasting! The flavor is a nice mix between the nuts and the white chocolate, with neither one overpowering the other. Being a type 2 diabetic, I try to watch my carb intake (especially sugar) and these are low enough that they are safe for a mid-day treat.<br /><br />Each Bar Has -<br />Calories: 180 (100 from Fat, with 2.5g of Saturated Fat)<br />Carbs: 12g Net (16g - 4g Fiber = 12g, with only 2g from Sugar)<br />Protein: 10g<br /><br />It should be noted that these do contain Maltitol, which can cause "gastric distress" in some people.<br /><br />I ordered these in the summer and the white chocolate did melt and stick to the foil packaging on the first ones we opened since they were sitting on the porch for a bit before we got to them. This was not an issue for the rest after we got them inside and they sat for a day or so.<br /><br />The real test is if my picky kids will eat them, and they also like them as much as I do.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I frequently purchase ThinkThin bars, and when I see a good price from Amazon, I jump.  However, in the last 2 purchases, the product has arrived in moderately poor condition.  The box of crunch bars was damaged and repaired with tape.  One bar was missing.  Twice I have purchased the peanut butter bars and both times the chocolate was powdery and cakey as if it had been stored in a less than optimal temperature range.  They were within the sell-by date, but had that "too old" look.  I will not purchase through Amazon again.

review/summary: BEST tasting protein bar I've EVER had.
review/text: This is a great bar. I'm calling it a protein bar because even though it might not have as much protein as the heavy hitters, it still has 10 grams which is pretty respectable, especially for a nut bar. The taste is great, and since nuts like almonds help you control hunger I eat one of these when I get an urge to go on a midnight eating binge, I get to enjoy a great tasting bar that's good for me, and my hunger goes away! WIN WIN!

review/text: I discovered Think Thin products at my local Trader Joe's market. But, the per bar price was a bit high. Then I saw that Amazon sold them and had so many more flavors. I have been ordering them one by one. This is one of my favorites. I like the crunch of the nuts and the sweetness of the white chocolate. It may be a little too sweet. I like the darker chocolate with the nuts better. But, if you're looking for a different taste with the crunch of nuts, this is a good choice. I use them as a breakfast food mostly. They don't raise my blood glucose and that's good.

review/text: These protein bars are so tasty that we have them on auto refill. This flavor does not taste at all like a "diet" bar or like any other "health" bar we've tried. My picky husband is even willing to eat these. I always keep one in my purse and we keep them in our car. When we're on the go and a "hunger headache" or "hunger shakes" come on, we reach for one of these bars and we're good to go for 3 or so more hours. We are not fond of all the flavors in this brand line, but the nut crunch line is delicious.

review/text: I eat a protein bar daily, and look for ones that are high protein, low carb, and actually taste good.  This bar only had 10 grams of protein, which is half of what the Think Thin Proteins bars have, but this bar is delicious!  I love the nuts and having a sweet, crunchy treat. This is definitely one of my favorite bars.  It arrived during a heat wave (but the price during their June deal was so good, I risked it), and it does crumble easily from having melted and then cooled.  But other than that, this bar is a win!

Think Thin bars are a great option for a quick breakfast or snack on the go.  I love that they are GF, have little or no sugar, and are chock full of protein.  This flavor is my favorite, but we also loved the peanut butter flavors.  When ordered using Subscribe and Save, they are very competitively priced on Amazon.

review/summary: Sweet and crunchy gluten free delight...
review/text: Like most of the thinkThin line, I like this bar as an occassional snack. Most importantly for me, it's gluten free, very crunchy with a lot of nuts (more peanuts than anything) and bits of crisped soy (that are a lot like small pieces of crisped rice) which can make it crumbly sometimes. It's not sickening sweet which makes me happy and the "white chocolate" coating on the bottom is a yummy twist. I like this one because it is satisfies my sweet craving and something lovely to enjoy every now and then...if I could change anything it would be that it would have more than 10g of protein.

I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/text: I was surpised at the relative mildness of this Colombian coffee; many of them are a bit much for me, but not this one.  It's very finely ground which usually adds to the taste strength.  Despite the advertising, I don't generally think Colombian is better than other South or Central American coffees (and I've visited all the countries of both South and Central America).  But maybe it's your "cup of tea!"  Hah.  If I were to pick Colombian though, this would be the one.  It's not bitter, but has lots of flavor.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Good and Plenty!
review/text: If you pay $1.50 or less per box it's a good deal- especially with free s/h. These are available at local convenience and supermarkets for between $1 and $1.50<br />You've gotta like the taste of black licorice though- cause these are little nubs of black licorice with a hard candy shell. kind of like jordan almonds are almonds with a hard candy shell. One of my favorite no fat snack foods.

review/text: These "movie theater" size boxes are the right size to have to watch a movie.  I have ordered these a few times when the price can't be beat, which is usually the case on Amazon.  Even though I don't finish them for a couple of months, the last box has been as good as the first box, with the licorice being soft and chewy, and the shell with a hard sugar coating that did not break down.  One of my favorite indulgences!

review/summary: Outstanding product
review/text: I was initially leery because the bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening, but the benefit of this consistency over hard cubes is hard to overstate.  You can use exactly as much or as little as you need; it can be dissolved easily in cold liquids; and the flavor is just excellent.  I've used it in everything from risotto to aash-e reshteh, and it hasn't disappointed me yet.

review/summary: Delicious! But buy it elsewhere for under 5 bucks.
review/text: I am vegan and use this a lot more than I ought to. You can add a bit to just about any vegan dish (other than desert... ew) to give it the extra "YUM!" factor. I don't think it really tastes like chicken (as far as I remember) but it is yummy anyway. I made green bean supreme with lots of tomatoes and garlic and added a bit of this and my omnivore friends begged me for the recipe (recipe link in comments).<br /><br />As for the price: please do not buy it from here. The price is insane! Iherb has it for 4.27 right now. If you haven't bought from iherb before my reward code HUM176 can save you 5 bucks off your first purchase. Shipping is free if you spend 20 bucks so it's a great deal. You can stock up like I did.

review/summary: Great product--inflated price!
review/text: I almost always make my own stocks and such. However, as a vegetarian, creating a "chicken stock" from scratch can be rather, shall we say, difficult? That's where my "Better than Bouillon, No Chicken Base" comes in quite handy.<br /><br />Better Than Bouillon, No Chicken Base is wonderful in terms of adding flavor to rice, tofu, and veggie dishes. Personally, I don't miss the taste of chicken, but the additional flavor helps woo my omnivorous daughter to try dishes that she might not normally eat. And that? is priceless! ;)<br /><br />Speaking of price, $13.88? I originally thought this was for two jars. While my local grocer does not carry the vegan bases (all other bases are around the $5 mark); the website soups online sells the entire line for around $5 and offers $5.99 shipping regardless of order size (orders over $75 earn free shipping). Still a little pricey, but a better value--especially if ordering multiples. Best bet? Ask your local grocer to start stocking them. I mean, it never hurts to ask, right?

review/summary: Yummy yet messy! But no palm oil, yay!
review/text: Better Than Bouillon is a line of "concentrated paste food bases" that includes three vegan options: vegetable, beef, and chicken (or rather "no beef" and "no chicken"). The "not bouillon" comes in small, 8 ounce jars and requires refrigeration after opening. You use the paste much the same way you'd use bouillon - there instructions for use on the jar - but according to the manufacturer, the paste is supposed to result in a "richer and more natural flavor" than one can get from bouillon cubes.<br /><br />I've bought a jar of each to sample, but thus far have only tried the chicken flavor (to make vegan chicken noodle soup - of course!). While the broth is indeed delicious, I can't say that I prefer it over the vegan bouillon cubes I normally use (namely, Edward & Sons and Rapunzel brand, though I'm still shopping around). Since it comes in a semi-liquid form, it's also messier and less convenient to use than a traditional bouillon. From an environmental perspective, the jars mean more packaging and greater use of resources in shipping.<br /><br />On the positive side, none of Better Than Bouillon's vegan options contain palm oil, whereas both Edward & Sons and Rapunzel do. So bonus points for that!<br /><br />Use it to make vegan soups, gravy, rice, seasoned veggies, pasta sauce - whatever your heart (or tummy) desires. Just be sure to recycle that glass, people!

review/summary: Great product, crazy price
review/text: This product is a real favorite with my wife and me. It really does have the best chicken flavor of any vegetarian substitute we've tried. Use this base with some of the Morning Star faux chicken strips and you can make a vegetarian version of chicken and dumplings that is honestly indistinguishable from real chicken!<br /><br />But the price... what gives?! Amazon, I love your service and selection, but $20 is just not reasonable. We pay about $6 at our local grocery. I would recommend buyers check with their local stores. Again, I understand the need for profit, but $20 is just too much.

review/summary: Great for soups and/or gravy
review/text: Since I am originally from Europe, I thought I couldn't live without KNORR Bouillon, but over the years I found out that I am reacting poorly to that product's MSG. I tried every other bouillon cube and/or soup and gravy base available, but was never happy with the results. Finally, I found "Better Than Bouillon" @ amazon.com and that product, together with another "cubed" bouillon, also on amazon.com, I was able to make my soups and gravies (or should I say "sauces") which  everybody always liked about my cooking. You cannot go wrong with this product!

review/text: My boss brought these back to me from Hawaii and I am now desiring to keep a bit in stock and to give some as gifts.  This chocolate packed can of heavenly goodness was so intensely delightful that I cannot even throw the canister away.  It reminds me of how much I enjoyed such a sweet and tasteful group of nuts!!  I don't mean my office.  Simply yummy.
