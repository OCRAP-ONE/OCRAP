review/summary: Delicious Soup
review/text: Hormel Bean and Ham Soup has a really great flavor. I like this soup much better that the leading canned bean soup and I like it even more than Dominique's Senate Bean Soup. Delicious! If you are a bean soup lover, I suggest that you try this soup.

review/text: I received a box of Gavarny Belgian Truffles as a gift from a customer.  I took a few pieces home to my husband and he thought he was in heaven.  So the internet search began.  These are the best truffles you can find.  Not too rich, very, very creamy and almost addictive.  The box count is larger than you would expect and you would be hard pressed to find such wonderful chocolate for a better price.

review/summary: Great stuff, always been an oatmeal fan
review/text: I have been eating oatmeal for quite a while now.  Though I might be slightly bias toward this product since I am an avid fan, I have to say that peaches and cream might be one of the better flavors.  It's not too sweet and not too bland, but the right mix.  Therefore, for those who like their oatmeal just right. I'd recommend this.

review/summary: The Only Oatmeal I Like
review/text: There's always been something about oatmeal that almost made me gag on its way down. It's not the taste; it's the weight, consistency and texture as it hits the soft palate. I can't explain it any better than that. My daughter says she has always had the same sensation, eating oatmeal.<br /><br />Not so with Quaker Peaches & Cream Instant Oatmeal! This is a hot, quick-and-easy breakfast food that I often make a stand-in for cookies or other sweet when I want a snack. It's a low-fat alternative, and at 130 calories a package, it's low-cal, too.<br /><br />I live in a remote area where foods are often overpriced and out-of-date on the grocer's shelf. Amazon's Subscribe & Save program makes this a very affordable item, and it's always fresh when it arrives.<br /><br />Stir up a bowl of goodness, pour yourself a glass of good, cold milk and enjoy!

review/summary: What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I bought them in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I also bought peach&cream flavor and noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe. I found blueberry flavor with REAL blueberries, cranberry with REAL cranberries. So it is possible to make a great product you just have to make an effort QUAKER and stop fooling your customers.

review/text: I use these when I go on long runs to help calm my stomach. They work well, but I used to have to unwrap them beforehand; otherwise, I had to stop my run to concentrate on the impossibly sticky wrapper.

Now, I can unwrap the outer layer and have the chews ready to go on a run.<br /><br />Good ginger flavor, very chewy, does not melt much so needs to be chewed.

review/summary: My favorite ginger chews
review/text: I do have a thing for ginger. I have been through Ginger Altoid, Reeds Ginger Chew, and now The Ginger People Ginger Chew phases. I still enjoy all of these products, but the Ginger People chews are my favorite of the bunch.<br /><br />I prefer them to Reeds because the ginger has just a wee bit more zing to me, and the quality is a bit more consistent. Reeds has had some problems with quality control of their product in my experience. It's gotten better lately, but is still a bit lax.<br /><br />Ginger Altoids I enjoy simply for the convenience.<br /><br />The calorie count of these chews is about the same as the Reeds chews, and I suspect the ginger content is very similar. I don't think it's necessary to scrutinize the labeling to realize that these are a ginger-flavored product, not real ginger.<br /><br />They do help relieve nausea, and I'm not going to make any medical claims, but I eat a few of these every day, and my joint pain from osteoarthritis has all but disappeared. YMMV.<br /><br />If you want to sample these before buying this rather sizable order of chews, Trader Joes does carry single bags. Buy one there, then come back and buy 12 boxes here.

review/text: I have been shopping with Amazon from many many years.  Whether it is text books for course study or pleasure reading, ebooks or games for my Kindle or music for my ipod.  Great Products and Fast delivery. I purchased the Ginger Chews about a week ago. This product was recommended to me by someone who has retired from singing backup for some well known recording artists.  She told me it was a great asset when stressing your voice whether it is speaking or singing.  It seems to open the vocal cords and the sinus seems to calm my throat when singing for long periods of time. It is a wonderful product and I have suggested it to several of my friends and where I found it. Thanks Amazon.

review/text: All of Ginger People packagings can be difficult, It depends how they are stored. I love the flavor of all of their chews, I am a Ginger freak, I Love the health aspects of the product. Regarding their Packaging, It doesn't matter it they are wrapped in Plastic or Parchment Both styles can be a pain in the but. If they are stored in a cool dry p;ace, I find they are easiest to open, If they are warm to hot, Forget it, you will have a problem with both wrappers due to the nature of the product itself. I actually prefer the Plastic packing to the Parchment double wrap. Just pinch with your fingers just right or left of the center and they open right up. I order 22 pounds at a time, what does that tell you about the product.

review/text: I bought a supply of these "ginger chews" to help with nausea during treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. I thought the calories were high and the "hot" taste was more like pepper. Looking carefully at the contents, I discovered these chews contain only 8% ginger! The sugar and tapioca (aka manioc root) are what add the carbs. They are tasty, but contain too little ginger for optimal results and taste. Unfortunately, I still have many small boxes of this product. They will make nice stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br />Roman Vanasse, Green Bay, Wisconsin.

review/summary: Tasty But High Calories with 7 Layers of Packing!
review/text: Chewy, ginger flavor is delightfully delicious. And yes, ginger does help indigestion and nausea caused by motion sickness, chemotherapy, morning sickness etc. One study shows ginger to even reduce pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee too. Because ginger can affect blood clotting, people on blood thinners need to be careful not to consume too much.<br /><br />This candy has two major downsides: each candy is 20 calories - way too much; and 7 layers of wrapping! Cardboard box, then plastic wrapper around each of the two  cardboad boxes,  with 6 smaller cardboard packages, each wrapped in plastic, and then each individual candy in two wrappings. You will feel very guilty consuming this candy if you really care about the environment.  Does it really need 7 layers of wrapping?<br /><br />If they can formulate ginger candy with a trace of honey in one or at the most two wrappings, it will be great buy. But as it is now, I don't think I am going to buy again.

review/text: My first experiences with ginger were not that pleasant. I did not care for the spicy flavor, however, after having ginger in milder doses over a couple of years I acquired a taste for it. Now, I really like ginger a lot, and I really like these ginger chews! They do have a spicy flavor, and they are a bit like eating candy with the sweet flavor that they have! Ginger is fabulous for helping to settle motion sickness from flying, or sailing on a cruise ship! Ginger works better than Dramamine for motion sickness.<br /><br />If you can find a bag of these at a Whole Foods store, possibly at Trader Joe's, I would encourage you to try them, but give them some time as the ginger flavor may grow on you!

The taste is a matter of opinion as I myself and some of my friends very much enjoy them, and others think they taste disgusting.  They taste a bit spicy - and sweet.  Sweetened ginger.  I would def. recommend, especially to anyone with indigestion, motion sickness or other such issues.

review/text: I received a bottle of porcini olive oil a few years ago as a gift from a friend. It was absolutely heavenly - a small amount made a huge difference in flavor complexity in my dishes. I've been looking for another bottle for months and finally purchased this product hoping it was similar - it isn't. The flavor is very subtle; not "potent" as the listing describes or the bottle I had was (I wish I could remember the brand!). I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it.

My dog was given a  Dingo and liked it but I didn't realize until now, that they're not made in the US, and I'm more concerned about the quality and health of products. China's quality control is sub par and has caused too many problems in recent years. I'd rather not risk my dogs life, or health.

review/summary: Ahhh, a few moments of peace!
review/text: I purchased these because I hoped they would provide a fun and tasty distraction for my active 1-year old mini Aussie while I got some work done. I am very pleased! She loves the challenge of trying to get the "yum yums" out of the twisted rawhide and it took so long she had it put it down for a while to rest before going at it again! I'd say it took about 1-2 hours in total for the chew to disappear (although it's hard to say exactly because she returned to it again and again).  I recommend this product if you're looking for a long lasting chew without the smell of bully sticks, although the red yummy inside might be a problem for some people with light-colored carpets.  The yummies do flake a little bit, but I found them very easy to sweep away and they didn't leave a stain.

review/summary: The only raw hide I buy!
review/text: My dog is a chihuahua mix with a small mouth and huge appetite. The small rawhides would only last her 30 seconds and the larger ones were too big for her mouth. Then I tried these chip twists- just the right size! My very un-picky dog now turns her nose up at any other kind of rawhide or chew. (Treats are a different story. ) I get both sizes, the regular and mini. Regular lasts her 10 minutes or so, and the minis are good fort a smaller treat if she starts chewing her paws but has already eaten enough treats for the day.  The "meat" in the middle does leave a bit of a mess on her bed, but as far as I can tell doesnt stain and sweeps or vacuums up easy.

review/summary: SKIP THIS ONE FOR OTHER SPROUT CHOICES
review/text: My 7 month old LOVES real food and the new organic foods on the market have been a god's send.  I bought a box of the Sweet Ginger Chicken w/ Bananas & Coconut based on the reviews and the overall appeal of the name.  We are now feeding them to our dog, which is appropriate because it looks, smells and tastes like dog's dinner.  Looks: Dark and mealy- so dark that it seems like it must be organ meats (which I have no problem with if it didnt taste awful).  Smells: the smell is so strong the second you open the pouch and VERY much like a can of cat or dog food. Tastes: I taste all of the baby food I give my daughter.  It was pungent and metallic, where the banana and coconut were, lord only knows.  If you must try it, I get it I would too, just buy a packet or two and see how it goes.  Do not buy a case.  On a side note, my dog loves it! So no a total loss.<br /><br />In general the sprout meals are delicious and the texture on the level 3's are chunkier than Plum or Happy Tot.  You can see bit of veg and grains.  Holiday Veg w/ Turkey is a big hit as is the Pumpkin Peach Graham (I serve together but not mixed).  Roasted Banana Mango is really yummy and she LOVES the Yukon Golds with Squash and Parmesan.<br /><br />Beyond Sprout, we prefer:<br /><br />Fruits and Veg: Ellas for a richer consistency and better flavor than Plum or Happy Tot.  Parsnip, Carrot, Apple is a surprise hit. Plum fruits are watery and water is even listed as first ingredient on some. However, the Plum Mish Mash line is much better and my daughter eats all of it.<br /><br />Breakfast: Happy Squeeze (tot) Organic Super Smoothies are awesome, in fact, I'm going to start having them for breakfast myself.  ALL of them taste excellent! Have 100% adult dv of vitamin C, 1/2 vitamin A. 6 grams or so of protein and under 100 cals.  They are thick, and creamy.<br /><br />Dinner: Plum Training Meals seem to be her favs along with the Sprout brand (other than the curry chicken) We have yet to try the salmon but have a case of it ready to go.  She likes the potato and turkey with rosemary (tastes like an herby mash potato) and the chicken pasta (not something an adult would like but I think she likes the texture of the visible chunks of pasta).  My girl has never been able tohave abottle more than 100ml but can eat a whole 4oz training meal.  GO figure!<br /><br />We have landed on plain cherrios vs the canisters which she lost interest in.  Straeberry mum mums NOT caramel or plain and teething bisuits above those.<br /><br />I cant beleieve how much baby food has evolved in a year.  I heat up breakfast and dinner and serve lunch icy cold.  She seems to like the changes.  I got the plum spoon that screws on for when we ar on the go but as a rule, the playtex spoons with silicone are THE BEST!!!! and I have a drawer full. I hope this helps, we really have tried all the snacks and foods we could get our hands on in store and online.

review/text: This recipe is terrible. I tried giving it to my daughter and she winced at the smell. She tried it and spit it out immediately. I tried it and could not swallow it either. It doesn't taste at all like it should based on the ingredients and description. It smells like dog food. I laughed when I read the other review that said they were feeding it to their dog. I doubt my dog would even have it. The other flavors they make might be tasty - but this is awful. I like the Plum brand of organic baby food SO much better. Great flavor combinations and really pleasing to the palate. I have a few more meals to try and I am hoping that they are better than this one. Very disappointing.

Have served it to company with openness and no apologies for it being instant. I like to make food from scratch, but not every course every time, so this is a welcome addition to my pantry.

I have tried the Morning glory in the larger size, and the fruit and nut.  The morning glory was my favorite, and I would probably buy it again, but I would not buy this peanut butter flavor again.  I'm hoping my hungry teenagers will enjoy them because there are 48 cookies total.  I was disappointed in this cookie and would not recommend it.

review/text: This is the third flavor I have tried in the mini cookies.  It is not as good as the oatmeal raisin.  I really like this size instead of the<br />larger size, just right for a snack or have 2 for breakfast.  The mini size has only 100 calories where the large size is over 300.

review/summary: A Cookie That's Like a Cracker. Delicious!
review/text: Here's an interesting product. I don't know whether to call them crackers or cookies. I found them at my nearby Fresh and Easy Store. They have the square shape, thinness and crispness of a cracker. But they have an interesting chocolate-vanilla taste, and that's more like a cookie. On the box, they are referred to as cookies, and I'll go along with it, but I'm using them more like crackers and I plan to continue.<br /><br />They're quite good. They're mildly, although distinctly flavored, and are only slightly sweet. They have low fat and low salt content. The calorie count is modest. They're quite crispy and crunchy and go well with a whole variety of things, especially if you enjoy being a bit unconventional. As a cookie, I prefer them over most of the more conventional kinds. It's a kinda strange product, but they're quite delicious and I like them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Sweeter than hot
review/text: The flavor is pretty good. Like others said, not the overpowering vinegar base but a more mellow taste. As a condiment its ok, but as a hot sauce it just fails. Not much heat at all. I've tried tons of hot sauces and have one for every meal and every mood so I can justly say that this just isn't really a hot sauce. Sadly its a lot sweeter than hot, but on the plus side it does have a nice flavor.

review/text: ********** 10 Stars!!!<br /><br />This is the best vinaigrette we've ever used. It is the perfect blend of tangy, spicy, and tomato-y. It isn't a sweet vinaigrette, more like a dressed-up Italian. Try our favorite; split open a sandwich roll, put Kraft Sun Dried Tomato Salad Dressing on both sides; stack avocado slices, thin sliced red onions, havarti cheese, deli-sliced baked chicken (or turkey), & thin cucumber slices or shredded lettuce. DELICIOUS!!! Also excellent as a dressing on pasta salad, marinade for baked chicken, and a dip for breadsticks or pizza crust. Oh, yes, and it is almost the only dressing we use on green salad anymore.

But I liked it so much that I ordered 6 bottles in order to keep using the product and insure that I have it available for the high salad season that is fast approaching.

review/summary: Humans Love 'Em BUT Dogs Don't At All
review/text: The reusable plastic container is wonderful and it keeps the product fresher than other alternatives.  The size is perfect for small dogs (10# yorkies) and the biscuits smell tasty.  But while my 2 old pups look up at me saying when are you going to get some good chicken biscuits in I am at a loss to answer.  Yorkies are like some folks we know:  picky.  (Sorry Miss Picky) I cannot emphasize how many packages of treats we have purchased for these critters and how many we gave to friends and neighbors.  I picked up a package from Walmart a few months ago and the price per pound was significantly more than these biscuits.  The pups loved them.  They ate the outer chicken and later attacked the biscuit.  Expecting similar results yielded another give-a-way package of treats.  I felt a rating of 4 was for the way we felt about the product and if the dogs liked them it would have been a 5.  If the dogs were writing this it would have been 1 from the dogs and that's it.  Maybe one day we'll find that perfect treat such as pig snouts but those things are about $1 each.  Two dollars a day adds up when a household budget is concerned.

review/summary: Filling Oats with a Great Taste!
review/text: The Better Oats Dark Chocolate Oatmeal is a great oatmeal I feel good about eating.  It's not made with partially hydrogenated *anything* and doesn't look "chemically" when you pour it out of the pouch.  The oatmeal has flax seeds in it, and the chocolate taste is rich without being too overdone.  Initially I worried that the chocolate would have a greasy or strange aftertaste, but it has none of these things.  It really has a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />There are 5 long pouches per box.  On the back of each pouch is a measuring line for liquids, so once you pour your oats into a bowl you know exactly how much water to add to the mix.  Sometimes I also add a bit of 2% milk, which adds a nice creaminess to the oatmeal.<br /><br />Here are highlights from the box that may be helpful:<br />- Made with 100% whole grain oats and flax seeds<br />- 160 calories, 0g trans fat, 0mg cholesterol, 220mg sodium/serving<br />- 28 grams of whole grains/serving<br />- 170mg ALA OMEGA-3/serving<br /><br />I bought these on sale at my local grocery store for $1/box.  I'm hoping to see them on sale again!  It was a great impulse buy  :o)

review/summary: Wonderful Chocolate Oatmeal
review/text: I was delighted with this oatmeal despite my initial doubt.  I don't usually eat chocolate for breakfast and I have not been fond of other oatmeals containing chocolate, but I tried this one because I love Better Oats and they were on sale.<br /><br />Like other Better Oats products, this one is easy to make with the bowl I keep at work.  I measure the water in the pouch the oatmeal comes in and microwave it for 2 minutes.  The oatmeal flakes are big and flat, and there are flax seeds in it for an extra boost of nutrition.  It only has 12 grams of sugar yet is full of sweet, chocolatey goodness that is suitable for breakfast or a filling dark chocolate fix.

review/text: A coworker introduced me to Better Oats by giving me a packet of their Bare oatmeal. I liked it (even plain!) and tried to find this brand in my local grocery store. Didn't find it there, but found the Lavish Chocolate here on amazon. It was the least expensive of the flavors so I thought I'd give it a try.<br />I love the way each oatmeal packet becomes a measuring cup for your water. Very easy to prepare. Take note: you must use a microwave. You cannot prepare by just adding boiling water.<br />The chocolate flavor was very pleasant. Not overly sweet and not too bitter of a dark chocolate for my children to enjoy it. The oats looked and tasted better than other instant oatmeal brands. Plus the added bonus of flax seeds. I will be keeping a box of these in my drawer at work for easy breakfasts or healthy snacks.<br /><br />I finally did find these in another store locally and the price is much better than here. I hope Amazon will find a way to sell a case of 9 of these for $10. That would be a perfect subscribe and save item!

review/summary: Blech
review/text: I should start off by saying that I am not a huge oatmeal fan in general. That being said, I'd bought a box of another kind of oatmeal from the Better Oats company and really enjoyed it. Hoping I'd finally found a way that I could like oatmeal and being impressed with the Omega 3 content, I decided to see what other products were available from Better Oats. I came here to Amazon and was excited to see this chocolate oatmeal (I love chocolate). I was impressed with all of the good reviews and so I decided that if I could find it for cheaper at my local grocery store then I would try it out. I found it for $1.30 for one of the five-pack boxes which was much cheaper than here on Amazon. I bought some and then went home to try it out. I did not like it at all. To me it tasted a little like non-fat instant chocolate pudding with soggy Wheaties mixed it. It was that consistency too. In fact, I'm not convinced that I'd be able to pass a taste test between the two. I was really hungry which usually makes me much more willing to accept tastes that I might not otherwise like, but even after not having anything to eat all day I still just picked at this and eventually dumped the bowl out and went hungry. I should also say that I followed the microwave directions and not the stove-top ones, so you might have better luck that way. I gave it three stars because as I said before, I'm not a big oatmeal fan and so that could have effected my judgement. It looks like other people liked it really well so if you're an oatmeal lover then this might be worth a try, but if, like me, you have so-so feelings about oatmeal in general, then I don't think this will change your mind. I will say that the original oatmeal I tried by Better Oats was the Oat Revolution! Apples & Cinnamon flavor  and it was delicious.

Come on!!<br /><br />I bought it when it was $3.33 per box, now I see that it has gone up over $2.00 per box.  What's even more sad?  I bought 2 more boxes at Target tonight for $1.79 per box.<br /><br />I thought this was the only place I was going to find this oatmeal, that's why I stocked up.  I had bought it before but it is in limited supply in all the stores I've checked-and some stores don't even carry it at all.<br /><br />My advice:  If you want to be royally ripped-off, by all means, buy it on here.  If not, go to Target and get it.
