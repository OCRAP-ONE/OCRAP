review/summary: Looks good, tastes bad
review/text: I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea.

review/summary: Not particularly strong
review/text: I have a wrapper from a single teabag of Nummi Tarry Lapsang Souchong, and the wrapper alone smells stronger after being opened for two months than a whole 3.5 oz bag of this smells fresh. This tea only has a light smoky scent and flavor, whereas the Nummi tea had a strong pine smoke scent and taste. I know that tarry lapsang souchong should be stronger, but I'm still a little disappointed at how weak this one is. Maybe I'll just use more tea for stronger batches.

review/summary: Great green tea for not too much.
review/text: Stash's gunpowder green has been a staple tea in our house for almost a year now. We prefer it iced, but it is decent hot. It is much more affordable than most other green teas and the quality is right up there with other good gunpwder greens we have had. Like most green teas, steep at 180 degrees for 3 minutes to get the best results. We go through a 3 pack of this stuff every single month.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E268">Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: Great Green Tea
review/text: I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.

review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.

review/text: After having some incredible green tea with ginger at a restaurant, I began my search for something similar. I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas.

review/summary: High quality, organic!, a little flat
review/text: I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time. Both are graded TGFOP and both are superb: filled with body, complex flavor, malty. But over the years I have become concerned about pesticides used in foods. I have chosen to use as many organic food products as I reasonably can. I recently tried this Stash Premium Organic Assam Tea.<br /><br />This is a very good tea. The pouch is filled with quality loose leaf product. My uneducated guess would be an approximate grade of FOP or perhaps TGFOP.<br /><br />The taste is basic, unadorned Assam. Malty and full of body. It is not as complex as teas from the finest plantations. By complex, think of colors. This tea flavor has maybe one or two colors, where a complex tea from a fine plantation might have 3, 4, or more flavors you can distinctly identify.<br /><br />Still, at a fair price and with an organic grade, this will be a regular choice at my house in the future.<br /><br />I would prefer to see an organic tea packaged in a non-plastic pouch though.

review/summary: Sweet Jasmine
review/text: I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.  I like a fairly strong tea and usually grate fresh frozen ginger into my tea cup for extra flavor.  I steep a generous teaspoon of the loose leaves in 8 oz. of hot water (not quite boiling).  To my delight, the Jasmine green tea is always good with or without ginger.  I can use the leaves at least twice with good results.  The mild aroma of the tea is like jasmine blossoms and the taste has a sublte sweetness.  I drink at least 24 oz. of the tea each day.  So the fact that the tea is organic is a plus. The price is competitive.  I will buy this tea again

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice beautiful loose leaf jasmine tea. Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

review/text: Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx

I kept one for myself and I think it is going to last me awhile. Since I don't know all that much about teas, I can't comment much on the quality but as far as I know it is good!

That's why they call it DOUBLE BERAMONT EARL GREY.<br /><br />The Upton Tea loose Extra Bergamot is a good alternative also.  But for the price this is a good one.  Loose, or in bags it's a nice tea.

review/summary: Excellent English Breakfast Tea
review/text: I have been searching for the 'right' balanced English Breakfast Tea for a few years now. Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning. Personally, loose leaf seems to taste a lot better to me, and I've not tried the tea-bag variety on this one.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy this tea as much as I have.

review/summary: I always come back to this tea
review/text: I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it.

What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.

It's nice and fragrant with notes of honey. Here is how we make it: bring water to boil, pour some hot water in medium size tea pot to warm it up, pour it away, place tea into the pot (1 tea spoon per cup of water), wash it with hot water, pour water away (hold on to the tea), finally cover washed tea with hot water and let it sit for 5-7 minutes; to test its readiness, pour some tea into clear cup - it should be medium amber color. Serve hot.

I've been a vegetarian for 30 years and have had plenty of them in my time. I, too, was a little dubious when I found that these came from China, but they're fine.

review/text: I've bought several shipments over the past year and so far I've only received 1 dud (the creamer had coagulated and was gross.) Otherwise, the only problem I've had is the ocassional cup of creamer that takes too long to open (overly sealed or something.) From a taste perspective, it blows other Irish Cremes out of the water. Also, no refridgeration is required so it lasts for a long time. I stock up on these when I'm headed for a cruise, to a hotel for business or somewhere else where I know I can't refridgerate and they aren't likely to carry my Irish Creme.

review/summary: Love the Flavor and the Messages
review/text: My daughter gave me my first box of Scripture Tea for my birthday. I enjoyed the tea so much I tried other flavors. These individually wrapped bags are perfect to tuck inside a 'get well' or 'thinking of you' card just to add a little something special to your message. Looking forward to trying more flavors.

review/text: This is a great tea.  It's very warming and quite potent, in fact I use the bag twice.  The first time I steep for a very short time and the second for a longer time.  I am amazed at how sweet and spicy this tea is with no sugar added.  I was so glad to find it when I remembered the taste from my college days in Olympia, Washington.

review/text: A friend shared her MarketSpice tea with me years ago, and I was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me.  I ordered some, and that wonderful taste was still the same.  The teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in. It's a flavor you won't find anywhere else.  You can taste the orange and the cinnamon, and they're just a little sweet - you may not need to even sweeten yours!

review/summary: Great  tea - except for the headaches!
review/text: I love this tea although I haven't had it for a while now.  After a few days of having the decaf tea with breakfast, I was getting a headache that couldn't be knocked out with Tylenol (my go-to-headache reliever).  I stopped drinking the tea and haven't had a headache since. According to the website, chemicals aren't used in the decaf process,so, I doubt it is the decaf.  The orange flavoring is natural,so maybe it's the artificial cinnamon flavoring??? I don't know, but I will experiment with it again when I don't mind having a headache!  It sure is good tasting tea, tho, and the shipment was on time & well-packaged.  I'd buy it again, if it didn't give me headaches!! Maybe I should try the tea with caffiene ???!!

review/text: I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.

It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.

review/summary: What it is....
review/text: As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.

A thorough checkout with the vet revealed no other causes other than food intolerance.  We went through many different brands.  He would always eventually become intolerant.  Then, a few years ago, we found Nature's Variety Prairie.  Problem solved.  Our Aussie loves it too.<br /><br />Now, by subscribing, we save quite a bit per bag when compared to buying it from pet supply shops.

I switch up the flavors which keeps them interested, and I have noticed a richer shine to their coats and the nutrition holds them much longer especially with their active lifestyles.  I never worry about them looking in empty bowls between meals; however they are eager for breakfast or dinner time! The quality is top notch and after doing much research, I feel safe that what is actually in the food matches the claims on the labels. The pups have better digestive function and the one with a sensitive stomach has yet to have any problems. I have been using this product for almost 2 years and each bag is fresh and satisfies two picky bellies!

My belief is that it is due to the crappy junk they feed their animals.  My dogs are both 9 years old and have no significant health issues.  They have bright eyes, shiny coats, and firm stools.<br /><br />I rotate flavors every couple of months and no matter the flavor, they happily eat up all of their food.  (Then again, they occasionally eat wild animal poop so I guess they aren't too discerning).<br /><br />My personal experience with this food has always been very positive and I've got two healthy dogs to prove it.

review/text: We tried this on a whim this past summer just to see what it was like and we loved it!!<br /><br />I'm so glad we can order it online, because neither of us like driving up to Pike Place anymore.<br /><br />This tea is very similar to say an Irish or English Breakfast  but with enough of a hearty yet mellow difference that is amazing.  It has a hint of the original Market Spice flavor in it (the tell tale cloves and orange)  but not enough to take the flavor as a whole out of the "Breakfast" realm nor make it so you can't add milk if you like.  It's not just for breakfast of course and it's very popular with my heavy tea drinking family.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for folks who like both Market Spice and traditional Breakfast teas or for folks who like Market Spice but don't particularly want to get punched in the face by it all the time!  lol
