review/summary: CHEAPER AT COSTCO
review/text: Just bought a 2.2 box (has two sealed 1 lb bags in the box) at Costco yesterday for only $8.99.  They are good , not great and not nearly as good a Godiva. Dont taste very "chocolate-ty!"  Looked at the ingredients list  -and no wonder - Vegetable (Palm) Oil is theifrst ingredient (??) followed by sugar, low fat cocoa, whey powder, cocoa powder.<br /><br />UPDATE - Served these Xmas Eve and they went over well.  Still would not buy them again due to the ingredients.

review/summary: So Very Rich, I Can Eat Just ONE!!
review/text: I love truffles, but they're too expensive. This was a tremendous deal... so many truffles for so little cash! I have trouble "eating just one" tasty chocolate. BUT! These truffles are so rich and creamy, I can limit my intake to just one! (I got fooled though...these truffles are from Canada, not France!)  I love these truffles... a great gift. Keep one bag for yourself and gift the other bag!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: love these truffles!
review/text: They are very smooth, i love just letting them melt in my mouth.  And they have a very rich cocoa taste.  not like swiss miss, like a batch of fresh made dutch cocoa.  The only downside to the one i bought is i think they were kind of old.  normally they are dusted in cocoa powder and are literally powdery on the outside.  But this case i bought they were actually a bit moist and there was no powder, it was absorbed.  So probably they were sitting on a shelf for a while.  But they still taste awesome.

review/summary: Out of this world
review/text: Tried the Lyndt dark chocolate truffles as they were most readily available at the grocery.  I even purchased a box (60 ct) of the Lyndt from Amazon.  In looking to reorder, I noted the ingredients in Lyndt vs. Chocmod . . .  Chocmod won hands down for being 'natural' and free of artificial flavorings.  So being the Type A personality persona that I am, I ordered 2 boxes.  If I was wrong, then I would be sorry.  I am not.  There is No bitter taste.  At the initial outset of these melt in your mouth glories, there is an 'intense' chocolate flavor which is immediately followed by a creamy dreamy chocolate experience.  I'm going for the 4 pack next time.  .  .  I was satisfied with one whereas with Lyndt I wasn't.  Can't believe what a great price these are.  1000 grams is over 2# . . .  much better bang for your buck and better for you than any other option.

review/summary: Palm oil and cocoa powder
review/text: What a disappointment. I bought these (at Costco) after reading some internet article that gave them a great review. However, when I tasted them they seemed bland and overly greasy. I read the ingredient list and there was the explanation. They're made of palm oil and chocolate powder. I should have checked the ingredients before buying this, ingredients say a lot about quality. This is not a good quality product and tastes nothing like a well-made truffle.<br />It is, at best, passable. Odd texture and a faint chocolate flavor. Will not buy again.

review/text: I have celiac.  I bought my first box of these at a local HFS.  The plain are too boring, but with the tamari, they are quite tasty.  I save a bunch of money by buying them by the case from Amazon.  You have to eat a lot of them to get calories, so I could go through a box quickly.  I also use rice cakes, and these little crackers are far superior to them.  I make a seed butter out of toasted, ground pumpkin seeds with a little olive oil, and it is quite tasty with these crackers.

review/text: They used to be my favorite cracker but always so expensive could barely afford and also because they used to be so tasty I'd eat the whole package in one sitting. But today I splurged on a package and unfortunately they changed the recipe and they tasted bad. Sure enough I called Edward and Sons and they said due to Japan nuclear meltdown they changed the manufacturing to Thailand. But why didn't they make sure Thailand could make it just as Japan did before putting in markets? Morons. Hopefully they get their quality back. Today they taste like crap. Dry, and rancid sour taste.

review/summary: The Cholula Original Hot sauce is excellent. Their Chipotle version is watered down and near tasteless
review/text: I love Cholula's original hot sauce. One of the finest, general purpose hot sauces, available. The original is loved by many including Scott Roberts. Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.<br /><br />After trying the original - I could not agree more. What an excellent hot sauce.<br /><br />Then - I tried the other Cholula varieties. This company also offers a lime, garlic and chipotle versions. All of these were a major disappointment.<br /><br />Their Chipotle based hot sauce lacks almost any flavor beyond a heavy dose of vinegar along with a bit of gentle heat. At best - there is just a hint of this smoked (Chipotle) pepper.<br /><br />Far better (for a Chipotle based hot sauce) are either the Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce or the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. Both of these are excellent and have a rich Chipotle favor and far surpass the Cholula Chipotle.<br /><br />Make no mistake - the original Cholula is excellent but the variants of their original hot sauce fall far short of the original.<br /><br />Everyone needs a hobby and I've been blind taste testing about 40 different hot sauces for over 6 months. I stumbled on Scott Roberts review long after I had determined that the Cholula Original was an excellent hot sauce from my point of view. But the garlic, lime and chipotle versions are surprisingly inferior.<br /><br />PS: Watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price for a product but charge very high shipping rates ON a PER Bottle basis. So even if you order multiple bottles at the same time you will still pay very high shipping charges based on the single bottle shipping rate.

review/text: As another reviewer said, these are pulverized in our house.  Once the can is opened, somehow that aroma waifs through the air on the back of a gnat and they're by my side in 1/2 a millisecond! My only suggestion is that if you have a cat that doesn't like pates, be careful on these grilled varieties.  They're supposed to all be shredded but they do have a couple that are actually pates and well, up went the nose on those!  I pay about six dollars less for this loaf pack at my local grocery, so keep that in mind with the pricetag.  I think it's high.  Other than that, highly recommend!

review/summary: my cat loves it, though has more gluten and filler than regular grilled line
review/text: for canned food fancy feast is the only thing my cat eats.  shed rather starve than eat anything organic.  my cat devours this stuff within minutes. she particularly loves the beef. after checking the ingredient list though im wee bit alarmed. for the regular grilled line poultry or beef is listed as the first ingredient, followed by broth liver or fish, then meat by product. these gravy ones has broth as the first ingredient, followed by poultry or beef, and has a higher percentage of gluten. hence the gravy i guess. it sure taste good to my cat but it's like more like junk food than a healthy meal. the kitty won't get these on a regular basis anymore, regular grilled variety is better for her health. suscribe and save is such an awesome deal. it comes out to 46 cents a can. my local walmart used to have fancy feast for 47 cents+tax, no more! now its 54 cents!!!

review/summary: My Mocha likes it and smells good to me
review/text: I, like many cat owners, love my cat very much.  I enjoy watching my cat eat as it is a sign of good health.  I also enjoy more when she eats and finds her food delectable.  She gives you that 'look' and you know when the food she ate has tasted good.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the 3rd fancy feast i bought for her.  i bought the pate version (or classic).  Classic ones have a very pet-food stench to it.  On the other hand, this smells a bit more like human food and isnt stinky.  The food is shaped like canned tuna filets but a bit stiffer in texture.  My only complaint:  there is WAY more gravy on the can compared to the pate version.  I'd say 1/8 of the can is gravy.  as for the meaty filets, i'd say 1/2-less 3/4 can is actual food itself.  quite disappointing.  i feel ripped off b/c  i do not get my money's worth in terms of quantity so one star off.  quality is good; comparing it to pate, it seems Mocha enjoys this and pate equally.  I only notice she seems to enjoy chicken flavor more b/c she eats it all in one setting.<br /><br />I know Fancy feast (FF) isnt the 'ideal' wet food out there.  I dont have the means to afford evo, wellness etc.  I feed this in conjunction with dry kibble, and one FF can lasts about 2-3 days.  I mix in homemade meat or greeny vegetables at times with FF.  In short, i guess i am saying that i am glad Fancy feast sells this 'crack' food (as known in many cat lover circles...lol) that cats run for.  Thanks to swagbucks, I am able to get this for FREE from Amazon and even take advantage of del. subscription to give my cat some pleasure in life.

review/summary: 2.7 ounces in a 3 ounce can
review/text: I was surprised to find out that Fancy Feast is shorting their 3 ounce can to 2.7 ounces (occasionally 2.8 oz) I was curious when the bulk and weight of other foods felt heaver.  I took a bowl, put it on our digital ounce scale tared it out so that is showd 0.00 ounces. Then I opened and emptied a can of Fancy Feast into the bowl being careful to get every last crumb of food out of the can and all of the liquid from the sides and top. Came out to 2.7 occasionally 2.8 ounces constantly.<br /><br />We purchase our groceries once a month so I have too much on hand considering that it is time for a switch to smething else. No more Fancy Feast unless they can convince me that their cans will contain at least 3.0 ounces from now on. I know it is difficult to change a cat to something else however, a cat will not starve itself.  My cat will be eating something else next month!!

review/text: 2 years ago, my vet said that I should start my diabetic cat on what he called "The Catkins" high protein diet. He offered a lot of high priced foods designed specifically for diabetic cats, then said "but if money is an issue, Fancy Feast has the correct ratio of protein to other nutrients for much cheaper" my cat has been eating it since, with very very good results. When eating this instead of his previous diet of normal dry adult cat food, he needs a lower dose of insulin to maintain his blood sugar. The icing on the cake is that when I order it from Amazon, it's cheaper than the stores in town. With subscribe and save I don't even have to think about it, it just shows up on my front porch every month!

Since we've been on auto-order from Amazon.com, we've never run short of cat food, or had to make an emergency run to the market just to keep the cat happy.  I very much appreciate being able to buy the 24 can packs of cat food through Amazon.com, mostly for the convenience, but also for the slight price break compared to the local market.  These days, every $ counts, I don't have so much bulk to carry home from the store, and I never run short on his supply. You see, Tim stays up late at night, and when he thinks we're not watching, he gets into the pantry and counts how many cans of food are remaining.  He feels most secure when there is a large stockpile on hand, and his behavior the next day proves it.

review/summary: They like everything except the beef...
review/text: First I'll start with packaging - it's minimal and all paper which can be recycled. Kudos.<br /><br />There are three layers in the box - one for each variety of food. I've been removing the paper from the layers and mixing them up because sometimes they just don't want the same food for days in a row. I prefer this minimal packaging because the box and the cans are 100% recyclable without any additional waste and no plastic.<br /><br />As for the food quality - it looks great and smells good too! I haven't tried it myself, but for the Turkey and the Chicken, the cats love it and devour the entire portion in one sitting. I wish I could say the same for the beef.<br /><br />It's probably just personal preference for our three cats but NONE of them like the beef as much as the other two varieties (or the three fish varieties in the other pack that we purchase).<br /><br />Aside from the beef issue - we've compared this product to several IAMS varieties and this one wins hands down for the cats. The IAMS paste products don't seem to be as interesting to the cats, and it's hard for me to tell if there is real product there. The Fancy Feast actually looks like shredded/chopped turkey/beef/chicken.<br /><br />The produce is soft and always moist, making it very easy to eat. We will sometimes put just a little bit of water in the dish with the food so the cats get some extra moisture (especially important for our older cats).<br /><br />I'm giving these products 5 stars. The packaging and cans are fully recyclable; the product looks like real food; every can appears and smells fresh; we have yet to find any quality problem with any can. This is on my subscribe and save list.

review/summary: For finicky cats
review/text: One of our cats prefers Fancy Feast Grilled flavors which are finely minced with gravy. While our vet doesn't recommend gravy because of carbohydrates from cornstarch, we compromise on this one. I like the Variety Packs because we can vary the protein source with each meal, which I understand is healthier for cats. We are delighted with Amazon's Subscribe and Save automatic delivery, which is reliable, saves money, and prevents running out of food.

review/summary: Oops
review/text: I have a cat with a very sensitive stomach and I thought I had ordered the cat food that made her stomach purr.. For some reason this cat food gives my adorable cat the runs.  I should have ordered the Classic Fancy Feast.  So I have to give away three cases of cat food since my cat makes it very unpleasant for all of us when she "runs".  I was going to order the Classic but it was through another vendor and I would have had to pay shipping.  Grilled Fancy Feast was ordered but I actually did not come out ahead with having the cat food delivered to my door with no shipping costs.  I will donate it to a shelter and go back to finding the Classic Fancy Feast at the grocery store.  I am working with the vet to find a diet that agrees with her and one she will eat. Classic was finally one that I found that worked.  I would like to say that Amazon rocks. It is so convenient to order things on line and have them there when you need them...of course that is only if I am not paying shipping...

review/text: This stuff is a little pricey but with the subscribe and save option I feel pretty good that I can feed my cats something they enjoy.<br />My vet told me to lean towards canned food and I have tried many. The only other thing they will eat out of a can is the tuna I used to eat for lunch. I have actually had to invest in a heavy duty kitchen garbage can with a lid that tightly closes because they will knock the can over to get at the empty cans of this food I have thrown away. They do not do this with other brands.<br />The one downside to subscribing to this is that you are given a discount off the price but prices do fluctuate so you have watch for this before your next automatic shipment.

review/text: I love cat food. Cats should eat a lot of it. The more, the better.  That way, they won't run around outdoors, threatening the local wildlife. Just the other day, I saw two cats sneaking around the woods outside "my" place of work. One of them even looked at me in an obviously threatening manner. A clear and present danger to the cute little Tree Sparrows and Wagtails, if you ask me! (And to people, too.)<br /><br />Cats aren't truly domesticated. Deep inside, they are still tigers. No, keep them indoors, make 'em fat, lazy and contended. Like Garfield! This cat food is perfect, since it tastes like chicken and turkey. That way, the real birds can feel safe and be sound.<br /><br />Buy Fancy Feat Gourmet Cat Food! Save a Tree Sparrow today!

review/summary: Not as much cat food for your $
review/text: I bought this pack because the fishy pate fancy feast smells terrible. However! I noticed that most Fancy Feast cans instruct something along the lines of "feed one can per 3 lbs of body weight daily." I feed my cat both wet and dry food, so I usually just feed her 1 can per day. However, the cans in this pack say "feed one can per 2 1/2 lbs of body weight daily." This means that these cans are less filling. I think its a nice change, but I'd rather get the other types from now on. Also, in the grocery store, I found a flavor with a label instruction to feed one can per 3 1/2 lbs of body weight.

review/summary: Easy to Make, Great Taste
review/text: I was skeptical when the other reviewer said "just like the restaurant" (used to serve). The reality is that these are amazing biscuits that are really simple to make and quite close to the old restaurant quality. They can be a bit dry so if you're having problems consider adding some "extra" cheese or a tablespoon of butter or something to moisten them up a bit -- but at this price you can't beat the quality.

review/summary: These biscuits are dry and need additional "help"
review/text: Unlike other Marie Callendar products, these biscuits need additional ingredients during the prep phase.  If you follow the instructions, as is, the biscuits are dry and have a light cheese flavor.  Adding butter and cheese can improve the product.<br /><br />When compared to other low cost biscuit mixes such as Betty Crocker or Bisquick, Marie's mix need additional flavoring and butter/oil.  I enjoy Marie's other products and will continue to try the other products.  This mix is good to use when you are a rush, so long as you have time to to "help" the mix.

review/text: These taste like Bisquick with macaroni and cheese powder mixed in. That's probably more or less what they are. If these are restaurant-style, I shudder to imagine this restaurant in my mind. I bet it serves potato flakes and Jell-O instant cheesecake too. There are other cheddar biscuit mixes out there that at least come close to the flavor of the ones at Red Lobster. These come close to the flavor of cheddar sand. (I don't like them.)

review/summary: Cats.... loved it!
review/text: Today was the first time my cats have had this brand of food and they were too funny with it!  I split a can between the 2 of them to ward off any problems that could arise with a new food.  They were having Natural Balance turkey and giblets for dinner, so I put that on one side of their bowls and the Tiki Cat Hana Luau on the other side.  They both sniffed it and ate a little but then both dove into their turkey, which in all fairness, is one of their favorites.  They kept coming back to the Tiki food though and then would look at it and eat some more.  It didn't take either of them long to decide it was acceptable to them.  After all, they probably figured I try so hard to give them the best, they would go along with it.  Too funny!  They did both lick their bowls clean and thoroughly enjoyed their first dinner at  Tiki's.  I will be adding this food to their menu, but only the varieties that don't contain they synthetic vitamin K - menedione sodium bisulfate.

review/text: I was expecting the content would be more chunky and higher quality. But it is mostly thin slices and gooey dark red matters. my two cats do not take too much liking to it. So I mix it with the more chunky type of cat food for them. With the high price, I think the food should come with better quality than this.  I will not order this again even though the food smells and looks fresher than regular canned cat food.

review/summary: Cat "feed"back.
review/text: Being a human means that I cannot personally vouch for this product but my two cats have indicated their willingness to provide this review. According to them the Tiki Cat food in general is of the highest quality, tastes incredible and makes-you-look-forward-to-breakfast. My personal observation is that there is never even a scrap left on their plates and that I usually just have to grab the tins to have two very interested and demanding friends circling and excitedly talking to me. Since I started serving them this food they have turned into "alarm clocks" (fully adjustable to daylight savings time), each morning, seven a.m. sharp. I am supposed to be up and feeding them. If not (or want to sleep in) they pounce on the bed and pester me until I get up. Thanks Tiki Cat for turning my beauty sleep upside down. Well I suppose "as long as they are happy!".

review/summary: Need improvement
review/text: The idea of using hazelnut sounded fresh and promising to me, but the product turned out to be pretty bland. I'd rather eat plain hazelnuts - I'd feel similar taste, but more texture. I'd be happy to try an improved version - I'd like it sweeter (maybe xylitol would work better than erythritol?) and with the texture better mimicking cookies. For now, I recommend Lucienne's almond cookies (sugar-free) instead.

review/summary: A great way to reward the little ones.
review/text: Having a box of ring pops around is a great way to give the kids a reward for being extra helpful and well behaved for the day.  These ring pops are even better in that regard as the blinking light adds a special level of novelty to it all.<br /><br />The box contains four flavors, Blue Raspberry, Sour Apple, Strawberry, and Watermelon.  All of which are rather good and tends to cover the range of "likes", meaning they may not be flavor favorites, but you shouldn't dislike them all.<br /><br />Be warned about one thing though.  The clear cone protecting the LED is study, but we have had one break at the joint between disk the candy actually sits on and the battery housing.  Luckily this doesn't allow the button batteries to come out, but it does expose the LED which can be a hazard with smaller children.  On an up side though, if you are a do-it-yourselfer, this does become a ready supply of easily harvested, non-soldered LED's and the button batteries aren't to hard to get out either once you look at it.

review/summary: Pork is a nice change up from Chicken
review/text: We recently went to a strictly 100% grain free and raw diet for our dogs. As most know the process of feeding raw takes time and effort to be sure you get a balanced diet for you pet. You should never just throw a few chicken breasts in a bowl and think you are giving your best friend a good properly balanced meal, as you may be mistaken. However, if time is not something you have in order to feed raw, this product fits the build so far. Our babies love the taste and are eager for dinner-time everyday. (as most boxers are anyway) I've recommended Grandma's to several people and each had the same result with thier pets. It's a bit like "grewl" in the bowl but does not bother them at all. I have one very active boxer and one a bit more lazy so I did have to adjust the amounts a bit to be sure my active dog stays filled out, but no more weight issues with my lazy boy, and they are maintaining very well. They have alot less waste in the yard and I researched every ingredient and compared to several others out there and found this one to have just what I wanted in a complete raw diet. You can feel comfortable this is a great way to give your dog the proper nutrition without the labor it takes to serve a raw diet 100% of the time.

review/text: I am used to tasting Utah honey, which is outstanding in that desert blooms and high altitude blooms (7000' +) produce incredible distinctive honey. I had heard of Tupelo honey and wanted to try it so I purchased a 2 lb. bottle. Very different taste from desert or high altitude honey and it was truly outstanding. Everything I have heard about the excellence of Tupelo honey is true and the taste exceeded my expectations.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.
