review/text: I can't say the flavor is bad because it isn't. It isn't bad for just a little bit of flavor. What I can say is this:<br />I thought the packaging of the product was sketchy. Mine came with a seal but it was not one that actually sealed the product.<br />I don't think it tastes like cotton candy at all. I mean, not even a tiny bit.<br />It took me three times the amount in my GO TO frosting recipe to get much of a flavor at all.<br />The smell of the extract itself isn't really a pleasant smell. It smells like chemicals.<br />I guess what I am saying is I'm not impressed and I wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: looks great, tastes ok
review/text: This was received very promptly and in good condition. The cigars look really good. The wrapping makes them look like real cigars. The box is smaller than a typical cigar box, but we own a real cigar box to put them in. The chocolate is of fair quality, not excellent, not horrible. Reminds me of the hollow, chocolate bunnies one finds at Easter. We bought them more for looks than taste, so for us they are perfect!

review/summary: What it is....
review/text: As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.

review/summary: Great Snack!
review/text: I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.

review/summary: Tasty but Burnt and Salty
review/text: OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!

review/summary: Future of Food
review/text: Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example. A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.<br /><br />As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?

review/summary: GOOD STUFF!
review/text: I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.

review/summary: Nice flavor, and better for you too!
review/text: I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!

review/summary: Great Pretzels...and I love pretzels!
review/text: These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!

review/summary: Great source of fiber and protein--but TASTES great, too!
review/text: I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.

review/summary: Its burned
review/text: I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.

Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these.

They taste better than your average pretzel on the market and they are healthier for you. I recommend the spelt pretzels!

I was making chocolate-dipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag, so I had my kids count how many there were per Newman's Own 8-Ounce bag.  There are about 40 pretzels per bag.  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough, so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I did--buying twice as much as needed.  Now we get to eat them.  :0)

review/text: I ordered a case of these pretzels to give away as snacks--I ordered it on Dec 17 and when it came, it had the "Use By Dec 27, 2011" date stamped on each bag. I'm not happy that they sent me "old" product that is nearing the end of its shelf life.

review/summary: Mine Also BURNT flavor!
review/text: I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....

review/summary: Review for the Hi-Protein variety
review/text: Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.

review/summary: How can a pretzel taste this good?
review/text: A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon.

review/summary: Burnt taste and shelf life short or used up
review/text: I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.

review/text: Discovered these online and looked high and low for some that I would not have to buy a case.  Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them.  They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt!  Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more.  I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.

review/text: didn't know what the diff was between the "sticks" and the the "rods" because when I was little (yes, I really was little... a long, long time ago) I used to go to the "candy store" and buy two pretzels or pretzel sticks, not knowing that what I was really buying was a pretzel rod....live and learn...<br /><br />Anyway, once I realized that I had bought these "mini-rods" I could get on with the taste testing. Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus...

My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.

review/text: My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi-Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag.

review/text: The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online.

review/text: If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!

Not too many decafs fit that bill. While this could be even a bit stronger for me it has the most body and flavor balance I've found in decaf yet...in traditional or K-Cup varieties.

review/text: I only drink decaf coffee, and having tried at least 12 other brands, this is one of my three favorites!  It's got a bold flavor, without being bitter, and it doesn't get lost when I add flavored creamer. Some of my 'regular only' friends couldn't tell that it was decaf.

review/summary: Don't purchase this product
review/text: I purchased Tully's Decaffeniated House Blend 24-count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers.  They open up around the top seal when brewing and the coffee grounds get into the coffee and also make a mess inside the machine.  Unless you want to strain your coffee and clean your entire machine after each use do not purchase this product.

review/summary: Inferior K-cup product
review/text: Although the flavor of the coffee is good, the K-cup is not properly sealed.  The cover seal breaks when brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in the brewed coffee and coffee coffee grounds in the Keurig brewer.  This necessitates a thorough cleaning of the brewer each time a new K-cup is used.  I ordered and received two boxes of Tullys House Blend.  I have not opened the second box because of the inferior seal on the K-cup.

review/summary: K-Cup foil not sealed and hot coffee spurts out all over
review/text: We purchased two 24-count packages of Tully's House Decaf. Obviously something went wrong in manufacturing of these K-Cups.  After we began the brew cycle, very hot coffee came out over the top of the K-Cup and the compartment in many directions and only a portion of it went into our mug below.  Thinking it was only a problem with that one, we tried another.  When it happened again, we investigated more closely.  The foil seal over the top of the K-Cup is not complete.  Very hot water under pressure inside the K-Cup was forced up and out, along with coffee grounds, and sprayed quite a distance from the machine. Our Keurig is in the bedroom - what a mess!

review/summary: TULLYRIFIC!
review/text: I had to switch to decaf several years ago due to an ulcer. We recently purchased a Cuisinart kcup brewer. I had been having quite a time finding a great tasting decaf kcup. I ordered a sample pack from another site and it contained one of the Tully's. It was sooo good, I can't begin to tell you how excited I was!<br /><br />I hopped online in search of the best price for the quantity on these kcups! I found it here.<br /><br />This coffee reminds me of a warm, nutty toasty regular cup of joe that I used to get at a local restaurant!

review/summary: Don't Buy this!
review/text: We buy a lot of K-cups for our Keurig, typically going through about 4-6 a day. We often buy various ones to satisfy different tastes.<br /><br />This is the only brand that we have purchased that has given us problems. Not only have the k-cups exploded, leaving grounds all over the machine both inside and out, but every single k-cup in the two 24-count packages has done this. At first, we thought we just received a bad batch in one of the two packages that was a part of the order, but when the k-cups in both of the packages did this for k-cup after k-cup (there wasn't a single one that did not explode and leave coffee ground in the coffee mug, machine, or outside of the machine), we knew it wasn't a fluke.<br /><br />Since there is no return on food...buyer beware.

review/summary: Good tasting coffee, poor quality k-cups
review/text: I just want to chime in with the other reviewers who noted the poor quality of these k-cups. Half of the k-cups I purchased explode in my coffee machine because the foil over the top of the cup is not sealed properly. Not only is it disappointing and a waste of money, it's a real pain to clean your machine after an explosion of coffee grounds. This is unfortunate because I think Tully's has the best quality coffee, particularly decaf, you can find out there in k-cups right now. I heard Starbucks is going to get in the k-cup business at some point. Hopefully sooner than later.

review/summary: Nice tasting decaffeinated coffee
review/text: I need to drink more decaffeinated coffee. Thus, I tried this product out for my Keurig coffee maker. And I have thoroughly enjoyed the experiment! Some of the K-cup blends that I have tried are terrific, some are okay, and some don't have much taste. This product is closer to the good end of that continuum than to the bad end.<br /><br />It is labeled "extra bold." Perhaps not quite so. Still, it does have a rich taste and is a delightful way to begin the day.<br /><br />So, I am a satisfied customer and intend to keep drinking this particualr brand.

review/summary: One of the Best decaf K-Cups around!!
review/text: I love to have a cup of coffee at night but I'm always leery of how caffeine might affect me.  Tully's Decaf House Blend is perfect!!  During the day I drink Newman's Own Organic Special Blend and in the evening I have a cup of Tully's.  While they don't taste exactly alike (Tully's is a little weaker, I'd say) it's still a great alternative.  It's so hard to find a good decaf and I'm thrilled that I finally found one!!  It's fairly strong and bold but not skunky or overpowering in it's flavor.  I highly recommend it!!

We won't be ordering any more of these until we see from the reviews that this is no longer a problem.

review/text: I ordered these k cups by mistake, I meant to order the Tully's decaf French Roast, which I love.  This coffee is even better!  I usually don't care for house roasts, I was even really disappointed when I opened the Amazon box and realized my mistake.  I decided to try it instead of sending it back and I'm glad I did!  I like a darker and richer cup of coffee, and this one is nice and dark and very smooth.  It's not watery like many decaf coffees and it doesn't taste like the donut shoppe type coffees that I really dislike that decaf coffee always seems to taste like.  It also makes an excellent iced coffee on the smallest setting on the Keurig B70 Platinum.  I sometimes make iced coffee on the 5-1/4 cup setting and it still comes out pretty strong.  It's really the perfect decaf coffee.  Even better than at the coffee house!  You will not be disappointed!

review/text: So my title speaks the truth. I've tried lots and lots of decafs and this Tully's house blend is the best of the lot. Good, smoky depth without any bitterness. Doesn't have that weak taste the Green Mountain decafs have. Have no fear of adding milk/creamer - this coffee keeps its flavor and makes a mighty tasty latte. Closet to Starbucks flavor I've found in a decaf K cup.
