review/text: We love the national brand but don't like the MSG in it.  So, we were very excited to try this.  It tastes very good and we were happy to find it.  It takes a couple of minutes longer to thicken than the national brand, but we won't buy the other one again!

review/summary: Organic Reinvented............
review/text: Organic has grown into a household name, in recent years. I've seen a rise in healthier alternatives to favorite staples. Annie's has got the formula for mixing healthy choices, with the much loved food products. This is no rabbit meal. Delight in cheesy flavor. No cardboard taste. Perfect for the picky food kids.<br />Great for fast family meals, without the bad stuff!It looks like pasta, and won't crumble.

review/text: I was a little skeptical about ordering 6 boxes of this at once, but I'd been wanting to try a healthier version of this dish and none of my local health food stores carry this variety.  I took a chance and ordered it and it was surprisingly very good! Combined with the Subscribe and Save, the price is pretty good too.

review/text: There is nothing bad to be said about this product. If you cook it correctly it tastes great. I have eaten plenty of boxes of this stuff. If you mix in organic beef, turkey or chicken with this you are really doing your body a favor. People in this world are too hooked on the garbage ingredients laced into numerous foods products and all the GMOs we eat, enough said. Sorry to say but you are what you eat. Eat healthy and eat organic. Not to mention but there are no GMOs in this stuff.

It's basically like white chocolate, except caramel flavored, a lot softer, and way thinner. To enjoy it you put it on your tongue and let it melt. A good treat for when you have a sweet craving, but you don't want to overindulge.

I've also tried Teavana's spice rooibos blend, and like it as well.  But the tea I got from Davidson's is just as flavorful AND 1/3rd the price! it ships in a VERY nice container, that was a bit dinged up from shipping. I will continue to order this replacing Teavana and Republic's Tea's

review/text: This tea is very fresh and is not too fine that it will wash into your cup with normal infusers. This tea's taste is very unique as to the flavor, it tastes like a fermented cucumber mixed with a mild black tea? It's so hard to explain. It's not particularly to my favor. I still have nearly 4 cups left of it on my burner. I tried it with soy milk (lactose intolerant) after trying it plain; I can't quite create a cup to my liking (I will keep trying). The single pack tea bags that came with my purchase from the Davidson's Tea vendor were unexpected and delicious, thus the tea price with the combined fedex shipping was well worth it for the fantastic trial pieces that I plan to purchase in the future.

review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: Way to great chicken!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with this blend of seasonings.  It is great for chicken and all other types of poultry.  I especially like it for roasted chicken and oven fried chicken.  I really like the no-salt feature, because it allows me to control my own salt content and flavor.  With this blend, a little goes a long way, so don't over-apply it.  Start with a light application and build it up a little at a time to suit your own taste.  It is also very economical, and is actually much cheaper than those small bottles you get in most grocery stores.  Another feature I liked was getting a fresh batch with your order.  The company advertises that they mix a fresh batch for your order, and I believe they do.  The aroma of the spices when you receive your order indicates that they are fresh.  Makes a big difference in their use.<br /><br />  Trapper Tom<br />  Mahnomen, MN

Unfortunately, I had to move the plant into a larger pot and some gnats decided to make the soil their new home. I had to move it outside, but its still going strong!

Delivery was prompt and well packed, vacuum sealed plus ice packs in a well insulated box, but the product itself was very poor. The fish was so dry that it was akin to eating sand. Maybe the vacuum packing process does this or maybe it was just old product, although the best by date was still a year away. No repeat order from me!

review/summary: Great Gum
review/text: Xylitol is much better for you than any of the chemically sweetened mainstream gums that use things like Aspartame. Research studies have proven Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay, different experimenters used different amounts of Xylitol. As the previous reviewer mentioned, some researchers claim that there is a threshold which must be met for the results to be significant, and this is debatable. What isn't debatable is the fact that this gum is not harmful for the body unlike artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />"In another study (with Xylitol), researchers had mothers chew xylitol gum when their children were 3 months old until they were 2 years old. The researchers found the children of the mothers in the xylitol group had "a 70% reduction in cavities (dmf)" when they reached 5 years of age.[15] Recent research[16] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based bread, for instance.) This is because cariogenic bacteria prefer fermentable six carbon sugars, or disacharrides such as sucrose, as opposed to the nonfermentable xylitol, whose antimicrobial properties then "starve" the bacteria, reducing their growth and reproduction."

review/summary: Loses flavor too quickly; not really worth the higher price
review/text: My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards "No Thanks" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />Also (this is USEFUL), I've tried the Spearmint, Citrus & Green Tea, and out of the three, the Green Tea tastes the weirdest. It's almost matcha-like in flavor, but there's something off, like it's almost like someone took the descriptions of what Green Tea tasted like without actually ever tasting it, and then tried to re-create the flavor in the gum. It's very artificial tasting, with the barest of hints of Green Tea.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!

review/text: This cinnamon has a rich warm flavor that will remind you of a Vietnamese cinnamon, it is not your typical Ceylon. Forget about how easy it is to tuck in a purse or briefcase. Forget how it will enhance every single cup of restaurant coffee or bland white rice.  Studies have come out touting cinnamon's ability to stabilize blood sugar, so I gave a tin to a diabetic friend. She claimed that after a teaspoon a day, within a week she noticed a difference. How amazing that something so delightfully flavorful might (for some) have a health benefit!  I sprinkle it in lentil soup, meatloaf, spaghetti sauce, on toast, and in anything chocolate. Any 'foodie' would love this elegant little tin.

review/text: Presumably, this flavor is created mainly for children.  So, with that in mind, this flavor tastes very good to them.  However, here's the clincher.  Don't get near them while they are chewing the stuff.  I don't know what they use to flavor this gum, but it gives people the absolute WORST breath you've ever smelled!  Something reminicent of a pig farm, if you know what I mean!  Really, it smells nothing like watermelon on their breath - it smells like you are actually downwind of your local farmer's pig pen.  Honestly, it's really that bad.  Strangest experience I've had for awhile with food.  Anyway, the kids love the taste and actually, it's really pretty good.  Just don't pop one of these in your mouth before you're going out for the evening.  People will wonder what you've been eating!

review/text: Mackeral is one of the best fish you can eat for the Omega 3's (DHA & EPA) along with sardines and salmon.  These mackeral are packed skin and bone free....no worry about picking little bones out before you eat!  They are a delicious mild fish.  They are packed in soybean oil which I DO NOT like but it's a minute amount so I ignore that my preference of Extra Virgin Olive Oil is not used.  If EVVO can be used in the cans of boneless and skinless sardines.....why can't it be used with these??  Anyway...these are absolutely scrumtious.  The cans are tiny so I consider them one serving and they are expensive but the price on Amazon is terrific.  They are like sardines but without that "fishy" after taste.  I love sardines too so they are both a wonderful complete protein.  I sometimes eat them as the protein in my meal or sometines as an afternoon treat...right out of the can.  I guess if you don't like sardines you should try one can locally before buying the 25 pack from Amazon.  I will be buying these again and stock up when the great Roland sale returns!

review/summary: not the healthiest mackerel?
review/text: I purchased a can of Roland mackerel in soy oil at my local grocery store, and found within delicious small (like large sardines) fish. On that basis I ordered this item from Amazon. The fish in these cans is much larger: each can contains just part of single fish. The flavor is fine but my concern is that these are king mackerel, which are less healthy for your diet than other species (as you can check yourself with an Internet search). There is less omega-3 and, probably more importantly, likely to be more of the man-made pollutants that accumulate in larger fish. Of course the real solution is that we stop polluting the oceans so badly! But until that happens, I will prefer to eat smaller fish.

review/text: This mackerel is very good and tasty, and inexpensive. It is right up there with sardines as very healthy fish. If you can find them, cans like this cost around $2.50 to $3.00 a can. Just drain the oil and enjoy.

review/summary: Roland Canned Mackerel
review/text: This stuff is great.  I used to eat this when I was a very poor college student.  Between the canned mackerel and alot of walking I lost 30 pounds.  Now I am alot older and still love it.  My husband and I work out in our woods.  This is a convenient, easy, healthy and delicious food to take with us.  It is also an easy go-to food when I am too lazy to prepare something.  I bought a case of it and will be buying another soon.

review/summary: mackeral dackeral
review/text: i ordered a different brand that i had tried before but amazon said they would put me on a waiting list. i waited for a month or so and then ordered the roland brand.<br />in the process i learned that mackeral are seasonal. seems the best mackeral is only available in the spring when the omega3 oils are more than double as they are in the fall. the taste is very satisfactory but i'm still wondering if these mackeral are from the spring catch with lots of omega 3 or another time of year when they have less omega 3 because it doesnt list on the tin when they were caught.

review/summary: Nourishing, Healthful, Deliscious
review/text: Experts agree that conventional salt, sea salt, and himalayan crystal salt are very different substances. All three have been analyzed microscopically and nutritionally.Himilayan Crystal Salt was the most nutritive, while the conventional salt and sea salt were not. However, knowledge is easily to verify these days without the need for biased opinion. The science is in, it's tops for trace minerals and thus nutrition; and for this culinary artist my opinion is it is simply deliscious.

review/summary: The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals
review/text: These crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function.<br /><br />I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance.<br /><br />For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt.<br /><br />As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts).<br /><br />Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health.  I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that.<br /><br />As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps.  In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all.  The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me.  From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect.  (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt).<br /><br />Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both.<br /><br />I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823">Obesity Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure</a>.  I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also.<br /><br />Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program.<br /><br />Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm "lucky" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs.  When I'm not taking enough the cramps return.  During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both.<br /><br />As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping.  That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book.<br /><br />Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.<br /><br />My thanks to Amazon for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.<br /><br />With Respect for the maverick M.D.'s who actually apply and teach true healing,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books on KINDLE and Amazon Shorts

One day, I caught a segment on the Dr. Oz show about simple solutions to help with allergies and hay fever. He suggested this product specifically. While still watching the program, I jumped onto Amazon and ordered it immediately.<br /><br />It works!  I've been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen dramatic improvement. That is not to say that this product works for everyone. However, I have bought seven more for my husband and six children.<br /><br />Why put chemicals in your body if a homeopathic treatment works better? However, as written above, this product may not do the trick for everyone, but it sure works for me.

review/text: 88% is pretty intense and in most chocolates it would be extremely bitter with that sour note, but not Hachez!  This stuff is incredibly smooth and delicious.  It has only 8 grams of sugar in the whole bar.  For those of us who either don't love sweets or are working on cutting back on them, this is the perfect treat - intense, smooth chocolate with just a hint of sweetness.  World Market used to carry it, now I have to buy it online since I'm down to my last 3 bars.  Also, try their chocolate leaves, they are gorgeous and delicious.

review/summary: smoothest least bitter dark chocolate I have ever eaten
review/text: This chocolate has a smoother taste and is the least bitter of any dark chocolate I have ever tried, including many varieties in the 60-80% range.  In fact, I think this bar is better than the other Hachez dark chocolates with a lower percentage of cacao.  The only reason I can imagine that someone would find this bitter is if they had never had anything darker than regular American milk chocolate, and even then, the taste of this chocolate is so much richer than milk chocolate that it can't compare.  I also love milk chocolate, but when I want a richer, less sweet flavor, I go directly for this chocolate bar.

review/summary: Healthy food for picky old cats
review/text: My six cats are so picky about their food. Two of my cats have very few teeth, so they eat canned food. I inherited two cats who only wanted kitty treats, and were unhealthy -looking. My other two will eat anything--not necessarily good for them. I went online to find what others said about nutritious cat food , and found a Cat Rescue website that recommended this food as being healthy and free from the bad stuff used as fillers in cat food. I ordered a bag, and was thrilled when all my cats wanted to eat it. I softened up some of the food with chicken broth for the toothless ones. After three months on this food, I have observed the following changes: my 17-year old Siamese who had a greying muzzle and chronically weepy eyes, now has a shiny black muzzle and clear eyes; My two treat-eaters think this is treat-food and have gained weight and have shiny coats; and my two eat-anything guys go for this food first, then race madly through the house, forgetting the bowl that held my ice-cream. The fact that the cat food is a reasonable price and comes right to my door makes this a wonderful deal all around!

review/text: I am trying to find food for my cat which does not contain corn. You'd think this would be a no brainer - cat's can't digest corn! - but it seems pretty much EVERY food in supermarkets contains corn, and usually as the first ingredient. This seemed like a good deal and good quality food. Since switching to it, however, my 9 month old cat (who had no problems whatsoever before) has been puking fairly regularly. I'll be trying a different brand next time.

More importantly, my one cat, who will not really eat wet food, had a coat that was less than ideal, and he was a little underweight. Now his coat is shiny and sleek, he has plumped up to a healthier weight, and he eats with gusto. I am delighted with this food and have reordered several times.<br /><br />If I had any suggestions, it would be to offer this food as a subscription item, and also a resealing bag would be ideal. It is very important to keep their food fresh.

review/text: This was one of the best holistic pet food brands on the market. There were many amazing ingredients in this cat food, and it was almost on-par with the other better-than-commercial brands, but not  grain-free. CSftPLS has a few vegetables and grains in it, but it isn't corn-wheat-soy that is so prevalent in commercial brands.<br /><br />Sadly though, because this food is manufactured by Diamond, and the company was involved in a recall in early 2012, I will no longer be purchasing this food for my cat...<br /><br />Full ingredient list:<br /><br />Chicken, chicken meal, cracked pearled barley, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), turkey meal, white rice, potatoes, oatmeal, millet, natural chicken flavor, salmon, turkey, duck, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, sodium bisulfate, egg product, DL-methionine, potassium chloride, choline chloride, dried chicory root, taurine, dried kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberries, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-Carnitine, dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus casei fermentation product and dried Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, zinc proteinate, vitamin E supplement, niacin, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, copper sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin A supplement, biotin, potassium iodide, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, manganous oxide, sodium selenite, vitamin D supplement, folic acid

(I estimate a rounded half teaspoon as a quarter of a tablespoon, and call that 1 gram of xylitol.) Dissolves very easily.<br /><br />6-10 grams of xylitol per day is recommended for your teeth. More than that isn't dangerous, but can cause unpleasant temporary bowel changes which I prefer to avoid - so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Dr. John's also has a helpful website with more xylitol and sugar-free candies than what's listed on Amazon.

review/summary: Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!
review/text: *****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities."<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of "Kombucha-Pure", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Best noodle soup mix!
review/text: As far as chicken noodle soup box mixes go, Mrs. Grass' is the best.  I had this as a kid, and I still like a bowl of it when I'm sick and want something simple.<br /><br />It's very easy to make, either on the stovetop or in the microwave, and there's something about the flavor egg that makes it more appealing.  The broth is really tasty and has real herbs floating in it, so it doesn't feel like it came out of a box.<br /><br />I have had the Lipton's variety of noodle soup mix, and it paled in comparison.  The noodles were smaller and less plentiful, and there was too much broth for me.  I'll stick with Mrs. Grass.<br /><br />As for the reviewer who didn't like the noodles, my guess is that he or she didn't cook them long enough.  I usually let them simmer for more than the recommended 5 minutes, and they turn out really nicely.  And, no, this isn't exactly healthy or gourmet soup, but it's good when you're sick and need to soothe a sore throat or feed a stomach that's been upset.

review/summary: The Best Packaged Soup Mix
review/text: Without a doubt the best packackaged soup mix available.  I use it as an ingredient in different foods that I cook, and if I use different brands it is just not the same.  My local stores stopped selling this particular Mrs. Grass soup, so now I order it by the case, and it is well worth it.  The golden flavor nugget is the secret ingredient that makes it so good.
