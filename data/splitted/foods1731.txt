review/text: I've been using this product (Hodgson Mill brand) for about 3 years.  Smells good and never takes away from the taste of my foods.  I first learned of flaxseed by reading an article about an African-American actor/physical trainer who swears by it.  She stated she uses it every day, at least one tablespoon in her cereal and recommends it for everyone.  This is some good stuff...and this company is wonderful.

review/summary: Just OK.
review/text: Service was excellent, as usual, from Whole Healthy Pet, but this product was disgusting.  My cat liked the taste, but the consistency was like a duck milkshake.  I had to open a can of her Blue Buffalo duck food to mix with it to give her something she could chew rather than drink.  I know water is good for a cat, but I drizzle some on each of their servings already.  With this quality of food, I want to pay for meat, not water!  Plus, each can I opened was way underweight, coming in at only 4.8 ounces. When I contacted the company - Addiction foods - they blew me off.  Not impressed at all and will not buy again.  I'll stick to Nature's Variety and Blue Buffalo for duck.

review/summary: Great for CRF cats, allergy cats and finicky cats LOVE it!!
review/text: Finally, a healthy human grade quality food that all my cats love AND that is safe for my cats with special dietary needs.  My 19 year old cat with kidney disease requires low phosphorus food. Addiction canned food has 1% phosphorus(dry matter basis) which may not be as low as special prescription diets, but it is low compared to many other good quality canned cat foods. My 13 year old cat has allergies and needs a grain free food with a novel protein source. I refuse to feed my cats the hideous prescription diets sold by vets that are made from GMO corn, rendered meat and who knows what else. If you don't know about these ingredients Google "API report truth about pet food" and you will learn things about Science Diet, Royal Canin, Iams, Eukanuba etc. that you probably don't want to know. Between slick commercials and vet recommendations, a lot of people have no idea what is really in so many of these foods.<br /><br />All 4 of my cats love Addiction and lick the bowl clean. Even my cat who turns her nose up at all wet food, eats Addiction enthusiastically. I have only tried the Duck so far, but will try the others as well. Addiction dry food, unfortunately, is higher phosphorus and not a good choice for cats with kidney disease but would be great for a younger cat with allergies. It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Eliminating Aspartame in all forms
review/text: How did something like Aspartame ever make it into our food supply?  In the book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing," by James and Phyllis Balch, aspartame is listed under the category of "chemical poison." Uh, yeah.  It's made up of three chemicals: aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. Also noted for causing migraines so, as a sufferer, I began eliminating everything containing it from my refrigerator and shelves.  Fortunately that wasn't much but I do chew a lot of gum and have since I quit smoking 10 years ago.<br /><br />Amazon to the rescue!  The Epic Xylitol Sweetened gum not only tastes great and has a nice consistency, it's got the added benefit of leaving my teeth feeling super clean and smooth.

review/text: I drink at least a pot of this tea everyday, and two months after purchase the bag is still over half full. If you like green tea, you will love this Kukicha. I think it tastes less bitter than most standard loose-leaf greens. It's also a little darker. And with the low caffeine content, you can drink it almost anytime of day or night.<br /><br />I usually brew at least two pots from each batch of leaves. But as long as you don't steep it too long, you could probably get three pots out of one batch.

review/summary: Different than expected, but enjoyable
review/text: This tea was different than I expected, but not due to any kind of misrepresentation. In the past I had purchased my Kukicha tea from Adagio Teas. Their Kukicha is not roasted, and the color of the tea is a mixture of green and blonde. Perhaps it's not a true Kukicha, but I really enjoyed it. The Davidson's tea has a dark brown roasted color and consists of fairly small twigs. I admit to being a bit disappointed initially since I have not enjoyed roasted teas in the past. Ugh, I thought, now I have a huge one pound bag to get through! Once I made the first cup, I was pleasantly surprised. The roasted flavor is (to me) more subdued than the dark color would suggest. Still prominent, but not overpowering. I've had at least 25 cups so far and I'm not at all tired of the flavor. I also appreciate that it is easy to clean up. Some teas cling to the brew basket as they dry, but these "twigs" drop right out. Given the price, I'm pretty satisfied.

review/summary: Love
review/text: A little over a year and a half ago I became obsessed with tea.  I have tried every organic (and even some of the well-reputed non-organic brands) tea that I've been able to obtain.  Now that the tasting spree is over, Ineeka is what I drink.<br /><br />This chamomile tea has the best and most pure flavor of any I've come across.  It has a depth that is amazing.<br /><br />Contrary to someone else's review of this product:  Ineeka's Whole Leaf teas *are* whole leaf.  I've never received any smashed product.  And if you don't like the air-tight tin box that it comes in that is absolutely perfect for storing tea in (and gorgeous enough to leave on your counter), then order the refills sans the tin off the mfg's website instead.  The tea bags aren't any more wasteful than any other tea bag in existence, and they work flawlessly on a myriad of tea cups and even the thick double-walled glasses that I use daily.  If you prefer, you can purchase the tea without the teabags, they also sell it loose.<br /><br />I drink Ineeka tea all day long (the green, chamomile and mint).  I drink more tea now that I don't have to mess around with a tea ball or tea steeper.  They also make a little 2 qty tea bag tin that is awesome for carrying in one's bag for those times when you find yourself with hot water but no quality tea (gas stations, cafes, etc).<br /><br />This is absolutely fabulous organic whole leaf tea from a very socially responsible company.

review/summary: This tea made me a "Tea Drinker"
review/text: A rather sophisticated beautiful ex-model friend of mine gave me some of this tea as a gift. Each serving has a little cardboard/paper infuser that you open and set on the lip of the cup and pour hot water through.  Sometime I will use a couple pieces of tape to hold it on larger cups.  The technique is unusual and adds to the whole experience.  The tea is great... mellow... smooth with a kind of "thickness" in fluid serface tension.  I almost gave up coffee drinking this stuff and my wife has to ration it out to me or I will drink them one after another...  only a "special treat" she says.  Argggggh....  out of it and back to coffee... Love coffee... but you just got to try this!!  Makes a great gift too... nice metal container that reminds me of a bank vault.  I think this tea won a prize at a food show for "Best Beverage" if I remember correctly.

review/text: I purchased this brand because it was one of very few Organic whole leaf Chamomile teas Amazon carries that appeared to be good quality. The packaging and bags themselves are wasteful, especially given how few tea bags there are. There is just too much going on with the design of these bags and they dont even stay on your cup well when pouring water. I also wonder about the glue they are using to attach the paperboard holders to the tea bags. The tea bags come flattened out in the tin box, crushing all the chamomile flowers inside. I think I will stick to Traditional Medicinals brand for now, at least the design is more practical and the box can be put in the compost, even though they are not whole. These are for the infrequent tea drinker.

review/text: I asked "Swanson Health Products" for an answer to my question: Would you be so good as to tell me if the process being use to purify the fructose is the Castner-Kellner process (commonly used)? Their reply: After speaking with several Product Specialists and a Supervisor, we were unable to locate additional information on how the swanson 100% premium fructose item #SW1083 is processed.<br /><br />Now I ask you; how could they know if it is 100% pure?

review/summary: This is a great drink...I truly love this stuff, but read this review and think about test drinking generic...
review/text: Like many others who have written reviews on this particular flavor and package count, this stuff is the drink of my choice.  I do like flavored drinks but due to health problems, and simply trying to watch my weight, I have had to cut all of the soft drinks normal people like, my beloved Kool-aid and anything else with a high sugar/calorie count. Thus, after searching here and there for a replacement, I started drinking Crystal Light...my favorite being the Pink Lemonade.<br /><br />I drink about two quarts of this stuff on a normal day and during the summer when I am out in the sun working or exercising, my intake increases.<br /><br />This drink is supposed to have only 5 calories per serving and I simply take their word for that.  It should be noted that this beverage does contain soy and phenylalamine so those suffering from allergies do need to take note.<br /><br />There is also the factor, which has been brought up in other reviews, that this particular drink is not as strong as it use to be when in was marketed in the little tubs.  I tend to agree with this and I do cut back on the water I add somewhat.  This does affect the cost somewhat and should be considered.  I suppose the `strength' of the drink is a matter of personal taste though and many may not be bothered by this.  This stuff is not cheap, although I will say that the price here on Amazon is quite competitive to what we pay in the local store.<br /><br />There is one thing of note that needs to be brought up.  This is not a reflection of this particular product; a product I dearly love, but rather than that of pure economics.  We recently ran out of this particular product and I sent a grandson to the store for more.  They too were out!  He instead bought a generic brand of this particular drink.  I made up a batch and to be quite honest, I could not tell the difference in it and the Crystal Light I have been drinking.  What is interesting to note is that the generic stuff cost about on third of what this stuff does!  I check the contents of the other brand...the cheap stuff, and they appear to be made of the same stuff!  It is packaged in little tubs and the outer package is not as pretty or elaborate as that of the Crystal Light, but hey, I do not set staring at the package when I drink this drink.<br /><br />Now perhaps many to most have a more sophisticated taste than the one I possess and can indeed tell the difference in the two...it might be something you want to consider though and give it a shot.  Hey, in this day and age a person needs to save every dime they can.<br /><br />I am giving this product five stars as it is most certainly a five star product as far as I am concerned...I have absolutely no problems with it.  On the other if I can save some of my hard earned coinage.....!<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/text: Thank you Amazon for offering Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  You cannot imagine how hard it is to find this on the grocery store shelves.  They never seem to have it in stock.  It is all my husband and I drink, simply because it quenches our thirst.  And auto shipment has another case coming just when we need it. Going on line to Amazon has taken the frustration out of trying to find this product.  Thank you Thank you.

And I will act like one of the idiots on here that reviews a products features or specifics that don't exist anyway or has anything to do with the product. Like I could say I don't like the shape of the bottle. Boom, 1 star. Or the pink of the powder is not the shade I prefer. Or when I mix it into water and haven't chilled the water that the temperature is too warm for my beverage preference. You know what I'm saying. Some crap like that.

review/summary: One of my favorite flavors!
review/text: This is one of my favorite Crystal Light flavors.  I like to keep a pitcher of it in the refrigerator, especially in the hot summer.  I like that it is only 5 calories per glass and contains no caffeine and it is low in sodium.  That's three things I need to avoid!<br /><br />Crystal light is a good replacement for carbonated drinks and it is lower in cost.  One packet makes 2 quarts and the flavor puts some zest into your water.  Each canister contains 6 packets that each makes two quarts.  That's 18 gallons of flavorful pink lemonade that is Kosher and gluten free.  That is less than � the price of sodas and it tastes just as good.<br /><br />My family likes it and yours will too!

review/summary: The best pre-packaged curry
review/text: Curry fans.  This is the number one selling condiment in Japan.  They make a version of Indian Curry that is pretty good.  This is labeled as HOT but don't let that scare you.  If you want to make a REALLY hot curry, this is a good base.  You can stretch is out quite a bit by adding more water, spices, salt, and a thickening agent.<br /><br />If you are watching your fat intake, it would probably be a good idea to dilute it by half as described above.  On the box label, it lists 7 of fat, 4.5 grams of saturated fat per serving. I'd bet that most people eat more than serving, so just be aware of that.<br /><br />Otherwise, the taste of this mix is very good, feel free to add more spice.

There is no hint of anything, just the sensation of your senses of taste and smell being hammered into submission by cloves.<br /><br />Nicely packaged, good price, makes a good potpourri if you don't want to drink any after that first sip.  Or I guess you could sprinkle a little on your Christmas ham before you bake it, I'll try some of their other teas but not if they are labeled as 'spiced'.

It's so disappointing because I feel bad throwing it out and I haven't figured out a way to use it, and you get a 1-pound bag and that's huge!<br />Bottom line: you might want to reconsider this, EVEN if you like cloves.

There is no reason a small jar 11oz jar should be $12+ dollars! If you have a TJ's next to you this is $3.69 per 11oz jar as of 4/17/12.

review/text: I found this at Trader Joe's on the peanut butter aisle and after talking to a clerk who described it as being kind of like a light ginger bread wafer type of taste I thought, "Eh, I'll give it a go...."  He suggested putting it on a crumpet and so I got those too....(Ever hear them say don't shop hungry?).  Well, I am glad I tried it.  It is for sure junk food, it is made up of ground cookies and the taste is not too heavy on the ginger and spices, just a bit, in fact perfect if you ask me.  I like it on the crumpets but found they are to die for spread on an apple....I was afraid this was seasonal, but I understand from TJ's it is coming back, they are temporarily out of stock due to demand.  HURRY UP ALREADY!  Oh, also made Rice Krispie treats and put in approx. 1/4 c. in while the butter and marshmallows were melting and then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  Too good!<br />The only thing I can think of as a drawback is if you can't stand a cookie crumb texture.  It is smooth like peanut butter but you do get little spots of cookie crumbs now and then, so some may say that gives the spread a gritty feel.  I myself love it and will buy a couple jars to have on hand.  Oh, and don't refrigerate!

review/text: This is DELICIOUS.  The first night I opened the jar, I found myself looking for something-anything- to spread this on.  There's nothing artificial in it, but it's not "healthy", and it's not a peanut butter substitute- it is sugary sweet and definitely a dessert spread.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is awfully pricey online, and even if someone is reselling it, is it necessary to charge over 3x the price?  It's not like it's being imported from overseas' they're just picking it up at the local TJ's.

review/text: This is the best new thing I've tasted since I ate truffles for the first time a few years ago. Speculoos cookie butter basically tastes like graham crackers with the consistency of peanut butter. They need to learn how to fortify this stuff with protein,medium chain fatty acids, calcium and other good stuff, so kids will beg for their nutrition. Not one single person that has tried this in my presense has said anything other than it is amazing.<br /><br />Wait until the hood hears about this, is what my friend said web he first tried it, and I must agree. Way too expensive from Amazon. They are obviously incorporating the shipping into the price of the jar because on the shelf it is $5.

review/text: I don't have a Trader Joe's near me so when I went for the first time, this was something I grabbed for just to try. It's REALLY good but it is definitely not as healthy as a regular nut butter. it has similar nutrition facts to nutella, which has almost no nutritional value at all. don't be fooled because it doesn't contain trans fat and hydrogenated oils, therefore it's healthy for you. it's not. it's mostly sugar and oils. but you have to live a little and at least just have one jar for a nice treat.

review/text: Cookie butter is everything it says on the package and more. It has a gingerbready, slightly nutty taste to it and it's almost exactly like peanut butter. It spreads well and it makes a wonderful ice cream topping when microwaved for 20 seconds (for microwaving, I recommending putting about two teaspoons in a little bowl and warming it up like that).<br /><br />Of course, it's not healthy at all. It's called cookie butter, what do people expect? But it has no trans fats in it or hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated oils. I recommend going to a real Trader Joe's instead of buying it online, it's much cheaper there.

review/summary: Very similar to Biscoff Spread
review/text: I can tell you exactly what this tastes like, and pretty much what it is...creamed butter (or rather a healthier variety of margarine), brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon solidified to a peanut butter consistency.<br />I purchased some Biscoff Spread at Publix in Florida last month (the crunchy variety), the Publix in Georgia doesn't carry it so I thought I'd try TJ's Cookie Butter and they are so very similar.  The taste of both is that of the airline cookies made by Biscoff, Lotus.  It is good, but not a health food.  There are no trans fats in any of Trader Joe's products.  They would be a fun spread for parties or a gift basket.

There's like this almost perfect balance between ginger snap flavor and sweet cookie crumbled up. Kinda hard to explain the texture of the bits of cookie in it. Super fine, not chunky at all but not so fine to the point of gross or too weird. It's perfect for a late sweet tooth craving and all you'll need is like a teaspoon :) Yum!!!

review/summary: Good Job keeping dogs in, KILLS Kittens though
review/text: Bought the SS525CS Light Duty Fence energizer to keep our minpins from digging out from underneath our fence.  It was our last resort since they broke through every other barrier we set up.  It did the trick!  We set it up at our new house so it surrounds the fence all the way around, and also set a single strand on the outside of the back of the fence, which butts up to vacant land where coyotes and stray animals run around.  We didn't want coyotes coming to our yard and digging in to get at the dogs, so this was a great idea.  We've heard loose dogs get shocked out back there, and that keeps our animals safe.  Well, unfortunately yesterday I heard the energizer making a louder than usual buzzing sound and knew that something was wrong.  We previously had a kitten get stuck on it on the inside of our yard (poor thing was scared half to death by the fence and the dogs!), and bit the wire.  It fried it's poor little mouth to the wire and his legs were stuck straight out. We turned the fence off but the poor little guy had been shocked terribly.  He ended up being "ok" and we found him a home.<br /><br />Yesterday when I heard the noise I freaked out and went looking around the perimeter, and found another stray kitten, with one of its rear paws stuck to the outer perimeter's line.  I couldn't save this one. The fence killed him.  The side of his body that was touching the ground was smouldering and burnt. I had to pick up the body and dispose of it.  I cried a LOT yesterday about this.  We have a cat and a kitten in our home and it devastated me that we were responsible for the death of this precious little life.<br /><br />But today, after thinking more about it and then going online to research, it turns out that the manufacturer knows that the energizers with "CS" in the model number (means "Continuous Shock") DO KILL small animals.  Despite thier knowledge of this, the company still advertises that "No commercially made charger when installed properly will harm a pet or human."  The problem isn't improper installation here; it's that the shock in this model is continuous and doesn't give a smaller animal the chance to pull away. Cats and kittens are notorious for biting at things that hurt them, and once they clamp down, there's no getting loose unless someone happens to see what is going on.  If you are considering an electric fence, be sure it is an Intermittent Shock energizer.  This means it pulsates and allows the animal to get off the wire.  As far as I'm concerned, the item I'm reviewing, SS525CS, is a death trap for small animals (and birds & frogs too).

review/summary: Maybe a bit too strong for a garden fence
review/text: We have deer, rabbits, groundhogs, and probably a few other critters that love to get into our garden. I bought this fence energizer to keep them out, and it works very well. However, I'm having second thoughts about the continuous current. One of my fence lines is just a few inches above the ground to keep out rabbits and groundhogs. The other day I found a dead starling under it. I don't really feel too bad about the starling ... it has been pulling up seedlings ... but it made me realize that small animals probably can't escape the strong, constant shock. Some other chargers use a pulsing current, and they may give the same animals a chance to break free and get away.<br /><br />I will continue to monitor this. All it will take will be one dead rabbit and my wife will insist that the charger be removed. As is, I am running it only at night to minimize the chances of accidently shocking a pet or person!<br /><br />If you intend to use a low fence wire, or if you are going to use it where kids might touch it, consider a pulsing fence energizer.

review/summary: Excellent Fence Charger for the money..........
review/text: This fence charger is inexpensive but a good one. However, it is a constant voltage one. That means the fence is constantly charged. You must take this into account if small animals and children are in the area. If they are, you need a fence charger that pulses, the interment pulse allows an animal/human to pull away if it contacts the fence thus preventing electrocution.  Very good fence charger for the money but treat it with respect.............. I will give it 4 stars and not 5 due too there being no indicator light to show when it on and it is not a pulsing model............
