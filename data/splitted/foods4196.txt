review/summary: Great taste and great for shakes!
review/text: I drink a protein drink for lunch just about every day and this product is so handy in adding flavor and protein to my shakes without wrestling with a jar of peanut butter!  It mixes up well, has a great flavor, is lower in fat and has only a very small amount of sugar and salt for additives.  Great product!

review/summary: Peanut Butter fanatic!
review/text: Works great for protein shakes and on ice cream for those of us who want peanut butter in everything! I still like to dip my spoon in the jar for the serious cravings, but use the powdered PB for everything else. Love that it has fewer calories and how easy it is to clean up! Smells like regular peanut butter! Wish it was priced a bit lower, but benefits are good. Getting ready to order my 3rd supply. Try it! :)

review/summary: It has SUGAR added as well as SALT
review/text: This is a good product IF you like sugar and salt in your peanut butter.  I like plain old peanut flavor in my peanut butter, so I have a choice to make:  either the oil from Smuckers or the sugar and salt from PB2.  I'm not sure which I'll choose long term.<br /><br />UPDATE:  PB2 is my first choice all the time now.  Not having the oil is worth the little sweetness that is present in the PB2, and the salt tastes about the same as the salt in the Smuckers Natural.  It's very convenient to mix as needed, and it really is just as good as regular peanut butter.  And one serving is only one Weight Watcher point.  3/15/3012

I CANT WAIT TO EXPLORE OTHER WAYS TO USE IT. I'M GLAD I MADE THE PURCHASE.I have received my second order of PB2 and couldn't be more pleased to have the product. since my first purchase/use i have found many ways i enjoy it.  i find it to be weight watcher friendly also. i have actually mixed the powder in with my moms steel cut hot oats cereal and she really enjoys it.

review/summary: Great on a cut...value not so much
review/text: To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor.

review/text: I have had the PB2 for awhile now and realized I need to come up with some way to use it up...  All by itself it is way to sweet.  No where on the Bell Plantation web site did it say it had sugar and a lot of it at that.  I eat plain peanut butter, because my body does not like cane sugar.  So I think I'll be making muffins or something so that there will be enough protein to balance the sugar.<br />I have eaten the PB2 with carob powder blended in ... now that has got to tell you that this stuff is really sweet.  bottom line ... I am a wee bit bummed out with the sugar.  Never would have purchased it, had I known.

review/summary: PB2 - Peanut Butter with All The Work
review/text: PB2 is a great idea, and a much healthier option for PB lovers; however, when I want PB, I want PB, and messing with the PB2 is not something done quickly unless you are just making PB2 with water. Excellent mixed with honey, preserves, etc., but it takes more of those things that are not water to make the PB, and is there really a point of mixing PB2 with something other than water if you are looking for the health benefit?<br /><br />As a huge fan of crunchy PB, and having eaten only natural PB for years, I already receive the benefit of not eating hydrogenated oil (we all have to have some fat), so I'm not gaining the same benefits from the PB2 that I would if I were moving from Jiff or Skippy to this almost no-fat product.

review/summary: Great for making regular peanut butter less oily!
review/text: I bought this powdered peanut butter to "fix" the consistency of my favorite natural peanut butter by Sunland. Natural peanut butter tends to be very oily, and I hate anything with an oily or greasy consistency but I am always trying to find ways to increase my intake of healthy fats, which keeps me lean and totally ripped (I am the same size 2 in my 40's as I was in my 20's thanks in part to my PB&J addiction!) Mixing PB2 in with regular peanut butter gives it a perfect drier and firmer consistency that is so much more palatable. My daily peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are absolutely delicious now with no gross oily mouth feel! I love the fact that PB2 is also all natural. Great product!

review/summary: Tastes pretty darn close to real peanut butter ...
review/text: I travel a lot for business and I can never find decent peanut butter anywhere outside of the US. I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.  I'm planning on packing several ziplocs of this yummy powder with my on my trips so I can have it on my bread for breakfast. The hotels always have jams and jellies but they never offer peanut butter. Now, I'm packing my own and loving it.

review/summary: Great tasting low fat peanut butter
review/text: PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks. It's a powdered peanut butter - peanuts with most of the fat removed, plus small amounts of sugar and salt for flavor. The amount of sugar per 2 tablespoon serving is only 1 gram (equivalent to 1/4 of a teaspoon). I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter. My favorite way to eat this is with apple slices, although I've had patients tell me they like to dip their fresh fruit directly into the powder. Amazon seems to have the best prices for this item.

Needless to say, I mix it up in vanilla yogurt and add berries or I mix it up in chocolate pudding and add bananas.  I make smoothies with this stuff, and I will also mix it with water to make a creamy peanut butter for a nice peanut butter sandwich! The 1 lb bag is the way to go, especially if you love peanut butter! I have turned SO many people on to this stuff where I work that it's kind of a running joke now. Everyone loves PB2 and most importantly, can't believe HOW GOOD it tastes! Another bonus: 5 grams of protein in just two tablespoons! Awesome!

review/text: I absolutely love peanut butter but it's such a high calorie food that I really have to limit my consumption. My typical morning begins with a bowl of oatmeal which I like to mix about 150 calories worth of peanut butter into. I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!

review/text: PB2 is low in fat and calories (2 tablespoons of PB powder = 45 calories, 1.5 grams of fat).<br /><br />It's fabulous in my banana & PB smoothie (banana, milk, honey, PB2).  It tastes soooooo good, and because it's low in fat and calories, I can have this as a snack without feeling too bad.  I also mix this with chocolate soy milk for a quick drink.<br /><br />I don't like it as much in a sandwich, but it satiates that craving.  It was a great thing to try, but I probably wouldn't purchase this again only because something about removing healthy fats kinda gives me pause for thought.<br /><br />As a not-so-healthy option, it works great in flavoring buttercream frosting and dusting truffles for extra peanut flavor.  :)

review/text: This was the best idea ever.  I have a SERIOUS peanut butter addition.  I thought I was just going to have to stop buying it because it was getting so out of hand.  I usually mix regular PB with Greek yogurt (the unflavored kind...it has the lowest amount of sugar) to try to lower the fat/calorie content, but I wont be doing that anymore.  This tastes just as good, if not better.  I also found that if I used yogurt instead of water, that a little bit less PB2 needs to be used.  I typically mix a little water in there, too.  For a treat, I would also put just a lil' bit of PB2 in with some Greek yogurt and maybe a bit of SF jelly and some cereal!

review/summary: Not quite peanut butter, but a reasonable substitute
review/text: I've been on a diet and exercise program and was eating peanut butter as a snack and it started to get out of hand and I couldn't lose any weight. Well with roughly 200 calories in 2T of peanut butter, it is easy to figure out why. My trainer told me about PB2 so I got some to try and I do like it. It is NOT peanut butter, it lacks the creamy smooth taste. I guess if I had to explain what it tastes like, I would say peanut butter cookie dough - basically imagine what peanut butter would taste like mixed with flour. But given that I can eat it for 1/4 of the calories, it is a reasonable substitute when I crave peanut butter.<br /><br />As I recall, the instructions call for 2T of powder and 1T of water. I found that wasn't enough water to mix it up properly and had to put in a little extra. Over time I've found 1T of water is needed for every 1T of powder (equal parts), and that provides a creamier texture.<br /><br />If I've got a few extra calories to burn for the day, I will sometimes mix 3T of PB2, 3T of water, and 1T of real peanut butter.<br /><br />So PB2 is a great product and it is helping me meet my diet goals, but I wish it tasted more like real peanut butter. I haven't tried it in smoothies or anything like that (because I don't drink them), but I can see how that could be good if you enjoy them. I've ordered some of the chocolate flavored and I look forward to trying it.

review/summary: Peanut butter for the chubby set
review/text: Does it taste like a full fat peanut butter? No. Is the consistency the same as a full fat peanut butter? No.  Does it taste good and act as a good substitute? Yes!  I've made PBJs with this and it is not quite the same (but good), PB and honey--I don't advise it, Thai peanut sauce--excellent..  The best use of this product is in smoothies with bananas, blueberries, protein powder, and coco.  I've ordered this product twice and will continue to do so but it is by no means Jiffy in a powdered form.

I can measure my portions much more easily.  PB2 is so much easier to take with me for lunch or snacks.  PB2 is only 45 calories compared it the oily stuff's 220 calories.  PB2 is great for adding into smoothies, yogurt, curries, soups, and just about anything you can think of whilst in the kitchen.  The best reason for eating PB2-it tastes GREAT!

review/text: I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years.  PB2 isn't a perfect replacement for peanut butter, but it has a natural taste to it, is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile.  I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product.<br /><br />When turning PB2 into peanut butter, don't add too much water, or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted.  In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread, I also put PB2 powder in smoothies, on cereal and with oatmeal.

review/summary: Much Healthier, Yummy REAL Peanut Butter! Amazing!
review/text: I have difficulty controlling portion size when I eat peanut butter, which wrecks my diet, and is preventing me from losing the last 20 lbs. I need to lose. After trying the revolting Walden Farms 0 Calorie Peanut Spread, several Amazon users recommended this product. PB 2 is real peanut butter in powdered form. It's had most of the fat extracted from the peanuts. It contains just three ingredients: peanuts, salt, and sugar. It's more natural than many regular PB brands. Each 2 tbsp. serving contains 45 calories and just 1.5 g of fat (compared to 190 or 200 calories and 16 g of fat in regular PB). You mix one to two tbsp of water per two tbsp of PB2. This is one of the few diet foods that tastes the same as the regular stuff, instead of being an inferior chemical tasting imitation of the original. I mix it with sugar free syrup and spread it on an apple for a 115 calorie dessert that tastes awesome!

review/summary: For those who truly care about a healthy lifestyle with good taste
review/text: I first tried PB2 in D'Lites located on Cedar Rd. in Chesapeake. The owner raved about it and offered me a sample. I was sold at first bite! I loved the clean taste without all the sugar and additives. I bought a jar and as I continued to eat it on our Daniel Fast, I just had to go on line to order more. I offered some to my 14 yr. old granddaughter and  she is sold on it too. She also thinks it tastes better than regular peanut butter.  I can have 3 TBS, get the same amount of protein with less than 68 calories. I have mixed it in oatmeal & I have added part water and part total fruit spread for a sandwich. You get all the fun with none of the guilt and it has so much nutrition! Eating this is saying goodbye to empty calories and being able to carry it with me is a great benefit. If you really care about living a healthier lifestyle, you will want to order this awesome peanut butter.  It also comes in chocolate with the same food value. I even posted it on my facebook page.

review/text: As a major peanut butter fan, I was a little dubious when I started hearing people talk about this powdered peanut butter as if it were the best thing since sliced bread. As it turns out, PB2 is quite compatible with sliced bread, or smoothies, milkshakes, ice cream, or just by the spoonful.<br /><br />This is the real deal. All of the flavor and taste of peanut butter, without all the peanut oil.

review/summary: Great for protein bars and more!!
review/text: I love this product!  I use it as an ingredient in my homemade protein bars but also have tried it every way I can think of.  As a peanut butter junkie, I was not sure I would like this, but its great.  Mixed per the instructions with water and I think it tastes as good or better than most commercial brands and without the fat.  Okay, but I am lazy, too. I empty the original package into a glass container with a snap on lid.  I find it easier to get the product out without spilling this way.  It also makes it easy to dip bananas for each bite.  Sprinkles on vanilla or chocolate ice cream? You betcha!  Here is one that sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  Mix two tbsps. powder with one tbsp. water and five or six drops of your favorite hot sauce.  Spread this over a freshly grilled hamburger and enjoy.  It sort of tastes like Thai beef satay, only better and juicier.  It is a little pricey at this size and I am hoping to find larger, bulk sizes.

review/summary: Where has this been all my life?
review/text: I hesitated to try this as, frankly, powdered peanut butter sounded repulsive.  However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know "it's a good fat").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!  I love this stuff and don't think I will ever be without it in my pantry again.

review/text: I used to buy Better'n Peanut Butter but this is by far a better alternative. At first, I was a little leery about having to reconstitute my peanut butter but this is a very tasty alternative and the dehydration makes the product more versatile. I would suggest that you make sure that the product is well mixed or the consistency will be bumpy/powdery and not as good. Occasionally, I will add a little stevia to sweeten the mixture and make it a little more like peanut butter. Today, I am buying 6 more so I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Simply Amazing!!
review/text: I was pretty excited when I accidentally came across this product on Amazon! But --- I really like peanut butter, and how could they make it taste good and take all that oil and all those calories out? A ton of reviewers claimed it was good - but I just had to see for myself. I ordered both the regular and chocolate.  I couldn't wait to get the shipment. It came today (sooner than expected) - and I immediately mixed up the regular PB2. At first it looked like grainy stuff and water. I kept stirring - and pretty soon my spoon was coated with peanut butter - and I had a nice little mound of peanut butter in the bowl! Well - at least it looks like peanut butter - that's something! Then I tasted a little with my finger. Wait .... WHAT?? Seriously - it really IS peanut butter!! It looks like it, smells like it and tastes like it! I grew up in the mid-west, enjoying peanut butter and sweet pickle sandwiches. (Yes - sounds weird, I know - but have you tried it? Wonderful!) I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier - and those can't be enjoyed very often. I've been using the high fiber whole grain tortillas that are only 50 calories - so I spread some PB2 down the center - and placed a few pickle slices on top. I rolled up and tasted ----- perfect! I know I'm going to love this stuff! Another thing I like to do - is just scoop a spoonful of peanut butter and eat it (we call it a "peanut butter pop"). Well guess what - this is good enough that you can even do that! If you are used to Jiff like I am - just sprinkle a bit of Splenda in the PB2 as you mix it up for that little bit of extra sweetness! I read a few reviews by people who said PB2 wasn't anything like real peanut butter - and I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about!! I was fully prepared to sacrifice flavor for the goal of lowering fat and calories - but I'm so excited to find out I don't have to! Oh - and the PB2 Chocolate is pretty darned good stuff too! Buy PB2 and try it for yourself - you'll find a million ways to use it, I'm sure! All I wonder - is where has this been, and why didn't I know about it? I'll be telling every nutrition conscious person I know! Happy, healthy eating!!

review/text: Bought this product on Amazon just over a week ago, and it's almost gone already! That should suffice for the "how'd you like it?" part. It's a pretty good sub for actual pb on sandwiches, etc., (found it mixed better with a bit of hot water rather than cold) but it's at least as good if not better in smoothies. First day, I tried it with the banana as folks had suggested, but discovered I liked it even better with just cold almond milk. Since then, I've been adding a packet or two of stevia and a tablespoon of ground flax to the mixture and having it in a tall glass with ice cubes; tastes like a pb milkshake! Yum. Only slight negative is the sugar they add to the powder; would prefer if this company sold a plain pb version (with or without the salt). Other than that, it's just about perfect.

review/summary: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread!
review/text: I used to go to summer camp when I was a kid and my nickname was the Peanut Butter Kid because I put peanut butter on everything.  I put it on watermelon and I used to put it in my cup of vanilla ice cream.  This was in 1970 before peanut butter and ice cream was an actual flavor at ice cream parlors.  I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?<br /><br />As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.<br /><br />PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.<br /><br />When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.<br /><br />PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.  With PB2, you can have your cake and eat it too!

review/summary: Great for Peanut Butter lovers trying to watch fat intake
review/text: Fine powder, great when added to Whey smoothie. Gonna try in cookies at Christmas.  when mixed with water in a little bowl tasted salty to me but I eat very little salt.  I'm sure I will find more uses but so far the best yet was in the smoothie.<br /><br />Also I am a person who loves to eat any nut butter right out of the jar but have to resist because of the calories so I have high expectations of flavor and texture. This hits the peanut butter spot, but there is no danger for me of over indulging :)

review/summary: PB2 is good
review/text: I'm a big peanut butter consumer but was on the lookout for a lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, then I found PB2.  This stuff makes it very convenient to add extra protein and flavor to your diet at any time of the day.  No mixing thick, oily peanut butter is really nice.  Or, wondering what the other 10% of the ingredients are in that off-the-shelf brand of peanut butter. The single packages are pretty expensive, so I think next time I will be ordering the twelve pack of 6.5 ounce bottles instead.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: Being a peanut butter lover, I decided to try this in my daily protein shakes to cut back on calories. I add 1 serving to my usual fruit smoothie and it blends very well and tastes great.  I also like to add a serving of it to my coffee drinks, but just know that if you mix it in with a spoon, it will eventually settle at the bottom of water based drinks. The nutritional benefit is 5g of protein per serving and a mere 40 calories (versus 180 calories for a serving of peanut butter). Unfortunately when you cut out the calories, you also cut out the heart healthy fats so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete substitute for real peanut butter if you're eating peanut butter for healthy heart reasons. However, if you're like me and love the peanut butter taste and your want a quick 5g of protein here and there, and need to watch your calories, it's definitely worth it.

review/summary: Tastes like real peanut butter
review/text: At first, using PB2 was confusing as the ratio of powder to water in the directions gave me a very dry crumbly mess. As I experimented, I found adding more water, a little at a time, gave me the consistency of peanut butter that I desired. I like that the fat is almost all removed and when prepared, can be used just like regular peanut butter with much less calories. A treat for me as I love peanut butter but can enjoy it more so using PB2.<br /><br />I did remove one star as I'm not happy that sugar is added to this product (wish it was an artificial sweetener or nothing at all).

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: In my never ending quest to find low calorie nutritious food, I bought some of this powdered peanut butter. I love peanut butter and eat a little bit most days of the week.  I am somewhat conditioned to the natural flavor and richness of the real thing.<br />I'd read that this PB2 is not the same as regular peanut butter, but many reviewers say it's a good substitute.  Therefore I expected it to be different, but not distasteful. I'm used to eating healthy fare and realize there has to be a trade off.  However, I was quite disappointed in this product. It feels chalky and tastes like stale fake peanuts. For someone on a restricted diet who is desperate to eat some type of peanut butter, this may work. I'll stick to the regular stuff and continue on my way.

review/text: So, I have to admit I was initially skeptical of powder and water making peanut butter, but this stuff is pretty good! It's my first try, so I will have to perfect measurements - so far I'm thinking I might try closer to a 1:1 ratio instead of 2:1...it will help the product to go further too. It tastes good and smells even better - very pure and peanutty, plus, I am always happy to save calories, especially on higher fat foods like nut spreads. I imagine it would travel well in small containers. Of course, on the downside, it's quite bit more expensive than good old Jif...

review/text: I was excited to try PB2 after reading so many rave reviews.  Now that I've tried it, I wholeheartedly concur. This really is an amazing product.  It's easy to prepare and it tastes fantastic!  I love to cook.  Anything and everything.  But I've been looking for new ways to curb calories without losing flavor and the joy of the food.  Initially when I bought this, my goal was to make a lower calorie satay sauce without losing that wonderful peanut flavor. Now that I've tasted PB2, I'm sure it will make a great peanut sauce.  Plus I can imagine making lower calorie cookies and PB&Js and who knows what else?  If you're experimenting in the kitchen like I am (a la Bobby Deen reworking Paul Deen), consider giving this a try.

review/summary: great quality, but my dogs weren't too keen on it
review/text: I know this is a 5-star dog food.  I had previously been feeding my dogs (2 small Chihuahuas) Iams and Purina Beneful (until I realized that's junk food).  At first they seemed to like Nature's Variety.  I did notice that their stools were loose sometimes--probably because it was new or rich.  I decided to buy Kirkland dog food at Costco (much cheaper at 27 bucks for a 40 pound bag, and rated 4-stars, so not as good as Nature's Variety, but still very good).  I filled half their dish with Nature's Variety and half with Kirkland, and they ate the Kirkland and left the Nature's Variety.  So, I gave the Nature's Variety to a coworker.<br /><br />I really like the fact that Nature's Variety comes in so many flavors.  Kirkland has 2 varieties: chicken, and lamb.  But that's okay.  I got one bag of each, so they can have a change of food every week or so.  With Kirkland, no loose stools and everyone is happy.  And I feel good knowing that my dogs are eating healthy food.<br /><br />PS: If you Google "dog food advisor", then you will find a website that ranks almost all dog foods.  I found this to be very helpful when deciding what food to buy for my dogs.  To find the Costco brand, Google "kirkland signature pet food".

review/summary: Looks good on paper but my dog never stopped being sick.
review/text: We used Nature's Variety (non Instinct formula) for a while, but when we moved to our current location, the closest we could find was Natural Balance, so we had to switch.  When NB put out their grain free Alpha Dog, I tried that out and was amazed at how my normally very smelly Boston Terrier suddenly didn't seem to have any gas at all.  This got me searching for reviews, where I discovered the NV's Instinct line was rated much higher than NB's Alpha dog.  When I discovered the Amazon subscriptions, and how inexpensive that makes it(relative to what I pay at the pet store for organic pet food), I decided to give NV another try.  For the first week, I mixed the last of the old food with the new to get him used to it.  He had diarrhea and the worst gas EVER for days.  Now it's been a week on just the NV food and the sickness has not stopped.  I though maybe he was suffering from seasonal allergies and that's why he seemed so blahhh lately.  Last night I put it all together and realized it's the food.  I really wish I could get a refund, but at least I stopped the subscription in time not to get another.

Is what I said after I first bought it. Amazon won't let me change my rating but I was wrong...<br /><br />I began to drink this tea often, Most days of the month. The weeks before my cycle, about when I start to ovulate. I start to drink at least 6 bags a day and I have seen a HUGE IMPROVEMENT in my pain.<br /><br />I have had severe cramping since I started my "woman time" several years ago. This is the first time I have seen relief. While this could do with a combination of things, I can say that there is a signifigant change in the heaviness of my cycle.<br /><br />Another tip, I mix this tea with the Joint Pain tea that Yogi has as well. This has helped to mask the mildly unpleasant flavor of this tea.

review/text: I love this tea, it is so yummy and I love that it is organic.  And, it is cheaper than buying Raspberry Leaf tea at the store.  Plus, I can't find Raspberry Leaf anywhere buy health food stores or Whole Foods, so it is nice to get it on Amazon.  I was paying $5 or more for a box of tea.  This tea is supposed to help with female reproduction and toning the uterus, which is why I drink it all day long.

review/summary: Wonderful Tea!
review/text: I'm a chiropractor specializing in fertility, pre-natal, and pediatric care.  I always have this tea here in the office because of it's healing and soothing effect on the female reproductive system.  I recommend it for menstrual cramps, any cycle irregularity, during pregnancy, and general uterine health.  It's a miraculous ancient remedy used by native cultures for centuries.  I've always loved the quality of Yogi Teas and their Red Raspberry Leaf is delicious.  For those who haven't tried it, it's like a mild black tea in flavor and naturally a little sweet. Try drinking it throughout your next period and see how soothing it is for yourself. I usually drink a cup every day and maybe two during my period. Enjoy!  Colleen [...]

review/summary: Not for Everyone!
review/text: I bought a box of this tea at my local Whole Foods.  If you have never tried this tea, I recommend buying one box, like I did, rather than buying it in bulk here on Amazon.  I am not pregnant, but I heard this tea had good benefits for all women of reproductive age (I'm in my late 20's).  So I made a large cup of this tea and went on with my day.  Within two hours of ingesting the tea, I had MAJOR uterine cramps.  Now, I guess this might be what they euphemistically refer to as "strengthening the female system".  I cannot imagine drinking this when I was 6 weeks pregnant, as it seems to basically cause contractions in me after one cup.  I guess it will be useful at the end of the third trimester, especially if I'm past term.  But for every day use, I don't like it.  It's like having period cramps every day.  Ugh.

review/summary: LOVE THIS TEA!
review/text: I love this tea! I used to have such bad periods that I was bent over screaming, throwing up and crying so hard. No medication could help me calm down at all. I got this tea and started drinking it the day I got my period and within 3 to 10 sips I had no more cramps at all. Now I drink it 10-5 days before a period and I have no more cramps, no more screaming and crying or anything. I LOVE this tea! It is a gift to all females who have bad menstrual cycles! I want to start drinking it when I do get pregnant and try to have a natural birth.

review/summary: I'd recommend!!!
review/text: Similar to many reviews - I started drinking this tea when I was 35 weeks pregnant. Drank for 2 weeks and the baby came a bit early - yet it was an amazingly easy and fast labor. It took me less than 30 minutes and I was fully dilated. I had to literally held the baby in so that my doctor could rush in to deliver him. LOL. And he was out in 3 pushes. Everyone was amazed how quick and smooth it was. I also had no tear. Like others said, I don't know for sure if it's really this tea, or genetics, or exercise (I did walk like at least 30 minutes a day), or luck or something else...but really, I can only see benefits of drinking this tea. I'll definitely drink again with my 2nd. Good luck everyone.<br /><br />Updated 11/11 - I recommended this tea to a close friend who drank 2 - 3 cups a day for 2 - 3 weeks before her labor. Her labor was not as smooth and fast as mine - it was about 15 hours total. Still it seems to be faster than other first time mothers I know who had labors of 24 hours or longer. I'm currently pregnant now (16 weeks) and will surely start to drink it around 32 weeks and will update this review after my labor.

review/summary: I get the worst cramps and this tea is a life saver
review/text: This tea doesn't taste much like raspberries to me but it i a great help during my monthly period pains. Without this tea I get pain so bad that I can barely stand and have broken into sweats from the pain (I don't usually sweat easily). Since I can't take most pain relievers due to a bad stomach I decided to look for something holistic. I try to take it when I know my period is coming I take this tea a my pain is mostly gone but it only takes like 20mins to work if that day comes before I expect. If you get bad cramps, I highly recommend you try this tea!

review/summary: A must if you're pregnant
review/text: During my pregnancy I drank this tea faithfully every single day! I love the taste also. When I went into Labor, it was the easiest labor ever!!! No, i'm not getting paid for this review (I wish I was) I am writing this review because I swear by this tea. My labor started at 1:00 am arrived at the hospital at 1:30 and by 3:00 my baby was out, NATURALLY!!! that's how quick and easy it was. When I went for my six week check up, my doctor told me my uterus was back to NORMAL. She said she was expecting my uterus to be slightly apart, but nope, back to normal. I love love love yogi. especially this one. Ladies let's get this if you are expecting. It really helps!!!!!!

review/summary: stop whining!
review/text: I didn't buy my first box at Amazon, but I will buy future boxes here - awesome deal.  I bought this tea because everything gives me migraine and I wanted a non-caffeinated, warm beverage to enjoy multiple times during the day.  I read somewhere that raspberry leaf tea is good for headache, so I gave it a try. It's GREAT!  I don't know why these other reviewers are brewing it for 20 minutes, but no wonder they don't like the taste.  When brewed for 3-5 minutes, in 16 ounces of boiling water, in a Starbucks ceramic "Venti" mug, the taste is lovely. No sugar, no milk, just tea. I don't know if it's going to enhance my lady parts or not, but I love this tea!!

review/summary: Watch out -- Reviews are for a mix of different teas
review/text: I was looking at the reviews while considering purchase of Raspberry Leaf Herbal Tea. Many of them didn't make sense in relationship to raspberry tea, until I noticed that the header of each review mentioned what tea the review was for. All the different teas made by Yogi Woman seem to be mixed together.  Not very helpful, Amazon.

review/summary: amazing with lemon!
review/text: well, here i am again in my 3rd trimester...and i did some research on the benefits of drinking raspberry leaf tea during this time...and apparently for women it's good to drink just in general, pregnate or not.  so, being a yogi tea lover i ordered a box.  i find it very convinient to be able to buy a 6 pack (16 bags per box) at this price b/c it averages out to about 2 dollars less than you pay per box at whole foods or other grocery stores.  also, i dont worry about running out in a week.  i like to double up the tea bags, i drink about 4 cups per day.  it tastes great in my opinion, and today i just added a fresh lemon from my lemon tree!  delicious!!  as far as the benefits for my uterous i cant really comment on since i'm not a obgyn, and i havent had my baby yet so i dont know if this tea will play any part in easing my labor.  but i can tell you that i love this tea, it tastes great, it makes me feel like i'm doing something good for my body & it's a great price.  i will continue to drink it after giving birth b/c from what i've read there are also post partum benefits of drinking raspberry leaf tea.

review/summary: This tea works wonders for those with irregularity!!
review/text: I had tried this last year because I read reviews that said this works for infrequent periods. After reading so many positive reviews I was convinced it would work for me. It took about 1-2 weeks of drinking this tea before my period started again after not having it for 3 months+.  I just drink a cup of tea using 2 tea bags each day. Before I found out about this tea I had considered taking birth control pills because I heard it helped regulate your period. I'm so glad I found a natural alternative!!! And you can't beat Amazon's subscribe and save deal! In the store they are $5/box!!

review/summary: This could very well be the reason...
review/text: It's my first review on Amazon, and I made sure to remember to write it, despite having my hands full with the newborn, since I believe this tea was the reason why I had the labor and delivery I had. 33 year old first time mom, I must have read 15 books in preparation and packed all sorts of massaging and relaxation tools in my hospital bag, hoping for the natural unmedicated birth. My somewhat painful contractions started around 9:30pm. I was prepared for the long night ahead at home. Well, by 11:30 I had to wake my husband up to go to the hospital. Once we arrived, medical personnel somewhat took their time to admit me. Guess what, when they checked I was 8.5 dilated and ready to push 20 minutes later. 7 pound baby was born at 3:24am after 6 pushes, without any pain meds. According to my husband he flew out like a rocket. And did I mention it was actually on his due date. I have been drinking this tea before getting pregnant, and then starting second trimester one bag daily, sipping for 20 minutes. During last 2 weeks I used 2 bags a day. It must be the tea, since my mom was in labor with her first for over 20 hours, same as I expected for myself. Seven days later I'm drinking it to help my body heal. Don't get me wrong, labor still hurt like nothing I've felt before, but it was fast and a very profound experience. Highly recommend!
