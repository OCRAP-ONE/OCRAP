review/summary: PRODUCT OF CHINA!!!!!!!
review/text: I was really starting to like this brand and food until I just read it's a product of China. Why? It's bad enough almost every nonfood item is made there but our food? Never will I buy again, amazon should disclose this info.

review/summary: Trio bars are delicious!  My favorite energy/snack bars
review/text: Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars. I love them. They come in four flavors and you get five of each flavor in this variety box. Blueberry is my favorite, followed by strawberry (I like berry flavors). Cranberry comes in third, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry. Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others. My least favorite is the tropical but only because it has a less distinct taste than the others.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients. The bars have a trio of trios: 3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits. The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors. The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios. The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower. The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the "glue" that holds all the other ingredients together. The third fruit in each flavor is (obviously) dried fruit in the named flavor, though the tropical is a blend of three different tropical fruits, none of which dominates. The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy. The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher. They also have no preservatives. If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is "good" fat. The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated. To round out the rest of the nutrition facts: calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have. They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying. I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.

review/summary: First health bar that I look forward to eating.
review/text: This tastes kind of like the 6" disc shaped nut/seed treats that had a hard honey glaze they were sold in some stores. Every bit of space on this bar has some type of nut, seed or dried fruit crammed into it. They have a great flavor and to me taste way better than most nutrition bars. I have a problem with eating right but this helps.<br />Oh and you can find this box of 20 bars at one of the big warehouse club stores for nine dollars cheaper than in Amazon.

review/text: I love the flavor of these bars.  So good.  But, they are really hard. They are made with nuts so I suppose I understand why they are hard, but after the first few bars, I found myself skipping these and reaching for other bars that were not as hard as these.  Too bad because I really love the flavor.  This 20 pack will last me a long, long time...

review/summary: Made in China - buyer beware!
review/text: When I saw this product I liked the concept.  It's an enegry bar with no chocolate coatings (it won't melt) and no odd soy-based protein sources that I can't understand.  It looks like real food so I bought some.<br /><br />Then I read the label on the bar itself - it's made in China!  After China's track record of having dangerous chemicals in baby formula and pet food, I'm not so happy with this purchase.  I looked all over their website and it's impossible to know this fact until you get the bars.  Mrs. May's is in CA, I don't know why they can't use nuts & dried fruit from the US & Canada.  I won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Good but not as good as store bought
review/text: I got sucked into comparing these to the ones I get from Costco, and these are a lot smaller than the ones at Costco.  I am not sure that Costco is even stocking them anymore though.  When gotten from Costco, I love these, and I can't stop eating them.  When I saw the price on Amazon, I jumped at it.  These bars are about half the size as the ones I am used to.  In addition, it is true what I read in another review, that they do not taste as fresh as the ones I buy in the store.  Bizarre that would occur over months of reviews.  I will probably keep this on my subscription, but that is assuming I can't get them from Costco.  Otherwise I will buy them from the store, no brainer.

review/summary: Unparalleled in the world of snack bars
review/text: I have spent a while trying to find the perfect snack bar, and my search ends here. I've tried Luna, Odwalla, Balance, Power Bars, Quaker, Nature Valley, Cliff, and Kind bars, all of which are too sweet and taste funny to me. This one tastes almost exactly like its ingredients: a whole bunch of nuts, some seeds, and a little fruit. They find some magic way to stick them all together with the minimum possible amount of sugar (6g, as opposed to 17 or more). It's like a bag of trail mix in bar form--heavenly.<br /><br />But you should also know that each bar is quite small -- closer in size to a Kind bar than an Odwalla. That said, the low amount of sugar makes them more filling and satisfying.

review/text: After some of the safety issues regarding products made in China (Lead in toys, Melamine in milk, etc.) i'm very hesitant to consume fods products which are manufactured there.  When purchasing a "higher end" product such as this one, one doesn't expect that it would be made in China.  I'm not even sure if I should eat these. I definitely will not be purchasing these again, and in the future would prefer to purchase from companies who produce their products in countries with higher standards for food production.

review/summary: Not what I remember...
review/text: I initially had my first Trio Bar this summer given to me by a friend in Colorado.  He said that he gets them at Costco.  The bar he gave me was about twice the size of these bars, the 1.2 oz size, I got from Amazon.  I didn't notice the difference until I got the box and saw the "mini" bars.  Doom on me.  So now I paid quite a bit per bar for mini bars.  The second factor, like some others have written, is that the bar seems stale and very brittle.  I haven't looked at the box to see the "consume by" date, but what do you expect from a Chinese food product.  Needless to say, initially I was excited about this bar, but the price, staleness, and Chinese-ness of it will keep me looking...  How can an organic, American company find it acceptable to have their product made in China?

I wish Amazon would list where a product is from, especially for food items. I am really upset that a supposedly health food type products are being shipped out to be produced in China, (think Apple Crisps).  Come are profits that important.

review/text: A co-worker had brought in a box of Mrs. May's Trio Bars.  I chose Blueberry, My first introduction to a Mrs. May's bar.  I rated this "I HATE IT" however I never took a bite so I can not tell you if they taste good or not.  When I opened the package I first viewed cobwebs and was not sure what I was looking at until two maggots dropped out. Went back to the box to check expiration date "BEST IF USED BY JUNE 11th 2011".  I opened my bar on 11/17/10. Then I looked for company address finding none.  What I did find was PRODUCT OF CHINA. This has prompted me to read more labels from here on out.  THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL US ?  I was able to find a contact online and sent a picture of the maggot infested bar to the company. Purely customer feedback. Making it clear to the company that I do not want coupons or a free box of this product.  Thank you but no thanks.  HAPPY TO LIVE IN THE USA

The label says there is 2.5 (1.5) grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 230 (170); total carbs, 20g (14g); dietary fiber, 3g (2g); sugars, 8g (6g); protein, 6g (5g); cholesterol, 0g (0g); trans fat, 0g (0g); and sodium, 60mg (45mg).<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.

review/text: I've tried several brands of pure fruit and nut bars and like the Trio bars the best by far. I bought them regularly at Costco until they stopped carrying them several months ago. Recently I tried the online version here at Amazon. Quality is again top-notch, but something seemed to be missing. The new bars are TINY.<br /><br />Thankfully, Costco is stocking them again. Costco charges about $17 for twenty 48-gram bars. These guys want $25 for twenty 35-gram bars, a third smaller for half again as much money.

review/summary: Not Fresh? Do we have a health risk ??
review/text: I have recently noticed that the last few months of Trio snacks received are stale and more brittle than usual. I am told that this product is made in China which concerns me.<br /><br />I cannot find madatory expiration dates on the box which causes me even greater concern. I hope Amazon is reviewing their food products prior to shipping.

review/summary: Tasty and good
review/text: I had the opportunity to purchase this when it was a Gold Box deal.  Earlier that day, I was getting a massage (rare treat), and they had these bars.  I was starving, so I purchased one.  After tasting that one, I placed an order for this through my cell phone.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was surprised that they were not the full retail size.  These are about half the size as the ones you buy in a store.<br /><br />However, that being said, they are delicious.  I am not a whole foods type person.  I prefer to eat according to taste, not whether something is healthy for me, or good for the environment (sad but true).  So these are quite tasty if I'm willing to buy a box of them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that htey are a tad tiny compared to the retail size.

review/summary: exactly what it say it is, three nuts, three seeds, three berries
review/text: This is definitely not my favorite product from Mrs. Mays but still very tasty.  I don't personally enjoy the texture of these 'bars' as they are very hard.  I see some people have complained about them being stale and I wonder more if they are just not used to the texture of the bar.  Also, when I think of a 'bar' I am thinking of something sort of cakey, sort of chewy, and these are not at all like that.  Really, they are just a bunch of nuts and seeds held together with some sort of hardened liquid.  The only thing I could relate it to would be sort of like a brittle, with a similar texture or consistency but not sweet like a brittle.  I really like the blueberry and cranberry flavors, strawberry is okay but could definitely pass on the tropical one.  These snacks are healthy, filling and pretty tasty and something great to munch on when you are on the go or looking for something to fill the snacking void that is a bit healthier than a bag of chips.

review/summary: I am NOT a big healthy food nut but..
review/text: ...these don't taste like you are eating healthy! I went to my nephews wedding and in our gift bags at the hotel they put these Trio Bars. I read the package and said no thanks! I brought them home and gave them to my son. Well my mom still had hers and she made me taste one....78 years old and still pushing me around! Well she was right...they ARE good! I contacted my sister and asked her to get me more from her son if she could. She then told me they were on Amazon and I was really happy because I could not find them in the stores locally.<br /><br />I am NOT a health food person. I love my fattening food but I have been trying to eat a bit better lately. You know how it is with getting older. I will GLADLY eat these because they are delicious. If you love nuts, you will love these bars. Crunchy, touch of salt, touch of sweet, filling....they just fit the bill! I've gotten my son to eat them for breakfast because he's not a breakfast person. It makes me feel good to know he's got some healthy energy food in him and not some caffiene loaded beverage!<br /><br />Look locally and see if  you can try a bar. To me they are very rich and filling so one is plenty for me even though they are slightly small. I think once you try them you'll get the bug to eat them regularly. They certainly are better for you than a bag of chips!

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: We like these Mrs. May's Trio Natural Bars. These are a little on the chewy, sticky side, so beware, if you have dental problems (chew carefully). Packaged in an almost indestructible cello package. The ingredients are as follows: Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Fruit (Cranberries or Strawberries or Blueberries or Tropical-Pineapple, Mango, Papaya), Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Dates, Raisins, Rice Malt, Natural Flavors, Cane Juice, Sea Salt. That's it! There are 20 bars in a 24 oz or 700 gram box. Each bar is 1.2 oz or 35 grams. The box says: vegan/no trans fat/no additives/no preservatives/no cholesterol/gluten free/diary free/wheat free/non-GMO/kosher and product of China (that worries me more than a little). Calories 170 each, 100 calories from fat, 12 grams total fat, 1.5 grams saturated fat, 0mg cholesterol, 45mg sodium, 14g total carbohydrate, 2g dietary fiber, 6g sugar, 5g protein, 2/4% calcium, 8% iron, 0% vitamins A & C. Yummy flavor, can taste the nuts and fruit, not too sweet for most people, certainly a lot less sweet than any other granola/snack/breakfast/protein type bar we've tried. Wish they were bigger, pretty small. Otherwise, very good bars.  Nice having 5 bars of each flavor all in one box!

review/summary: Chinese Mrs May Trio Bars
review/text: We purchased the item from Costco and have enjoyed the snack without reading about its origin [individual bars have a lot of attractive information but does not have country of origin].  To replenish our supply I decided to order it from Amazon and for the first time [after reading the reviews] became aware that the food product was made in China. What guarantee is there that the product is GMO free? Are random samples of the food item tested for GMO presence? Is the product manufactured in a facility that does not process non-vegan items?  Who has tested food products from China for presence of heavy metals and other contaminants and is there a continuous testing? The claim is that the product is "all natural" but who has verified that components used are grown on land that is not contaminated with chemicals and heavy metals.  The product is very tasty and we have not suffered from food poisoning but now that I am aware of the country of origin I have grave doubts about the integrity of the product for long term use [bioaccumulation of contaminants and cumulative effects over time] and will look for similar snacks that are made locally [Made in USA]. I have no confidence in food products from China based on available evidence of widespread pollution and contaminated pet food ingredients and baby food.

review/text: I've been buying Mrs. Mays Trio bars at my local Costco for years, and agree that they are the only health bar that one can look forward to eating. However, Costco stopped carrying the product, so I bought it from Amazon. Some of the bars tasted stale, almost rancid, even though the sell by date is in Feb. 2010.<br /><br />I didn't realize the product is made in China. Unfortunately, if this is the case, I will have to rethink my choice. Also, because I cannot buy the product locally, and what I got from Amazon was sub-par (compared to all the other instances when I've used the product), sadly I will probably give it up.

No claim they make (gluten free, dairy free, etc.) can be trusted. On top of that, these ingredients are shipped there and then shipped back. I'm paying for diesel fuel to push ships instead of ingredients for my food.<br /><br />This'll be the last batch I buy. They taste fine, but I'll buy closer to home, where the food is local and the processes are regulated.

review/summary: A Great Gluten Free Protein Bar
review/text: I was given a Mrs. May's Trio Bar on a trip recently.  I was pleasantly surprised at this not too sweet, nutty, crunchy treat.  And it's gluten free as well.  I saved the wrapper and ordered some for myself.  I remembered the one given to me being in a different wrapper and larger than the ones I ordered. This person lives in Canada, so perhaps that's the reason for the difference.<br />I enjoy them to sustain me between meals, and have them in my backpack on the trails.  These bars are a great summer option since there is nothing that will melt.  Do they taste as good as some of the other bars I eat?  No. I'm not intolerant to gluten so have many many options.  There is only 5 grams of protein per bar, but more than most granola bars provide for comparable calories. If you need to avoid gluten, I think you'll find that these bars are a tasty option for you!  Even if you don't need to avoid gluten I think you'll still find these are a tasty option, more nutritious than most granola bars, with much less sugar!

review/text: I bought a box at costco and liked these better than any bar I've eaten before. They are higher in fat due to the amount of nuts, but much lower in sugars than the average bar which is one reason they tasted better to me. Though they are crunchy I didn't find them too hard as one reviewer found. (I'm almost 60 and don't have that good of teeth). Now that I looked at the Amazon reviews I'm disappointed they're made in china so I will have to rethink whether to buy these again.

review/text: I've eaten all flavors of these Trio bars. I started buying these about 5 years ago. They are just nuts, seeds, dried fruit and a little cane juice. Previously the bars were larger and were 7 Points Plus points with Weight Watchers. The current bars are a little smaller and are only 5 Points Plus points. They are a complete meal. I always have one in my purse and two in my car. If I'm out running errands and get hungry I'll eat one for a totally satisfying lunch. I take them on all road trips and eat one for breakfast while I'm driving.<br /><br />I think I'm on about my 8th box of these Trio Bars. For a person who doesn't like sugar, sweets and fillers, this is a healthy, wonderful snack (or meal).

When I inquired at the Costco near me, I was told they no longer carried the Trio bars.  The Mrs Mays website indicates that Whole Foods and BJ's carries Trio bars, but the locations near me - do not.  The shipping charges on the Mrs Mays website are pretty high - which brought me to Amazon.  I was also told by CS at Mrs Mays that the 1.7oz bar was only available at Costco.  The bars sold here at Amazon and the Mrs Mays website are the smaller 1.2oz bars.  I'm not thrilled that they're manufactured in China.  If anyone knows of a similar nut/seed crunchy bar - please post in comments!  Thank you!

review/text: Someday, it will be safe to buy food products from China. Today is not that day. Everyone knows China is very poorly regulated and the Chinese people suffer from all kinds of side effects as a result. Why should that problem and uncertainty be exported? The only way to manufacture in China is for the outsourcing company to STRICTLY and CONTINUOUSLY audit the manufacturing process -- because we cannot rely on their native legal and regulatory controls to ensure a safe product. Trio is not Apple Computer. They can't afford to scan the manufacturing all the time.<br /><br />I had a Trio bar yesterday - first time - and so I wanted to buy more. But I'll have to think twice about this product until they bring manufacturing back to the USA or at least to a country with a recognized high manufacturing standard. Health food + uncertain origin DO NOT equal a viable product. Sorry Trio!

review/text: I love how they taste, very fresh nuts, not too sweet.  A perfect snack item, but then I saw they are made in China and that was a huge disappointment.  That's a long way to travel for a snack item.  If they were made in USA I would give them 5 stars.

I deducted one star for "Made in China".  However, I have never had better tasting "processed" food.<br /><br />All the flavors are tasty.<br /><br />The bars' cost is on par with other, less enjoyable snacks.<br /><br />They are my go to snack when I am away from home.  They taste so good that I had to review them, and I almost never write reviews.

review/text: We have tried all the BRAT feel better drinks, and this is our favorite flavor....its like drinking the milk leftover from a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch.  So good!  More importantly, though, its always worked when my kids are sick with the stomach flu; keeping them hydrated, calming their tummies, and helping stop diarrhea.  Which is great news because I can never get them to drink Pedialyte, AND that drink doesn't have the extra "feel better" benefits of the BRAT drinks.  I also like that this drink works for adults too who have similar stomach problems (eg morning sickness and digestive disorders)! Plus, its all-natural and doesn't contain any of the common allergens, so as a parent, I actually feel good about giving them this product.  A+ in my book!

I thought it would be thicker (because of the apple and banana puree in there) but it is essentially like drinking yummy rice milk.  For people with multiples allergies (like me) it is a safe drink that I can actually drink without making me sicker.  And the Amazon price ($5 a quart) is much cheaper than I can find it in the local Whole Foods ($7 a quart).  And yea, it is expensive, but face it, if you are puking and sick, you won't be chugging the whole quart at once.

review/summary: Top Quality from Spain
review/text: Just like many of the best Italian olive oils come from top wine producers, Marques De Grinon EVOO comes from one of Spain's greatest wineries, Marques De Grinon, known for it's exceptional Cabernets and Syrahs from its estate in Castilla-La Mancha. This olive oil is quite complex and rich, more buttery and less bitter than typical Tuscan oils, but every bit as fresh and flavorful. I would put it as a worthy alternative to the Tuscan oils, particularly for dipping in bread, where it's softness makes it especially delectable. It's too expensive to be used for everyday cooking, but it can be drizzled on steaks and chops at the end to add aromatic and flavor nuance to grilled meats and vegetables. Really, this is a world class oil.

review/summary: Best Before April 2011
review/text: For those of you wondering why the 2-pack is much cheaper per oz. than the 3-pack, here is  a possible reason (yes, you guessed it): the back label reads "Harvest Fall 2008/Released Spring 2009/ Best Before End Of April 2011". That being clarified, it's still a great olive oil, its charming tomato aroma still full and unclouded. But Amazon is less than honest in not providing this information as of August 2011, an unacceptable omission - hence 3/5 stars, in order to draw attention to this issue. Amazon does not provide the harvest/best before dates for 3-pack or other packs either.

review/summary: Yummy, Sweet and Hot, Hot, Hot!
review/text: I love wasabi peas, plain and simple, and these are absolutely wonderful. They are good sized, nice and crunchy, tangy sweet with that bite of HOT that wasabi is known for. The price is good for the amount you receive, and they taste fresh and yummy. I like the 'no MSG' aspect, because MSG gives me a headache (always has), and there are some I've seen that do have MSG in them, so it's nice to know these don't. When compared to other snacks, like chips or cookies, wasabi peas offer a kick pick-me-up snack that's much more healthful for you. Dr. Oz even said on one of his shows that they help boost metabolism, so you can't beat that! My son will even eat these peas, and he doesn't like anything green!<br /><br />These came in a bag, but it was the crinkly type of bag, that was stiff and it broke and tore, so the bag opened and spilled peas out. Fortunately, they were packed in another bag and twist-tied, and so they didn't spell out and were kept fresh.<br /><br />These are a LOT of peas in a 2lb bag... so know that you're getting a lot, and I do mean, a lot of peas. I found them flavorful, not overly hot, with just a touch of sweetness to them. I will definitely be buying these again.

I love Hapi Snack's Wasabi Peas, but they're expensive and hard to find. I was thrilled when I saw these. However, they have a strange "fake" taste and worst of all, they are like eating rocks - LITERALLY! Every fourth or fifth pea I tried to eat was a solid rock. I actually chipped my tooth. My dental work is going to cost me a lot more than what I saved on these. They're not that hot, either. If you like Wasabi Peas try some other brand. These are not worth the $11+ shipping. I've never left a negative review like this before. But buyer beware.

review/text: I purchased these Chocolate-O's for my daughter who has multiple food allergies.  The texture was similar to an "Oreo" cookie.  However, the Chocolate-O's are not as sweet.  My biggest disappointment was the quality control.  When we opened the box, the filling was smeared on the outside of the cookies.  It looked liked the cream melted, oozed out then hardened. There was very little cream filling between the cookies, and a third of the cookies in the box didn't even contain any cream filling in the middle.  They were just two chocolate cookies stuck together.  If they'd put actual filling between the cookies I'd try them again.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

review/summary: If you like...
review/text: So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. "That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy." Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it.

review/summary: More beans than I know what to do with.
review/text: I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.

review/summary: Delicious, but overpriced.
review/text: I thought the bag would be much bigger for the price, since you can get them at Trader Joe's for about 1/4th of this price. (bought for about $10) Sadly, it was just one small bag.<br /><br />They were, however QUITE delicious.

review/summary: Needs a warning label
review/text: WARNING! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SEEDS!<br /><br />Seriously, I ordered these hoping they'd last like a month or so and I ate all the bags in under 2 weeks. These things are fantastic! I've always loved seeds but hated the way that salted seeds messed up the insides of my cheeks. Enter saltless seeds... So good. I have to make myself not eat them. I also had to google "Is eating too many sunflower seeds bad for you!"

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: Their taste is very good, very fresh and I love the packaging - you'll get 6 tubs - so you can open just one at the time, which is good, because otherwise we would eat them all at once.

review/summary: Our Choice
review/text: Of the reasonably priced dry cat foods, Nutro Natural Choice has the best ingredients. Our cats like it, too, and were gaining weight, so we switched to Healthy Weight, which seems to have brought that problem under control. Nutro Natural Choice Healthy Weight has therefore become our regular cat food.

review/summary: Best M&M EVER!!
review/text: These M&Ms remind me of tiny little Almond Joy's surrounded by a bright candy shell.  They are spectacular!! I hope this company does itself and every candy lover in the world a favor by making these "special limited edition" candies a regular in their product line.

review/summary: Necessity
review/text: I had been using this product for years, but can no longer find it in the stores. It is a key ingredient in my asian inspired bloody marys. My fan have been missing them. Now that I have a case of this all important ingredient, I can make them happy again. :)

review/summary: so good!
review/text: I made these cookies and took them to work and they were a huge hit!  The cookies taste a lot like the chunk brownies so it's probably the same mix.  They sell a similar cookie at the local store and the office deemed these cookies are much better than the store bakery cookies that were previously the favorite treat.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: 'I use this product because my husband has congestive heart failure and<br />the safe levels of potassium chloride is over 4000 mg per day. Never<br />use that much but the flavoring in food really helps. Cannot find this<br />product in any of the local stores.  Product was fresh dated Thanks for<br />offering it!

review/summary: Easy to use and no sodium!
review/text: I love this as an alternative to beef stock and bouillion cubes.  It is the only sodium free that I can find.  Why do they have to put salt in everything.  I wish manufacturers would start leaving the salt out of everything (and sugar) and let us season to our own tastes

review/summary: POTASSIUM ADDED!!
review/text: I was greatly disappointed. Because I like regular HerbOx products. I can't stand the taste of potassium and it is not good for me. But the ad states nothing about this fact.

review/summary: Great sodium-free flavoring
review/text: I have Meniere's disease and need a sodium-free diet. The markets in the city where I live do not offer a product like this, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It also contains no MSG. Excellent flavoring.
