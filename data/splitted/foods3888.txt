review/summary: Wanted it to work...
review/text: I really wanted this formula to work for my son!  I had to stop breast feeding at 7 months and we started him on Gerber Good start Protect.  He did fine at first but I noticed he became gassy and fussy.  Also the formula did not mix well.  We would shake and shake and stir the formula for what seemed like forever (when you have a crying baby) and in turn caused it to create bubbles.  I tried another formula and even went back to this just in case but it was a no go!  Unfortunately we still have not found the right formula.

review/summary: Good formula..but what on earth is coming out the other end??!!
review/text: My son's pediatrician recommended this formula when he was having issues with vomiting up half a bottle of his previous formula.  We tried a sample and soon switched.  Have had no problems since, and he is now a happy non-puking little dude.  All's well right?  Uhhh...nope. WHAT on earth is he pooping out? I swear I have never seen a baby poop that color before, some weird shade of grey/green sludge that has the consistency of tar and stinks like nobodies business.  Great formula but the poop could kill someone!

review/summary: expensive clunky packaging
review/text: Well, the baby was already on Good Start, so we couldn't switch to another formula.  This new packaging is a sturdy squarish plastic shell.<br />1. difficult to open the latch -- often the entire lid threatens to come off<br />2. square shape makes it hard to get to corners<br />3. at the lid, the container narrows (the lip), so if you try to turn the can upside down to empty it out, formula gets stuck on the ledge.  It's really a pain in the ass to use every last bit of powder.<br />4. decreased amount, increased price.  Bleah.<br />5. I almost forgot, there is an asinine blue plastic circle at one corner that appears to protect the foil lid.  You have to carefully remove the foil under this blue plastic, and half the time the foil rips and you waste time removing the rest of the foil.<br />6. The scoop holder in the top of the lid works but it's totally not worth any increase in cost.

review/summary: TOXIC hexane still in it!
review/text: RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be "agricultural ingredients." Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as "necessary vitamins and minerals," which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and "other" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from "natural"<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: "includes mutant organisms" and "recombinant organisms", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is "extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane."<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: "genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid" and "extraction with solvents such as ... hexane." Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.

review/summary: I actually spent $60 on candy, so sue me
review/text: I LOVE this candy more than anything in the world. Originally bought it at Trader Joe's many years ago, was given them at a restaurant recently and looked for them again...could not find them in stores. So I actually blew $60 on this. Well, the candy is delicious and great but I actually took the time and effort to count them, only to be just under 200 short. :( I got 1414 candies in this.  I feel kind of gypped considering I paid $60, and for it to be missing an eighth of what was supposed to be in it kinda sucked. Great candy, though.

review/summary: Wholesome hides seem a little weak
review/text: First rolled hide that hasn't given Moose explosive poops. So good there. He is able to completely consume one 9-10" roll in one day. So bad there. At least I think he's not getting toxic waste. But he is a compulsive chewer at 7 months, and I'm saving the kitchen cabinet fronts, table edges, legs, chair feet and any book or paper in the room from being shredded.

review/summary: Best Rawhide Yet
review/text: I wanted a product that was made in the US rather than China. Most raw cow hides come from the US and are shipped to China for processing. Rawhides produced in the US generally should be fresher and not packed in crates and preservatives for months. I have a higher level of confidence there are fewer harmful chemicals if any when made in the US and with this brand. For our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy this product can outlast her need to chew. I like the roll better than the bone style. With the wrapped style, she was able to rip the wrapped ends off quickly and I had to watch her carefully to make sure she did not ingest large pieces. I am sure a larger dog could quickly devour one in a setting, but for our 30 pound dog it is lasting a good while. I will most likely reorder this product again.<br /><br />I don't think there is a perfect chew toy for dogs, but this one is working out for her.

review/summary: Worth the Price but hard to find!
review/text: My cat gets a combination of wet food in the morning and dry in the evening (sometimes dry in with the wet in the morning if we don't have his normal wet food). I don't know that I would call him a picky eater but I do know that since I put him on this dry food minimal hairballs, his weight has come down (he was at 15lb now down to 11), his coat is beautiful, and the vet says he is super healthy. I did go with a cheaper, easier to find dry food when we ran out of this once before and never again! His coat got duller and hairballs galore! Now the biggest problem is actually finding this brand and specific type for him. Because he doesn't get tons of this, a 7lb bag will last at least 2 months so I don't get the bigger bag, but if you try it and only feed dry food, I would go with a larger size bag. All in all, we love it!

review/text: My cats are picky eaters, but I've never seen them completely snub a brand of food!  I mixed it with their old food so they could get used to eat, and they would literally eat everything in the bowl except for this food.  If I put a bowl of just AvoDerm out, they would not eat anything.  I thought they would eventually get desperate and try it, but they refused to even do that.<br /><br />Maybe some cats like avocado, but mine certainly don't! It was so bad, I actually had to return it (never had to do that before).

review/text: Our dog LOVED the edible bone, and the floppier brown rubber bone was a favorite for a long time.  The floppy brown bone survied her puppy teeth with almost no damage.  The white bone is really stiff and hard, almost plastic feeling, and she had no interest in it then and as she has aged, doesn't like it now either.  She ignores it completely, not even bothering to bury it in the backyard, which is her favorite thing to do with all her treats and toys.  Maybe other dogs will like it better.  2 out of 3 bones were great!

I bought the "souper" size thinking that he would take FOREVER to chew this. I had gave it to him, and at first he was a bit scared of it. Once he got started there was no stopping him. He ate 90% of it in an hour! If your looking to buy this to keep your dog busy, beware. If a small Boston can chew a "souper" size in little over an hour imagine what bigger dogs could do. For the price, I wouldnt recomend this to anyone. It's just like a "souper" size cookie.

This stuff is soooo good, I make it with milk (with water wasn't as tasty) but it is delicious! The bag doesn't come with a scoop, so I just used a big kitchen spoon (tablespoon) and I used 2 heaping spoonfuls! I have had a cup at least twice a day for about 5 days and I'm not even halfway through the bag. It is an incredible value and is Oh-So-Tasty! If I could give this product more stars I would, and also with the prime shipping it came to my door exactly when expected within 2 days! Awesome!<br /><br />Two weeks later:<br />  I have to add to this review because although I still love the product, I do not love how they increased the price and made it not prime eligible, this means with shipping I would pay more than double what I did two weeks ago!!

review/text: I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight,  I made a mint julep w the syrup. Its wasnt a HORRIBLE drink, but its not a mint julep to me. It just didnt taste like the ones Ive had. Taste combined w a shabby bottle didnt work for me.

review/summary: Incredibly delicious!
review/text: Yes it's bright green, yes it is full of sugar, but by gum is this mint syrup delicious! Like several other reviewers, I grew up in Europe where this can be considered a fairly common drink. Most caf&eacute;s in France, Belgium and even Italy will carry a mint syrup, and no, they don't use it in coffee! Add a dash (or four) to cold water (flat or sparkling) and you have created what is easily one of the most refreshing drinks imaginable. The mint tastes is not overly sugary, making it excellent as a cocktail mixer/modifier (alcoholic or virgin). Use Teisseire mint syrup to add a punch in flavor and presentation!<br /><br />I highly recommend that you give this sirop de menthe a try!!

review/text: Teisseire is a French company that still makes the best syrups out there, with no nasty ingredients in them. High quality products for at least 20 years!<br /><br />Mint syrup is my favorite, and I used to drink a ton of it when I lived in Belgium and France. Add it to ice water or, even better, to sparkling water for delicious, refreshing soft drink. Highly recommended! And if you'd like to try another flavor, get the grenadine flavor (that one can be added to vanilla ice cream for a delicious treat).

review/text: We all love Teisseire syrups in our family. I grew up in France and my grand-mother used to serve me these drinks during summer. Now, my parents bring these when they come visit from France for my kids. I love that I can find the syrups on Amazon too as they're pretty heavy to carry in a luggage! My favorite flavors are mint, grenadine and anis. These are the classic flavors but the truth is that they are all amazing. All the fruity flavors are great: strawberry, red fruit, orange, lemon, etc...

review/summary: NOT a bargain
review/text: Though many of our customers liked seeing some of the retro candies, the price is, I feel, outrageous.  Even if there were 200 pieces (as claimed, which I very much question), you're still talking over 22 cents PER CANDY. I know the days of penny candy are long gone but 22 cents per piece of candy is steep. Plus one of the 'candies' was actually a sizable quantity of cinnamon flavored toothpicks.  When is a toothpick considered candy?  If you count the individual toothpicks, then maybe you might hit 200 pieces (the toothpicks appear to number about 60 individual picks but they come in packages of 6 so, unless you're going to break open the package and dole them out one-at-a-time, you can't count that as 60 pieces of candy - especially when it doesn't even qualify as candy.)  An intriguing combination but not worth the cost.  I bought this assortment in mid-August and I still have quite a bit of it left because the customers have picked over what they liked and left much of the rest - including all those darn toothpicks.

review/summary: Pretty good for pod coffee
review/text: Life is funny sometimes.  In high school I used to make fun of shoppers outside of Nordstrom paying outrageous prices for a tiny cup of Italian style coffee.  A few years later in college I answered a help wanted ad from my local coffee stand.  I wasn't picky, work was work and helped pay for tuition and books.  The owner opened my eyes to the world of gourmet coffee, he not only introduced me to espresso he turned me on to it.<br />As part of the job we would take classes on how to make coffee and go to coffee tastings.  The appreciation of artisan made food and beverages has continued through the years.  I enjoy local bakeries, micro-brews, and regionally wineries.<br />That being said I think it is possible to get decent to good quality out of mass-marketed and pre-packaged items.  I was against pod coffee for a long while until I tried the Keurig coffee maker my girlfriend got for Christmas.  I still enjoy making coffee with fresh beans but I will occasionally enjoy a K-cup.<br />The Tully's Kona blend makes a mellow relaxed cup.  I can almost see it giving me the "hang loose" sign hearkening me back to its place of origin.

review/text: Let's face it, with so many different flavors for the Keurig machines, how do you pick the best?  Simply, trial and error.  The Tully's Coffee Kond Blend actually tastes like coffee, in addition good coffee.  My wife and I were pleasantly surprised to get a few samples of this and it quickly became our standard K-Cup.  The brew is very nice just black, or it can provide a deeper palette with some milk/sugar added.  Great coffee, great taste and great K-Cup.

review/text: I am out of this coffee and not happy about that. I forgot to order more! Now, I can say that I enjoy the coffee and don't want to recommend it because of my fear that it  will sell out before I get a chance to reorder.<br />I enjoy the bold flavor of  real coffee and the intense aroma that it has. I do not find the bitter after taste that I have found in other dark roasts. I was a little unsure of ordering the Kona because I had thought that the talk about it was just hype, well it is just darn good coffee. It may or may not appeal to you, but give it a try. It is really good.

review/summary: Oh So Bold
review/text: This is maybe more about the ad copy than the coffee.  When it's BOLD iut should say so in big letters.  Very BOLDLY stating this quality.  I was mis-lead by the medium roast into thinking this was a mild coffee and it was a great deal but it's so strong I can hardly drink it.  Of course if you like strong coffee, you'll love it.  I've tried adding a little cinnamon or a little cocoa mix to try and soften the taste but so far have not hit the right combination.  It was an excellent deal money wise but not so much for the drinkability factor

review/summary: There are better chestnut honeys
review/text: Ordered this chestnut honey a while ago and just opened. Somewhat disappointing; little, if any chestnut flavor.  If you want "very mild," perhaps you'd like.  Also very "thick," but easily corrected with 30 sec in microwave.  Much more flavor in the miele di castagno from Italy or France.  An excellent source in Piemonte is Inaudi &lt;[...]>.  Their chestnut honey #45054 is excellent and very flavorful.

review/text: This product is great & i definitely recommend it!! We loved the flavors & actually being able to make our own gum from scratch!  Mixing  in all of the powdered sugar & flavoring was a task, but we did it together as a family & had a good time.<br />I think Everyone should try this with their family or friends at least once! I'm glad I bought two packs because the kids want to do it all over again....it's worth the effort.

review/summary: Good Hot Chocolate
review/text: I am a bit of a hot chocolate snob... I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate (not too sweet, not too bitter), and have found myself searching for a good hot chocolate brand I can make at home.  I've tried so many different brands (Harry and David, William Sonoma, Ghirardelli, etc..) but nothing could satisfy  my hot chocolate cravings at home until I received a Tassimo for my birthday and tried this hot chocolate.  Its delicious, with some of my own modifications.  I don't really like it with the milk it comes with- instead, I warm up regular milk in my mug before running the chocolate into my mug.  Its an extra step, but definately worth it!

review/summary: Taste is good, but portion is too small
review/text: Milka is one of the top chocolatiers in Germany. So I was really excited to find out that they are making T-disc now as well.<br />Unfortunately I must say, that this excitement has been replaced by a kind of sober disappointment.<br />Yes, the taste is good, although a bit too sweet - I still prefer the hot chocolate from Suchard (one of the top Swiss chocolatiers ...).<br />But what really annoys the heck out of me is that you actually need two syrup discs and two milk discs to get the same amount of liquid as with the Suchard discs. In other words - there is only half as much stuff in there.<br />So either you use smaller cups (which I refuse ... I am a big man and need a big mug), or you spend twice the amount of discs to fill the usual mug. Annoying.<br />I will not buy this ever again, the Suchard stuff fits my needs much better.

review/summary: Delicious, But Wildly Overpriced
review/text: First and foremost, this is great stuff. In fact, it's one of the best tasting Tassimo products on the market -- rich, creamy...basically everything you could expect from a hot chocolate (and much better than Suchard, which is lousy and tastes synthetic). However, it's just too expensive. Run-of-the-mill powdered products such as Swiss Miss cost one tenth as much, yet are nearly as good. So unless you're a hot chocolate snob, this just isn't worth the exorbitant price premium. Great product, horrible price. Hence the 3 stars.

review/summary: Where's the Chocolate
review/text: Only two hot chocolate brands for the Tassimo and unfortunately neither one is made with real sugar.  Milka has the artificial (Sucralose) and the Suchards has HFCS.  The Milka is pretty bland with very little chocolate flavor, while the Suchards is decent.  Although, I prefer having milk in my hot chocolate, I will stay with Suchards until hopefully something better comes on the market.  I will use the rest of my Milka for Mocha Capuccinos and leave this one for the "Hot Chocolate Snobs".

review/summary: just okay
review/text: Whether you prefer the Milka or the Suchard is simply a matter of personal preference.  Personally, I didn't notice that much difference between the two.  And frankly, neither one is outstanding.  With the Milka, I had several problems.  As others have mentioned, it produces a very very small cup.  The first time I ran it through, I thought my machine had malfunctioned because there were only a few mls of chocolate.  I opened up the machine and checked out the pod and discovered that clearly half of the chocolate syrup had been left behind in the pod.  So I ran another batch of water through the same pod.  I then ran the milk pod through.  The hot chocolate is definitely not creamy.  Part of this could be that I'm always running two lots of water through the chocolate pod, but it's a fact of life with these Milka pods.  One of the other issues I have is that these pods often leak.  I'm finding chocolate syrup all over the place.  And the milk pod ALWAYS leaves milk around the pod holder.  I have to wipe the machine down every time.  Since it doesn't do this with any other milk pods I use, it therefore has to be a design flaw with the Milka pods.  I bought one package of Milka pods to try and quite honestly won't bother buying any more.  For the difference in price, the Suchard is just as good.  But my preference would be to going back to making hot chocolate the old way, not with the Tassimo.

review/summary: Sweet, somewhat thin, but perfectly prepared
review/text: The Milka Hot Chocolate is $1.24/serving. My usual approach to Hot Chocolate is to melt a small bar of Valrhona chocolate, mix in some milk, and continue heating while adding sugar to taste (depending on the type of chocolate I've chosen). The richness of the hot chocolate is controlled by the milk:chocolate ratio and the sweetness controlled by the amount of sugar. I find mixes with water to generally be too thin and of poor overall taste (e.g. Swiss Miss, Nestle, etc.)<br /><br />Here, you use your Tassimo Brewer and place two T-Discs in, one at a time, to "brew" hot chocolate - you have a syrup disc and a milk disc. You end up with a delicious appearing hot chocolate which is neither too watery nor too syrupy. The overall texture is somewhat thin compared to my homemade variety but richer than the water-based mixtures such as Swiss Miss. The taste is a solid "good." It's a little on the sweet side - my 6 year old, who prefers bittersweet chocolate, turned up his nose after a taste. I rather liked the taste. The serving size is small. My standard coffee mug ended up about half-full after going through the two-disc process.<br /><br />If you want quick and easy hot chocolate in a serving for one, this produces a superior product to the water-based mixes out there albeit at a significantly higher price point. My homemade approach is in the middle from a cost perspective, requires more cleanup and some greater investment in preparation oversight and time, but results in superior taste.

I ended up doubling the amt and adding in milk discs and needless to say it ended up one expensive drink. I'm sticking with the Suchard which is pretty darn good.

review/summary: The loser when comparing it to packet hot cocoa.
review/text: So after buying some good choices for coffee and even liking the english breakfast tea selection, I thought it would be nice to have some hot cocoa available in case company/friends didn't want coffee when visiting.  The delivery of the product is somewhat messy.  The syrup seems to make the machine struggle a bit and is dispensed in a haphazard fashion into your mug.  You do have to clean up after using this product as well as running the cleaning disk as it really shouldn't sit in the tube very long.  But all that would of been forgiven for a half-way decent tasting product.  Well sadly, the people at the test kitchen left early that day as a lot leaves to be desired for the taste of this product.  It really does taste worse then the bag versions of hot cocoa.  I am not sure how that is possible using milk and syrup, but it does.  It has terrible after taste which reminds me of using inferior sugar substitutes.  I don't hate it, just don't like it.  I will finish the product and not buy again, but wife won't touch it again.  Even if you really want to try it or think its good just to have on hand -- I wouldn't recommend at all.  I don't mind the product only making half a mug if it was only worth it.  I attached product photo as it looks promising once its made.  But that's all.

review/text: I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. The milk was sour. It looks like prepared instant milk. I could still taste it after I added about 1/3 cup of flavored creamer. The chocolate tasted like chemicals and plastic. I didn't recognize any cocoa flavor. Thankfully, Tassimo refunded me for it. I have God to thank too. For a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try the  Celestial Seasonings "Tuscanny" tea bags. Recipe: 1 bag made strong, in a tall to-go insulated mug. Remove the bag and add 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, then the hot water. Amazon sells both, but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $1.50 in a grocery store. The grocery stores used to sell this tea, but for the past year or so, I've only seen it on amazon.com.

As other reviewers have said, you can definately taste the fake sugar taste in the hot chocolate. This really bummed me out, I was hoping that the Milka would taste better than the Suchard simply because the Suchard didn't have any milk disc. I'm a firm beliver in hot chocolate should be made with milk.<br /><br />In fact, I would go so far as to say that the Milka discs do not taste much like hot chocolate at all. I don't think the Suchard discs are really that much better, but at least they taste something like hot chocolate.

This is a very good, creamy hot chocolate. It's not too sweet and it was just perfect for my taste. It's much better than most of the powder mixes I have tried and the Tassimo gives it a nice foam on top. Definitely worth a try if you are a hot chocolate lover!

review/summary: Chocolate tasted a bit weak
review/text: When I made the hot chocolate following the directions, it had a very weak chocolate flavor.  It tasted more like warm milk.  Then I tried putting some Hershey Dark Chocolate Syrup in the bottom of the cup first before using the two discs.  It came out great!  Make sure you stir it also.  After doing that, I would rate it 5 stars.
