review/summary: Great product
review/text: Works great for giving the large capsules or several regular pills at once.  The beef seem to have a better consistency than the chicken ones.  The chicken tended to be drier so it was more difficult to mold the pill pocket over the pill to seal it in.

review/text: If you have a pet that takes medication on a regular basis, you will love Pill Pockets.  Rather than prying his mouth open and jamming the pill down his throat, my dog eagerly eats his pill.  If your dog doesn't take pills regularly, I would still suggest keeping a bag of these on hand for the rare occasion.

review/summary: Greatest idea since sliced bread
review/text: We've had to give our dog pills twice a day for over a year now.  Before pill pockets, we tried everything to get him to take pills--hiding them in peanut butter, a little piece of Musketeer bar, oatmeal cake, etc.  He takes the pills without any problem whatsoever in these pockets.  Only problem is--he will only eat the beef-flavored ones; hates to duck-flavored.

review/summary: Best, best, best
review/text: Pill pockets are a LIFE-SAVER. I had a very sick dog and she took several pills three-times a day. It was a constant struggle to get them down. Until I discovered the miracle of the pill pockets. We'd tried everything before an nothing was a sustainable fix.<br /><br />Before our beloved girl passed away, we adopted a puppy and the puppy was so jealous of the pill pocket her sister was getting. The smell is overwhelmingly strong and they both would run to the kitchen when we opened the bag (seriously). I was able to potty-train our new puppy using the pill pockets as her reward. Actually, I am able to train the puppy to do anything for a pill-pocket. She jumps in her condo, goes outside, sits, stays, lays down, etc. After my girl passed, we adopted another pup and were able to train her as well using the pill pockets as treats. Mostly they are used now as a split treat when they get into their condo in the morning; I never give full pill pockets.<br /><br />So now, even though we have healthy strong dogs, I find myself stocking up on pill pockets, because they love them so much. We've had our puppies for over 16 months now and they are still eager (read: wait) to get these "treats". On weekends they will get our attention and then run and sit in their condo, hoping for a treat.<br /><br />Great product, highly recommended!

review/summary: Love these, wish they didn't have corn syrup
review/text: Other reviewers have covered the many benefits of this product.  It's a lifesaver for me as my picky dog will spit out his daily pill even if buried in peanut butter or cheese, but gulps these down.  My one complaint is that they have dried corn syrup in them.  Maybe this is necessary to keep them malleable or palatable, in which case there's nothing you can do.  But for those of us who don't brush our dogs' teeth daily, giving them corn syrup every day is not ideal.  There's still no better product out there, but if one came out without this ingredient, I'd be thrilled.

review/summary: Great for Dogs That Need a Lot of Pills
review/text: I have a couple of dogs that are getting older and need to take 2 - 3 pills twice a day.  Since the pills are large capsules, it used to be difficult to get them to take the pills.  With the Pill Pockets, I put the pills inside and they both think they are getting "treats".  I makes the whole process so much smoother.  The Pill Pockets are very piable so it's easy to mold them around the pills and capsules regardless of their shape.

review/text: The pill pockets were wonderful. I threw it in the air and had him catch and eat it. I used 2 packages before my dog, (a German Shepherd- very smart and clever animal) discovered how to eat the pocket and spit out the pill.  I was feeding him 5 pills a day so it was bound to happen, especially when he bit into the pill in the pocket which really smelled and tasted bad.

Having tried cheese, peanut butter, bread, etc, Pill Pockets are amazing--my dog LOVES them, and comes eagerly for his pill every time.  Just put the capsule in, squish the end closed, and let your pet enjoy.  These come in both chicken and beef flavor, with different sized pockets for tablets versus capsules. Thank you Greenies!

review/summary: The Only Way to Go if You Have to Give Your Dog Pills
review/text: My dogs GOBBLE these things.  They don't even care what I've got stuffed inside.  They just wolf them down and look for more.  The price offered here is a couple dollars a bag cheaper than the pet store, so these are a good deal.  They do come in two sizes.  The large ones are for capsules, and the small ones are for pills.  I just buy the large ones, as my german shepherds might take my fingers off if I only gave them a small one.  Besides, if you only have a small dog and a small pill, you can just break the pill pocket in half.  They're the consistency of soft play dough, so they're easy to mold around the pill.<br /><br />One word of warning:  Don't get the Roasted Duck flavor!  The dogs will still love them, but they stink to high heaven.  I opened the package and thought they sent me a bag of dog pooh.  It was so awful I ended up throwing them out.  The beef and chicken flavors smell very nice, so I'd stick with those.

review/text: Some of this stuff can get rather expensive but this particular brand is the most cost effective product of its kind that I have come across and it still delivers the unique and delicious flavor you are looking for.  I was a bit skeptical at first, due to the price, but after tasting it at a friend's house, I became a true believer.  Like another reviewer here, I add a dash to steamed veggies and a wee bit to some of my salad dressings and to be frank, it will tickle your tongue while knocking your socks off.  The best part is that you get all this quality and you do not have to lay awake at nights worrying about what you spent on the stuff.

My first attempt was La Tourangelle (see my review on Amazon).  You really have to work to find the truffle essence in the Tourangelle version.<br /><br />But, JR's La Truffiere is the real deal.  Pungent, garlicky, and very powerful.  I've only tried two different truffle oils, but I'll risk giving this one a five star rating since I can't imagine a better version.

If you do store it in the refrigerator you need to pull it out enough ahead that the oil can liquefy.

review/summary: Great Oil, even better price!
review/text: I've tried a few brands of truffle oil and I really haven't been able to tell the difference between qualities.  All are super pungent with that lovely aroma and taste that truffle oil brings.  I used this on salads and also to oven bake/fry potato chips (recipe to follow). The price is great which is why I bought it.  Truffle oil can get pricey quick.  Depending on how often you use it, it is great to find a economical source!  Love this stuff!<br /><br />Potato Chips:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />* 2 baking potatoes thinly sliced on a mandolin<br />* Garlic powder<br />* Salt<br />* Pepper<br />* Olive oil (75% of the mixture)<br />* Truffle oil (25% of the mixture)<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F<br /><br />2. Pour enough olive oil and truffle oil in baking pan/sheet to thinly cover entire surface area.<br /><br />3. Move pan around to coat evenly.<br /><br />4. Put pan in oven for 2-3 minutes to heat oil.  Remove pan from oven.<br /><br />5. Sprinkle desired seasonings in the oil.<br /><br />6. Place sliced potatoes in oil (will fit about 1 large potato per baking sheet).  Do not overlap!<br /><br />7. Bake for 8 minutes, flip potato slices over.<br /><br />8. Bake until done 5-8 min (continue to check as the outside ones will crisp sooner)<br /><br />9. For round 2: Reapply some oil and seasonings.  Repeat process

review/text: Pros:<br />Pungent and unmistakable aroma and smell<br />Tastes divine with truffle salt<br />Cheap for good truffle oil<br />Great pouring spout and design<br />Absolutely addictive<br /><br />Cons:<br />Absolutely addictive<br />Can become a costly habit<br /><br />In a side by side test, this oil is, imo, far better than roland's.  It's garlicy, pungent, delciious and when mixed with some truffle salt (I use fungus amongus) it tastes divine.  Also it doesn't dribble annoyingly like the Roland's does and has a dedicated spout (I bought the larger so cannot say much about the smaller).  That alone makes it better, though don't get me wrong Roland makes really good oils as well.<br /><br />On the note of size, if you like truffle oil this is habit forming and you better get the larger bottle.  Then again, because it is addictive you may want to watch your caloric intake and choose the smaller bottle.  Though if you like truffles half as much as I do you will wish you bought the larger bottle.  I am eating this with plain oatmeal to taste the difference between roland's and frankly I can't wait to try this on eggs or on mushrooms.

review/summary: Drinking truffle oil for the first time was slightly anti-climactic experience.
review/text: After reading and hearing so much about truffle oil, I have build up large expectations in my mind. As one of the few remaining, who never had truffle oil before, I did lot of asking around and checking to help me pick correct brand.<br />This one came out as one of the best and I just chose it arbitrarily.<br />I have had it on several pasta and vegetable dishes and it was interesting. Even though both taste and aroma are very intriguing, I have to admit I was expecting more.  Not sure what exactly, just that it does not seem as wildly fantastic as many people are describing.<br /><br />I am sure if I was not hyped up prior to tasting it, my experience of it would have been different, more open minded and less critical.<br /><br />I will be happy to finish the bottle, just that I have to use really only a little bit at a time, as it did have strange metallic taste when I took a sip of it.<br /><br />Obviously I am no truffle expert, this is just my personal opinion.  Once I've had other oils to compare, I will come back and write more about the comparison.

review/summary: high quality product
review/text: I was skeptical for the price and not having previous name recognition of this company but come to find out the truffle oil is very strongly and nicely perfumed. It is well worth the value, quality, and convenience over purchasing in a "gourmet market" paying 3x as much for an inferior product. This has already paid for itself and I'm only 1/10th through the bottle. Potatoes, pasta, polenta, and mushroom confit so far can't wait to drizzle this on some cauliflower soup or a simple white bean stew

review/text: Great oil. However, you'll never get the cap back on the bottle. Once you open it, the cap won't go back on. I placed the cap on top of the bottle to cover it, so next time I went to pick up the bottle, I ended up dropping it, wasting the oil.

review/summary: Excellent Taste
review/text: This oil though not from actual truffles has a fantastic aroma it is strong so only a few drops are needed to give a delicious finishing taste to sauces pizza and or whatever you want to put it on. I got the smaller bottle and I am kicking myself for not shelling out a few more bucks. Whoever is claiming that its not good or only three stars is a moron who doesn;t know anything, Once again it is not from real truffles but does taste a hell of a lot like them. Black has a pungent aroma, and the white is more sophisticated and cleaner taste.

review/text: While in university, I used to visit friends at a farm where they made jam from scratch, baked their breads and hunted for meat. Our friend Gladis was an excellent cook, and had a spread for us on weekends. After I graduated, moved away to a big city, busy life and purchased food off grocery shelves to whatever fell within arms reach...:0) Although the Smucker's jam was not bad, I decided to try the stonewall sold on amazon. I was in for a treat. Just like the good ol days..Tasted fresh, they used cane sugar, no sweetener , and it was filled with berries.Just like how they made it on the farm...

review/text: You know I've always had a question regarding these well-packaged jam jars- are you supposed to decorate these jars inside your kitchen by putting them on top of a shelf?  Are they for display purposes only?<br /><br />The reason I ask is because I'v actually seen people put these jars on a special shelf inside their kitchen and it makes me wonder if that's the MAIN reason people buy these jars- so visitors can admire them, but not to eat out of them.  Who knows?<br /><br />Either way, the jars look really nice, I love the old-fashioned label and the jam itself tastes absolutely great, but who knows if I'm supposed to feel guilty for eating out of the nice looking jars or not!

review/text: The product does have to be mixed by hand with a wooden spoon to keep the cookie chunks from being pulverized. I made the mistake of licking the spoon, it was so good I didn't even give it time to set, I just ate it like a bowl of soup. I'll be purchasing several more boxes.<br /><br />Blue Rock, however, is OUT OF ITS MIND charging in excess of $8 for a 2 oz box of pudding mix!! Even the 24 pack is a rip-off! You can get the 3oz box at Walmart for $1.09. That's two extra servings for less money, no postage and handling fee, and you don't have to wait for delivery! Shame on you Amazon!! Making an honest buck is one thing, allowing a supplier to gouging your customers is another thing entirely! Personally, I'd tell a supplier like that to set a fair price or take his business somewhere else, I sure wouldn't help him rip-off my paying customers.

review/text: This sounds like such a good idea. I bought an Oreo pie crust to turn it into an Oreo pie.<br /><br />It might have worked if Jell-O had packaged the cookie pieces separately so they could be folded into the pudding after it was mixed. But the cookie bits were already in the pudding mix. The problem is that when you mix in the milk to make the pudding, the cookie bits get completely broken apart.<br /><br />So what you end up with is GRAY pudding--GROSS. The taste is OK but it looks like a mud pie.<br /><br />Definitely not one of Jell-O's best ideas. Need to go back to the drawing board on this one.

review/summary: Fabulous, healthy treat for Dogs, $23 price is extreme
review/text: Waggin' Train's YAM GOOD is a fabulous, healthy treat for dogs that is just yam, chicken, touch of salt and sugar with vegetable gylcerin to hold it together.  It makes me feel good about giving a "treat" to my dog, who loves these snacks.  The $23 price tag is excessive in my opinion.  I found a 32oz bag of YAM GOOD at SuperWalMart last week for $15.  Wish these vendors had a better price on this great product.  I would much rather order with Amazon Prime than drive to SuperWalMart!

review/text: these are soft, french-fry shaped yam treats that I gave to a litter of seven-week old australian shepherd pups. They went for them with gusto! But, after a few minutes, three of the pups began choking--the treats were rendered very gummy when chewed and stuck to the roof of their mouths, gagging them!! Luckily, we were present and had to literally pry the stuff from their little mouths!! I shudder to think how this might have ended had we not been there to rescue them  I would NEVER recommend these treats....even for older dogs!!

I was a bit skeptical at first, due to the price, but after tasting it at a friend's house, I became a true believer.  Like another reviewer here, I add a dash to steamed veggies and a wee bit to some of my salad dressings and to be frank, it will tickle your tongue while knocking your socks off.

My first attempt was La Tourangelle (see my review on Amazon).  You really have to work to find the truffle essence in the Tourangelle version.<br /><br />But, JR's La Truffiere is the real deal.  Pungent, garlicky, and very powerful.  I've only tried two different truffle oils, but I'll risk giving this one a five star rating since I can't imagine a better version.

If you do store it in the refrigerator you need to pull it out enough ahead that the oil can liquefy.

review/summary: Great Oil, even better price!
review/text: I've tried a few brands of truffle oil and I really haven't been able to tell the difference between qualities.  All are super pungent with that lovely aroma and taste that truffle oil brings.  I used this on salads and also to oven bake/fry potato chips (recipe to follow). The price is great which is why I bought it.  Truffle oil can get pricey quick.  Depending on how often you use it, it is great to find a economical source!  Love this stuff!<br /><br />Potato Chips:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />* 2 baking potatoes thinly sliced on a mandolin<br />* Garlic powder<br />* Salt<br />* Pepper<br />* Olive oil (75% of the mixture)<br />* Truffle oil (25% of the mixture)<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F<br /><br />2. Pour enough olive oil and truffle oil in baking pan/sheet to thinly cover entire surface area.<br /><br />3. Move pan around to coat evenly.<br /><br />4. Put pan in oven for 2-3 minutes to heat oil.  Remove pan from oven.<br /><br />5. Sprinkle desired seasonings in the oil.<br /><br />6. Place sliced potatoes in oil (will fit about 1 large potato per baking sheet).  Do not overlap!<br /><br />7. Bake for 8 minutes, flip potato slices over.<br /><br />8. Bake until done 5-8 min (continue to check as the outside ones will crisp sooner)<br /><br />9. For round 2: Reapply some oil and seasonings.  Repeat process

review/text: Pros:<br />Pungent and unmistakable aroma and smell<br />Tastes divine with truffle salt<br />Cheap for good truffle oil<br />Great pouring spout and design<br />Absolutely addictive<br /><br />Cons:<br />Absolutely addictive<br />Can become a costly habit<br /><br />In a side by side test, this oil is, imo, far better than roland's.  It's garlicy, pungent, delciious and when mixed with some truffle salt (I use fungus amongus) it tastes divine.  Also it doesn't dribble annoyingly like the Roland's does and has a dedicated spout (I bought the larger so cannot say much about the smaller).  That alone makes it better, though don't get me wrong Roland makes really good oils as well.<br /><br />On the note of size, if you like truffle oil this is habit forming and you better get the larger bottle.  Then again, because it is addictive you may want to watch your caloric intake and choose the smaller bottle.  Though if you like truffles half as much as I do you will wish you bought the larger bottle.  I am eating this with plain oatmeal to taste the difference between roland's and frankly I can't wait to try this on eggs or on mushrooms.

review/summary: Drinking truffle oil for the first time was slightly anti-climactic experience.
review/text: After reading and hearing so much about truffle oil, I have build up large expectations in my mind. As one of the few remaining, who never had truffle oil before, I did lot of asking around and checking to help me pick correct brand.<br />This one came out as one of the best and I just chose it arbitrarily.<br />I have had it on several pasta and vegetable dishes and it was interesting. Even though both taste and aroma are very intriguing, I have to admit I was expecting more.  Not sure what exactly, just that it does not seem as wildly fantastic as many people are describing.<br /><br />I am sure if I was not hyped up prior to tasting it, my experience of it would have been different, more open minded and less critical.<br /><br />I will be happy to finish the bottle, just that I have to use really only a little bit at a time, as it did have strange metallic taste when I took a sip of it.<br /><br />Obviously I am no truffle expert, this is just my personal opinion.  Once I've had other oils to compare, I will come back and write more about the comparison.

review/summary: high quality product
review/text: I was skeptical for the price and not having previous name recognition of this company but come to find out the truffle oil is very strongly and nicely perfumed. It is well worth the value, quality, and convenience over purchasing in a "gourmet market" paying 3x as much for an inferior product. This has already paid for itself and I'm only 1/10th through the bottle. Potatoes, pasta, polenta, and mushroom confit so far can't wait to drizzle this on some cauliflower soup or a simple white bean stew

review/text: Great oil. However, you'll never get the cap back on the bottle. Once you open it, the cap won't go back on. I placed the cap on top of the bottle to cover it, so next time I went to pick up the bottle, I ended up dropping it, wasting the oil.

review/summary: Excellent Taste
review/text: This oil though not from actual truffles has a fantastic aroma it is strong so only a few drops are needed to give a delicious finishing taste to sauces pizza and or whatever you want to put it on. I got the smaller bottle and I am kicking myself for not shelling out a few more bucks. Whoever is claiming that its not good or only three stars is a moron who doesn;t know anything, Once again it is not from real truffles but does taste a hell of a lot like them. Black has a pungent aroma, and the white is more sophisticated and cleaner taste.

review/summary: Farewell Old Friend - Exciting UPDATES below original post
review/text: ORIGINAL POST (September 26, 2010):<br /><br />I used to buy several bags of Chocolate Twizzlers at a time, because otherwise I wouldn't be able to eat any as they were gobbled up quickly by my family. The new version is gummy and nasty tasting and no one in my family will eat them. In fact, I had to throw out two one pound bags.<br /><br />UPDATE (December 22, 2011):<br /><br />Today I received a reply to a letter that I had written to The Hershey Company a while ago about the changes in the taste and consistency of Chocolate Twizzlers. The letter dated December 14, 2011 held exciting news, "Based on consumer comments like yours, we decided to change the product back to the classic twist".  The letter also stated that the bags to look for will have a message stating, "Now in the Classic Twist".<br /><br />Hurrah, Huzzah, Yippee, Yahoo!!!  Thanks ever so much to the wonderful people at Hershey's for bringing back the Chocolate Twizzlers I love and adore : )<br /><br />UPDATE (August 15, 2012)<br /><br />Just purchased 2 bags of Classic Twist Chocolate Twizzlers at Weis Market - they taste just like original chocolate Twizzlers, so I can add them back on the weekly goodie list : )

review/summary: Not something you'd eat for every meal, but not bad tasting.
review/text: I am one who loves very strong flavors and a lot of spice in my food.  With that in mind, This sauce was incredibly rich tasting. Very creamy, with a distinctive taste of coconut.  It's not the same as taking a mouthfull of fresh coconut or drinking coconut milk, but you can discern the sweet coconut flavor.  I made Chicken and shrimp Korma last night, using extremely thin sliced chicken breast (the kind of cut most oriental places put in their moo goo pai pan and other chicken dishes)  The shrimp was 31-40 count.  I added some fresh steamed veggies to the mix as well, and put it on a bed of Basmati rice.  I heated the sauce, dumped it over top, and served it family style.<br /><br />I thought the combination of the sauce with chicken, shrimp, AND veggies all worked, so its a versatile sauce.  I think it might go well with just about any meat or veggie option.  It did wear on my towards the end of the dish, however, due to the richness.  I would have prefered a bit stronger garam masala flavor, so I compensated and added a little into the sauce.  I won't be making this all the time, but every once and a while its a refreshing taste in indian cooking.  I still think I'll stick to Patak's vindaloo paste.  That's become a staple in my house when I'm not in the mood to make curry pastes from scratch.

We still got a few bites, but not nearly as many as the night we went out without it.<br /><br />There is another review saying this is not DEET.  That is 100% incorrect.  This is 23% DEET, which is a high as you will find in most normal bug sprays.  It is good idea to wash it off after you come back inside or some people might have a reaction to the high DEET content.  Not for little kids.<br /><br />The spray bottle works very well.
