review/text: Born in New Orleans and growing up at Cafe Du Monde, my son now lives in Denver, but MUST have this coffee!<br />It is a simple, meaningful "all-occasion" gift, to purchase and have shipped to him, as he cannot purchase in Denver.  AMAZON.com does a fantastic job hadling this for me and keeping my awesome son happy! HE ALSO THINKS THAT I GO TO A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR HIM (which does not hurt my image one bit)!!

review/text: Having never been but having a fascination with NOLA, I was dying to try the world famous coffee. I ordered one canfrom the CdM website itself, but when it came time to order again, I found these were a little bit cheaper and quicker to ship. I was not disappointed and this is already on my list to buy again.

review/text: I love Honey Bunches of Oats and have been a fan for years. Of all the varieties out there, I prefer this pecan version the best. It seems to be slightly less sugary tasting than the original, and more flavorful than the almond version. The pecans are delicious. Overall, this is a fantastic everyday cereal. Its light and flakey, yet satisfying so you don't feel hungry again in an hour. Easily my favorite cereal.

review/summary: It's Really a Cookie!
review/text: These are tasty and I am enjoying one with my morning coffee break while I write this, but reading the nutrition facts and the ingredients list on the package, I have to think that this is more of a tasty and somewhat healthy cookie than a substitute for breakfast. According to the package, a serving is four biscuits which adds up to 230 calories. Though that includes 4 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, it also includes 13 grams of sugar and 8 grams of fat.<br /><br />They are good, tasting like a nice butter cookie with a blueberry smell and a hint of blueberry flavor. Still, I think I'll be more likely to have one from time to time as a little treat with my morning coffee or after dinner than to substitute a package for breakfast. I'd more likely chose a low-fat fruit yogurt which would have more than twice the protein, less sugar and fat, and less calories.

Now I'm an addict, and why?  ...because these are just that good.  They have just enough smack of jalapeno-zip and a good squeal of cheese in them.  So good I had to write this review, finding it difficult because the tears of joy streaming down my face.  I think I'm suffering from my own kind of PTSD (Product Tested: Super Delicious!!!).

The good smoked taste of ham blended with the rich sweetness of the honey brings back fond memories of Sunday dinners at Grandma's house. Not too smokey, not too sweet... these ham sticks have a pleasant, satisfying taste. They are also a quick, tasty snack when friends drop in - I cut the sticks in bite sized pieces and served them with a dipping mustard. Everyone loved them! These yummy ham sticks are going to be regulars at our football parties.

review/text: I was introduced to this product in 2003 when I visited Croatia. I fell in love with it while there and purchased Fant seasoning to bring home with me. I loved it so much I just had to find a place selling it here in the States and voila...Amazon had it. In spite of the high shipping cost for these light weight packets, I ordered them. I am not sorry either. If you haven't tried them..buy it. Soak chopped garlic in 8 oz. of water for a few hours, add only the water to the chopped meat, add the seasoning mix and allow the mixture to meld for several hours, if time permits. Shape the meat into sticks or patties, fry and serve with pepper spread and chopped onions. I also serve a chibatta roll with the meal...yummy and this is the way the woman from Croatia taught me to do it. Yummy, yummy.

review/text: I was torn between this Amoretti or 3 times the quantity for the same price with Torani.  I am so happy I went with Amoretti.  I love my Peppermint Mocha's but at $4 a pop they get expensive, fast.  I've had the Torani at local cafe shops and thought it tasted really sugary, not quite like peppermint.  The Amoretti is like having a candy cane in your drink.  It's similar to Starbucks, but in my opinion just a tad bit better.  I'd never heard of nor used Amoretti but now I'm a huge fan and plan to buy more!

I had questions about some of their products and found their customer service to excellent, very helpful. I purchased the Peppermint.  It is not too sweet, just the right taste of peppermint.  I can now make my Peppermint Mocha coffee at home as this tastes much better than the famous brand and lots less calories!  I can't wait to taste additional products from this company.

review/text: After speaking with Paul from Amoretti Company, we need to understand how to use this product. This product isn't like any other syrup that is high in high fructose corn syrup. It's very concentrated with flavor with much less sweetness. If you like to have your drink more sweetness, add sugar to your drink, not syrup because the drink will be too much concentrated with the flavor.  Based on pumpkin spice syrup calorie, 1 serving amoretti is 30 calories compared any other brand syrup 1 serving is 100 calories.<br />This product definitely is a healthier choice of syrup for your coffee or desert. I will definitely will try more of their products and recommend this to my friends

review/summary: Corn Crunch-Ems = Yes-Ems
review/text: I used to get this cereal for my dad at our neighborhood supermarket and although it was pricey, he really loved it so it was worth it.  I never thought to look on Amazon for cereal until our supermarket no longer carried it.  Much to my delight, I found it on Amazon, ordered it and the best part is that the price was unbelievable and it qualified for free shipping.<br /><br />This cereal is delicious!  It tastes great and is made with natural ingredients.  My dad loves it and since he has recently been placed on a restrictive diet, it's awesome to find a cereal that is good for him AND delicious!!  I eat it as well and sometimes find myself snacking on it even without any milk.<br /><br />Corn Crunch-Ems is highly recommended.

review/text: Cheez Waffies have been my most favorite, processed cheese-food snack since I can remember. The cheez flavor is overwhelmingly bad for you, but satisfies the most persnickety of "bad for you" food cravings. They are only for the true lover of fake cheese and waffle crisps. Don't be fooled with the cheaper Cheese Waffles also offered on Amazon. They won't satisfy like these will.

review/summary: The cheesiest cheese snack ever!
review/text: You cannot find Cheese Waffies anywhere. It used to be that mini-marts would carry them. Then only truck stops. Now the Internet was invented just to provide a portal to obtain a Cheese Waffie fix. I guess the PC food police have run Cheese Waffies off the shelves. The waffle shell is crunching and cheesy. You can pull them apart like an Oreo and eat them in parts. Or nibble them slowly. Lastly, you can be a glutton and eat them whole. Any way you eat a Cheese Waffie, you will get lots of salty cheese pleasure. Go ahead, splurge. Run that extra mile tomorrow. But when you are watching football or just home alone (they are not meant for sharing), lay back in that lounge chair and enjoy each incredible bite. Try them and see what a Cheese Waffie addiction really is all about.

Some may be revolted, but I like it a lot. And the waffie crackers are just wonderful; light, crunchy, mmmmm-um!<br /><br />My 8 unit pack came nicely packaged and fully intact.

review/text: The box arrived today- haphazardly taped together with a huge part of the box missing, and paper crumbled around a plastic grocery bag full of the 8 bags of Cheez Waffies (NOT a factory box).... The bag was tied shut, and the bags of the snacks were a bit rumpled, but amazingly, the first bag I've opened has intact Cheez Waffies.  The expiration date is for February 2013 (it's September 2012 now)- so more than acceptable.<br /><br />Many of the 'sandwiches' have fallen apart, and are missing their matching 'waffle', but they are whole halves- if that makes sense. Naturally there are some broken pieces, but not an abnormal amount.  I don't think they taste like Old London-but they're close enough to get by.  I can't find anything around here that comes close, so I'm glad to have them.

review/text: I have done lots of home baking, to include homemade pretzels.  I did not enjoy making them - it required excessive time and work and the results were only marginal.<br /><br />I bought this product at WalMart and thought I would just try it because my family likes Auntie Anne's.  I was very pleased!  The kit was simple to use, directions were clear, and the results were delicious.  My kids enjoyed making them.  We were not terribly precise when proportioning and shaping the pretzels, but it did not make any difference; the pretzels baked without any problems.<br /><br />I recommend this kit for anyone who enjoys soft pretzels.  You do not need extensive baking experience, as the kit is simple.  It makes a fun weekend family activity.  Most teens would be able to do this kit themselves, with just some oven safety oversight, creating a unique snack for sleepovers.<br /><br />I am glad Amazon stocks this item - it is a great gift surprise!

The results were unbelievable... every bit as good as the Auntie Anne in the malls, maybe even better, because you eat them as soon as they come out of the oven.  We halved the ingredients so we could do it twice and wouldn't end up with pretzels that didn't get eaten.  And there was more than enough for the 4 of us.  Highly recommend... just look for the best price!

review/text: First off, this is available at your local supermarket (we bought it at Walmart for $5).  We decided to give it a try today and was quite surprised that the boxes 4 easy steps isn't at all true.  You get a sheet with the steps.  They range from a 30 minute wait to let the dough rise to making the pretzels and being told to mix a packet of baking soda in hot water and having to dip pre-made pretzels in the solution which makes them super soft and the stretch immediately.  After making them we both agreed that they tasted exactly like a pillsbury croissant that you can get in the tube and roll out for $2.  Needless to say, we were very disappointed.  We love our Auntie Anne's pretzels when we travel or go to our local mall but at home - this is not worth it.<br /><br />I will say, we had enough dough leftover for two medium sized thin crust pizzas which we froze for a future trial as a pizza dough.  Hopefully that works out well.

review/summary: Burn baby burn
review/text: I bought this sauce primarily to bring to work and pass around to my coworkers and boy did we have fun with it.  I knew I couldn't handle the heat of this sauce as I find Habanero sauces are usually just a bit too hot for me but there were a couple of my coworkers that powered through the burn impressively.  The first thing a few of us did was the toothpick tip test and fingertip drop test.  I did the toothpick test and drew a line of the sauce across my tongue.  The heat wasn't immediate but I began salivating like mad.  The heat built into what felt like a paper cut across my tongue, way too hot for me.  Others who did small drops could feel exactly where the sauce was as it found it's way down their throats.  You definitely want to try this sauce in small amounts before taking on a full serving.<br /><br />Then there was George; he's used to hot foods and without even testing it, put a river down the length of his pizza slice.  Those who tasted it gathered around to see the show.  He did remarkably well and said it was good, he did end up with puffy eyes and was coughing but he came out of the whole thing looking pretty well considering the amount he used.  I asked him the next day "how'd that feel later on George?" and he just grinned.<br /><br />Then there was Enrique, he did the toothpick test and proclaimed it "muy bien" and ended up taking it with him to eat his lunch and it came back less full and he looked no worse for the wear.  I do know that it made him cough though when he first tried it but I suspect Enrique eats Habanero peppers whole.<br /><br />Bottom line, this sauce is likely far too hot for most people but it sure is an adventure even in tiny doses.  It made a fun day in the office and a couple of guys actually enjoyed the flavor and the sauce with their food.  I can't personally tell you how good the flavor is because I just can't handle it; but those that truly tried it said it was pretty good.<br /><br />5 stars for performance and fun.

review/summary: Hot? Yes! But SWEET, also!
review/text: I've eaten raw habeneros and wow!  Eating a blob of this stuff on a corn chip reminded me of some of my first experiences with those peppers. (And yes, I know - these are bhut jolokia, NOT habenero) I've grown my own bhut jolokias and tried them as well, and the kick you get from this sauce is pretty much the same.  Heat aside, the flavor of this sauce is EVEN SWEETER than habenero, if you can believe that! (I often describe to others that are unfamiliar with the taste of raw habenero the sweetness encountered when eating them [if you can get past the heat] of milk chocolate for comparison) Extremely sweet, truly a "gourmet" sauce, but about as hot as I care to enjoy.  The only sauce I've had hotter was one of the Mad Dog sauces at a Firehouse Subs sandwich shop.  I think I asked them for the behind the counter hottest sauce they had.  Anyway, back to this sauce...<br /><br />It gave me the hickups when I tried it (one sure sign of a very hot sauce).<br />It has a sweet, smooth taste, and a slow burn.  I'd say it takes about 3 seconds for the burn to really kick-in. It is nice, and you want more, but how much can you handle?  ...<br />On a personal heat rating scale of 1-10, 10 being the hottest I can really handle, and 1 being a cabbage, I'd give this a solid 8, maybe a 9.  But it's not "I'm going to kill somone this is so hot!" hot.  It's super hot, really smooth, VERY SWEET tasting, and possibly addictive.  Hot pepper heads should love it.  But if you want "the hottest thing since lava" type of sauce, this is not it.  Look perhaps at "The Source Hot Sauce"...Easily 7 times hotter than this one.

review/summary: WOW!!!
review/text: I recieved my bottle of Dave's ghost pepper sauce today. I opened it and like all other sauces I made a bowl of beef ramen and added a teaspoon of this sauce to it. That was my first mistake. This sauce is hotter then the other two ghost pepper sauces I've had. And I do mean this sauce bit hard. The second mistake was not realizing that this sauce is thick, not watered down, so it sticks around a second. So not only was my mouth on fire but it was on fire for much too long. This sauce has great flavor and it's consistancy makes it's burn stick with you for a bit. This is definately the hottest sauce I've eaten so far. A must have for the guy or gal that must have HOT hot sauce.

review/summary: Nice burn, bad individual taste
review/text: Alright, maybe it is just me, but I don't care for the flavor by itself too much.<br /><br />I originally tried some with burritos by pouring some in the beans and mixing it, and then by pouring some extra right inside the burrito after getting it together. How was it? The heat was excellent. It wasn't something I couldn't handle, it was rather enjoyable. Don't misunderstand me, it was most certainly hot, but it wasn't unbearably so (not to me anyway, and nobody else in my family has tried it thus far).<br /><br />After the burritos, and having put everything away, I decided to try about a teaspoon of the sauce by itself.<br /><br />Alright, this time it felt hotter (particularly as some of it got on the back of my throat)... it was enough to cause me to hiccup... but, and this is the reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5, the flavor just wasn't there... I really didn't like it by itself.<br /><br />So my suggestion to anyone buying this sauce: use it in a way that doesn't involve you tasting it by itself... mixed with beans in a burrito, toss some in a pan with some roasted garlic and spices to change up the taste, do whatever, but I can't recommend it in a way that gives you the direct flavor of the sauce. Some sauces are great by themselves, without other things to cover their tastes, but this isn't one of them... although it is great for giving a burger or burrito a nice kick

review/summary: Great extreme hot sauce
review/text: I love Dave's Ghost Pepper hot sauce.<br /><br />Most of the time when I make chili, I make myself an extremely hot pot of chili which involves adding at at least a dozen serranos and habaneros.  The flavor is amazing.  But I have to make a second pot for the rest of the family who won't eat anything that spicy.<br /><br />When I do not have time, or the local supermarket is short on peppers, Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper edition is the next best thing.  I add about a dime size drop to my bowl of chili and it brings up the heat right to where I like it, and also adds a very pleasant smokey flavor to boot!  I should say that I like it hot, and most people would use only a drop or two for a bowl of chili of the same size.<br /><br />While this is an extreme hot sauce with a good amount of extract, the taste is quite passable, especially for what it is.  Obviously if you eat enough at one time, you will taste extract but in use enough, you will taste extract, but it's hot enough where you don't need to use that much as a little bit will heat up your bowl of chili or salsa and add a very pleasant smoky flavor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.  But also, be careful.  Use too much and you'll be sorry.  This is a hot sauce where one drop may be enough.

review/text: This sauce is great.  There are a lot of ghost chili pepper sauces but this one has heat and flavor.  I don't use it directly unless I am adding to soups or chili but warning, you only need drops.  If you have not purchased it, I recommend you tooth pick test it first.<br /><br />I add  mine to Texas Pete's with a little garlic power, some ginger and other spices to make a nice custom blend hot sauce.  I highly recommend using a few drops into your own store sauce versus using from the bottle.  Unlike some of the other ghost chili sauces, especially those darker pepper sauces, this one does not have the bitter taste that can ruin your custom sauce blends.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Many times the Jalapeno peppers are too mild to give us what we want.

review/summary: Almost hot enough
review/text: This sauce is hot enough that there is almost no "taste" besides hot, and it is INDEED hot.  I use about a TBS on a food plate, but for me that's too much.  I was looking for something so hot I could barely use any of it, maybe a TSP at a time MAX.  SO insofar as hot, this isn't as hot as I wanted.  That being said, 90% of the population will find it TOO hot.  I don't use a sauce like this everyday, for me that's Frank's Red Hot or Tabasco Green, but when you are craving something to really kick it up, or looking to light up your Chili this is solid.  My only gripe is that for the price I was looking for something closer to a ghost pepper extract.

review/text: I ordered a LARGE birthday bouquet (that was supposed to come with a birthday balloon) for my daughter's birthday. Did not show up until almost 6:00 pm day of delivery. Was most definitely not a large bouquet. Was a small bouquet in a cup that said "get real" on the front (seriously, lol), and no balloon. Called 1-800 flowers, and was hung up on twice. Once by someone named Anne and again by someone named Carl. Finally got someone named Tracy. She said she would send another bouquet out the next day (UH, LITTLE LATE, NOT DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY ANYMORE). Sent another one, better, but still not what ordered. Still was not a LARGE bouquet (as stated in the description), and no balloon. She had also said she would refund my full amount paid, she only refunded half of it. Was not a good experience AT ALL, and it was for my daughter's 16TH birthday, I wanted it to be special for her. Not at all happy with this company. I will never order from them again, and especially not if it is for a special occasion. AWFUL EXPERIENCE.

review/summary: The "boys" love it!
review/text: I have two cats that are very hard to shop for regarding wet food, well one specifically.  One is very finicky and the other will eat anything.  After finally finding a brand + flavor that Mr. Finicky will eat, the price shot up to almost double what it has been the past few years.  I tried several new brands with the biggest deciding factor being that they both prefer "paste" (pate) over shreds, slices or chunks.  I do want to mention that they both loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RJE6M0">Halo Spot's Pate for Cats Grain-Free Ground Chicken, 5.5oz/12 Cans</a>, it was just too expensive and defeated the purpose of switching brands due to the prior favorite's price increase.<br /><br />I bought this variety pack to see how "the boys" took to it and they actually loved every flavor which in itself is shocking!  A prior review mentioned this as "kitty crack" and I have to agree!  Also, there weren't even any litter issues after switching to this brand (boy oh boy can that be bad when you change their food!).<br /><br />These pate-only kitties even eat the shreds once they get to the bottom of the food.  Thumbs and paws up for Meow Mix on this new food!

review/text: This is a dog treat, not dog food. It is made with high quality ingredients in a USDA inspected plant. The meat ingredients are beef and chicken. This really does look and smell like real jerky. Our son lost his Australian Shepherd to the tainted Chinese Dog Food, and we buy the highest quality food and treats for our dog. This appears made in Albany Oregon. Per container, suggested daily servings per day run from 1/4 to 1 piece for a dog under 10 pounds, to 5 to 6 pieces for a dog over 70 pounds. I counted about 28 pieces in a 4 ounce bag. So costwise, it can get expensive for a large dog, but is inexpensive for smaller dogs. I have a 70 pound Chow Chow, and use it as a treat to get him in the house. Would also be a good training treat.

Well, I didn't eat one and don't plan to anytime soon so I'll just assume by the rapid tail-wagging these treats taste great, too. These treats remind me of the pressed jerky strips you find in country stores. Again, the texture is chewy. I hold the treat between my thumb and forefinger so my dogs can nibble away instead of swallowing it whole.<br /><br />We're long-time subscribers of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR41KQ">Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats</a>, ordering them through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. High-quality ingredients are very important to us.

review/summary: Dog loves them!
review/text: These treats are made with USDA inspected beef, and appear to be a cut above the bones you would find boxed up at your local grocery store. They come in a plastic resealable pouch. Each treat is reasonably sized at about 1.5 inches long and about 1/4 of an inch wide. Pretty much any dog, regardless of size, can fit these in their mouth easily and chow down. They look like little bits of beef jerky (one could seriously mistake them for human food -- good for practical jokes, perhaps?) Given their small size, you can give your dog a fair number during the day; the recommended number for a dog over 70 pounds (I have a golden-retriever mix) is 5 - 6. If, for some reason, your dog has trouble chewing harder treats, the soft, chewy consistency of these is a plus.<br /><br />My dog seems to like these more than his normal biscuits (Milkbone brand). As soon as I opened up the tear strip on the package, he was jumping up and down in front of me, eagerly awaiting a beef strip. Naturally, it's impossible to tell how much he liked them, but I'd say it's safe to assume that he really enjoyed them. It's also worth noting that he hardly gets excited for a standard biscuit, so these must smell and taste really appetizing. These seem to have a more pungent, welcoming aroma than regular biscuits -- they smell like human food, probably as a result of using USDA inspected beef and not leftover cuts. I'd reckon that these would be a great training tool for younger dogs, if my[...] golden retriever's reaction is anything to go by! Overall, these treats are a little bit expensive, but the quality is definitely there. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Picky Pooch Scarfs These Treats
review/text: I have 3 dogs - 2 will eat anything and 1 is a VERY selective eater who rejects about 85% of the treats we've tried with her.  This picky pooch went into hoard mode with these treats, she ran to her crate and ate it in privacy away from the other two dogs and then came back to ask for more.  I'd say it was a success.<br /><br />Typically we try to avoid treats and dog foods with any sort of corn product or too many spices which is why I was a bit turned off by reading that corn syrup was listed pretty high in the ingredients, but it could be worse.  For the occasional treat, these area actually pretty high end and big treats.<br /><br />The only thing that really concerned me was the waft of chemical smell that I got when I opened the bag.  I am not sure if that is the fault of the packaging or the product.  It's been about 3 days since we've given these treats and the dogs have had no adverse side affects, so I'm thinking it might just be the packaging? Or maybe the liquid smoke was too unnatural smelling, I don't know.  The dogs didn't mind.  :)<br /><br />The pieces are really big, so we can cut them down into thirds for the two small dogs and give the whole thing to the bigger dog.

review/text: When I opened up this bag of treats, my dog was so impressed with the smell that she came running from another room. I have to admit that I gave the treats a taste first because they look like good quality, thick beef jerky. And it does indeed taste like people-grade beef jerky. I'm not really sure why I'm feeding this to my dog and not to me because it is quite good with a nice beefy, smokey flavor.<br /><br />My dog gobbled up the treat with glee and hoped for more. Since my dog has a sensitive stomach and often gets sick from dog treats, I was hoping I'd not made a big mistake. But she was just fine. She loved the treats, they're good enough for me, and they didn't make her sick.<br /><br />Ingredients: beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (preservative), paprika oleoresin, and sodium nitrate (preservative).<br /><br />I have to admit, that I'm not impressed with the corn syrup, but these are still better than most dog treats.

Of course, the dog eats just about everything but at least these seem more healthy than standard dog treats found in the store.  Also, they are a little bit tougher than regular jerky treats so the small size does not upset my dog.  It takes a bit longer for her to chomp through them so they weork great as a treat and a control method from overfeeding her everytime she begs for a treat.

review/text: My dogs really liked these soft meaty treats.  They are small (the treats-not the dogs!), which makes them great for snacking but they are also easily cut into tiny pieces suitable for training.  They come in a re-sealable pouch to help them stay soft and chewy.

review/text: Bit-O-Luv Bistro Beef Recipe Dog Treats look and smell like a high end product, and my dog Fred swears it tastes great.  It makes a fun 'once a day if you're a really great dog treat,' but thanks to the corn syrup, we're not talking health food here.<br />However, the words 'made in the USA without any by-products' and 'chicken and beef USDA inspected' were just what I wanted to hear.<br />So five stars for a fun, occasional treat whose safety I shouldn't have to worry about.
