review/summary: A truly versatile flour mix
review/text: This bread mix makes great tasting bread and the flour mixture works well in most recipes.  The flour can be used cup for cup to replace wheat flour.  I have even used it to make homemade egg noodles.  It has the right consistency and texture for noodles and other bread products.  No beany taste as in some other flour blends.

review/summary: Good Bread in Two Hours Plus Five
review/text: Gluten free living can be depressing if you let it. Pamela's Bread Mix and Flour Blend makes bread tasty enough to feed to people with "normal" diets. It takes about five minutes to mix it with a good stand mixer. Pour it into a prepared loaf pan, let it rise in a warm place for an hour, and bake it in a pre-heated oven for an hour. It tastes much better than what you buy from the shelf. After 18 years gluten free, this is my choice for bread.

review/text: This is by far some of the tastiest bread that you can make for either yourself or your family.  You might need to make the bread several times until you fully grasp the recipe and get everything right, which is perfectly normal.  It's normal to make mistakes the first few times.  Making bread isn't as easy as it looks because the loaf tends to fall apart.  That's why putting effort into bread-making requires determination and skill.

review/text: I found Pamela's Baking Mix on Amazon and was so excited because it is much cheaper than at my health food stores. Our daughter was recently diagnosed with a Gluten allergy and buying gluten free bread is ridiculously expensive. We tried other recipes for bread, but they were only so-so. This mix makes a delicious bread that tastes like fresh homemade regular bread! And most importantly? Our daughter loves it, too!

review/summary: Amazing Indeed
review/text: My wife has been gluten free or close to it for several years now. We have tried several brands of gluten free breads and bread mixes, including some from companies that make other excellent gluten free products. This is the best by far. It creates a loaf that is hearty, yet remains soft. Other breads we tried would get hard and the only way to eat them was to heat each slice in the microwave. The bread that this mix makes is just delightful. In fact - gluten free isn't even the main reason to get it. It's just about the best bread you can get of any type. It is sooooo yummy.

review/summary: I really like it; handling gas issues
review/text: I really like it, the taste and texture are excellent.  When cut into chunks, oiled and toasted it works well as rusks in onion soup and seems to hold together about as well as wheat bread does.  I've been using the 19oz packets with a bread machine, switching to the larger packets.<br /><br />A big plus for me:  I'm sensitive to corn and this mix is corn-free, unlike many others.  For ingredients see pamelasproducts.com.<br /><br />Some people mention stomach-ache; the main downside of this mix for me is problems with gas (subtract one-half star).  I was able to greatly reduce that with a digestive enzyme (Houston Enzymes TriEnza).  Might also be worth checking whether you are sensitive to particular ingredients.

review/summary: Pamela's Flours are great!
review/text: If you're tired of buying expensive and tiny loaves of gluten free bread, this is a great alternative. Its a little bit sweeter than I would make it if I were mixing it myself, but for the convenience, it still makes a great loaf of gluten free bread! I make two loaves at a time. Let them cool completely, and then slice them using a bread knife. I use folding (not zipping) sandwich bags, two slices per bag... slip the "flap" between the slices and fold the top over. Store these in a larger zip lock bag in the freezer. This keeps the bread easy to "grab and go" or thaw as much or as little as you need. Keeping the bread frozen keeps it "fresh" and moister than storing in the refrigerator. The bread has a good texture and doesn't fall apart if you use it for sandwiches or a make-shift hamburger bun. Enjoy!

review/summary: Fantastic Bread you would never know it is GF
review/text: My husband became allergic to gluten a few years ago, and it has been difficult to understand how to re formulate the diet so it tastes good and is GF.  The (frozen) rice bread is just aweful and tastes like cardboard.  I started looking around at bread mixes to use with my bread maker, and Pamele's is the best out there. I was happy to find the larger bread mix bag, as it is much more economical.  Anyone that has had to follow a GF diet can relate to the confusion, need to read every label in detail, and higher cost !! as most of the GF items are in the specialty / organic area.

review/summary: Wonderful GF bread!
review/text: Well, let me tell you first that I was VERY skeptical of "gluten-free"  (How good can THAT be?)  The very thought... Yuk! Several of my friends are already "gluten free" and one, in particular makes her own rice flour.  I'm not so creative as that, and the work.... oh, my!  This is so easy!  I was pleasantly surprised that this bread turned out so wonderful, that I've given bags of it to friends and my daughter who is SO allergic to any food that she literally gets sick on everything.  She hasn't tried it yet, and I am hoping after a few weeks on her new diet she'll be able to actually eat this.  There is an egg-free recipe on the package, which is what she'll do when she can.  I will be buying more of this bread.  So easy.  Everything is right in the package, even the yeast, and it turns out to be a great sandwich bread.  Of course, it is not as airy as store-bought bread, but it's a whole lot healthier being it is whole grain, without the gluten, of course!

review/text: Basicly LOOKS like bread, has the texture of bread - but it is really difficult to get past the fact that it tastes terrible.  Even with the best condiments to mask over the flavor, it shines through tasting something like fish, the smell of windex, dust and sugar.  Honestly. I have made it 3 times now, wondering if it was just my technique, but no.  Sad - because the pancake baking mix is excellent, and I had my hopes up about the bread.

This product by far has made my life so much easier.  When making GF bread from scratch, it usually has many steps involved and many different ingrediants.  With Pamelas products, its so simple.  When making the bread, I do recommend using a stand mixer though.  The bread is moist and stays moist even 4 days after I have made it.  Freezes well.  Pamelas website has additional recipes I have used, using her bread mix.  My kids feel like they are eating "real food" again. I have also tried her GF pancake mix.....the best by far.

I tried a couple of name brands, meant to specifically address these issues and they weren't working well for him, and he hated the taste. On a whim I saw this in the grocery store and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. Since using this he hasn't had the issues he had with the others and he never refuses his bottle now. Would highly recommend and have approached a store to recommend they carry it too.

review/summary: Artificial tasting. Yuck
review/text: I purchased Emergen-C Acai Berry instead of my usual Super Orange, because this was on sale. Not a good substitute at all!! This flavor tastes much more artificial, like a too sweet candy that leaves a weird chemically aftertaste.  I like Super Orange, because it has a noticeable, yet not overwhelming, flavor...Bottom line is that I will not be purchasing this flavor again. Yuck.

review/summary: Much love for Emergen-C!
review/text: I was buying individual packets of these at Whole Foods and I thought I'd check the price at Amazon. I'm really glad I thought to do that...I am now saving 66% over what I was paying before. The only negative is that I have to get 30 of the same flavor, instead of one mangosteen, one dragon fruit, one cranberry-pomegranate, etc. BUT the Acai Berry flavor is pretty good so I don't mind too much.<br />I actually use this as part of a whole drink I make. This is the recipe:<br /><br />Vitamin C Bomb<br /><br />juice of two limes<br />1 packet of Emergen-C, any flavor<br />1 heaping teaspoon ascorbic acid (I buy it by the 3# container here on amazon)<br />2 droppers-full of apricot stevia liquid (it's made by Sweetleaf and also here on amazon)<br />A splash of Rejuvelac<br /><br />Put all that in a 24 oz mason jar, add some ice, fill with water and shake it up so the ascorbic acid dissolves.<br /><br />Oh yeah and also, I went to the Emergen-C website and found you could fill out a form to get a free sample. Probably not going to be doing that forever, but as I write this they will send you a free sample if you're willing to give them your name/address. Woot!

It's more exciting than the orange or the lemon-lime, although I like those too.

So, they've doubled the price AND told me that my subscription is unavailable. I did give a five star review for this product but I've changed it to one star because of this racket pricing scheme. btw I've read other reviews that were suprised that this is a "fizzy drink." Anyone who's ever used Emergen-C knows this is a "fizzy drink mix." Always has been. I like it, but not at this new price and not since they've cut off my subscription.<br /><br />update: If you really like this stuff get it at Wal-Mart. Online price: $7.88

review/summary: Smooth and Full Bodied + Caffeine Free
review/text: This 100 bag sampler of organic dessert teas from Davidson's offers 8 varieties (12 or 13 bags of each) that will sure to please a wide range of tastes.  The flavors are: coconut vanilla, caramel peach, raspberry cream caramel, carob mint, vanilla cream spice, cherries jubilee and lemon ginseng.  Most of the flavors are not too strong, but are more than reminiscent of the name.  The vanilla flavors definitely taste of vanilla and I liked them the best.  The cherries jubilee was the most disappointing.  overall, I think the teas were delicious, even if some (lemon ginseng, cherries jubilee) weren't really for me.  Most notably, the teas all had a great full body and were silky smooth - qualities usually reserved for oolong and black teas.<br /><br />While the packaging is attractive and can be folded for presentation as a display, I found Revolution's sampler boxes to have far superior presentation.  The tea bags do not have strings attached, which may be a sadly missed conveniece to many.  However, I did appreciate the brewing time being noted on each wrapper.<br /><br />I love good tea and coffee, but not the caffeine that usually comes with them.  So at night, I'm usually left to chamomille or relatively few other choices.  After being impressed by Davidson's Assam loose leaf tea, I'm glad I went back to their Amazon store and found this assortment.  I highly recommend it to any tea drinker looking for something non-traditional, and especially recommend it to those looking to avoid caffeine.<br /><br />These items are similar as well and may be a better purchase: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAPWDC">Davidson's Tea Assorted Dessert Teas, 8-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 12)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGEAOE">Davidson's Tea Dessert Teas 4-pack (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: The worst tea I've ever had. Terrible flavor combinations.
review/text: I absolutely love tea, I drink at least 3 cups a day. Now that I'm pregnant I was trying to find caffeine free teas that I could drink throughout my pregnancy. This was a complete waste of money. The flavors are: coconut vanilla, caramel peach, raspberry cream caramel, carob mint, vanilla cream spice, cherries jubilee and lemon ginseng. The ONLY one that isn't absolutely terrible is the vanilla cream spice.<br /><br />I have no clue how anyone could give these a positive review. I like cherry tea, but cherry jubilee and raspberry cream taste like cough syrup. Carob mint and caramel peach were definitely the worst flavors. I even tried preparing the tea for friends to see if it was just me, and it wasn't. We all had a good laugh over how absolutely disgusting these teas were.<br /><br />If you found a bag of Halloween candy from childhood then took all the hard pieces out and boiled them in a trashcan, then you would have a cup of "Organic Dessert Tea."<br /><br />Don't waste your money!

review/summary: Too much rooibos
review/text: These teas, which are 8 different flavors, despite the amazon listing saying 6, are all based on rooibos, which is the predominant flavor in all of them.  As a result, the fruit, caramel, carob, and mint flavors promised are greatly diluted.  If you love rooibos, you will probably like this collection, but I found it overbearing and unpleasant, and ended up giving away most of the set.  The one flavor that I did consume most of was the coconut vanilla, which turned out to go very well with double chocolate s'mores (chocolate grahams, dark Hershey's bars).  If you're looking for teas with interesting and subtle flavors, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a more robust caffeine-free tea (I was), try a small packet of something with rooibos to determine whether you enjoy that flavor before investing in these.  One other problem I have found with Davidson teas (I have tried about 20 different varieties) is that they tend to have the bare minimum of tea in each bag.  Forget about using your extra-large mug, or getting a second cup.  These bags are good for one 8-10 ounce cup and no more.

review/text: No complaints at all about these rolled oats. They were hermetically sealed in plastic bags inside the cardboard boxes. The taste was similar to Quaker rolled oats bought in cylindrical packages from a grocery store. The taste was slightly more flavorful and the texture was slightly more pleasant and chewy than similar "value" rolled oats (grocery store brand), probably because of better storage and packaging procedures. Overall, the best rolled oats I've had. Rolled oats (of any brand) are a very healthy food.

review/text: Quaker 'Old Fashioned' oatmeal cereal is a great product. Compared to Quaker instant oatmeal, the 'Old Fashioned' tastes better, has better texture and consistency. It takes 10~15 minutes to prepare in the microwave, however, depending on how impatient one is whereas the instant is ready in 2~4 minutes. But the asking price of ~$20 is ludicrous at best. COSTCO carries the identical 'Old Fashioned' product [9 lbs packaged in 2 bags] for ~$7.50! The product is highly recommended but not from over priced online vendors(s).

The company supports the Nature Conservancy (Protecting nature, preserving life).<br /><br />These are crispy wheat crackers with a sweet and mild flavor.  These are super crispy crackers that will hold up to any dip or topping.<br /><br />The sweetness adds just enough flavor to make your toppings pop.  I personally serve them with fish dips (salmon) and cheese toppings--yummy!<br /><br />The crackers are made of unbleached enriched flour and contain wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid, safflower oil, raw sugar, defatted wheat germ, cornstarch, brown rice syrup, sea salt, malted barley extract, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), natural turmeric flavor.<br /><br />The 8 oz package contain 8 servings--17 crackers.  Each serving contains 130 cal., 4 g fat, .5 g polyunsaturated fat, 2.5 g monounsaturated fat, 230 mg sodium, 55 mg potassium, 22 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 4 g sugars, 2 g protein.<br /><br />The package states that the crackers contain no artificial perservatives or flavors and no hydrogenated oils.  However, the product does contain Thiamine mononitrate which is a 'synthetic form' of vitamine B1, and medical and nutrition experts recommend a daily potassium intake of 4.7 g per/day.<br /><br />Don't forget to recycle the box!

review/text: By far, and I've tried many, many different brands of Panko bread crumbs, the Kikkoman panko crumbs are the best!  They are very light but flavorful unlike other grocery store brands.  They cook up extremely crisp and provide a great golden color.  They adhere very well to chicken, pork, and veggies if making tempura.  I was only able to find this brand at our local BJ's Wholesale Club until now; Amazon, we love you for caring everything we want at the best price!  Try mixing 1/2 cup of Kikkoman Panko bread crumbs with a 1/4 cup of freshly ground parmesan cheese, dash of garlic powder and lots of black pepper.  Take boneless pork or chicken, dip in egg bath and coat with Panko crumbs and saute in olive oil until 3/4's of the way cooked, flip and cook remaining side. Remove and let stand a few mintues--TOTALLY yummy!

review/text: I love panko! I always use it for chicken katsu or pork katsu.  Typically I coat the meat with rice flour, followed by a mixture of eggs, garlic powder & onion powder. Then I coat the meat in panko before placing it in a pan with heated peanut oil. I wait for it to turn golden brown on one side, then flip. Once it looks done I place it on a plate with paper towels, check that the meat is done and then pat the top of the meat with a paper towel to soak up oil. Using tongs to flip the meat is best, though if you flip it too much the coating might come off. The panko provides just the right crunch (and if you have katsu sauce, all the better!).

review/text: This in just wonderful to cook with. I use it to coat my fired homemade chicken strips. And let me tell you that this is the best bread crumbs I've ever used. My mother and I just adore this brand. Plus it has a lot less salt in it then all the other kinds I've used. We even think that chicken made with this tastes better then KFC.

review/summary: This hard to find vinegar has wonderful flavor
review/text: This is a hard to find vinegar that is superior to balsamic especially when rich flavor is needed. While balsamic adds sweetness and a strong vinegar flavor, sherry vinegar is a mild vinegar that adds huge flavor with a depth and richness that is unique. It can be used very much like white wine, but it adds a smooth nutty flavor similar to pecans. This can be used whenever cooking sherry is called for. I like to use it instead of beer to cook turkey brats, and when cooking cut up chicken: cover the bottom of a fry or saute pan, let the liquid reduce while browning each side; it turns out great. I haven't tried it with other meats, such as beef or pork, but I would expect the rich, mellow flavor to compliment those meats as well. The bottles are large, the size of wine bottles, and this will force you to think up ways to use it--lucky you.

review/summary: They are okay
review/text: The salt is good, the mini grinders are not so good.  They fall apart, the salt doesn't fall out as long as the grinder is upright but you have to keep working at them to keep them shut while you're grinding.  I got them specifically for the grinder and that didn't work out very well.  If they fall to their sides the salt does fall out. I would recommend just getting the salts and not relying on the grinders.

review/text: MPower Energy Tabs is a health and energy product that has a big impact on my daily routine. To give some details about the product, it only has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, a LOT of vitamin Bs, some ginseng and green tea extract. This wonderful concoction gives you a feeling of waking up and seeing the world around you without missing a beat. It is sugar free so you will not crash and it wont make you super hipper/wont give you the jiggers.<br /><br />With the combination of control energy and focus, you can take it and go do a hard core workout or take it to get through your yoga class. It also helps me get my day going at the office and it will last all day without the feeling I need a nap.  It is the best of both worlds.

review/summary: 3.5 Stars
review/text: I refuse to say that a product is 3 or 4 Stars. I believe a half point is significant because, after all this time, I realize that a 3 Star is like a lukewarm average rating, while a 3.5 is significantly better without having to go to 4. I decided to buy this product when I noticed that Dreamfields Pasta was not readily available anymore in amazon and the price had skyrocketed. Was using Dreamfields for quite a long time so when I discovered this product I was very intrigued and order it immediately. Love the sound of a lot of fiber and the flavors also were appealing. They come in big boxes, which I believe contain 12 ounces. Since it is standard practice to mix the pasta with some veggies the 12 ounces are quite enough for they seem to bulk up once you mix them. I like the pasta but find the texture a little hard to get used to and perhaps that is why I allocated 3.5 Stars, which by the way, in my world a 3.5 is nothing to frown upon. I was more generous with Dreamfields because I truly felt their pasta tasted like the real deal, the one you would get at any italian restaurant and that contain at least 40 grams of carbs. Dreamfields states that theirs is very low in carbs after you consider this and that. I can not say I have taken the time to analyze their statements for I figure if they are saying it, is probably true.<br />I have tried other pastas that are similar to the FiberGourmet Light Nested Fettuccine, Garlic Parsley Flavor, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6). It is reassuring that there are some companies out there who truly care for that segment of the population who prefer their pasta low low low. And I love pasta so I am always searching for the ideal one. That said, and as I already stated, I, or should I say we, eat this pasta with no problems at all. Parmesan, Marinara Sauce, with a side of fish, fowl or beef, no one ever complained or said they did not like it. I once tried it like a variation of chow mein with a tasty, guilt free sauce, and it was also tasty.  Have bought all their flavors and perhaps this kind is my favorite but they are all close. Now if I could only start working out a lot harder perhaps all this concern about eating somewhat healthier will pay its dividends. Good enough to eat, 3.5 but no quite 4 Stars? Let's say for arguments sake, that 3.5 is slightly above average.

I tried to force myself to eat it because I dont want to waste food but just couldn't.  The product I recieved I noticed tonight was almound meal and not almond flour like in the picture.  The two shouldnt taste difference so I doubt that is the reason.  I tested to smell also with the leftover flour from my other supplier and the two are completely different.  Its like comparing old gasoline smell with fresh gasoline.  That how the two were different.  I could be just one of the unlucky few to recieve out of date flour but I thought it would be good just for a heads up for future customers.

review/summary: WARNING! This product is not gluten-free.
review/text: I am on a strict gluten-free diet as I have gluten sensitivity. I started using this product, assuming it was gluten-free, as it is naturally and doesn't have any added ingredients. Well, after continually having problems when eating my baked goods and researching all of my products, I found my answer. This manufacturer produces many flours and they make it clear on their website that this product is not intended to be sold as gluten-free.<br /><br />Their statement is as follows:<br />"Celiacs and those with a wheat intolerance on special diets can find rice flour, tapioca flour and even sweet potato flour which has been produced in dedicated, gluten free mills to prevent cross contamination."<br />[...]<br /><br />Any other products from this company are at risk of cross-contamination. So, I should have done my research, but I didn't understand the need to. The lesson here is that a product cannot be accepted as gluten-free unless labeled as such. This product is not so labeled and it caused me multiple repeated health problems. I hope this will save someone else from the same issues.

I'd been eying them on a previous trip, but at $3 per candy (each candy is roughly the size of my thumb, well, I just couldn't do it, I'm a cheapskate, I guess.  So when I saw them marked down for 70% I bought three, one for me and one each for my honeys.<br /><br />I should have bought more because this candy is freaking amazing!  We went back the next day and they were gone!  I know! We were disappointed and ended up eating too many peanut butter stuffed pretzels in our candy-deprived wallowing.<br /><br />But luckily, I've found them again, here.<br /><br />I've long been a fan of marzipan, especially Ritter Sport bars (love German chocolates) and Niederegger bars, but a double dipped chocolate candy filled with pistachio marzipan (something I'd never even heard of before trying these candies), wowee, that did sound intriguing and tasty.<br /><br />The shell of the chocolate was hard and crunchy, possibly because they were a couple of months old, I'd bet they'd be a little less sharp if bought fresher, but the chocolate was of a nice quality, smooth, tangy and rich, but it's the crisp hazelnut inside plus the dense pistachio marzipan around it that is the real prize.<br /><br />All in all, well worth the price.

review/summary: Love the coffee but...
review/text: My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

review/summary: Had to downsize because K-Cups were so weak
review/text: The coffee is pretty good at the smallest cup size, but it gets weak fast the larger serving size you use. For a brand claiming to be "Black", I expected more coffee per cup.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Just finished off my first Amazon packaged (50 count) box, and am impressed with the quality of the k-cup (ZERO wasted cups - no cups with broken seals, and no cups that resulted in a cup full o' grounds).<br /><br />My 5-star rating comes with a caveat.  It's not the best coffee I've had, but it is very good.  I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

review/summary: Good Strong Coffee
review/text: I found this coffee to be full flavored when brewed at 3/4 cup. Not really bitter at all with a smooth flavor. Not as good as Timothy's World Coffee Rainforest Espresso but pretty close.

review/summary: My go to brew when I need a kick in the am
review/text: If you like good bold coffee to get you moving, look no further.  A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead.
