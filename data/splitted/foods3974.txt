review/summary: Sushi making made easy
review/text: My husband and I had a wonderful day of eating.  First a soup, then after much anticipation California rolls, smoked salmon rolls and shrimp rolls, which ended with a small bowl of mixed fruit.  The Sushi Chef came with everything and the directions were easy to follow.<br /><br />I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  So much so, my friends and I are planning a sushi party.

review/summary: Great fun, once you've cooked your rice
review/text: This kit is GREAT - all you need to learn how to make sushi (although I did find some good clips on youtube on how to make the rolls) - the rice takes ages to make, you have to wash it three times, cook it, then let it cool (fan it perhaps), then add the rice vinegar or whatever you have to add to it - and it is TOTALLY yummy - and all the other items are great. We used shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese for our first rolls and they were restaurant quality taste due to the good ingredients (although the rolls themselves needed a little extra help to look perfect, but what can you expect, first time round) -  this is a really great kit.  Used up all the nori last night, and will get some more, but this really is all you need to get started.  Couldn't be happier and have recommended it to friends.

review/summary: Great for beginners!
review/text: It has everything you need for trying your hand at sushi. It helps to have a nice sharp knife. We didn't have a very good sushi knife so it kind of shredded the roll. The seasoned sushi vinegar is great. Now that I have run out, I have to make some seasoned vinegar, which isn't too hard... But it was nice to have it in the one bottle. The nori sheets included don't taste that great, but they are alright to work with. The "recipe book" doesn't have a lot of recipes, so I'd recommend looking up your own recipes, or get creative!

review/summary: Great for making at home!!!
review/text: This kit has everything you need to create your own sushi.  This was our (my husband and I) first attempt.  As long as you allow plenty of time and have plenty of patience, you will have restaurant quality sushi in your own home.  The directions are kind of tricky (which is why I gave 4 starts instead of 5) but you can pretty much get the idea.  Preparing the rice is the hardest part only because it takes about 1.5-2 hours.  I found it easier to work as a team.  I prepared the rice and toasted the nori while my husband cut up the fillers and rolled.  Overall, this is a great way to learning how to make your own sushi.  You have plenty ingredients to use this kit more than once.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try to make their own sushi.

review/summary: Great gift!
review/text: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend's parents last year. I included it with some miso soup packages, sesame seeds and a sushi plate set. I really like that it has the bamboo roller as I did a lot of research before making this purchase and read that those are much easier and more efficient for rolling sushi. This package was great and had basically everything, except I wish it included the sesame seeds for what it costs (or used to cost, I see it's about $10 less now). Although it was easy to pick up the seeds at my local grocery store, just an extra trip - which nobody likes.<br /><br />It shipped and arrived very timely and in great condition.<br /><br />I can't review on how well everything works as I haven't heard if they've actually made sushi yet, but it definitely looked nice and was very well received!

The only thing that would have made the kit better would have been an instructional DVD.  The booklet gets kinda messy when you've got sticky rice all over your hands as you're flipping the pages.  So much fun!  And healthy!

review/summary: not bad
review/text: The kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit. Makes an awesome gift but I reccomend going to a store and purchasing. When it arrived in the mail, the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere... luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so I was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it. We just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag.

It was impossible to find a simple kit locally, and I was very happy with this product. It came sooner than promised, and had just about everything to start making sushi. THe only issue was the handbook was not as clear as it could be for a beginner, so they watched some video's on youtube and as a result, we all enjoyed some awesome sushi for New Years. I may order a kit for myself! Thanks

I looked at several and since I don't know anything about making sushi I was a little nervous that I would not get the correct item.  Several of them had plastic parts, etc....however - this one appeared to be good quality so I ordered it.  When he opened this on Christmas morning he could not have been happier. He said "WOW - this is exactly what I wanted".....and he was thrilled.  It was a very complete set and nicely packaged.

review/text: This sushi making set is a must have for anyone wanting to learn how to make their own sushi. It comes with all the sushi making essentials, even a mini recipe book (as pictured in product details).  If you enjoy inside out sushi, like california rolls, etc; just use a damp cloth to roll the sushi instead of the bamboo mat. This prevents rice from sticking to everything. It is also useful to keep a small bowl of water and vinegar (included in kit) to dip your hands in to remove rice residue on hands while preparing sushi.  I purchased this product from amazon for just under twenty dollars and it has been worth every penny.

review/summary: Great product - could use better recipes
review/text: Love this kit!  It includes everything you need to make basic rolls, and the recipe book includes very basic recipes.  I recommend a supplement like Sushi for Dummies if you're into more creative rolls.  Also check out FineCooking.com for a few basic sushi recipes and step-by-step color photos.  The kit includes the bamboo mat, spatula, two kinds of vinegar, 4 cups of raw rice, 5 sheets of nori, pickled ginger, dark soy sauce, and wasabi powder (for making wasabi paste).  You can probably pick all of these things up in the Asian section of your local grocery store, but you'll definitely save money buying the kit.<br /><br />I wish I had bought this years ago - I love sushi and I now love making my own sushi!  It is so much easier than you would think, and so much cheaper than going out for sushi.  One recommendation - wrap your bamboo mat with plastic wrap if you're going to make inside out rolls!

I'm going to re-gift it when I find someone curious about making sushi and who needs a head-start.  Like I said, it makes a great gift.  Not so great if you're already into sushi making.

Everything's in the box, including a small sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are tricky to find in supermarkets.

I'm sure this in no way prepares you to become a professional sushi chef, but there's definitely some satisfaction in preparing this type of cuisine if you've never made it before. Everything's in the box, including a brief sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are difficult to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be better, but for a few bucks, it is still worth it.

review/text: My fiance and I are huge sushi fans, we used to go out to sushi at least twice a week and it began to get costly. We started looking at videos on Youtube to find out  products and tools we would need to buy to make our own sushi at home. After compiling the list, I started researching sushi kits.<br />This sushi kit was the most complete kit on the internet, and the price was also the lowest. It includes everything you need to start making basic sushi at home. The only thing you really need to buy is a really sharp sushi knife. The book is really vague and doesn't have many recipes, we just used it to make sushi rice and used Youtube for sushi recipes and rolling techniques. I would definitely recommend this kit to any beginner- you won't be disappointed!!!

The unusual taste of lotus flower is hard to describe--it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea.<br /><br />If you need a strong jolt of flavor this tea is not for you. If you want something unusual, savor the subtlety of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />Quote from The Book of Tea by Okakura:<br /><br />"Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea.  The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of pines is heard in our kettle.  Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things."

review/summary: Delicious Flavor
review/text: This is the first time I have purchased Tazo tea. I have always been a fan of green tea, but this time I decided to purchase green tea with a lotus flavor. I was delighted when my tea finally arrived and I sampled it for the first time. The taste was delicious and I was also very pleased with the delivery of my order. It arrived very quickly. I would recommend this tea to anyone who is a lover of green tea or who loves tea with a very smooth, mellow taste. :)

review/summary: Picky Egyptian Mau LOVES This Food!!!
review/text: We have a five year old Egyptian Mau cat who is quite picky when it comes to dry food...she will not eat any of those "grocery store" brands (9 Lives, Friskies, etc.), she hates Iams & Eukanuba, will not touch Science Diet, etc.  Our veterinarian (we go to a "cat only" vet who specializes in purebred kitties) recommended Royal Canin food.  Since our Mau LOVES to shed...I decided to try this particular type of Royal Canin (since they don't have a Mau specific food).  Instantly she pounced on her automatic dry feeder...and absolutely loves it! Royal Canin costs more than most cat foods but it's worth it!

review/text: Panch Phoron is a Bengali melange of five spices, combining for a wonderful mix of tastes. It's sometimes hard to find in the U.S., and when you do find it, some brands substitute cheaper seeds instead of the correct five spices. This brand is a good one and I would be completely satisfied if it weren't so expensive.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

I'll be buying these as long as my dog is alive :)

review/summary: Charlee Bear Dog Treats
review/text: My dog loves these little treats - only 3 calories each and that adds up when you use them for training.  I keep several in the pockets of my jackets so when we go for walks we can work on our commands, and I use them to calm her down by saying "watch me" when another dog comes by. She is generously rewarded with Charlee Dogs.<br /><br />I've had a hard time finding this product in pet stores and I've bought other brands. They seem a little harder and larger, not great for training unless it's a mastiff or something. Don't get me wrong, these are wonderful little treats anytime for my dog.

Will probably place an order soon via Amazon (Prime, of course).

review/summary: Great Treats, Depending On Your Dog's Palate.
review/text: We had three black labs when I lived up in Wisconsin, and they all went wild for these, preferring the original and the cranberry over the other flavors.  All we had to do was say "bears" and their ears perked up as they did a little dance.  My beagle, on the other hand, is picky and wouldn't eat them.  Guess it's a matter of taste.  That's no reason to give this product a low rating, because it all comes down to the dog.  They are clean, don't smell, and they look a bit like oyster crackers.  In fact, sometimes we put them in with a new dog food to get the boys to eat it, and it worked.  If you're not sure your dog will go for them, try the smaller packs first.

It keeps them happy and busy - which is important because one of them tends to get car sick if she's not occupied.  They love them - but I have to take them away when there is only an inch or so left.  My maltipoo choked on a small piece and it was very scary.  Now I just keep an eye out when they get to around an inch and they get taken away.<br /><br />I don't know why, but the prices on these doubled in the last few months.  I'm starting to limit how many they can have.  I have noticed their breath isn't as clean since I've cut back.  They must have really helped keep their teeth clean!

review/summary: Is anyone else sick of this company?
review/text: My Shih Tzu has enjoyed these treats for years.  I used to give them 5 starts.  But then the company started having inventory problems.  Sometimes it would take 2-3 months unless you were willing to pat $250 a box.  Now they've fixed the inventory issues but have totally screwed up the packaging.  Where they used to just place a cardboard strip in the middle of the treat, now they shrink-wrap it in very tough plastic.  You have to fight with it for 5 minutes just to get the darned thing unwrapped.  And they've gone backwards environmentally speaking.  All of the packaging used to be recyclable but now it goes in a landfill.  I've just had it.  My puppy prefers your chews, but I think it's going to be Best Bully Sticks from now on.

I have a small breed puppy and they are the perfect size and shape for him to hold and chew (not too bulky/big).  These can be difficult to come by (I've only found them at specialty pet stores) and are relatively expensive, so it is definitely worth it to order them in bulk from Amazon - you'll save time and money.

review/summary: Moldy on arrival
review/text: I received these flossies and they were full of mold and definitely not suitable for consumption.  There was a recall by the manufacturer some time ago and flossies are hard to get a hold of.  Either these were recalled and the seller is still selling them or the seller is storing these in bad conditions.  It took more then a month to deal with the seller to finally get a shipping label and full refund.  Buy with caution.

review/summary: Impressively YUMMY
review/text: These were priced right so to be frank, my expectations were a bit low. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when a delightfully packed box (appropriate for gift giving) was delivered with six different varieties of dried mushrooms, presentation stuffing, recipe ideas etc...the overall effect is quite nice and makes a wonderful gift idea.<br /><br />The first we tried were the morels - although you can certainly find much more expensive ones, I was very pleasantly surprised how good these were especially given the price of the entire box. Frankly, they tasted much better than expected. Next were the shiitake which are one of my favorite mushrooms and I tend to be very picky about them...most of the time I purchase them fresh but always keep some dried on hand for those "cooking emergencies" (I use a lot of shrooms when cooking). In fact, I had just ordered a pound of dried shiitake from another vendor...these were FAR surperior (unfortunately, I'm stuck with a pound of not so good ones...USA organic made at that!). Each has been equally pleasant and far in excess of my (admittedly modest) expectations. Frankly, these would easily pass for double the cost I paid...in fact, I liked this set so much, I hesitated to give it such a good rating because I was afraid they would jump the price up!<br /><br />As soon as I work through my present selection from the other inferior company, I intend to purchase more dried and fresh mushrooms from this Earthy. VERY impressed!

review/summary: Great price and variety!  Do multiple rinses though...
review/text: I haven't yet tried the morels which are of course the gems of the litter, but of the three other varieties I've tried, these are great!  An ounce is quite a lot actually...I'm going to get 2-3 uses out of each bag.<br /><br />I've never rehydrated mushrooms before but it's pretty easy and has some great benefits.  While the texture isn't the same as cooking with fresh mushrooms it lets you have all these varieties any time of the year and the "liquor" that you get from the water they rehydrate in is flavorful and great for using in sauces (sometimes the same recipe as the mushrooms).<br /><br />One caveat though - I had looked up instructions online and then compared them with the labels.  I followed the instructions on the labels at first but found one important thing that the internet had suggested - you really do need to carefully wash these and strain the liquor if you're going to use it.  That's because there IS sand and grit on a few of the mushrooms.  (Overall they seem fairly clean, but I bit into a few grains of sand the first few times I used them because of skipping this step)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a FANTASTIC price and a great way to try these varieties if you never have since most aren't available in a lot of grocery stores.  My palate is inexperienced in most of these varieties but they seem good to me...nice big mushrooms that rehydrate well and are full of flavor.<br /><br />Finally, I did separately order a variety of other products from Earthy direct from their website.  They have a lot of stuff there (sauces, spices, gourmet treats) and their other products are fantastic thus far as well.  Watch prices though...although it's nice to get all your little treats in one place, some items really are cheaper here on Amazon.<br /><br />Customer service from Earthy is great as well...I would assume they'd treat Amazon orders as well as they treat their direct traffic.  I had an issue (my fault) with an order from their website and they were incredibly helpful fixing it.

review/summary: The Perfect Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />This Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a plain, but far from ordinary green tea. The taste is incredible. It is definitely the best green tea I have ever tasted---green tea as it always should be---full of flavor and freshness!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 100% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue by providing antioxidants. It contains 58mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee). Note that Yogi makes a Decaf Simply Green Tea, too, if you want to avoid the caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended. In the case of this tea, simplicity is bliss!<br />*****

NOT ANY MORE, these smoked hooves are great.  not only does the dog love them more, but they truly smell like a smoldering campfire.  so i watch tv, she chews and i imagine the warmth of a nice smokey fire close by.  no more fans as i LOVE a good campfire.  ooooppppsss... now the neighbor dog is hooked too!!  sharing in the neighborhood.  going to order 3 more bags.  the 'humane society no kill shelter' will love these for the pups on the hill.

review/summary: Would not reccocmend for a dog that wants it chew ASAP
review/text: I love Red barn products but their hooves are very hard and if your dog doesn't want to take the time to chew them down the dog can break these up into 5 or 6 pieces and than swallow these jagged hard pieces.  Mine did this and the next day was vey sick trying to bring those sharp pieces back up.  I feel he could have been very hurt if they moved further into his intestines. I was worried enough to consider giving pumpkin mash to help coat any piece that didn't come back up the next day to help it through smoother.<br />My dog is bigger and these hooves are smaller so maybe a little dog would be okay with them but not if they are piggish little dogs!

review/summary: Taste to die for!
review/text: I used this product for many years. I favored Imagine for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. The chocolate flavor of this drink is terrific- sweet and chocolaty, totally delicious, and I drank this every day for decades.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

review/text: I have an intense dislike for all fake sugars out there, and have tried every one I could get my hands on. Ideal Sweetener is the only one I like. It is perfect for baking and you use it cup-for-cup in recipes instead of sugar. Zero calories and has no funky aftertaste like most artificial sweeteners. I am so happy I will be able to order this on Amazon in the Baking Bag, as all the stores in my area only carry the small packs. Finally, I can make cookies and breads without all the calories!!<br /><br />EDIT: If you are using this for baking, it is not zero calories. I contacted Heartland Sweeteners to find out the calories-per-cup, and this was the response:<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Heartland Sweeteners.  The FDA allows any food item with less than 5 calories per serving to be labeled as "zero calories". Ideal has 202 calories per cup versus over 770 calories in a cup of sugar.

review/summary: It has 202 cals and 53 carbs per cup. Great sweetener, but their marketing is misleading!
review/text: I like this sweetener a lot.  But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal.  So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon.  So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says.  They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag!  The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose.  It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings.<br /><br />That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good. Their shady lack of disclosure on the bag leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But while it's not a no calorie sweetener, but it is pretty close to ideal.<br /><br />Rating breakdown:<br />Product claims = 1 star<br />Product taste = 5 stars<br />Overall: 3 stars<br /><br />Calorie and carb info from [...]
