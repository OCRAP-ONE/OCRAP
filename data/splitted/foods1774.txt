Cheaper than the grocery stores and Costco so a good value too.

review/summary: Good agave, convenient package size
review/text: I really like the "raw" agave flavor of the Madhava brand. It tastes stronger than the light type but not too strong, if that makes sense? I'm also quite fond of this particular packaging. The 23.5 oz bottle holds a good amount, but isn't too heavy to squeeze easily, and the top isn't prone to leaking. Some of the smaller-sized "squeezy" bottles will have a little overflow if you squeeze too hard, so avoiding a drippy, sticky mess is always a plus in my book.

Sliced or diced, they also make an exciting addition to salads (sauce strained).<br /><br />I posted a pic of the 7-oz Embasa tin next to a regular 12-oz soda can for size comparison so that you know what to expect.

They would have ordered a case or two of these peppers already and be on to doing something exciting and awesome like filming a new Mountain Dew commercial.<br /><br />We have established that you are the second type of person, the one who chooses between hamburger helper and ramen noodles.  The one who knows how to casserole a can of tuna about a dozen ways.  The one who thinks that spaghetti sauce comes in a jar.  But you can be the first type of person.  What you have been missing all this time is SPICE.<br /><br />These peppers deliver SPICE.  Smokey, rich, and able to deliver just the right amount of heat.  I love chipotle peppers, and this deal can't be beat.  I love this brand and the price is about half what I pay per can at my local grocer.  In addition to any Mexican-style food, I add them to chili, pizza, beef or pork roast, omeletts, and many other items.  Mix a little of the adobo sauce with some apricot jam and use it as a glaze for fish on the grill (yum!).  Get a little crazy.<br /><br />When I told my grandmother that I was feeding her smoked jalapeno peppers she swore at me.  She doesn't like hot food.  But she had seconds.

review/text: I started out with Walter's Wasabi Peas from my local grocery, then I also found this particular brand locally in Walmart and I really like these. The previous reviewer may have gotten a stale batch, I don't know, but small variations in production will certainly affect the product a lot. I like my Wasabi Peas to start out sort of sweet, tasty and crunchy, then get hit with just the right amount of hot spiciness after a moment. I like the size and kick of these best out of the brands I've tried. I've also tried the ones made by Good Sense and they have a little less fat which I think makes them taste hotter and slightly crunchier, but might make some people happier for that reason. Hapi is definitely my own favorite so far.

The hazelnut flavor is well balanced---strong without overpowering, not overly sweet like some other hazelnut coffee flavors.

review/text: The K-cups are very convenient to use on work days, but I wish the flavor was stronger.  I use to brew at the large mug setting, but found the flavor watery.  Brewing at the middle cup setting results in more flavor.

review/summary: Awesome Taste, Great Aroma!
review/text: When I first got my Keurig brewing machine, I was a little skeptical about the quality of coffee any K-Cup could provide. After making a cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee using a K-Cup from a sample pack, I now stand corrected! Gloria Jean's makes great coffee to begin with and their Hazelnut coffee in K-Cup form is fantastic.<br /><br />The coffee gives off a wonderful Hazelnut aroma while it's brewing and it tastes great! It's the kind of aroma and taste you'd expect after grinding the beans yourself, but the K-Cup saves you the hassle. In the time that I've owned a Keurig brewer, this is hands-down one of the best coffees I've tried, and I'll definitely be ordering it again.<br /><br />My only complaint is in the packaging, but since it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the coffee, I can't rate it less than five stars. Just wish this 50-pack came in a differently-sized/designed box so it would store more easily in a kitchen cabinet.

review/summary: Delicious hazelnut aroma!
review/text: I love Gloria Jean coffee and their hazelnut K-cups do not disappoint. The aroma smells mouthwatering as it's brewing and the strength is just right. I do have to admit that hazelnut coffee tends to be on the light side of coffee strength so strong coffee drinkers beware! I always use the medium cup setting on the Keurig B60 special edition so if you want it stronger, use the smallest cup setting. At $0.60 per cup, this is easily the best value for coffee, especially if you're drinking a mug everyday like me.

review/summary: Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/text: I'm generally not a fan of Hazelnut coffee but even I like this one.  My husband tried this in a sample pack and loved it so I ordered them for him.  I was surprised that the cups arrived loose in the shipping box so make sure you have a container for them as this box doesn't exactly fit in the cabinet the way the small retail boxes do.  That said this coffee has a nice bold taste which works great in a big mug.  We will definitely buy more of these.

review/summary: Hazelnut Heaven
review/text: My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.  The Gloria Jean's is our favorite, even beating out Dunkin' Donut's and Millstone's Hazelnut Cream (which used to be my favorite) hands down.  We always make the largest size cup and there is still plenty of flavor, never watered down or "thin" tasting.  I've always been the major coffee drinker in the house, until we got the Keurig and then the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut.  My husband now drinks 2-4 cups a day!  Make the investment in the Keurig so much more worth it.<br /><br />This purchase is a great deal.  At $0.60 per cup and free shipping, it's a fabulous price and I don't feel like I'm paying extra money for packaging.  It does come in a no-frills box with all 50 of the cups just loose in the large box.  However, we have a holder on the counter which we fill and just keep the box in the pantry to pull from as we need.  If you have a storage situation like a stand or a drawer you keep your K-cups in, you'll have no complaints about them being loose in the box.  We're about to order our second box, and will definitely be repeat buyers!

When a couple people make coffee daily, you can really go through the k-cups, and this product keeps us stocked.  When these arrived, there were one or two that had been damaged in transit, but it didn't really bother me.  I removed the broken cups and transferred the rest to our k-cup staging area.  Definitely a good buy.

review/text: We enjoy this coffee very much.  With subscribe and save, it is a great value as well.  The hazelnut flavor is strong which is a plus for us, but might be overwhelming for some.  Only wish the coffee itself was a bit more bold.

review/summary: Great product.. but count the k-cups
review/text: I have bought several of these... But this was the first time I actually counted to see if there was 50..  SURPRISE!!!  There were only 47....<br />Not THAT big of a deal.. but be wary....  That actually makes it more $'s than just going to walmart and getting there 18 pk.

review/summary: Great Coffee at a Great price
review/text: I have to admit, I first purchased these Hazelnut K-Cups because of the low price. I had to pick some up for the office, and the price was right. I was very pleasantly surprised with the coffee! Better flavor than some K-Cups that cost a lot more.

review/summary: Bitter, Burned Flavor. Major Aftertaste.
review/text: With the first sip, you can taste the bitter, burned nut flavor in this Gloria Jeans k-cup.  Top it off with a major aftertaste (cream & sugar didn't help) & this blend went straight to the bottom of my list.<br /><br />If you want a nice hazelnut coffee, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IRGDFW">Millstone Coffee, Hazelnut Cream, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>.

review/summary: Not a good value and weak in strength.
review/text: I guess my title says it all.<br /><br />Price has gone up 30% plus in the past three months. I have got my old coffee maker back out for when there is more than one of us having coffee. At over 50 cents a cup, even on "sale", this is too much. (All K-cup were at one time 30-40 cents now they are 50-60 cents!)<br /><br />For the taste it is weak at best and I am not a strong coffee drinker.  Better flavored Kcups out there but this one is just OK.  I do like some other Gloria Jean's coffee but usually get the bold one's just get a normal cup of coffee.

review/summary: Gloria Jean's Coffee - Hazelnut
review/text: Gloria Jean's Coffees, Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig.  Tasted fine but was hoping for a bit more Hazelnut flavor.  In their defense I have found most K-Cups not to have a strong flavor like fresh brew coffee.  Product good, would buy again, but the flavor was not over the top.

review/text: I love hazlenut coffee.  I have tried several brand of Kcups over the first year of having a Keurig.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is rich in flavor without the acidy after taste of many others that often upsets your stomach if you enjoy coffee often.  I start out the day with no less than 4 cups and I never get tired of Gloria Jean's.  You simply "must" use the "frustration free" packaging, thank's Amazon!
