review/text: Best waffle mix I've had, leagues better than any supermarket brand, and even better than some "from-scratch" mixes I have tried at home.<br /><br />FYI, this mix is either the exact one or extremely similar to the one they use for breakfast at the Hampton Inn hotel chain.<br /><br />It yields sweet, fluffy (yet crisp on the outside, depending on your iron settings and timing) waffles that are best enjoyed with even more butter on top! If you're looking for health food, look elsewhere :)<br /><br />I definitely will be buying this again. And again and again!

review/summary: Just okay
review/text: I have to agree with a previous reviewer that these are kind of bland.  I also only get two waffles from one recipe.  In fairness though, even using a homemade batter, I don't get as many as suggested in the recipe.  Might be because my Presto Flipside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TYBWIG">Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker</a> makes a very big (7 inch I think) and deep waffle.<br /><br />Homemade batter is more labor intensive, so this mix will come in handy for those lazy days when I don't feel like fussing too much, but like was said before, I will probably have to add sugar or Splenda to the batter or some type of flavored extract.

Be prepared to doctor up this flour with flavor extracts, sugar, and extra oil.<br /><br />If you want to fill your house with a wonderful aroma, this is your answer. If you want to cook excellent waffles, change up the ingredients and experiment, of course you could do this all purpose flour for much cheaper.

review/summary: THE "HOLY GRAIL" OF DOG FOOD!!
review/text: I hate, hate, hate the way most canned dog food looks.  I especially feel bad feeding it to my older rescue dogs.  I also hate reading the ingredients and knowing what I'm putting into my dear older dogs.<br /><br />But my current 9-year old rescue dog wouldnt eat anything except the grossest-looking canned food (no brand names will be mentioned -- you know what brand I mean, though).  It gave her stomach troubles, from both ends -- so, after 18 months of bearing with her bad breath and bad gas, I started looking on Amazon for an alternative.<br /><br />I had tried just about every canned dog food product and then came across this Duck and Potato.  It sounded intriguing and the ingredients looked very promising.  So I bought it, somewhat dubious that she'd be willing to eat it, but desperate to find a better food that she'd eat.<br /><br />But she loves it!  I'm so happy.  It looks so good.  I dont have to feel bad about feeding her stuff that I dont even want to touch any more.  And her stomach problems have ceased totally.<br /><br />I've found my HOLY GRAIL of dog food. This is what I'm going to feed all my dogs from now on.  Thankyou, Thankyou, Thankyou!!!

review/summary: Best Non-Organic Dog Food
review/text: Adopting an abused 2 year old Shih Tzu has been an interesting experience for our family over the past few months. We started Aggie out on Trader Joe's kibble, believing this to be an acceptable, more natural product for both our dogs. Aggie could never digest the TJ's product, so I began researching what doggie naturalists were feeding their dogs. And, it looked like the raw meat diet was the way to go and definitely no grains. This went great for about a month untill we got a bad batch of premade raw dog food (super expensive @ $60/week) and had terrible projectile poo and throwup for 3 days each! So, I said, forget this.. not worth it. Next, my research brought me to Acana/Orijen Brand(s). I still feel this is probably the highest quality kibble out there, but after 4 weeks of runny poo on this brand, I realized my little shih tzu just couldn't handle such rich food. My other dog, a chow chow did fine on it but didn't really care for the flavor all that much. The quest for answers continued until I came accross information on Dick Van Patten's web site for his dog food line: Natural Balance. I didn't realize that some dogs can be allergic to meat. For example, chicken is in nearly all dog food, and after a couple of generations (just like soy and wheat with humans), dogs are becoming sensative to chicken as an ingredient. The VERY FIRST DAY I put Aggie on their Duck and Potato Formula (grain free too - I love that!), her poos hardened up and no more bile throw up in the morning. She's been on it now for 10 days, and it has been a wonderful experience - changing all our lives. Though I have to say she doesn't run to the food, but she eats it when she is hungry. Now, our other dog, our Chow Chow begs for it. I've begun mixing the Orijen kibble with the NB canned, and she eats her entire meal right up. I will be transitioning my chow to NB as soon as her remaining Orijen is consumed. Love, Love, Love this product.

review/summary: Great food for all dogs.
review/text: This food is great. My dogs like the taste and smell of it. It's premium food so they eat less of it so the price is right. It's good for them,especially my overweight dog. He's lost ounces in days and you know it's hard to knock off the weight on a dog. It has no grain in it which I believe has been the fattening carbohydrate in his diet. I feed them this wet food with the Natural Balance Alpha line of dry foods with no grain in them. My dog will soon be the active eager dog he use to be. Thanks to LID (Limited Ingredient Diet) Natural Balance dog foods.

review/text: This is a good limited ingredient diet and most of the time my little Maltese likes it.  I just purchased a second case from Amazon.  The first had a few cans that were a soggy mess but most were of a normal consistency so I didn't think much of it.  I'm on the 4th can of the second case and they all seem to have too much moisture and are a soggy mess.  I have to refrigerate the can for a day before opening it so that I can portion out his food.  My dog is less thrilled with the mess and I can't even warm it quite to room temperature before he'll refuse it.  I don't know if the food was stored improperly at Amazon, if something happened in the shipping, or if Natural Balance doesn't have good quality control and "bad" cans seem go to Amazon but I haven't had the same problem with the cans that I buy at the Petco store.

review/summary: 2 Big Lab Mixed Dogs Love this stuff
review/text: In the last couple of years, I have change brands a couple of times after extensive research.  I ended up making homemade batches starting with my vet's recommendation and then modifying the ingredients based on further reading.  The health of my dogs improved (11yr old and 7yr old).  They were looking and feeling better, evident in their energy level, skin, and their coats.  Personal schedules were going to be very busy for a couple of weeks and I knew I was not going to be able to keep up with the homemade batches.  I switched to Natural Balance Duck/Potato for a temporary solution and the results have been terrific.  Of course they love the stuff but they are more alert, bright eyed, and playful than ever.  Although it is more expensive, it is great to know you can get excellent quality out of a commercial dog food product.  I will be reordering for sure.

review/summary: My big guy thinks it's just ok.
review/text: My dog is about 130 pounds and there is no way I can afford to feed him a high quality canned dog food for all of his meal.  I buy the grain free dry food at Costco and then like to add a good canned food that is both healthy and good tasting.  Jackson eats this food, but not eagerly.  That would be fine, but the real reason I have given this food three stars is that I absolutely cannot stand the smell of it.  I understand that dog food is not made for us to like, it's for the dogs....but, I usually don't mind how the canned foods smell and can even understand why a dog would like them.  This duck one really smells odd to me in that it seems to have a heavy smoked smell.  I find myself really not looking forward to mealtime and hoping a go through this case I have so that I can order something else.  It is probably good food with good ingredients and this is just a matter of personal taste (or smell in this case).  If my dog were wild about it I probably would go on feeding it, but since he isn't, it is time to try something else.

review/summary: It must be yummy!
review/text: My Shiba Inu is having allergy shots for a number of environmental allergens.  The vet recommended putting him on a hypoallergenic (duck/potato) dry dog food; a 17-pound bag of it costs more than $80 but that didn't impress my dog at all.  He would walk over to his food bowl, sniff his food and then walk away.  Even adding duck meat or duck jerky pieces didn't work since he would pick those out and then leave the rest of the dry food in his bowl.<br /><br />After reading the reviews of the Natural Balance duck/potato canned dog food, I decided it was worth a try.  When the shipment arrived, my dog came over as soon as I opened a can and then stayed in the kitchen throughout while I prepared his dinner (I warm up 2 tablespoons and mix it into his dry dog food).  By the time I set it down, he dove for his bowl and gobbled every single morsel down.  Since he's acted like that whenever I've tried anything new, I decided to give it a while before I wrote a review.  About the only change has been that he waits outside the kitchen when I start prepping his food and as soon as I set his bowl down, he's right there to start eating.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this canned dog good is the added smoke flavor (same for their duck/potato biscuits).

review/summary: How many complaints does it take?
review/text: I just sent a complaint to Amazon because, like others, I did not get the item pictured.  I got the restaurant-style container that cannot be closed.  Not only that but, for a set of 4, the restaurant-style containers are a cheaper product.  Restaurants like the lids with holes on two sides because they know the containers will be used many times during the day by many patrons.  So, there is little chance of the soy sauce spoiling before the container needs to be refilled.  Not so with people at home.  I'm the only one here and do NOT use soy sauce every day.  So, I'm probably going to have to pour it into another bottle that DOES have a lid that closes ... just to keep it fresh.<br /><br />So, 5 stars to Kikkoman for making a great soy sauce and 0 stars to Amazon for cheaping out on at-home customers with an unfair switcheroo.  Between 5 and 0 stars, the average I give this order is 3.<br /><br />P.S.  When I sent the complaint to Amazon, I specifically stated that I wasn't asking for a refund.  They responded to my complaint - saying they were giving me a refund anyway and asking if it solved my problem.  I told them, "No," because I was still stuck with 3 restaurant-style containers.  However, they did say they would investigate why this switcheroo is happening.  Hope they fix it for future orders.<br /><br />P.P.S.  Up to this point, I was merely disappointed.  But then, Amazon responded to my response.  They suggested I "try one of their other sellers."  And they asked me again if this solved my problem.  I answered yes ... but only to get them off my back.  And I took away 1 more star - making my review a 2-star review.  Buying from Amazon should be like buying from any other store.  Customers need to "trust" that the store "knows" what it is selling.  If I visited a local Safeway store and bought this item - only to find the item switched in my shopping bag when I got home - I'd be disappointed.  A refund doesn't put the product I bought in my home.  And the suggestion to try a different Safeway store would be a bit insulting.  Who knows, maybe the other store would do the same switcheroo.  Selling and buying should be a transaction, not a crap-shoot.

Fried rice and pan-fried noodles have always been comfort foods for me and I found myself longing for them.<br /><br />Following my instincts, I made my first batch of fried rice using Kikkoman's, veggies and two eggs.  The soy sauce was all I used other than a pinch of pepper and it was all that was needed.  Kikkoman's is flavorful without being overly salty. (That's a lot coming from me being as I can't stand overly salty foods or condiments.) It's no where near as salty as those soy sauce condiment packets you get at the restaurants.<br /><br />I actually found myself adding more after the dish was done to add more flavor.<br /><br />I think the sauce is a tad pricey, so if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, great.

review/summary: Neocate Overpriced, but a necessity
review/text: Neocate is the only thing my allergic child can drink, however this is an outrageous price.  You can find it for about $120 with free shipping directly from the Neocate website, and they always have promotional codes, so do a search before you order.  I sure hope your baby outgrows their allergies soon.  My little one is 2yrs old and still very dependent on Neocate.  Good luck.

review/summary: wonderful bottled water that actually does come from a spring
review/text: Poland Springs bottled water actually does come from a spring in Maine--thank goodness! I have purchased a couple of other brands that are purified after simply being taken from the tap; but because Poland Springs bottled water actually comes from a spring I am impressed.<br /><br />The water tastes great and it is extremely refreshing to drink very cold on a hot summer's day. The water can be served cold or at room temperature, whichever you please.<br /><br />Overall, Poland Springs bottled water truly is good for you. It helps to keep your system cleansed; I drink at least two or three bottles of this every day. I prefer Poland Springs bottled water to other brands because it actually does come from a spring before they process it and put it in bottles for us to drink.<br /><br />Great job, Poland Springs!

review/summary: Is this the official water of America?
review/text: In Italy, San Pellegrino is everywhere. In France, Perrier can be found in bistros in Paris and in your hotel room mini-bar. But over here in 'Merica... Poland Springs RULES. Really. When I walk through NYC or sit in a park with a sandwich, I see Poland Springs bottles everywhere. Whether it's the sexy blond jogger or the overweight Wall Street banker, everyone seems to be carrying and drinking from these convenient right-sized bottles. (Love this size...)<br /><br />And while I think we all need to be sure we recycle the bottles when done (I do see empties on the ground), Poland Springs has even changed their packaging to use less plastic. Bravo! Take the rest of the day off...<br /><br />But the best reason to buy Poland Springs is that it's made here, in the USA. If you want a sexy bottle to impress friends, look elsewhere. Want good tasting H2O - buy Poland Springs.<br /><br />In my opinion, it is a great tasting "still" - meaning, non-fizzy - water and unlike others, it's from a place where the supply is (so far) un-pollluted. Some bottled waters are merely "filtered" tap water, leaving in chemicals (e.g., prescription medications that are often found in city water supplies) that no one should drink. More important, this is stuff that could really affect children's health long term.<br /><br />It tastes good. It is made in the USA. They make it responsibly and it is from a great source.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/text: We have two large dogs and are always looking for high quality treats.  The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.  The chews were not long lasting (about five minutes).  I have purchased other high quality chews for a lower price so I can't really justify the high price of these treats.  We spend a lot of money on our pets but this is the first treat/chew that I felt like they might as well have been chewing on my wallet! (I think my wallet would have lasted longer)

review/summary: Best I Have Tried So Far
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH3M">Zoe Anti-Oxidant 8-1/2-Ounce Dental Chew Treats, Medium</a> actually worked really well. We have a medium-sized lab + something mix and she really enjoyed these. I'm generally not a big fan of dog treats, because they stink,, they don't help her breath/teeth much, they have funky things inside, and she has powerful jaws that enable her to go through just about any treat in a short amount of time.<br /><br />ODOR<br />As far as the smell goes, this wasn't bad at all. In fact, not only did it improve her breath, but there was a noticeable reduction in plaque. I didn't expect the treats to actually accomplish this, and was glad to see how well they worked.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />All natural and healthy.<br /><br />LONGEVITY<br />Unfortunately, the treats didn't last long. She finished each one in just a few minutes. I suppose I shouldn't expect treats like this to last too long (hence, the five stars), but it would be nice if they did.

review/summary: My Dogs Were Not Very Enthused
review/text: I tested these treats out on three dogs, a schnauzer mix, poodle mix, and a terrier mix.  They all got very excited when I opened the bag, but the terrier was the only one who seemed very enthused about the treat itself.  The other two kind of chewed on the treats for a minute or two, then just kind of stared at them.<br /><br />The treats are a little messy, especially near the end.  My dogs left tiny crumbs on the floor, so that's something to watch out for.  They're a good size, perfect for medium build dogs.

review/summary: Quite the hit!!
review/text: When I first received Haley's (my dog) package of Zoe Anti-Oxidant Dental Chew Treats (medium size), I took Haley and 3 of the treats to my neighbor's house to visit and share with her dogs. All 3 dogs LOVED the treats and got very possessive of their own. The dogs range from about 15 pounds to 30 pounds.  It took the boston terrier the longest to eat.  There were no crumbs leftover at all.  Haley normally carries bones around for awhile to protect and guard.  She started eating her Zoe bone right away.<br /><br />These bones are similar to Denta Bones in style, but they have much better ingredients.  I've given Haley natural dental bones before, and these have a similar smell.  I'm not sure if it's the rosemary or what other ingredient.<br /><br />I am very impressed and pleased with these bones.  They seem to keep the dogs busy for a while longer than denta bones, so that is definitely a good thing!  I will be purchasing these for Haley in the future.  I doubt I would give her one every day because of the calories, but maybe she will get them as a special treat a couple times a week.

review/summary: Short life, strong odor
review/text: On arrival, I distributed a chew to each of three dogs under 20 pounds who do like chews.  They each went at their chew with a will, and in 15 minutes the chews were gone.  As the chewing was in progress, and lingering, was a distinct odor similar to horse weeds and other strong herbs.  I cannot say how "dental" the experience was, for such a quick gulp.  If one of the purposes of the chew is to occupy a pet for any extended time, this choice is a flop--but it must have been tasty.

review/summary: Dog Loves It and Perfect Size
review/text: My dog has been using Check-ups and Greenies for a while and he loves this new addition to his dental chewies routine. The medium size is perfect for my 25 lb. cocker spaniel. The bone is roughly the size of a large chicken drumstick bone. When I was opening the bag, my dog followed me around. I suspected he knew this bag of bones was for him. He grabbed the chew bone immediately after I offered it to him found a nice corner and went about his chewing. It lasted a good minute or two. This stuff is made of quinoa, gluten free, and touts anti-oxidant benefits. And I assume it tastes good because it actually smells pretty good. 5 stars for Zoe Anti-Oxidant Chew Bones and I would buy again and recommend to others. When my dog is happy... I'm happy.

review/text: These are the kind of dog treats that take the dog a few minutes to chew up.  They break into safe pieces so they won't get lodged in the throat or further down, but they still take a few minutes to eat as they are kind of hard.  I thought they smelled sort of medicinal, but my dog seemed to like them a lot.

review/summary: Benny likes it. But why Nutraceuticals in Dog Treats?
review/text: My cocker spaniel enjoyed these treats. They do not contain corn or wheat, which is good because he seems to get itchy when he eats those grains.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not give them to our other dog, a beagle mix. He tends to get seizures after he consumes chicken, and since these contain natural chicken flavor, I did not risk giving him these.<br /><br />I received these treats as a sample. I would not bother to purchase them because of the cost plus the fact that only one of my pets can eat them.<br /><br />I wonder if the price would be lower if designer nutrients were left out. I mean, do dogs naturally want green tea extract? I realize that studies are being done on possible benefits of this substance, but throwing some in dog treats is not the same as having a vet prescribe it. When I searched the web for research on canine green tea extract, one of the first that came up reported that some beagles died in a study using high doses of the extract, so now I feel that caution may be advisable. Of course, your dog would have to eat an awful lot of these treats to get enough of it to suffer any harm; a single treat is almost certainly okay.<br /><br />Nutraceuticals have become trendy because marketers know that people are aware that certain nutrients have impressive health benefits. And including these nutrients give manufacturers a reason to charge more. You may want to ask your vet's opinion before paying extra for designer treats.

review/summary: 4 of 5 Dogs Approve
review/text: Upon opening the package, the two young Jack Russell Terriers began bouncing up and down --they could tell from the smell that this was a treat they were going to like.  I was not at all off put by the vaguely minty, grainy smell but my wife did not care for the smell at all.  The two youngsters ran to their crates where they immediately devoured the chews in less than 2 minutes.  The treats were also given to a geriatric JRT, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an Australian Cattle Dog.  The old JRT also polished his chew off in a matter of minutes, it took the CKCS about 10 minutes and the ACD turned her nose up at the chew -- she literally pushed it into a corner of her crate and sat in the opposite corner as far away as possible from the treat.  The ACD is admittedly very picky about food and treats, but she absolutely loves bully sticks (as do all of the other dogs) which also last many times longer than these chews and cost less when one considers their staying power.<br /><br />In summary:<br />+4: Number of dogs liked<br />+0: Smell (some humans and dogs liked, others didn't)<br />-1: Cost<br />-1: Duration<br /><br />So, these chews get a score of two (2) given that all dogs in the house love bully sticks which provide much longer chewing enjoyment  at a lower cost.

review/summary: Nice Dog Treat - The Dog Liked It
review/text: What else can I say except the dog really liked these treats?  I didn't taste them, but after sniffing the something new for him treat and being a little skeptical he ran off with it and sat down to gnaw for a long time.  A good benefit is there wasn't a nasty smell to the treat before or after the dog eating it like there is with other dental-type pet treats.<br /><br />One thing I want to point out is the size of these treats - they are a lot bigger than a greenie and other similar pet dental treats, as well as a lot tougher which will take them longer to chew.  I have a small dog that weighs a little over ten pounds, so I broke this one in half which seemed like enough for him.<br /><br />See my tongue-in-cheek comment above about not tasting them, but I do believe there is a bit of salt in these, as a few hours after eating them he was extremely thirsty.<br /><br />Overall, this appears to be a good treat for your dog - time will tell if it helps his teeth!

review/text: I have two dogs, a medium mixed breed and a small Chihuahua who has had a few rotted teeth pulled.  I gave both one each and the mixed breed ate it right up and finished it off in a couple of minutes.  The Chihuahua on the other hand chewed the end for a couple seconds before going into guard mode.  The broke it in half in hopes that he could chew from the middle which is smaller than the ends.  He was able to crew off a half an inch from the middle before giving up again.  At the end of the day, I figured it was too big for him and tossed what was left to my other dog that was more than happy to finish it off.

review/text: If our pup's opinion of these small dental chew treats changes, I will update this review.  I like these puppy dental chew treats because they keep her busy for a longer period of time than most chew treats.  She chews on them but she is not that crazy about them because she will quit chewing and leave it while she does something else.  I think it may be the mint flavor that is not her favorite because she has other mint flavored chew bones that she will chew on and then leave unfinished.  However, I am keeping these chew treats for back-up and am not sorry I bought them.

It became minty bad breath, but it was still icky breath.<br /><br />My yorkie, on the other hand, didn't really care too much for these treats. He'd tried them only because the other dog was enjoying it so much, but never cared for them much.<br /><br />From an owner's point of view, I do like the good ingredients these chew treats have. They don't get sticky, they are not messy, and they smell ok. I would gladly buy these again seeing how much my chiweenie enjoyed them.

review/text: My 21 lb Cockapoo loved these treats. He's only 1 1/2 yrs old and I brush his teeth regularly, so his teeth still look great and he does not have bad mouth odor. If the treats helped to clean his teeth it was not noticeable to me. I do wonder how effective the treats are at teeth cleaning and mouth odor because my dog was able to consume them very quickly- within just a few minutes. Perhaps the treats leave some sort of residue in the dog's mouth and on their teeth to prolong the effectiveness. I thought the treats smelled rather strongly of beef stock, though the ingredients list natural chicken flavor, rosemary, parsley, and vanilla among other things. The ingredient list is not too long and are all natural. I've found my Cockapoo to have a rather sensitive stomach and these treats do not upset his digestive tract. I try to buy only natural, limited ingredient foods and treats. Unlike other reviewers, I have had no issues with crumbs or staining from these dark brown treats. My dog tends to eat the treats on our beige leather couches and there has been no residue.

review/summary: The dog loves them and they probably help his teeth
review/text: These treats are a huge hit with the dog; it's the only item he takes to another room to enjoy and be certain that we won't change our minds about it. They've got a tough exterior that he works hard at, but he likes it so well he never gives up. It's about 15 minutes from start to finish. That's a lot of good jaw and tooth exercise.<br /><br />Of course, when we ask him if his teeth feel cleaner, he doesn't say a lot, and a visual inspection doesn't tell us a lot. But with the way he works at these, we're certain it's doing something worthwhile.<br /><br />We've had other rawhide-like treats, and the dog abandons them after a while. Not so with these.<br /><br />We also liked the packaging, which was attractive, reseals nicely, and isn't extravagant or wasteful.<br /><br />The only thing we recommend you watch out for is to get a large enough treat size. We had a package of the "medium" size and for our dog, about 60 pounds, a larger size would have been better.<br /><br />Highly recommended --- by the dog as well as us.

There harder then these are.<br />since these are softer, I think it would do a better job of cleaning there teeth, and gums,<br />cause it rubs around there gums and teeth when they bite into it (if that makes sinse!)<br /><br />I think these are good for there teeth, and gums. Hopefully this will keep there<br />teeth cleaner, and there gums in better health, with fresher breath.<br /><br />I would buy these..

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats!  There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes.  As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />Teeth cleaning ability? We were only able to sample 1 bag up front, so I can not comment on how well they would do over time, but can say that they did appear to be soft and chewy and looked like they would clean teeth over a period of weeks.  As for her breath?  Again, not enough quantity to make a call one way or another, but she did not have what I would consider bad breath.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per...  If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them.  However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them.  In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/summary: Slowly approached, but definitely enjoyed
review/text: My pups (aged 6 & 5) both enjoyed these, but since they talk I couldn't get their "official" position on them.  That said, having trained them extensively I'm pretty good at watching their body language.  When presented with these both pups were eager for a 'treat,' but after getting these in their mouths they both were slightly tentative to dig in.  Perhaps its because my pups normally get high-protein snacks like dried chicken breast, and they're not used to brown rice flour, quinoa flour, pea flour, & tapioca starch. Or perhaps it was the vanilla/mint flavor. Either way, it sort of reminded me of kids acting with trepidation about eating a new vegetable. But, after a few fleeting moments the question marks popping out of their heads went away and both pups earnestly chewed up their treats.<br /><br />The package says "Dental Chews" which normally speaks to an ability to remove tartar or freshen breath. The package states that the product "freshens breath naturally,"  so I assume the mint serves as a breath freshener, thus earning the title "dental chew" instead of "treat."<br /><br />That said, I'm pleased to know the product is wheat-free and corn-free, as I'm not a fan of feeding my pups either one of those all-too-common ingredients.  I was going to give the product four stars because the dogs didn't jump on them like white on rice, but then I realized that this is a very healthy treat that is a whole lot better for them than most of the stuff that's out there, and after the slight hesitation, both dogs seemed to enjoy these very much ... so five stars it is.

review/summary: My dog loved them - good for a special treat.
review/text: I'm not someone who gives their dog all-natural or organic food and treats as a regular thing, but I'm always willing to try something new. I swear my dog could tell by the crinkle of the package that they were for her, and she was at my feet the entire time I was opening the bag. I handed it to her, she grabbed it, and off she went. She devoured it, so I guess it was a success. They are quite a bit more expensive than her daily treats that I buy, but these are great for a now and again treat.

review/text: I got these for my parents dog Mya. I thought that they would be a nice treat for my kids to give Mya when they went to visit. As expected, they were eaten very quickly. This was a nice surprise, as Mya can sometimes be picky with treats.<br /><br />Whether these are healthier, I don't know. While Mya can be picky, most dogs will eat any treat you put in front of them. So it is tough to say how good these are vs other options.<br /><br />I suppose the best thing to do is see if your four-legged friend enjoys them.

review/summary: My boy just loves these smelly things.
review/text: This is not the first doggie treat that Amazon offered me to review.  I do not offer many treats to my Pug so he doesn't get too fat.<br />But I liked that these are more healthy than the usual ones, and the price was even better than the average chew treats.<br />Personally I did not like the smell but he did,and that is all that matters. I had  just got the package in the house when he started to drive me crazy, he actually smelled it through the packaging.<br />He jumped up on my lap and wanted me to open it, and I did, the packaged was easy to open and it comes in a resalable bag.<br />He really loved these, my boy does not always eat treats and has been known to leave them on the floor.  He likes raw fruit and vegetables but he went at these hungrily<br />and finished them in no time. They are the right size for him but they did go down very quickly but he did not pester me for more so I can only assume they filled him up.<br />Now when I give him one he is very attentive and he sits politely so I will let him have it.<br />I would buy these again, I chose the medium size and that was perfect for my boy.

review/text: I love that these chews aren't artificially flavored and colored and don't have any of those odd animal body parts (pig ear, cow toe whatever) that are kind of repulsive to think about. Even better, shaggy dog seems to like them, too.  I do have to admit that even after chewing this he has doggy breath, but there's no saying it wouldn't have been worse without these chews.

review/summary: Great dental treat
review/text: These dental chews are both a great treat for your dog as well supposedly helping with tartar buildup.  My dog, who is normally picky with treats, devoured these.  Being a fifty pound dog, it's also the perfect size for her -- not bulky like some rawhides (which she detests) and not too small like some treats.  One per evening was sufficient for her.<br /><br />My only knock on these is they are a bit pricey.  There are comparable products available priced a few dollars less.  If the price is reasonable to the consumer, I'd definitely recommend trying them as a healthy treat for your dog.

review/text: I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.

review/summary: love these
review/text: I get a lot of stuff from the Amazon Vine program but this is the first item that I liked so much that I added a subscription to my account for them. Freakin' LOVE these things. My golden retriever is 3 years old. She sees the vet every six months (ongoing medical issue) and each time the vet checks her teeth. She has never had to have a vet cleaning because I'm a bit compulsive about keeping her teeth clean. She normally gets a Greenie a day along with an additive in her water and regular teeth brushing. Yet there always seems to be a bit of tarter build up on her back teeth that I end up scrapping off with a scaler. After chomping down just two of these, that tartar was completely gone. The nice part is that they are much harder for her to chew than the Greenies. Even though I gave her size medium, it still took her several minutes to chew it up. (Greenies are gone within a matter of seconds) And she LOVES them. I'm pretty sure she would save a baby from a blazing inferno if she thought that is what it would take to get one. When she sees me going for the bag, she starts in with doing all the tricks she can think of. Hilarious to watch. They smell...interesting. Like mint and beef jerky? I can't put my finger on the smell exactly. It's not bad or anything. I am now getting a bag of mediums sent each month and will make it a part of her weekly dental hygiene. Very glad to have found these!

review/summary: Great for bad dog breath!
review/text: The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a really strong minty, doggy smell. I still can't decide what it is beneath the mint, but it is potent! Whatever it is, my little Maltese had no problem with it. She quickly buried the first one in the backyard, which she only does with things she really likes. She'll recover it later, I'm sure. The next day I gave her another one which she worked on for several hours before it was gone. When she jumped in my lap later, I immediately noticed that her bad breath problem was gone...wow! And it seems to last for hours. For us this is a big plus since doggy halitosis is a big problem with her.<br /><br />Another big pro for me is that these chews contain no wheat or corn products which cause allergy problems for my dog. Treats that she actually likes that don't contain these products are hard to find.<br /><br />One other con besides the strong odor is the gassiness that occurs later. I might not have put two and two together on this had several other reviewers not mentioned it. This is not normally a problem with her, however, and since nothing else in her diet has changed, I would have to attribute it to the Zoe chews.<br /><br />Since bad breath is such a problem with our dog, I might be tempted to purchase them regularly, even if the price works out to $2 per chew (5 in a bag @ $10 per bag). I might shop around first to see if I can find a better price, though. Maybe I could make them a weekly treat instead of a daily one.

He doesn't even like those popular greenies or any other dental chew we have tried.<br /><br />At least, we found these. He absolutely love them. Our other dog likes them too, but he likes everything.<br /><br />They do have a mild smell but it isn't unpleasant to me. The first ingredients are brown rice and quinoa so I like that these aren't made out of junk fillers like so many dog treats and chews. on the market.

review/summary: Vanilla mint?
review/text: I understand that it says vanilla mint flavor, but I also expected it to smell something like that.  To be blunt, it is funky!  All three of my dogs (two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier)seemed to think that they smelled great, so who am I to judge.  I am careful about the treats that they get because the cocker spaniels try to inhale most of them.  These actually took them a while to annihilate.  Some treats leave a sticky residue on them and the carpet, but these weren't messy.  Although they smelled funky, the smell didn't linger on their breath.  The size was excellent for my dogs.  A lot of treats that are recommended for their size tend to be much smaller.  Six came in the pack, so I waited a while before giving them the second round.  They are a bit too expensive for me to buy regularly.  If they ever go on sale I would probably stock up.  Overall a pretty good product.

review/text: My dogs (a 20-lb. and 32-lb. terrier mixes) showed their approval by enthusiastically accepting these chews and wagged their tales eagerly for more. To be fair, they love nearly all treats, but I approve of these, as well, because of the healthful ingredients, neutral odor (at least I couldn't smell them without getting down on hands and knees to sniff), and lack of slobber-staining as the dogs (as usual) chose out area rugs to enjoy their treats. I noticed no sharp points as they chewed, and the dogs are chew-savvy enough not to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />With high quality ingredients and a high terrier approval rating, I highly recommend Zoe Anti-Oxident Dental Chew Treats.

review/text: At last, a dental chew that my one dog doesn't inhale in one bite. Altho, it does smell pretty gross -- doggie chew on steroids, proteiny smell. I didn't detect any of the vanilla mint they were talking about in the description.<br />I was pleased to see Maggie the Inhaler actually working little pieces off of these. Her chomping down entire Greenies has worried me in the past. Because if it's in her stomach whole then it's doing nothing for her teeth.<br />The smell, like many dog treats, is a little overpowering. But I'll put up with it, if it's actually helping get her teeth a little cleaner.

review/summary: 6 out of 6 Dogs love these chew bones
review/text: We have 6 big dogs here, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Walker Treeing Coonhound. These dogs go through a bunch of snacks, treats, bones and toys to say the least. I am always on the lookout for healthier snacks - especially since the Ridgebacks tend to be sensitive to corn and wheat. (oddly enough, the random squirrel doesn't phase them)I like these Zoe Dental Chew Bones - no corn, no wheat and no soy.<br /><br /> When the bag was first opened, the smell of roasted chicken wafted out - good first impression! They don't feel particularly greasy to the touch, yet clearly have a flavored coating. I passed one out to each dog and they went to their respective beds to knaw away. The Ridgebacks can burn through other brands of similar type chews within a few bites, so I expected the same thing here. They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better. That was astonishing - these are hounds and they always assume someone else has something better than they were given. Meanwhile, that smell of roasted chicken has permeated the kitchen - so much so that now I want chicken for lunch! I will buy these in the future for our Heathens.

Now, the pups have always farted but these treats seem to stimulated their little gas makers to go full tilt.<br /><br />As instructed, I haven't given more than one treat a day and I've skipped days and now I also know better than to give them the treats in the evening.  All I need is to have a bedroom filled with a bunch of dogs pootering all night long.<br /><br />As for the treats themselves they smell like mint and molasses to me.  They're somewhat glossy and you get 6 medium-sized 5" bones to a bag.  Pricy.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll buy any of these "Lifestyle Treats for Dogs" in the future due to the costs and the farts but the dogs like them well enough.<br /><br />Is being a dog really a lifestyle?

She'll chew on one for a few minutes, but she won't go to town on it like she will other chews (raw hide, pig ears, etc.  So I don't think she "loves" them.<br /><br />Anyway, I broke it down a little further, as I'm sure every dog is different and some dogs might really love these.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Really nice and hard, will last a long time, take a long time for the dog to chew up.<br />- Made of quality ingredients, no corn, wheat or soy or other junk.<br />- package is nice and neat, not excessive, hard to get open, or anything like that.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- They smell really odd.  Almost like... breakfast sausage, but less appealing.  Our dog keeps her toys and 1 or 2 chews she's working on in the living room.  All the other kinds/brands she has, I can never smell them later.  But even after two days, I can still smell the thing when I walk into the living room.  Not really crazy about that, especially since she doesn't look like she'll finish one sooner than a week.<br /><br />- The price.  To me, the price seems a little high for what you get, even with the subscribe and save.<br /><br />If the smell wasn't so strong, I would probably give these 5 stars.  And our dog is still technically a puppy (lab) so perhaps she'll like them better as she gets a little older.

review/summary: A treat I can feel good about
review/text: My beagles really loved these. The bones are approx. 4 inches long and kind of shaped like a real chicken bone.  When I opened the bag, I could really smell them - not really a good smell, but I guess it's something dogs like. Once they started eating them, I could smell the mint. I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.  The price is definitely not out of line with other treats that are similar to this, such as Greenies and Healthy Edibles.  I'll probably continue to buy these.

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: I have 4 miniature dachshunds and one is very picky about his treats. Usually he snubs treats. I usually don't buy treats like these bones, but thought they might be a good change for my pooches (especially their breath). I was completely surprised when all the dogs LOVED them. In fact, the picky one ate his and then tried stalking the girls to get their bones, too. He never does that! While I might not have bought these bones again because they are a little pricey (about $10 for 6 bones), I think now I am going to have to invest in some more seeing as they made the dogs so happy! I can't say much about the breath enhancement- it still smells pretty foul in there- but maybe they need to experience the bones a bit more before there is any breath improvement. I guess these will become a regular treat in my house since it is the first thing short of a juicy steak I have seen the dogs so excited about!

review/text: Like everything else these days, even dog treats are going green, high-tech, and health-conscious!  Just look at the product description for these chew treats!  We have a 2-yo golden/Labrador retriever mix, the best dog we've ever had, and while the unusual makeup of these goodies gave him brief pause to consider, he was chowing down heartily before too long.  And the best news is, as a breath mint they affirmatively do the job!  No more doggie breath!  And it's a pleasant coincidence that Zoe (a Greek word for "life") is a family name shared by my mom and HER mom, so that's a nice touch that you don't care about but I wanted to mention to pad out this review.  Let your dog enjoy a package of these and I bet you'll be back for more!

review/summary: Kitty finds just ok
review/text: My cat can only eat grain free cat treats, due to digestive system problems. These treats are not his favorite but he will eat them. He prefers Snack 21's other dried fish, herring is his favorite. They are good for cats with sensitive stomachs since they are pure fish. It certaintly wouldn't hurt to try the Pacific Whiting flavor, maybe your cat will love it.

review/text: It's true! This does add an exquisite flavor to almost anything! Try it on ice cream, fruits, jellies, sodas, you name it! Also a stimulant ofr the appetite and for flatulence! And it's not just for bart-ending! Even though it's almost 45% Alcohol by volume. You won't believe the difference until you try it! And I just discovered it's supposed to be the best mosquito repellent around! Be warned though that it will stain clothing, fabric, and most items if left to dry on them.

review/summary: Bitter's are also a Great Digestive Aid
review/text: In my nutrition class I have learned that "bitter" along with the other tastes our taste buds detect, helps digestion by stimulating digestive juices.  Digestion is very important.  I had this in my liquor cabinet and thought I would give it try.  I like the taste quite well.  I really can feel my stomach juices moving around.  Digestion is key to nutrition because without it, our body's can lack assimilation of important minerals, vitamins, fats and proteins.  Taking bitters w/ food can be a great start to a healthy digestion foundation.<br /><br />Since the formula is a "secret" (as stated at Angostura" website, I am unable to decipher if this has the roots & herbs that are commonly used to promote digestive secretions.  I think most people who buy this would be using it in their alcoholic drinks, but I don't think it hurts to use it for a digestive aid.  I think I only used it once for a mixed drink so, here is another use for this famous product.  A little dash here and there on foods. )<br /><br />On the label it says one to four teaspoonfuls taken before meals for appetite and digestion.  Can also be used for flatulence.  Add's a delightful flavor to beverages, salads, veggies, gravies, fish, grapefruit etc.

review/summary: Can't find in stores
review/text: Anyone who knows anything about mixology, knows bitters are an essential ingredient in a well stocked bar, esp. in making 'old fashions'.  As a former country club bartender, I found that ginger ale w/ bitters is good too.  It is unbelievable to me that some restaurant bars and even casinos do not stock 'bitters'.  It is indicative to me then, that other things in the business may be lacking as well...

review/text: Moles and/or Voles were turning my garden into swiss cheese.  After putzing around for 2 years, I put this stuff down twice about 7 days between apps, right before some forecasted rain showers...this really works.  I have to admit, I put it down about 2x per the instructions, and then followed up with a liquid concentrate from another company, covering the gardens and lawn.  I would definitely use this again!

review/text: I tried the repellent and gas bombs, the only thing that worked were the traps. You have to dig a hole but if you don't kill the gophers they will destroy your yard so a hole is no big deal.<br /><br />I used the Sweeneys Gopher traps they worked great.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZONYPE">Sweeneys 9013 Gopher Trap, 2-Pack</a><br /><br />As a follow up we have killed all the gophers on our 5 acres (at least the active ones), we did this in 3 days. We spent 3 months trying repellents and gas bombs.

review/summary: Made everything worse
review/text: This repellent needs a hard rain to soak into the ground, not just a sprinkler.  The first couple applications I put down just seemed to freak the moles out, causing them to run into the good yard.  i bought two more bags to make a thick barrier between my good yard and the mole infested areas, but now I have fresh new mole trails deep into the good part of the yard.<br /><br />The directions should say to wait until it rains.  I don't think the sprinkler for 20-30 minutes does the job.  I guess I will just have to use grub killer in the spring and hope my grass fills in over winter.<br /><br />F.

review/summary: Awesome stuff
review/text: We have a cow pasture next to our yard and the moles apparently decided that our yard was paradise.  For 7 years they kept moving more and more of their families in, and nothing I tried would work.  I used bombs, traps, water, even chewing gum.  Then I found Sweeney's Mole & Gopher Repellent about 3 years ago.  I chased them from the yard following the instructions, and now I shake it all around the perimeter of our yard a couple times a year.  I think we've seen 2 moles total in the past 3 years.  And it's so easy to use.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HHO8HW">Sweeney's 7001 4-Pound Mole and Gopher Repellent Granules</a>

review/text: I put the product in backyard a month or so ago, just before we had rain. It seemed to work as I didn't see any gopher activity since then until today when the holes were back and I could see a gopher popping out of a hole. I quickly watered the hole. I saw nowhere in the instructions that you have to continually put the product in the yard. I saw one review where the animal control expert says the product doesn't work if the holes are deep.

review/text: It works for just for about two or so weeks. I followed instructions to the T and actually double applied it just for safe measure since I was going away for two weeks. Well, after coming back, I had over 10 new large holes. It puts crop circles to shame. I turned to an animal control expert and they said, the problem I had, the tunnels are too deep. The product only works if the tunnels are close the surface. Anything greater than 2-4" is useless.

review/text: These snacks are my dogs favorite and they really helped me out when house-training her. I was breaking them into 3 pieces and she got a bit every time she did her business outside. It was only a couple of days before she realized she got rewarded for going outside and as soon as we came inside, she would sit on the kitchen floor and look at the drawer where I keep the treats. Very soft texture and they smell so much like real jerky my husband nearly tried one!

My 18 year old daughter and I just love this, and I am one that always prefers unflavored coffees!....until now anyway. I don't drink alcohol, so can't tell you if this is identical to the Kahlua liquor.  I can tell you it is a mighty fine blend of caramel, vanilla & black coffee flavors that is "just right"  I will continue to buy this through Amazon because I haven't found it on store shelves in the southern Illinois area yet.

review/text: This is my new favorite coffee that I found in the grocery store as a seasonal item and am excited to find an online source for.  It is so strong you can smell it through the sealed package. When brewing a pot, I use less grounds than I normally do as they are ground so fine and coffee is so bold and flavors so strong.  Helps make it last even longer.  Love to brew a pot because the entire house smells so good.
