review/summary: Good but....
review/text: Received only (1) - 2.5 oz dark chocolate bar,and we were expecting (12 bars) as stated in advertisement, so that was a disappointment to start with.  My husband and I shared the 2.5 oz bar, and we both felt that the quality was just average.  It was good, not too bitter, but not the best dark chocolate I've taste either. Based on the price, we would probably not purchase these in the future, as there are cheaper choices that are of the same quality, in my opinion.

review/summary: Rich, Delicious Chocolate
review/text: I have a major sweet tooth, and my favorite dessert is chocolate. I can't get enough of the stuff. This made Newman's Own Organic chocolate a natural choice for me. I wasn't sure what to expect since I haven't had a lot of organic chocolate, but I really liked this bar. It was thicker and harder than I'm used to (that's what she said), and I generally prefer my chocolate soft and creamy. However, the thickness means you get a lot in every bite. I wouldn't call this chocolate creamy, exactly, but it has a smooth texture. I liked the way it melted in my mouth. One thing I noticed is that tiny flakes remained as the chocolate melted; this gave it a pleasant texture. The bar was also full of flavor, almost too rich to finish in one sitting. It was sweet, too, but not too sweet (it's 54% cacao, in case that's not in the description). I really prefer the sweeter milk chocolate, but not everyone does, and this was good dark chocolate.<br /><br />As for nutrition, it could have been better. There are 22g of fat and 330 calories. I worry more about saturated fat, and there were 13g of that here. There were 28g sugar, about average for candy, and 37g carbs. However, I think the slightly high numbers here are due to the fact that the bar is bigger than most. It looks smaller than a Hershey's bar when you get it, but like I said, it's thick. I don't think it's meant to be eaten in one sitting. It's divided into six pieces, so it's easy to eat a little at a time (or is it?). It's 2.25oz/64g. I don't know if that's a lot, but other consumers might. All the ingredients are organic, of course, and cane sugar is better for you than processed sugar, anyway. Besides, we all know that chocolate is full of anti-oxidants, and dark chocolate doesn't have so much sugar.<br /><br />This chocolate is certified organic by the USDA and Oregon tilth. It also uses Rainforest Alliance certified cacao, which should please the environmentally conscious. The wrapper is all paper, easily recyclable.<br /><br />I found the packaging attractive, too. The background is brown with pinstripes, and the logos are in black and white and bordered in gold. It has a classy look. The information about the product is easy to find; it says dark chocolate in big letters on the front, along with the cacao percentage. The ingredients are clearly listed, as are the nutrition facts (though I wish the important stuff had been in a table for easier reference). Also, the organic labels are prominently displayed (except for the Oregon Tilth one, which is easy to miss). If you want to find out more about the company's organic program is listed. The address is also printed and easy to find in case you want to contact the company. Finally, there's a picture of the founders on the back (which seems like an attempt to make the company seem homey), and it kind of looked like American Gothic. I found this amusing. The overall presentation is a good one, and it's attractive enough to make a nice gift, I think.<br /><br />So all in all, I thought this was a great chocolate bar. It's rich and smooth, and you get a lot for your money. It's certified organic, and it's environmentally sound, too. Great for health and environment conscious chocoholics!

review/summary: Pretty dang bad
review/text: In the last year or so I've really developed a taste for dark chocolate. I've liked dark chocolate for years but I started eating a bit more recently. I've tried several different brands from the store. All were at least good with some being a little better than others.<br /><br />So. While not scientific my personal taste experience says this dark chocolate bar taste terrible.<br /><br />If you are looking for that silky smooth deep rich dark chocolate flavor that sort of infuses your whole body starting with the tongue and culminating in a very pleasing feeling in your nogging look elsewhere. My God.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are really into organics and go out of your way to eat all things organic then perhaps this is your chocolate bar. 54% is not a very dark bar and I think it shows in the taste of this bar. The taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar. That being the case, if you prefer that organic experience, that taste that organics typically have I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For everyone else, the flavor is off with strange undertones. Not inedible just not very tasty.<br /><br />The bars are fairly small at 2.25 ounces. That isn't really a knock since moderation in all things is a good habit.

review/summary: A little too sweet...
review/text: With all the organic, single-origin, Fair Trade, 80% + dark chocolates available even in discount stores, I am not quite sure why Newman's Own brand wanted to get in the chocolate business. Anyway, this is a very light-weight entry into the fray, and at only 54% pure chocolate (in the Vine sample I received, anyway), a quite weak entry at that. It tasted okay, but definitely too sweet and lacking the earthy bitter-sweet taste of the more cacao bean-heavy chocolates available. Not much different than a decent Hershey dark chocolate bar, and likely much more expensive.

review/text: I was excited to try this chocolate as I'm such a fan of Newman's Own products in general.  It was good, but I found it a little disappointing.  It has a rich chocolate taste, but the texture is a bit too dry for just eating (which is what I intended to do with it).  It might work well for baking, but I haven't tried that yet...probably would work to chop up in pieces for cookies.

review/summary: Makes a great Smores
review/text: I am but a simple man!  Complexities of taste and aroma are probably lost on me.  If I tell you, in a fake French accent, about the complexity of the flavor, it's probably because I'm trying to get your phone number.<br /><br />I did like this, though.<br /><br />This was a bit sweeter and creamier than most dark chocolate I've had, which can edge towards the bitter (aw we-we).<br /><br />Consequently, I liked it a lot.<br /><br />I decided to make Smores out of it.<br /><br />This turned out to be A Good Idea.  Probably offending lots of chocolate aficionados, who are even now fainting while someone waves a fan at them; I'm just sayin', next camping trip?  Box of these.  Far superior to Hershey's.<br /><br />As for "organic", I confess I appreciate things made with sugar.  I don't really buy into the horror stories of high fructose corn syrup, I just think sugar tastes better.  Kinda like those horribly overpriced sodas made with sugar.  THEY ARE SO GOOD.  But I digress.<br /><br />This is a great chocolate bar.  It has that dark chocolate flavor, yet it's creamier and more on the sweet side than most dark chocolates. I thought they really found the sweet spot.<br /><br />So to speak.<br /><br />Now about that phone number...

review/summary: Too good for mere mortals
review/text: Chocolate is one of the few luxuries accessible to anyone. Researchers say that it even boosts endorphins in the brain, those feel good chemicals that decrease pain and heighten mood. But most of us love it for the sheer sensual taste and texture. Lesser quality brands can give the impression of eating brown bees wax, and while preferences and tastes vary, quality chocolate can make your eyes roll back in your head and for a few seconds your whole existence becomes only taste buds and ecstasy. So where does Newman's Own stand on the chocolate experience scale? Again, that's subjective. But my opinion as a chocolate lover is that it's one of the best I've ever tasted. The first thing you notice is that it immediately begins to melt in your mouth.  In fact, I tested the theory with one square of the bar, and it did completely melt without making a single bite in a minute or so. The flavor is very rich, creamy and flavorful without being the least bit bitter. It's made responsibly using organic materials and I like buying Newman Products knowing that they give all profits to charity and in the 26 years of their existence have donated over $300 million to worthy causes. How does it compare in regard to value? At around $2 per ounce it's about half the price of Amedei - No 9, the chocolate bar judged as the best in the world by the Academy of Chocolate. Be aware that it is a chocolate bar and not in a decorative box for giving as a gift. But for a small slice of heaven in the privacy of your mouth it's a great choice.

review/text: Newman's Own is my favorite brand and I try all of their products.  However, this one is a failure.  The bar is bland and I guess 54% cocoa is not enough.  I am sure as chocolate bars go, this is nutritious, but frankly, it is hard to find a nutritious chocolate bar.  If you want nutrition it would be best to go and  get an apple.  When I want chocolate, nutrition is not even on my mind.  Decadence is.  This bar is not decadent enough.  Keep looking.

review/summary: a chocolate lover's perspective
review/text: As a true connoisseur of chocolate, I was interested in this new dark chocolate bar from Newman's. In truth I've always thought the Newman chocolate bars to be overly sweet and not particularly rich tasting. I thought from the hype that this new line of products would be different but I sad to report that is simply not the case here. In fact these new gourmet bars taste much the same as the standard line of Newman's own chocolates. There is still the problem of being overly sweet and considering how dark these are supposed to be, they don't have that deep rich dark chocolate flavor and texture that I am always looking for.<br /><br />n summary I just want to be clear and say that if you are looking for that killer concentrated rich dark chocolate flavor I'm sorry to report that you won't find it here.

If you are a fan of Dark Chocolates on the bitter end of the spectrum then you would not care for this chocolate necessarily.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that the quality was very good, it was pleasant to eat.  It had, perhaps, a slight aftertaste that reminded me of oranges.<br /><br />Good stuff, if you like mild dark chocolate, you wont be disappointed.

review/summary: Mild and semi-sweet
review/text: This bar reminds me of the semi-sweet chocolate used in baking.  The chocolate is neither instense on chocolate flavor nor very sweet, nor very smooth and creamy.<br /><br />My wife the dark chocolate aficionado in the house prefers a more instense dark chocolate - usually in the 70% + cocoa range.  Myself, the milk chocolate fan prefers a more smooth, sweet, and creamy chocolate.  In comparison, we bought a bar of Hershey's Extra Dark (60% cocoa) and it was both more intense and sweeter.  We both preferred it to the Newman's bar - surprising result for me considering I prefer milk to dark chocolate.<br /><br />I suppose those that prefer a semi-sweet, not overly creamy, medium intense chocolate this might be the ticket.  For us this  chocolate, though not bad per se, isn't what we are looking for when we want something to indulge in.

I prefer dark chocolate, typically with a higher % rating then this has but hey chocolate is chocolate so I wasn't going to turn down trying it. It reminded me far more of a bittersweet (think chocolate chip) then of my typical dark chocolate bars. It wasn't bad by any means but it didn't stand out as amazing either. It's obviously worlds above your typical "candy isle" bar but I wouldn't pick it out when compared to other organic dark chocolate options at a specialty market. For those interested in moving into dark chocolate for health benefits this might be a good transition bar into those with a higher % if you're used to milk chocolates.

review/summary: Pretty good taste, even better fringe benefits
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is a pretty good chocolate bar that has more going for it than just taste. First, it's USDA certified organic. I try to use organic products as much as possible, particularly on less costly products and those where organic matters. Second, the product is Rainforest Alliance Certified cacao. So the cacao is produced using sustainable growing techniques. These are the things about the product that I like best. And sometimes, it's these factors that make the difference between buying product A or B.<br /><br />As far as the taste ... well, it is not the best chocolate bar I have ever tried, nor is it the worst. First, the bar is about 7 mm thick ... moderately chunky as bars go. There is a classy-looking N emblem embossed in each piece. The nutritional panel says that one bar is a serving, but that one serving is going to provide about 330 calories ... actually 1/3 of a bar is a serving for me. The chocolate is not very melty. This is more common in higher cacao content chocolate bars; Newman's Own bar is about 54% cacao, so I was a little surprised. The bar was also a little sweeter than I expected. The chocolate was not unpleasant, but it just seemed to lack a "smack your face" slap of chocolate flavor that you expect in good dark chocolate.<br /><br />So, bottom line time: Newman's own is a decent but unremarkable chocolate bar. It's organic and Rainforest-friendly, and earns the product bonus points in my book.

review/summary: Not Bitter & Not Acidic . . . .
review/text: I eat all types of chocolate, from the cheapest to the most expensive I get as gifts.  Dark chocolate is my favorite.  Recent medical studies are now showing dark chocolate can help prevent heart attacks and strokes, and help keep those individuals who have already had heart attacks from an earlier death.  It also is suppose to make you happy, although I think that theory is being debated.<br /><br />Dark chocolate definitely makes me happy!  I wish I had a whole crate of Newman's dark chocolate bars.  It has a nice sweet taste, without tasting like milk chocolate. (Not that I have anything whatsoever against milk chocolate.)  It also does not leave a bad acid aftereffect as some chocolate bars do.  And if you only eat a small amount a day, there will be no bad weight aftereffect, either.

review/summary: Creamy Smooth Dark Chocolate
review/text: This is an excellent creamy smooth dark chocolate with more depth then expected for a 54% cocoa bar. This is between the best milk chocolate and the best dark chocolate. So if you are venturing into dark chocolate for the first time or want something in the middle then this product is very good. I taste tested this with three other chocolate lovers and we rated this the best mid level dark chocolate we had tasted. One taster stated this could become her new favorite chocolate. This is probably not for the extreme dark chocolate lovers, but all in all, a very good chocolate and highly recommended!!

review/text: I have not yet experienced a strikeout amongst the Newman's Own line of products, and this is no exception. Smooth, delightful, with just the right balance of bitter and sweet, this is the perfect capper to a light dinner or late coffee...or even just as a quick boost or snack. It was difficult to do, but I rationed myself to one small piece a night until it was gone. And when it was gone, I immediately went and bought another one. And of course, charity benefits from the profits.

review/text: Newman's Own is not known as a chocolate brand. They make organic stuff like lemonade and pizza, so I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />What I really like about this chocolate bar is its balance: it is not as silky smooth as a Lindt or Dove, it is not as bitter as you would expect from a 56% cacao bar. It is dark but not too dark, Sweet but not too sweet. Smooth but not too velvety. I could not help but finish the entire bar in one sitting.

review/text: I am surprised to see so many strong negative reviews for "Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar". Personally, I find the taste to be delicious; it (the taste) is rich in chocolate flavor, while also avoiding the overly-sweet sugar taste that is common with lower-end chocolate confections. "Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar" also manages to minimize the bitter taste that is common for dark chocolate, which is a huge plus for me, considering that I am not a big fan of dark chocolate in the first place.<br /><br />In all, highly recommended.

review/summary: Chocolaty Goodness
review/text: As a fan of chocolate I couldn't miss the opportunity to taste test Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate.  Probably the only drawback was that I was going to have to share some with my wife.  The chocolate doesn't have a strong aroma when you open the package, but the taste is excellent.  The chocolate breaks nicely, doesn't crumble.  It isn't waxy and has a great feel in the mouth, very creamy.  While it has a good taste, the chocolate doesn't overwhelm your taste buds.  I was a little disappointed in the "finish" - there wasn't a long lasting flavor in the chocolate, and that, perhaps is the one drawback I had from eating the chocolate.

review/summary: Less bitter than most dark chocolate; earthy and delicious.
review/text: I love dark chocolate; I vastly prefer it over the overly-sweet milk chocolate, so when I saw this organic dark chocolate, I knew I had to try it.<br /><br />It's delicious!  I will admit that I like my dark chocolate somewhat bitter, and this isn't terribly bitter the way some darks can be.  However it does have a unique, somewhat "earthy" taste that is all its own.  I ate my test bar in three different sittings in order to gauge its taste in three ways:<br /><br />1. With coffee... after a bitter cup of coffee, this chocolate is just sinfully delicious!<br /><br />2. After Italian food... after some garlic, again, this stuff is just sinfully delicious!<br /><br />3. After some chocolate ice cream... after this, the dark chocolate did have a less sugary taste, and "seemed" more bitter just because of that difference.  Again, it really hit the spot here too.<br /><br />Overall I will definitely be trying some more of this.  It is REALLY good stuff!

review/summary: Tasty & Organic, but Hershey's Gets the Gold
review/text: When I received my Newman's Dark Chocolate Bar, I resisted the urge to tear right into it since I wanted to write a meaningful review.  When my wife got home from work, we each tried a small bite and agreed it was pretty tasty.  But you can say that about almost any chocolate bar; so the question is, just how tasty is it?  To decide I bought two other bars that seemed pretty comparable: a Hershey's Extra Dark Chocolate Bar ($1.89 for 3.52 oz) and a Cadbury Royal Dark Bar ($1.35 for 3.5 oz).  The Newman's bar runs about $2.15 each for 2.25 oz when bought in a pack of 12.  My wife and I sampled each, and here's what we found:<br /><br />- Newman's: A very mild and smooth taste, almost bland.  It has a slight sugar aftertaste.<br />- Hershey's: The most chocolaty tasting, and sweetest, but with a slightly waxy texture.<br />- Cadbury: Creamy, with a sharper taste, less sweetness, and more bitterness.<br /><br />Our unanimous verdict: While they were all good, and we'd have been happy to eat more of any of these bars, Hershey's was the best, with Newman's running second.<br /><br />If I was concerned about buying an organic chocolate bar, Newman's would be a fine choice.  But you pay more, and get less chocolate, to have the "organic" label.  For me, I'll stick with the Hershey's, unless I'm in the mood for a more bitter experience, and then I'll go for the Cadbury's.

review/summary: I liked it... but your results might vary!!!
review/text: I let the bar sit on the counter for a couple of days after it was delivered (Vine Program)  I split the bar with my 17 year old daughter and she agreed with my assessment.  The bar had good dark chocolate taste, typical aftertaste, a bit of grit (not a bad thing)and generally an excellent experience.  The difference between this bar and most other dark chocolates I have tried was how creamy the texture was as I was chewing it.  Reminded me more of a Hershey's bar in consistency...  Perusing other folks' reviews, I saw several mentions of the taste being bitter.  Assuming that folks weren't eating these right after dinner - I am wondering if there are any issues with quality control - since I only had the one bar to try, that is only a thought!!!<br /><br />All in all... I thought the bar was excellent, uniquely creamy and soft versus my normal dark chocolate bars, and left me wanting more.  With the varied reviews, I will probably pick a bar or two up at the store and try again before buying 12 packs...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/summary: Scores well for what it is
review/text: There are so many dark chocolate bars out these days from all over the world.  Many claim to be delicious as well as healthy.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar seems worthy of praise even though the percent of dark chocolate is somewhat low compared to others. However, it has a creaminess and flavor that are above some dark bars.<br /><br />The waxiness of some chocolate bars is overly apparent, but Newman's is soft without the waxy feel.  It melts nicely in your mouth and because it's organic, it makes you feel like you're eating something that may be good for you.  People worry about additives, pesticides, etc. and this product, being organic, seems to avoid all the bad stuff.  Of course, it is a bit higher in fat than most dark chocolate bars, but if you don't mind that, the taste is good.<br /><br />The size of the bar is a bit small, 2.25 ounce, the price is about the same for other similar products.  On the other hand, a smaller bar is probably better than buying a large size one and devouring all of it.  I think it's a delicious tasting dark chocolate and I would probably buy it again.

It was something of a disappointment:  kind of waxy, too sweet, and the intense flavor of really good dark chocolate was missing.  You can really tell how good something is around here by how long it lasts -- and we still have about 1/3 of the bar left after about two weeks.  I'd skip the chocolate bar, but the Newman's Own "oreo" cookies are fabulous.

review/summary: Good taste, but great economic impact
review/text: MMMM chocolate.  Can you ever actually give a bad review of chocolate?  In my opinion, no.  Even bad chocolate is still pretty good, because, well, it's chocolate.  However, this chocolate was exceptionally good.<br /><br />Consistent with the Newman branding, this product is organic and takes into consider the impact it's purchases make by using cocoa purchases certified by the Rainforest Alliance.<br /><br />This dark chocolate, made with real sugar, was slightly sweeter than I expected, but still had a rich depth to it.  Although it was 54% cocoa, it tasted like more.  Honestly, I've had better, but considering that this is both organic and sustainably produced some sacrifices have to be made.  This is a high fat and high calorie product, so be careful not to eat too much.  This probably comes partially from their use of whole milk but the percent of milk and chocolate liquor weren't specified so it's unclear what the technical classification of this product should be:  dark chocolate or milk chocolate.<br /><br />Overall a tasty treat that is great choice for those concerned about organic and sustainable products.  If  health or taste are your primary concern, you'll find better choices elsewhere.

review/text: We love lots of different Newman's Own products, and have been devotees of Sockarooni pasta sauce and the mint chocolate chip cookies and the Caesar dressing for years. So we had high hopes for this chocolate. But sadly, those hopes were not fulfilled. The chocolate is good, not overly sweet, but just does not seem to rise to premium grade. The mouth feel was not as silky or smooth as we would like, and frankly a bit waxy. And there was something just not very distinctive to the chocolatiness of it all.

review/text: I am a fan of the Newman's Own company, and its philanthropic mission. Some of their products are quite good, such as their spaghetti sauce and oreo-type cookies. This chocolate bar was not quite what I anticipated - sweeter and more buttery than I expect from a premium dark chocolate bar. The flavor does not linger on the palate and each square seems "over" far too soon.  Still, one thing I've learned from reading and writing reviews on Amazon is that there's an enthusiastic audience for just about anything, so I'm sure other folks will enjoy this more than I did.  Still, I think Newman's would do well to butch this bar up a bit, and let those with sweet tooths go for their milk chocolate instead.  Each to their own, I suppose.

review/summary: Disappointing - but hey! It's still chocolate!
review/text: Let me preface my review with this confession: I'm a chocoholic.  There's no such thing as "too rich" or "too much chocolate" or "too decadent."  I love me some chocolate goodness.  Milk chocolate, dark chocolate...not so much white chocolate and none of the fruit flavored chocolate.  My personal favorite is dark chocolate, but not that too dark chocolate that seems to be popular lately.  Now on with the review...<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the Newman's Own brand and have a complete appreciation for organic products.  I had very high hopes for this chocolate bar.  Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed on several levels.  I found the chocolate to be drier than what my palate prefers, resulting in chocolate crumbles when I break off the pieces.  I don't like when chocolate (even the crumbles) goes to waste.  After all, any chocolate is good chocolate.<br /><br />I could tell, however, that the flavor of this chocolate was very pure.  It didn't have that "additive" flavor to it that some chocolate brands have.<br /><br />My last beef with Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate bar is that the squares are too big and don't break off easily.  I like bars that have smaller squares/rectangles to break off.  Because of the dry nature of the chocolate, there was never a clean break on the pieces.  It's a small, nitpicky thing, I know, but still something that matters to me when selecting a chocolate bar.<br /><br />And what made me ultimately give this chocolate only 3 stars was that after I broke off a few pieces and tucked the rest back in my purse, I COMPLETELY forgot I had any leftover.  This never happens to me.  I always break off a piece, and then save some for "later."  Later meaning about 3 minutes.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar had me forgetting I even had any accessible chocolate for several DAYS until I happened to spot it in my purse again.  That should tell you something.

review/summary: High-quality, deep dark chocolate
review/text: My husband is Belgian, and Belgians know their chocolate.  One of the many benefits of being married to him is the exposure to the vast array of superb Belgian chocolate.  Over time, my chocolate palate has become a lot more refined, to the point that I generally prefer dark chocolate with all its richness and subtleties to the overly sweet stuff that passes for chocolate in the U.S.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that this chocolate does not disappoint.  From the very first bite, I knew it was a winner.  It's smooth with a soft but pleasantly bitter edge.  It's the kind of chocolate that needs to be consumed slowly, allowed to dissolve in the mouth so that you can appreciate all of its subtle qualities.  I thought this one had some nice berry undertones.  My husband gave it his seal of approval.  The first day, we only ate one square each which, to me, is a mark of quality chocolate: it's best eaten slowly and enjoyed in small quantities.  We finished the remained of the bar the next day, and found it just as good as we had the first day.  Truth be told, I think this chocolate was about as good as any I've had in Belgium--though I may keep that part from my husband!

review/summary: Sweeter than I'm used to
review/text: I love chocolate, and indulge in it regularly. When I buy bar chocolate, I always buy dark. Now I don't go crazy and get the 85 or even 90% cocoa, but usually anywhere from 50-70ish% is great. Normally I love Newman's Own products, from their salad dressings, to lemonade, and even my dogs like the dog snacks. However, this chocolate falls short.<br /><br />It's VERY sweet, much sweeter than regular dark chocolate. I found the texture a little lacking, also-- somewhat crumbly and unappealing. (It brings to mind the episode of "Friends" when Monica had to work with a product called "Mockolate" and she said she loved the way it crumbled in her mouth.) I have to admit I was expecting a little more from this brand, and am let down.<br /><br />I'm not a fan, and don't see myself finishing the bar. I might just give it to someone who enjoys milk chocolate.

review/text: I feel like Darth Vader suggesting this, but really, Newman's Own Organics Chocolate Bar, come over to the dark side!  Reviewing a chocolate bar is not easy because so much depends upon the consumer.  I'm inclined to dark chocolates with high cocoa content and a sharp, bitter bite that mellows to a smooth richness in the mouth.  Alas, at 54%, this bar doesn't pack a dark punch.  Not to make light of it, but you'll find it a bit suspect -- as if it's fraternizing with the enemy (read: milk chocolate) -- if you're a true fan of dark.  If, on the other hand, you're equally at home with a milk chocolate, you will probably find more to like in this bar.  So consider your cocoa quotient, then proceed from there.

review/text: I'm not a huge chocolate eater.  I don't care much for overly rich chocolates, but I do enjoy semi-sweet dark chocolates (like Hershey's) and eat them often, even if not in huge quantities.  The Newman's dark chocolate wasn't quite as tasty to me.  As other reviewers have noted, it has a rather waxy texture to it that sort of threw me off.  I felt like I couldn't taste the flavor as well because it was too smooth and waxy.  Overall it was more bitter compared to the Hershey's.  And while that may suit some people, it wasn't quite my cup of tea.  I'll stick with my semi-sweets and let the real dark chocolate lovers have the Newman's.

review/text: You call this dark?!<br /><br />I love dark chocolate--the darker, the better: anything in the 80%+ cacao range is just dandy, as far as I'm concerned. Admittedly, it should have been obvious from the 54% designation on the wrapper that this was in another category altogether--call it "dark chocolate lite," for people who would really rather just have a Hershey bar. But I guess I had hoped that the fact that it was organic and fair-traded would somehow make up for the missing cacao. In general, I really support what Newman's Own is trying to accomplish.<br /><br />Alas, it was not to be. My main objection is that it tastes mass produced, like a so-called high-end chocolate bar you'd buy in a supermarket but that really is just a run-of-the-mill bar imported from Europe. In particular, there's a subtle but annoying undertaste that I don't detect in the other dark chocolate bars I'm fond of. I don't know if it's the soy lecithin or something related to how it's processed--there really are very few ingredients, which is good--but each bite has elicited nothing more than "eh" from me. I shared some of it with a chocoholic friend who also has a fondness for the really dark stuff, and her reaction was the same as mine.<br /><br />As a taste test, I bought one of Newman's Own's 70% cacao bars, which was the darkest I could find in that line in my local health food store, and it was somewhat better--at least the undertaste was missing. But it too falls short of what I seek in my empty calories, so I won't be buying any more of these, at least not until I see cacao content of 80%+.<br /><br />If you enjoy very dark chocolate, try Equal Exchange's 80% (lovely texture), Endangered Species 88% (with the black panther on the wrapper) or Valrhona's 85%. There's really no comparison.<br /><br />Two stars for an organic, fair-traded but otherwise insipid product.

review/summary: Dark, dark chocolate
review/text: In terms of the chocolate spectrum, I usually fall between dark milk and dark chocolate. This bar was good, but fell a bit too far on the dark side for me. It has a very rich dark chocolate flavor. It's good, but was a bit much for my taste buds. It's probably best eaten in smaller doses.

review/summary: Rich but not bitter
review/text: Newman's Own dark chocolate is labeled as 54% cocoa. This percentage indicates how much of the natural cocoa butter and cacao solids are in the chocolate bar. Lighter chocolates typically contain more milk and sugar (and/or other ingredients) by weight. The higher the percentage of cacao in a chocolate bar, the darker and more bitter the chocolate becomes.<br /><br />At 54%, I'd have to rate this as a medium dark chocolate. I've eaten 70% chocolate and I think it's just too bitter for eating out of hand. This Newman's dark chocolate strikes a nice balance: it's dark enough to get some of the health benefits from the flavonoid content of dark chocolate without having the bitter flavor. But it's not sickly sweet like some cheap national brands of chocolate. I like that the ingredients are organic so I can avoid artificial flavors, high-fructose corn syrup, and the other icky ingredients some brands add to their products. Newman's has a nice flavor and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste. It's got a rich mouthfeel without being too heavy and doesn't leave my teeth feeling fuzzy.<br /><br />The nutrition facts show 330 calories for the entire bar, but the bar is divided into six segments so you can easily break off a piece and only consume 55 calories at a time. I'm not into eating huge bars in one gulp, so I appreciate this. The chocolate makes a nice after-dinner treat with coffee.

review/text: Not a bad candybar it tastes just fine, but I won't be giving up Hershey's or even Cadbury's Dark chocolate bars anytime soon.<br /><br />What you are really paying for is the name & the opportunity to be politically correct. The candybar itself is half the size and more than twice the price of other dark choclate bars that are so similar in taste that the real bitter after-taste will be in your wallet. I would be more inclined to eat this more often if the pricing were more reasonable. Even if you are trying to do the right thing ecologically all the more reason you should not be punished by paying more for it.

review/summary: So nice to find chocolate that tastes like chocolate!
review/text: I'd started to think that a good chocolate bar was a thing of the past. For the past several years, commercial chocolate bars taste more like coconut oils and chemicals than true milk chocolate. So I was delighted to taste NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC DARK CHOCOLATE BAR because it actually TASTES like good, rich dark chocolate. It is by far the best chocolate candy I've tasted in years. And by the way, after eating about half the bar, I needed a chocolate sauce for a family dessert. I simply melted the last half of the NEWMAN'S OWN Organic Dark Chocolate bar in the microwave until soft, and wisked in heavy cream - a small amount at a time. It created a truly decadent chocolate sauce! I will definitely be buying this chocolate again.

review/text: As product lines go, Newman's is tough to beat. Organic, all natural, and money goes to charity. What's not to like?<br /><br />For this product, however, it's a swing and a foul ball. It's not a miss. The 50+% cacao stands out, with rich dark chocolate flavor similar to other bars. However, the mouthfeel and texture of this bar is all wrong. It's not creamy in the way chocolate should be, instead it leaves a thick coating on the inside of the mouth that is both unpleasant and ruins the flavor. I'm not certain what it is, but perhaps the type of fat or the fat content they used doesn't mesh with the chocolate bar. I found it rather unenjoyable to eat the entire thing.

review/text: I like a little taste of dark chocolate as a sweet treat, that isn't quite as unhealthful as, say, a Hershey's bar... Newman's gets the balance just right for my taste.  It's dark not milk chocolate which I gather is somewhat better for you.  But its not disgustingly bitter tasting to the point that you don't feel like you're eating chocolate at all like some dark chocolates taste -- it still tastes pretty much like a good old chocolate bar (maybe slightly more "dark" / bitter).

So good that I wanted to eat the entire big bar in one sitting, but I forced myself to show a little (very little) restraint. Once again, the Newman brand comes through.

It has the crisp flavor of dark chocolate (it's 54% cocoa) but there is a sweetness to it that you usually don't get in dark chocolate. According to the label, all of the ingredients are organic, which is good news to those who appreciate that kind of thing. Bottom line: it is an excellent chocolate bar which I think will be enjoyed by anyone who is a chocoholic such as myself.

review/text: There isn't much not to like about this bar, except that it seems kind of small for the price.  The chocolate is organic, it's difficult to top that.  No guilt about pesticides, etc.<br /><br />This bar is 54% cacao mass.  Sometimes with a super-dark chocolate the taste is very bitter.  This one is not, it has a nice mellow taste.  It's not sweet, but definitely balanced.  I am a mass-quantity chocolate eater, so that usually means milk chocolate for me.  I do like dark chocolate, but if I had the choice, it would be milk as first choice.  This one is really perfect for me because I can eat this a little bit at a time without feeling like I want to eat it all at once.  In fact, one bar lasted me about five days, which is a seriously long time in my pantry.  At this time of the year, I really need to re-think my chocolate consumption so perhaps this is the way to go, so I will eat less and perhaps enjoy more.<br /><br />The squares on this bar are kind of large, but easily broken up into smaller squares without wasting chocolate. Yes, I worry about wasting my chocolate, even if it is tiny amounts!  Enjoy!

I was disappointed that it was relatively waxy, and it didn't have enough of a dark chocolate flavor. It was a lot sweeter than what I expected. I would choose this over Hershey's or Ghiradelli, but there are a lot of other organic brands that provide a better chocolate experience (Dove Dark is even better than this).<br /><br />I did appreciate that it came wrapped in foiled paper.  It might make for a nice alternative to other commercial bars if you're looking for something wrapped up more like the old Hershey bar design. I can see someone removing the outside wrapper and putting a custom paper wrapper around the foil as a favor for a baby or wedding shower or maybe a special anniversary party.

review/text: I love the "Newman's Own" line of products, but this chocolate is not my favorite. I think if you like milk chocolate you will probably like this.  I like the 70% cacao version better but even it has a bit of a waxy taste and doesn't give you the mouth feel of truly great chocolate. While I like the 70% better, I set out the 54% next to the 70% Newman's Own and 2 people preferred the 54% - one of those 2 I consider a chocolate lover.  While I won't buy more of this, don't get me wrong. If this is sitting out next to some Hershey's, I'm going with this.<br /><br />I personally like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV7Q0">Green & Black's Organic Chocolate Bar, 70% Cocoa, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 10)</a>.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate-but Not Dark Enough
review/text: Whatever your preference, this is excellent chocolate: rich, smooth and sweet on the tongue. It kicks like a cup of coffee and serves to brighten a dull afternoon. However at 54% cocoa, it doesn't really qualify as dark chocolate.<br /><br />I'd draw the line for dark chocolate at about 60% cocoa content. Still rate this as a quality product, easily superior to Dove or Hershey. Newman's Organic label consistently strives for the best in their line of food products. I think they have gone for the "best" flavor here and have created a chocolate bar that is sweeter than my personal preference.<br /><br />If milk chocolate is for kids, then this is merely teenage chocolate...it still has some growing up to do. Real dark chocolate doesn't get by on sweetness alone. Real dark chocolate comforts because it has known adult sorrow but has managed to overcome it without becoming too bitter. Real dark chocolate knows about sin but winks at guilt. This may be too philosophical for a review about a candy product. Have some more chocolate and don't think too much about it...

It was smooth without a hint of grit, pleasant to the tongue without being overly sweet, the squares snapped brightly without any bend and if you just let a square sit on your tongue for a few moments, breathing in the taste and resisting the urge to hastily bite into it, the a perfect chocolate aroma fills your whole mouth and nose before slowly warming up and melting.  Yes, this is definitely one that I would look for on a special day!

review/summary: Decent Premium Chocolate But A Bit Pricy
review/text: Ever since I saw on TV how much work the cocoa farmers have to do to get their product into the sack and to market I have tried to purchase chocolate that treats the farmers more fairly. Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa used in Newman's Own Organics products meets this requirement.<br /><br />As for this product, 54% cocoa is a nice step up for people who normally do not like dark chocolate. While it may be a bit tame for those who like really dark chocolate, I thought it was quite good. It has a nice smooth texture that didn't have the waxy feel of standard store-bought chocolate. It melted smoothly without any off flavors or nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The price is a bit steep even for premium chocolate. Given a choice, I will stick to Divine (certified Fair Trade) for the few times I give into the chocolate urge.

I asked them if they would pay triple the price of Hershey's Dark to have this one and they said no. I asked if they would pay double and they both agreed, it would be worth it!

I like this too, although I will have to do some price comparisons the next time I'm shopping for chocolate. Nice that it's organic and rain-forest certified.<br /><br />This dark chocolate is 54% cacao, so not the absolutely darkest stuff out there. But it's good, has a rich chocolate flavor. Texture-wise, it's neither chalky nor oily -- that is, it seems to strike a nice balance in terms of the fat content. It leans toward the sweet side of the sugary vs. bitter scale, but not overly so.<br /><br />In short, well above average, unless your "average" includes boutique candies, handmade truffles, etc. Recommended!

review/text: If you like dark chocolate, this is certainly a contender.  And if you want organic, that narrows the field considerably.  For us, in an ideal world (with unlimited funds), organic would be nice.  But we happily settle for any good dark chocolate.  This wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it just did not stand out.<br /><br />What we didn't expect was such a great difference in the chocolate flavor compared to what we usually eat (I'll come to that in a moment).  Our favorite reasonably affordable dark chocolate is 60% cacao.  It's not organic, and doesn't have a star's name attached to it, but it's still considered a good brand.  At just 6% less than what we're used to (54%), both my wife and I were surprised that the chocolate taste didn't just jump out.<br /><br />What we compare to is the San Francisco-based Ghirarxxxxx Chocolate Company's 60% bittersweet chocolate.  While not organic, they at least advertise theirs as "all natural."  But we buy it for the taste.  It has a much more prominent dark chocolate flavor.  Newman's Own seemed rather bland to both of us - much more so than we would have expected for 54% vs. 60% cocoa.<br /><br />For some, the issue of cost may also be an issue.  Currently (at the time of this review) the 2.25 oz bar is not available on Amazon, but the 3.5 oz size is available, ranging from $1.33/oz to $2.06/oz, or ranging between roughly $21 - $33 per pound of Newman's Own.  One can go to WMart (they have frequent sales on this) or many grocery stores and pick up an 11.5 oz bag of Ghirarxxxxx Premium Baking Chips, 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate, the same thing as the fancy-packaged squares on the candy aisle at a far higher price, for between $2.50 per bag (on sale) to the upper $3 range per bag.  The key is to look for it in the baking aisle in bags, where the price is far lower than the candy-aisle version.  Even at $3.50/bag, that works out to about $4.90 per pound - a considerable difference from Newman's Own.  Even if Newman's was 1/4 the price shown elsewhere on Amazon for the 3.5 oz size, in order to make it price-competitive with the Ghirarxxxxx 60% dark, we'd go for the latter without hesitation - there's that much difference in taste.  My wife uses the Ghirarxxxxx frequently for baking, and if Newman's Own was competitive in price (and available as chips instead of squares), she'd still get the Ghirarxxxxx.<br /><br />Some reviews complained of a waxy texture with the Newman's Own.  We didn't really find that to be the case.  It melted nicely in our mouths (which we like to do before swallowing it in order to really enjoy the taste) and had what we both considered a nice consistency.  It was simply lacking a strong chocolate taste, though what was there was still decent.  I'd expect (and generally find it to be the case) that a dark chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa would have a fairly strong chocolate taste - much stronger than the namby-pamby taste of milk chocolate (which I used to love, and no longer even enjoy since our switch to dark).<br /><br />Some may say we're comparing apples and oranges (organic vs. non-organic).  Yes, and I realize that's not entirely fair.  But for us, though we buy a lot of organic foods, that isn't the major consideration when it comes to "recreational" chocolate (we're really addicted ;)  ).  Taste is the major factor, followed by affordability, and hands down our preferred brand comes out the winner.  I would not anticipate a follow up purchase of Newman's Own in the future, as a result of this sample.<br /><br />But if you've got the money, have to have organic, and want dark chocolate, you probably won't be disappointed with this product - it just isn't a stand-out.  I honestly expected more.

review/summary: Useless
review/text: I thought my review from the single item listing would carry over to here, but it didn't. I've got to warn guys off of this useless "tool."<br /><br />This thing was obviously designed by a woman. Trying to be "proper" with my comments, women don't have the same "hardware" to be cleaned.<br /><br />It doesn't fit your hand. When you're slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto. It's useless for building lather, even with our soft water. Both sides are too small. Because of the shell, you can't run it between your toes, nor use it even on ground-in dirt between your fingers.<br /><br />And I'll try to be as delicate as I can here-- For washing male "private parts," it's impossible. Both front and back.<br /><br />My wife's normal pink "poof" is far better.<br /><br />Put it in packaging you might see in an auto parts store, and label it a "tool." (Obvious male-directed marketing.) It's still trash. If I were to buy a tool as useless as this, it would be returned to the parts store ASAP.

review/summary: Read before using this Fish Scaler!
review/text: I got this in a large pack of Dove body wash at a big name bulk store and was excited to try it out.  I normally use the pouf to shower with (Don't tell my Pals!), but decided to give this a go.  It's, as another person posted, "Like using a Brillo Pad!".  I have very sensitive skin so it's way too rough for me.  It's too small, gets very slick, and it's impossible to reach in between the Guy parts.  I don't see how any Man could ever use this other than for scrubbing dirty, greasy hands.  It's made more for the mechanic or coal miner who needs to scrub their skin to get clean and definitely not for a Guy who occasionally does some yard work, etc.  If you arrive home looking like Mike Rowe after a hard day at "Dirty Jobs" then this may just be for you!

review/summary: Scrubs yes, suds no.
review/text: The body puff side feels rough, and is good for scouring pores in the chest and upper back areas.  My skin does feel smoother afterwards.  It's not very good at creating lather though.  Not sure if it's because the mesh is rougher, or the mesh is only exposed on one side.<br /><br />The back side is too rough for the skin -- I've been using it to sand down foot calluses.<br /><br />Might need to just use a regular body puff to apply soap, and use the Dove shower tool as a loofah and pumice stone.

review/summary: If you like to shower with Brillo Pads....
review/text: Then this is the shower tool for you.  I purchased these for my fiance', he used it once and said it was terrible.  I tried it once and completely agreed with him.  The exfoliate side is nice but the pouf side is so rough it's like showering with a Brillo Pad.  Not to mention it isn't poufy enough to use on some parts of the body.  I was unable to complete one shower with this "shower tool" I had to go back to my normal pouf.  If you like roughness when you take a shower and no lather with your soap than this item is for you.  I disagree with the other reviewers when they say this item provides enough lather because it doesn't provide any.  I totally agree with the other person who said that you could not use this item to clean your "personal area".  That statement is 250% true.  It's unfortunate for me that I purchased the 4 pack, now I am with 3 extras to collect dust.  I guess when I need to use a brillo pad for cleaning a pan I could use this instead.  Don't waste your money on this 4 pack before you at least purchase 1 to make sure you like them.  Chances are you will not, and will be glad you didn't buy a 4 pack like I did.

review/summary: Not bad, but two problems. Pad needs to be replaceable and additional rope.
review/text: This item isn't bad, but it has two big problems, it needs a replaceable pad, so one wouldn't have to buy a whole new one every so often, eliminates a lot of waste that way, as with many things. The second problem is that it needs a second rope on the other side, to allow for pulling back and forth (especially on the hard to reach places on the back, nearest the neck, I modified my unit to do this. It is the same with the one made to use with AXE products. Nice idea, but needs more thought through for practical purposes.

review/summary: Everyone who wrote bad comments clearly doesn't like to be clean
review/text: I really don't understand why everyone is bashing this product. I have tried both the axe and dove versions (basically the same things but the tan side of the dove scrubber is a little nicer than the red side of the axe version) and they do exactly what they're supposed to be doing, making me clean. Some people are saying it doesn't allow the scrubber to be replaced.... DEAL WITH IT. Its meant to last for 4-6 weeks so I don't know why you would need "replacement parts," just buy a new one! Secondly, I don't know how some people say they can't reach their "junk" with this. I don't know anyone who isn't either one, strong enough to squeeze the scrubber (Its made of rubber, mesh, and cloth; all three can bend/fold/etc. pretty easily) or two, flexible enough to touch their "junk." It's quite easy if you have any sort of motor skills.<br /><br />Furthermore, I just want to say I thoroughly enjoy this product (both sides) and that by combining it with the dove exfoliating body wash, I have very soft and smooth skin. Both of which are characteristics that (most) women love in regards to mens skin.<br /><br />The ONLY issue I have with this scrubber is that I feel like it's difficult to thoroughly wash the soap out of it at the end of the shower.<br /><br />LASTLY, I AM A MAN, not a woman or dove representative that has a tainted perspective of this product. I like it because it WORKS.

review/text: I got this four pack after doing research and finding out they were more expensive to buy signally from Walmart.<br /><br />They work great and definitely get you clean.  It took a little getting used to. At first it was if it irritated my skin, but it really didn't. It was as if it was getting scratched... but I guess that was just it working.<br /><br />I think I use a little less of the body wash... with better lather.<br /><br />I disagree with the other person who said they'd just use a cheap o applicator.  These are designed to get you clean.  And that they do.

review/text: I had been using the Axe Detailer thing, but I got these because they were cheaper. Both Axe and Dove are Unilever companies, and while they're pretty comparable, I prefer the Axe ones, because they're firmer, and the back abrasive side is more abrasive. This one isn't bad, and I can see how someone would feel the opposite way, so I guess it's just personal preference.

Thank goodness for the internet.  I like my tea iced and so I brew for four minutes and then pour the hot tea over ice.  The box says to brew for only one minute (I haven't tried that yet) the previous tea I was using said to brew for eight minutes but it was often bitter.  Also this tea is organic which is so important for tea.  Tea leaves can't be washed after picking so it's great to know that these were grown naturally.
