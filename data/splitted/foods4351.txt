review/summary: Herb-y and Unusual
review/text: ****<br />This Green Tea Energy from Yogi Tea is a "natural energy boost".  It's an unusual, rather herb-y tasting natural herbal tea made from organic green tea leaf, Asian (Panax) ginseng, organic lemongrass, organic spearmint leaf, ginseng-eleuthero extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosus), and kombucha . The taste is very difficult for me, and the kombucha comes across extra strong. I predict that you'll either love or hate the taste of this tea; try it first before you buy it in large quantities.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 70% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue. It contains 28mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />I gave this tea only four stars because the taste is so hard for me to handle. It is, however, a quality tea, and if you like it, there are many benefits to be gained.<br /><br />Recommended, if you can stand the taste.<br />****

review/summary: NOT "The Original" L&P at all - this contains HFCS!
review/text: Lea & Perrins' Worcestershire sauce is wonderful stuff that's been made to a secret recipe since 1838. Doubtless the recipe's undergone some tweaking over the last 170+ years, but the version that's been sold in the US for the past few years has, until VERY recently, contained high fructose corn syrup. As noted in the product info above, yep, what's being sold here is the HFCS-filled recipe.<br /><br />Heinz has actually removed HFCS from the US recipe earlier this year (see the latest ingredients on the L&P website) but unless and until the product information is updated for this item, I'd assume that this is old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, if you can find the bottles of L&P with orange labels, which I've seen for sale in quite a few stores, those are guaranteed not to contain any HFCS as they're imported from the UK.<br /><br />Kudos to Heinz for listening to their customers though - Mr. Lea and Mr. Perrins can stop rolling in their graves now!

review/summary: Worst coffee ever
review/text: I am not a coffee snob, and not very up on the various types of coffee's out there, but I certainly know when something tastes like burnt crap! I recently got a breville coffee maker that came with an assortment of cups. Most of the coffee that came with it were OK, but this Italian Roast stuff was horrible! I took one sip and dumped it. I'm sure there are people who like this taste, but not me. personal preference I guess. If I could give a 0 I would.

review/summary: Not that good
review/text: The flavor of this tea is not as good as other Golden Monkey teas that I've had.  It is kind of weak.  Also where the other Golden Monkey teas have a very nice buttery, honey kind of flavor (reminds me of butterbeer in the Harry Potter books), this tea has a hint of that, but really to me more of a soapy taste.  It's not horrible, so I'm giving it two stars instead of one.  I've been much happier with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPEWO">The Tao of Tea, Golden Monkey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and I think I'll go back to that.

review/text: I'm a daily iced tea maker and drinker. Bounced around between lots of different teas but settled on plain black tea as my favorite. Found Golden Monkey from a local purveyor which then discontinued it. I loved the clarity and total lack of bitter flavors in the Golden Monkey. The Faerie's golden monkey is just as delicious, and the 12oz package is by far the best deal for this tasty stuff.

review/summary: Pink salt!
review/text: We know the whole pink salt story.  If you don't, just google it.  We are using it mainly because it's supposed to be better for you health-wise.  We both like salt and this seemed like a reasonable deal.  There isn't much difference in the taste... cleaner and you have to use less I'd say.  The salt isn't quite as fine as we expected... a bit many grained size, but they all come out of the salt shaker well.  We found out that our local upscale grocery store carries it in bulk, but it's "rock salt" size.  We've bought a Bodum grinder that grinds both pepper and salt for when the salt we have now runs out.  The Bodum is great and they sell it on Amazon...<br />P.S.  Fairie's Finest had the best prices for both the pink salt and Red Hawaiian sea salt...

review/summary: Great product, will buy again
review/text: I love this product. It is very handy in the kitchen -- I cook a lot and use orange zest in many recepies. The individual small (one tablespoon) packets inside the box are vacuum sealed and the zest kept its aroma quite well, although it is not the same as fresh. But it is not always possible to have fresh organic oranges at hand, and I would never use zest with chemical pesticides in my cooking. So it is nice to know that I have these packets whenever I need them.

review/text: I bought these several times for my mother.  The first time she loved them and I ordered more when she ran out.  The second time about half the batch tasted fresh, but the other half was dried out.  I hadn't ordered them for a couple of months, then she decided to try one more batch.  This batch was the same or worse than the last, mostly dried out.  I bought one box to try from the store and they were fine, so it must have something to do with the age of the product.

review/summary: Far and beyond the traditional chewy bar
review/text: These bars were provided at the US Women's Open for the players and volunteers -- and I am in love.  They also had the Sweet/Salty ones, which were awesome, but these bars almost had a taste of coconut to me -- which means the natural sweetness was pure.  I'm a fan of Quaker chewy too -- and those are 90 or 100 calories (these are 140 -- 3 points on WW), but these are really a treat.  Much higher in fat content which explains why they are satisfying.  Can they be bought in stores?  I'm wary of mailorder food.

If health is more important (organic, no trans fats), give these a try.

review/summary: these are the best
review/text: I've been eating these granola bars, about once a day on average, for the past two years. Needless to say they are awesome. They are very oaty, moist, and chewy. The chocolate chips add just enough sweetness, and the sugary stuff that holds it all together is delicious.<br /><br />Keep in mind, there is some inconsistency. These aren't like Quaker Oats bars where every single one is exactly the same. Some bars have more chocolate chips than others - some have only a few, but others have many, with clumps in spots (these are the best). Some have more of the sugary stuff than others. Sometimes, the chips are a little discolored, though that doesn't affect the taste as far as I can tell. And yea, every once in a while, a granola bar seems to spoil.<br /><br />This is a small price to pay, though, in my opinion. These are great, delicious, and filling.

review/summary: Great!  Not dry and just right!
review/text: Many of the 'organic' snack bars we get tend to be dry; like Kashi, Annie's and though I don't hate them, the Cascadian Farm's chocolate chip bar (including the white chocolate) has a softer texture that you really don't get sick of!<br /><br />I eat this along with my protein shake and satisfy my stomach.  Our family all love this snack and have been buying them for over a year.  Walmart stopped carrying them for some reason but glad to know Amazon sell them in bulk which is the cheapest we've found!

Unlike most bars that seem sickly sweet and artificial, this bar has a very light sweetness to it and is not glued together with a sugar cement. This really tastes like something you created in your own kitchen from scratch.

review/summary: The BEST Granola Bars
review/text: I've been eating these Cascadia Farm organic granola bars for a while, but I used to get them at a local grocery store. When they stopped carrying them I didn't know where I was going to get them. I don't know what made me think to search Amazon, but I realized I could get them delivered to me automatically every month or two.<br /><br />I eat a granola bar just about every morning along with a banana or other fruit for breakfast, so I go through a case every other month. It was so easy to setup on Amazon, they just ship me a case every other month automatically and I don't have to worry about it.<br /><br />It's so easy, I'm thinking of setting up the auto-ship service with several other products too.

review/text: These are by far and away THE best chocolate chip granola bars..They're nice and chewy, without being too dry or wearing out your jaw like other organic granola bars.  We are never without these as a special treat for us or our kids! However, they're way cheaper at Walmart .. around $2.75 a box and there are generally coupons that can be printed online which brings the price inline with a sale price on Quaker bars, which don't even come close in taste to the Cascadian Farms bars, not to mention the high frutose corn syrups and hydrogenated oils in Quaker bars .. Even with Subscribe and Save these are $3.44 a box, boo for the price!

Very good, and very superior nutritionally to so many chocolatey chip granola bars on the market!

review/text: FYI, this is Rapadura sugar.  The company seems to have minimized that in the new packaging (or removed it completely on the new bags!?) - probably to get new customers to purchase it in stores, whom might have put it back not knowing what rapadura is.<br /><br />Rapadura is a very historic whole food and completely unprocessed from cane-sugar.  It is the best/healthiest form of sugar.  Arguably, maybe raw honey is better.  But if you need sugar, go with this stuff.<br /><br />It is all I use now, for bread making to jam and everything in between.  (And really raw honey)  :)<br /><br />Buy with confidence! Enjoy

review/summary: What Sugar is Supposed to Taste Like
review/text: Funny how sugar is considered an anti-nutrient.  Yet, if it's in it's whole form this is not the case!  Whole sugar contains nutrients!  How about that?  Too bad we never hear about it.  Sure organic sugar cane tastes way better in beverages.  If you give it time, your taste will adjust.  This is expensive, but considering what it is, you get what you pay for. I signed up for the Subscribe & Save through Amazon & have it delivered once a month.  I use it to feed my water kefir & for whatever else I decide to replace my organic sugar cane with.<br /><br />Tastes strongly of molasses.  If you don't like molasses you have a problem!  Molasses is a by product of the sugar cane refining process - in-case you didn't know.  So it makes sense that this tastes of molasses.  Because it hasn't been removed from the cane.  This is truly pure unrefined whole cane sugar.  This is what sugar is supposed to taste like!<br /><br />By the way, don't expect the same results as refined sugar.  Besides the already mentioned taste difference, this will turn liquids a muddy/cloudy brownish color.  Nothing to worry about but it might be off putting if you are not used to it.<br /><br />Thank you Rapunzel for this wonderful organic sugar!

I've used it to make sweet Amish bread, crumb crust pies, cinnamon rolls, soft pretzels, smoothies, chocolate cake, chocolate chip cookies, brownies--any recipe that requires sugar. If you're looking for a sweetener that's unrefined and nutritious, this is it. The only sweetener that I've found to be more nutritious is molasses. Skip the other "organic" sugars if you're looking for something to add nutritional density to your diet.

review/summary: Very different taste!
review/text: Before purchasing this sugar, I read the many positive reviews.  I definitely think this is a healthier alternative to the processed white sugar you buy in grocery stores.  However, I did find that this has a very distinct flavor and could not use it in all my baking.  For example, if you use this sugar to sweeten a drink such as tea, the flavor is overpowering.  I attempted to make a fresh strawberry pie and needed to sweeten the strawberries and thicken into a syrup.  I used only this brand sugar and ended up dumping all the ingredients and starting over because the taste was just terrible.  Now I typically combine Rapunzel sugar with another organic brand when baking anything, just to avoid the possibility of tasting this sugar throughout my food.  The value is great, I just can't use it as my go-to sugar.

review/text: I've used this to make brownies and chocolate no-bake cookies so far.  The brownies were moist and yummy, but didn't seem as sweet as I am used to.  I did try the recipe on the back of the bag so that may have been the difference.  However when tasting either sweet treat no one could tell that it had a special sweetener in it.  It boiled just fine for the chocolate syrup in the no-bake cookies.  Definitely will be buying more.  My daughter has an allergy to white sugar but she can eat treats made with this and no side effects.  Two thumbs up if you have a sugar allergy or want to be more environmentally responsible.

review/summary: The top Organic sugar
review/text: I say top for Organic Sugar because, if you read the packaging, the sugar is composted and never separated from the molasses.<br />For those who have used the sugar you notice quite a difference with the granules of sugar being quite soft, almost falling apart.<br />If you have the money and wish to bake with sugar, buy this, it's the top of them.<br /><br />Rapunzel is like the Rolls Royce of most of these Organic companies as well.  They sell an Organic Yeast which is USDA Organic as well as their Organic Cocoa Powder.<br /><br />Their Organic Cocoa Powder is the only Cocoa Powder that is not processed on equipment with Dairy or any Animal products as well so if you're a Vegan, like myself, and wish to minimize dairy exposure, even with incidental milk protein, this is great.<br /><br />I believe most Rapunzel products are non-GMO Project certified as well.<br /><br />I suppose my one complaint is I can't get the bulk sizing from anywhere around and it looks like Amazon doesn't offer it either.  That means the size is like 96 oz. bag.  I'm one of those people who wish to plummet my Organic bill by buying in big sizes and I don't like being blocked from doing so.<br /><br />I hope Amazon picks up the slack and lets me buy a 6 96 oz. pack or whatever size it ships by standard.<br /><br />Oh and ask Rapunzel for their old Rapadura brownie recipe as well.  For a Vegan, fixing this and leaving it in the oven for a while after make them nice and chewy, spot on as a substitute for fudgy brownies.

review/summary: Unusable stuff with a "no return" policy
review/text: I'm giving 2 stars only because I own some responsibility for not finding a way to taste this "sweetener" before ordering 6 bags of it. I bought it for making Kombucha, and when I poured in the "Rapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar", it looked like I had poured in a cup and a half of dirt. Not to worry. I can take ugly as long as it's healthy, but my batch of Kombucha , after 8 days, is an opaque, sour, slurry of a mess, totally undrinkable, not like any Kombucha you've ever seen, and I'm just hoping I haven't ruined my SCOBY.<br />I'm a health food person, have been for many, many years, so I don't expect organic, healthy foods to taste like a Dairy Queen shake, but it should be somewhat palatable and interchangeable with unhealthy foods, i.e. processed sugar.<br />Since I can't return the 5 sealed, untouched bags, I'll stick them in my WTSHTF disaster preparedness stash. If the economy crashes, or we get some other apocalyptic disaster, I might be glad to have it, even if it tastes like burnt caramel, has little sweetening value, and looks like dirt.

review/text: I love this sugar.  We now use it every morning in our cup of coffee and it is absolutely delicious.  I don't make kefir or kombucha but I do give this as a gift to my friends that do and they go gaga over.  The texture is really odd.  REALLY odd that it kind of threw me at first.  It is not shiny or waxy looking like sugar that has been polished.  It is very dull and almost looks like dehydrated soy bits or something.  But that almost adds to the wonderful quality of this.  The fact that something so dull can be soooo good.<br /><br />We drink Equal Exchange coffee, grind it fresh every morning with a simple Krups grinder and use an Aeropress to make the coffee.  We also use local raw milk to top it off.  You can find my reviews on these other items.<br /><br />YUM!  You cannot order this good of a drink at Starbucks!<br /><br />I have not yet used this in baking but I won't hesitate to.  I alreay use mostly raw honey in place of sugar so I think this will work just fine.  I am signed up to get this on subscribe and save but I am having them send me more before the demand or price goes up on this.

review/summary: Great Value!  Excellent quality!
review/text: I have been using Sucanat and Rapadura for some time now as a healthier alternative to white cane sugar.  Rapunzel's version of this is finer in texture than any I've had previously and so is easier to use.  The flavor is delicious.  I couldn't be happier.  Signing up for Amazon.com's automatic shipments saves a considerable amount on the price as well.  We love this stuff!  Of course, sugar is still sugar, but using the whole cane sugar sparingly, I don't regret this addition to our meals.  Sprinkled on oatmeal... that's my favorite.  I use it daily to brew water kefir and the grains are huge and healthy and double in numbers nearly every day!

review/summary: Affordable, Natural Sugar
review/text: Since Rapunzel sugar is purportedly the most natural source of sugar it has replaced the white stuff in my home; I have even made powdered sugar with it!<br /><br />One of my favorite uses for it is as pancake topping: mix 1c sugar with 1/4c water on the stovetop and simmer until the sugar is dissolved.<br /><br />For a while I was getting it on Vitacost but they stopped selling it for some reason, and Amazon has it for the cheapest price around.

review/text: Who would think that when you order sugar you would have to be concerned about gluten contamination?  After ordering this sugar which tastes amazing, I discovered that it says it may contain wheat.  Are you kidding me?  When I called them they told me that there is no wheat/gluten in the product but they think it might be made on the same equipment/facility.  There were not sure since it is processed in another country.  I don't think they understand what a serious issue this is for some people and they really should use a separate facility/equipment in order to avoid cross-contamination.  If you have any issues with gluten, you are better off buying organic rapadura sugar elsewhere.

review/summary: Raw Food is The Best Diet For Cats
review/text: I initially tried a few brands of prepared raw cat food, including this one before eventually settling on making my own raw cat food. I started out with prepared raw foods because i thought it would be hard to make my own. I was wrong it's not hard at all. My cats are now fully transitioned to raw food and they love it very much. But this food is a good choice to start if you simply want to give raw food a try. It is neat not, messy and you dont have to worry about measuring and mixing cat recipes.<br /><br />All in all my cats never really ate this product unless i cooked it or mixed it with a commercial brand that they liked. But this says nothing about the product itself because cats are notoriously picky eaters and at the time they were also not happy about me switching their food and introducing them to raw food for the first time. My rating is based on the cost not the quality of the product.<br /><br />I realize that this brand is pasturized, farm raised, organic chickens ... and that probaby accounts for the price ... if all of that is important to you then this product is a great choice for the price. But i personally find it too expensive to feed a cat this way long term.<br /><br />I have since discovered that buying powdered cat food supplements plus raw ground meat at my local supermarket is a much cheaper alternative to buying the meat already prepared. Ground turkey in Kroger is $1.50 per pound and the supplements are an additional $3 (per pound of meat) compare that with this product which is 1.2lbs for $7.50 + s/h.<br /><br />So that works out to a cost of $4.50 per pound for me to make my own cat food vs. ($7.50 + shipping) per pound to buy this prepared stuff. Also consider that buying 10 cans of 3.5oz premium canned cat food would cost $6.00<br /><br />(1 lb of raw meat feeds my 2 adult male cats for 3-4 days, much cheaper than buying "premium" commercial brands of wet cat food which are laden with preservatives and have very little real meat in them)<br /><br />NOTE: If you buy ground meat in the supermarket for your cat ... you MUST get a powdered supplement for cats to mix in the meat because the ground meat found in supermarkets is meant for human consumption, so it doesnt have the vital bone and organ meat that a cat needs. Adding supplements provide the added nutrition a cat would get from organs and bone. (I was not able to find these supplements for making raw food in local pet stores i had to buy them online.) And mixing the supplements and meat for the cat is simple as pie!<br /><br />My main reason for giving this product 3 stars is for the overall cost to feed a cat long term on this prepared organic stuff. I dont want people who are thinking about switching their cats to a raw food diet to be discouraged, since raw food is the best diet for a cat. I want to present options ... as i showed above it can be done much more affordably using ground meat and powdered supplements. If you can afford to go organic, farm raised, etc., for your cat that is even better but not neccessary to improve the cats health.<br /><br />Matter of fact if cost is that big an issue simply giving your cat properly supplemented raw food a few times per week instead of 100% dry food will drastically improve their health and save them from common cat ailments while not pinching the pocketbook.<br /><br />Remember Cats are not vegetarians, Just like Lions and Tigers they are "obligate carnivores" ... they need quality meat for optimal health.

review/summary: Each tin contains 0.2 oz, not 2 oz
review/text: Each tin is marked .2oz.  So you really get 1/10 the amount you thought you would get. Someone at Amazon was fidgeting when decimals were being taught.  Last week when I ordered this, the price was 12.11, which is 1.6 times what a bottle of this in non-organic costs per once at my local Whole Foods.  So is it worth it?<br /><br />The concept is a good one:  Organic- In my experience I pay on average 1.5 to 2 times more for organic to avoid the pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  1 tsp packaging- For any given product you will pay more for it, the more individually packaged it is.  The twelve to one packaging of this product should increase the shelf life of this herb substantially.<br /><br />So in my opinion, even with the decimal point properly placed (0.2 oz)per tin, this product has the competitive edge.  But you be the judge, especially since as I write this, the price is now 18.46, 2.5 times the cost per once at my local Whole Foods for a single bottle non-organic.

review/summary: One of the best vanillas you will taste and at a great price
review/text: I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)

review/text: A hearty thank you to all the reviewers informing my purchase, made a few weeks back at this link from the vendor "Amazon Warehouse Deals," which, it seems, has sold out by now on this product. Rock-bottom price, unbeatable service. I second all the rave reviews on the Sweets & Beets for taste and nutrition, despite my foreboding prior to buying: I'd read the 3-star "Good & Stale" review (Too long on the shelf! These chips were stale!"). Whew. That could have happened to me. I feel for him/her, and count myself lucky on not getting hit with the same rotten deal. To the 4-star "Just a Tad Greasier Than I Would prefer" reviewer, perhaps I'd also like it lighter and drier, but who knows? Maybe the taste would suffer. To the 2-star "too salty" review, I'm mystified. The package claims 10 mg sodium, or 0% RDA of salt (per serving), and the contents passed my taste bud / lie-detector test. What on earth was dropped at your doorstep?<br /><br />To try to explain that--as well the pictured package here of crinkled chips, when I've never found them crinkled--I wrote the company. Here's their answer copied and pasted. Hope it helps.<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Dear M.

review/text: I was so hoping that the other reviews were wrong and these wouldn't taste burnt. But, allas they are a dark dark brown color and 95% of the 2 bags i opened were brunt and nasty. Amazon was GREAT though. They refunded the money and I will give them to the food shelf.
