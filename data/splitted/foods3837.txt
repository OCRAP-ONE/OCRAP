review/summary: Kids love it!!
review/text: My son is on a special diet and cannot have some of the leading brands of juice, so I was thrilled when I found out about Vruit. The kids love it. It is a more natural alternative to the V8 VFusion. We cannot find it sold in stores where I live so we order it through Amazon when it has super saver shipping.

review/text: Dry food, a vet told me, kills cats in time. He recommended this food and no dry. Kitty agrees... She was looking terrible, yakking up hairballs all over the house, every two or three days. After a 6 weeks of this food, she looks great, is like her old self... And not a single hairball!  This is her favorite flavor.

review/summary: Tasty Black Cherry flavor in a 0-cal healthy option!
review/text: I have been buying Zevia for about two years now and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Black Cherry is one of my favorite Zevia flavors.  Also, it's not colored artificially like other cherry sodas - this one is clear.<br /><br />I've purchased all of Zevia's flavors... natural cola, natural orange, natural ginger-ale, natural root beer, natural black cherry, and natural twist.  They are all quite tasty, however, I do have some favorites... black cherry, orange, and root beer.<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either. Truly guilt-free!<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

review/text: Liked everything about this soda except the taste.  Everything is natural, no artificial this or that.  That's all real nice , but to me the flavor came up short.  Not by much,  With only a little imagination, and I do mean a little, it tastes great.  But really, should we have to use our imagination.  Maybe Zevia needs to find something that tastes more like Black Cherry.  I won't buy any more at a buck a can but if you've got a good imagination...

review/summary: A Decent Price for a Very Good Product
review/text: I already enjoyed Black Cherry Zevia Soda before I purchased it on Amazon.  I like it very much.  I loved and drank non-diet sodas all my life, and, could never stand the taste of diet sodas (the artificial sweeteners make my mouth taste like I've been sucking on a steel pipe).  However, I was recently diagnosed with Diabetes and am thus prevented from consuming regular soda anymore.  I tried to like some other diet types before trying this one, because Zevia is much more expensive.  When that effort failed, and I tried Zevia, I found the sweet taste to be identical to the usual sweetness of non-diet soda (which is actually high-fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />The sweetener is a very innovative, natural substance (derrived from glucose) called Erythritol.  Erythritol is a polyol in the sugar alchohol family that's quickly gaining a reputation as the only sugar alchohol that can be consumed in larger quantities without gastric distress (unlike other alchohol sugars like xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol, etc).  It's been approved and used as a safe food-product in Japan for the past twenty years without ill effects.  It isn't yet commonly used yet in the US because, while the USDA recognizes it as safe, it has only been approved as a "supplement", and not as a main foodstuff.<br /><br />Erythritol is a plant-glucose derivative that is also produced naturally in the human body in small quantities.  It contains only 2/10 calorie per gram (sugar has 4.0 calories per gram).  It's Glycemic Index value is zero, which means it has no effect on blood sugar.<br /><br />Erythritol has already been approved for general consumption by the European Union.  The major US players (Coke & Pepsi) in the soda market have asked the USDA to speed the approval of erythritol as a foodstuff.  Sadly, they only plan to use it to reduce the calories of regular soda, not to produce diet soda.  Cargill and ADM are already producing these sweeteners.  Erythritol will displace Splenda the same way Splenda displaced aspartame.<br /><br />I have tried some of the other (but not all) Zevia flavors, but like the Black Cherry most so far.  While I didn't prefer the other flavors as much, they still tasted sweet with no aftertaste.<br /><br />I will continue to buy this product, and, highly recommend it to consumers seeking to cut sugar or carb consumption.  I also highly recommend trying other products containing erythritol (especially chocolate) because their taste is impossible to distinguish from sugar.

review/text: Zevia uses the non-caloric natural sweetener stevia and all natural ingredients. When was the last time you had a good black cherry soda? I find the taste refreshing. The natural stevia sweetener might take a bit to getting used to but once you try it you want to keep with the product. I swear by all the Zevia products and buy no other type of soda.<br /><br />Search for Zevia under Gourmet foods.

review/text: This soda is terrible! What a waste of my $! The only reason I purchased a 6 pack is b/c the Amazon reviews were so good. If you drink diet or regular soda don't even bother! This stuff honestly tastes like plain, carbonated water!?, I can't even taste a HINT of black cherry! I don't know if all the reviews here are written by Zevia stock holders or what but I am NOT impressed with any tasteless product. Will just have to go back to the drawing board and dose myself off the bad habit. I should have known if it sounds too good to be true IT IS. Bummer!

review/summary: Great product !
review/text: I've been a diet soda drinker since diet sodas first came out (yes, I really am that old!).  A few years back I found out that the sweetening ingredient in most diet sodas was a toxic little chemical called Aspartame.  If you do a little research on that subject you will find that it is a neurotoxin with severe long term exposure risks (I found out the hard way).  I was excited to find out that a "new" ingredient called Stevia was finally allowed into food products and decided to give it a try.  Speaking as someone who can't tolerate the 7 or 8 teaspoons of sugar in each regular soda, I find this type of product to be the best available option.  Like any diet soda, it is an acquired taste, but I happy not poisoning by body anymore!  I would have rated it 5 stars, but it's kinda pricey.  Great product!

review/summary: I love the black cherry and ginger root beer flavors
review/text: I've only tried 3 flavors of this soda so far: Black Cherry, Ginger Root Beer and Cola. To be honest, I'm not much of a cola drinker, but, I found it comparable to other colas I've had. Now, that being said, the Black Cherry and Ginger Root Beer are quite good. However, the Black Cherry is fairly sweet, so, I can see where some might not be as thrilled with it as I am. On the other hand, I didn't find the Ginger Root Beer to be any more or less sweet than other brands of root beer.<br /><br />I've signed up to have Zevia delivered each month as it is cheaper to get it by the case through Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' service than it is to buy it by the 6-pack at Kroger (the only local store I've found it in). So, if you are purchasing Zevia on a regular basis from your local store, you may want to see if the 'Subscribe & Save' option will save you money as well. Cheers!

review/summary: Missing the flavor
review/text: I've never had a black cherry soda I didn't like, but this is pushing it. The flavor is just not strong enough, it's barely there, and there's that "diet" taste. The diet soda drinkers may not think the flavor is bad, but I am a REGULAR soda drinker so I notice any oddity right away. There is a slight, unpleasant aftertaste. If you're eating food it's not as bad as drinking it by itself.

review/summary: The sugarless drink of the future
review/text: All of the Zevia drinks use a natural sweetener. No sugar. No need for a dictionary to understand the ingredients. These drinks are not overly carbonated, not too sweet and very pleasant tasting. They have no effect on your blood sugar levels and contain no calories. The sweetener is called Stevia, which is derived naturally from a plant. Read up on the artificial sweeteners used in today's diet soda and compare them with the ingredients in Zevia's sodas. You probably won't even wait to finish your stock of present diet drinks.

review/summary: Not entirely Stevia
review/text: I have mixed feelings about this product. It tastes good and there is no artificial coloring added, BUT it is not pure stevia (S. rebaudiana). It has erythritol ,a sugar alcohol. For how expensive this product is, I am disappointing that Zevia did not keep to its main purpose for this soda. Because it has erythritol, this soda is severly MISLEADING. Do yourself a favor, buy pure stevia extract and make yourself lemonade, or your own sodas. Dont waste your money.

review/text: I ordered a case of this product as I've done many times before. Order was placed about the first of second of the month, here it is over 2 weeks later and still waiting for the product to show up. According to the tracking it's been sitting in my town at some sight waiting to be delivered for a full week but it's fedex and no real person to call to find out what happened. I've been charged for the order but this time it's just weird and complicated. Only other time I ever had a problem with it was some bad shipping/packing and ended up with a crushed box and only a few salvagible cans out of the bunch but I got online with amazon and got immediate assistance and another order sent out asap. Guess I just answered my own question, will have to find that chat thing on amazon again and get some help. This zevia soda stuff is great and the black cherry, root beer and Dr.Zevia are the best ones in my mind.

I pre-ordered the Mountain Zevia flavor for her and she is REALLY looking forward to receiving it. She would definitely recommend these products to others, especially those who want to limit their intake of artificial sweetners. Costs more than regular brands, though.

review/text: This is the only soda that has nothing in it that is bad for you.  In fact, it is one of the few drinks of any kind that is great for diabetics and those who want to lose weight.  For some reason, the Zevia flavors seem to have need for a little more sweetening.  Get NuStevia Clear liquid stevia supplement (available from Amazon), a put a couple of little squirts in there (don't over do it), and it really improves.  With other brands of stevia, the results are not as good.<br /><br />If you use this as something you drink only a couple of times per week, even $1 a can is reasonable (have you checked soft drink machine drink prices lately?).  The only thing keeping the rating below 5 stars is the price and need for more sweetener.

review/summary: Not as Good as Cola or Root Beer Flavors
review/text: Black cherry is the second Zevia flavor I tried.  It was significantly better than the orange I had tried beforehand.  I'm glad it was because I don't think I would have tried another Zevia flavor if I hadn't have liked this much.  Just like another reviewer had stated, it's good, but there are better flavors (such as root beer).  I would probably buy black cherry again only if some of the better Zevia's were not available at that time.<br /><br />There are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Black Cherry is an good tasting soda.  I would purchase it again if other Zevia flavors (root beer and cola) were out of stock.

review/summary: good grain free cat food
review/text: I work very hard to find grain-free dry and canned cat food at various suppliers/stores. I generally mix them together so my cats don't get stuck on one brand.<br /><br />The Petco stores near me or sold Soulistic, a brand that not only do all my cats tolerate (no upchucked surprises) and love but it's one of the few canned foods I've found that have actual chunks of meat in them instead of an homogenous "paste".<br /><br />I've tried feeding my cats both the gelee and the gravy versions. Hands down, they prefer the gelee ones. I've purchased the Soulistic brand for over a year now. The furbaby crew and I have been very happy with the product.<br /><br />The closest Petco to me replaced Soulistic with a different grain-free product. So I'll now buy Soulistic through Amazon.

review/summary: Good cat food for a decent price
review/text: Soulistic cat foods are made by the same company that makes Weruva and BFF, but it is made specifically for Petco.  My son recommended these brands as a better grade of food with a little better price than some of the higher end foods (he was a local pet store manager and learned about all kinds of pet foods). So far we have only tried the "gelee" flavors, not the "gravy" ones.  They are all tuna or chicken based, with other fish products mixed in among the ingredients.  They are grain-free, no soy, gluten or nasty additives.  So far I have not had any complaints from the crew here (6 ranging from 4 months to 11 years).  Next order we may try the "gravy' flavors.  Shipping was less expensive if ordered through Amazon than through Petco, shipping was quick, package arrived before the expected delivery date.

review/summary: One of the best "jams" I have ever tasted
review/text: We all remember the Saturday Night Live bit - "With a name like Sumcker's, it has to be good..." But in reality, they really do make wonderful products. My wife is really partial to cherry jellies and jams so when I saw their "Orchard's Finest" Michigan red Tart Cherry Preserves, I decided to be a home hero and surprise her with a jar. I didn't make a big deal about it. I just presented her with a Thomas's English Muffin (my favorite - even better - for me - than the much praised wolferman's english muffins) with the cherry preserves lovingly applied. Just like Igor in Young Frankenstein, she made yummy noises. She loved it and I was number one on the hit parade.<br /><br />She (we, actually) finished the jar quite quickly and this morning, we dipped into a Cherry Jelly from another famous and well regarded brand. No comparison - the Smucker's just flat blew the other brand away.<br /><br />Like cherries? Like Jelly? Want to have a breakfast party on your toast? Try this wonderful product.

review/summary: Get your Starbucks on....at home!
review/text: I'm a Starbucks iced coffee addict.  I like coffee, but iced coffee is what I drink daily during the week.  It's my morning ritual to get my grande black iced coffee (I prefer to put my own half/half and sugar in).  I was buying whatever Starbucks blend I could find, and bought me a nice coffee maker (see previous reviews for that maker awesome!).  Still I couldn't quite get the same taste I get from Starbucks.<br /><br />Then I came across this.  Could this be what I've been missing?  What I didn't realize is that they are straight up coffee beans.  No problem I bought a Krups grinder (cheap, small, and awesome!)  See previous reviews for details.  The iced coffee instructions on the package states 6oz of water and a full cup of ice.  Here are the tumblers I use.  Not your average.  [...]<br /><br />They're pretty much the same as the Starbucks cups, only they're hard reusable plastic.  My job gave them out.  Perfect for my iced coffee.  I put 7oz of water in my coffee maker (though they say something else, I found my sweet spot, you find yours but start with my suggestion), filled the aforementioned tumbler with ice.  Poured hot coffee over the ice.  The starbucks package states 4 tablespoons of coffee.  I don't recommend that unless you want a stomach ache.  I did 3 leveled scoops of coffee and roughly 7oz of water (I'm a bad measure).  Use filtered/Brita water for best results.<br /><br />Put some half/half and some sugar and you'd think you were at Starbucks save for $2.60 a day.<br /><br />Recap:<br /><br />Starbucks - You're looking at it.  Check!<br /><br />Krups Grinder - Because this coffee doesn't come pre-grinded.<br />[...]<br /><br />Coffee Maker:  Because your coffee is only as good as your maker<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005L3NIRS/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00<br /><br />Cup/Tumbler - Because the amount of ice you use is imperative.  If you can't buy these (i.e. this size and style) get something close.<br />[...]

review/text: I think this is really good juice and a good value. I read reviews before purchasing it and I think someone said it wasn't quite sweet enough, but I guess that's a matter of taste because I think it's just right. Sometimes I mix it with cranberry juice for a change of taste. Sometimes I mix it half and half with sugar free grape drink mix to cut down the calories (and grape-up the drink mix). But I also love to drink it straight. Great flavor, good price--what more could I ask?

review/summary: I'm sorry to have to agree with the one-star reviewer about Annie's
review/text: I have used Annie's Lite Raspberry vinaigrette for several years, and lately I've switched to another brand (Newman's Own).  Here's why I no longer buy Annie's salad dressing, with this raspberry vinaigrette being the prime example.<br /><br />Annie's quality on this dressing deteriorated some time ago, when I noticed that the raspberry color had changed and no longer seemed "natural".  The reason is that there's so little actual raspberry(ies) in the dressing that it no longer has the original, wonderful flavor. In fact, the color is now due to black currant "extract" and not from the tiny amount of real raspberry.<br /><br />The second reason that this product is not worth buying is the exorbitant price the company charges, and this is just for a small 8 oz. bottle.<br /><br />The third reason is that this dressing consists mostly of water, followed by  vinegar, and then a vegetable oil (the latter can or may consist of sunflower oil, which is a cheaper oil).<br /><br />I guess the "Lite" on Annie's label for this product ("Annie's Naturals Raspberry Vinaigrette, LITE") now means it's "lite/light in flavor and quality"!  It is really too bad that this company  has decided to cheapen its products, even though at the same time they haven't lowered their outrageous prices...

review/summary: Cheap, nasty garbage parading as healthy.
review/text: There are dozens of organic and/or so-called "natural" salad dressings on the market, but I've never seen and tasted such garbage in my entire life pretending it's healthy. Annie's lines are comprised of the cheapest and smallest amounts of "organic" indredients possible. Keep in mind that many foods are grown organically at low prices so dont' think that because something is organic, that it is high quality, nutritious or in healthy amounts. Annie's dressings are mostly water, made smooth with small amounts of cheap canola oil, an oil which is questioned today as being good for the body. You wont' find cold-pressed olive oils or high-quality spices. Just the lowest, cheapest and smallest amounts of spice, the lack of flavors disguised by the use of vinegar, again another cheap thing to make "organically".  It disgusts me to see this dirt on the  market and to see how bamboozled the average consumer is when they see pretty label with the words "natural" or "organic" on it.  I can make a raspberry or papaya dressing myself all organic and much cheaper, healthier and tastier than this line.

review/text: Maggi sauces are pretty common, but the only one I found myself craving was the Maggi Masala Chili. It is the only Maggi sauce with some bite (it's spicy), and it's perfect with almost any fried dish.  I use it primarily for breaded and fried seafood: crabcakes, tuna croquettes, etc. It is also great as a companion to asian foods like potstickers and dumplings. There is a slight masala flavor, but it does not dominate so the foods retain their flavor; everything does NOT start to taste like curry when you add Maggi's Masala Chili. If you like hotsauces but have yet to find one that has good flavor or enough heat, try the masala chili, you will not be disappointed.

We love Splenda - use it everyday, so we're ok with it.  (Some folks have a problem with it, though).  Currently, in my pantry, I have strawberry (I suggest using this over some low-fat frozen yogurt or ice cream!) vanilla, peanut butter and pancake syrup.  All four taste great!  The consistency of the pancake syrup is thinner than you might want, however.  I bought it because my local store did not have syrup made with Splenda at the time.  (Now they do, though).  The price listed here is good.  I've paid $17 per bottle at an online retailer!!

review/summary: Amazing product for arthritic dogs
review/text: Our 12 yr old shepherd mix has been taking this for about a year.  Our vet reccommended it, he thinks that dogs digest it better than pills.  I wasn't sure, but figured I would try it.<br /><br />Within a week I saw a difference in our dog.  He was a LOT more lively.  And he clearly felt better.  In fact, he felt good enough that he started stealing food off the kitchen counters again.  I was so happy to see that, it represented progress forward (instead of just holding steady, which was my best hope for his arthritis).<br /><br />I reccommend this product to so many of my friend with dogs.  It is really amazing what it can do and how well it works.  Best of all, the dogs love it.  I don't have to smear peanut butter on some pill and hope he'll swallow it.  If you have a dog with arthritis or hip dysplasia, this is worth trying.

review/text: I was not satisfied with these walnuts. The first time I ordered them, they were excellent. The second time I ordered them, they tasted very stale, almost burnt. Absolutely disgusting. Normally, if something is not up to par I will at least eat it to prevent wasting, but these were so bad that I threw them out and considered calling amazon for a return, although I never took the time to do that. I just made the decision never to order them again.

review/text: These were good walnuts.  Not crazy about the plastic bags but these are by far the tastiest walnuts,,more expensive but they taste good and are organic.  Why must healthy food be costly and hard to find?  Anyway I couldn't find these again to re-order so I am trying another brand. I will just have to look out for these.

review/summary: quality has diminshed recently
review/text: This has been a disappointing item the last few shipments. The quality of the walnuts has been deteriorating so much so that I have cancelled the last two shipments. Has the nut crop been drastically affected by some problem? The walnuts, almonds and pistachios seem to have been affected in the last three months. Previously I have been totally satisfied with the Sun Ridge products.

review/summary: Good flavor but too thick
review/text: So Hot Kid! Makes these rice crackers for infants called Baby Mumums.<br />My brother keeps eating my daughters crackers. I must admit they are very tasty (especially the veggie flavor)<br />So I've been searching for an adult rice cracker thats similar.<br />These crackers were close. They are just too thick. Thats the only problem. If they were 1/2 or even 2/3 as thick they would be better. The flavor is sort of soy saucey. Its a good flavor. But i'm still searching for an adult rice cracker as good as a Baby Mumum (but hopefully less expensive by oz)

review/summary: Fast Food - Good Food
review/text: This is a fantastic meal in a can.  Not too spicy but not bland at all, it can be eaten alone, just heat it up. You can also add some tomato sauce and vegetarian protein crumbles (I use Yves brand) and it's a terrific chili that tastes great in whole wheat pita bread or a tortilla wrap. Low salt, low fat, it's a perfect fast food dinner when you're tired.  I ordered a case because the local supply is inconsistent.  Too bad that there are many shelves of sodium- and fat-based products, and so little room for simple, organic good food.  I will enjoy this for many meals this summer.

A shot of hot sauce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EISKJ6">Huy Fong Sriracha sauce - 17 oz x 2 bottles</a> and a few twists of sea salt made the flavor pop. I've also enjoyed these with a sprinkling of grated cheese. A convenient, fast meal that doubles as comfort food. Good stuff.

review/text: I bought two cans of this product from a health food store other than Amazon and was quite dissappointed when I heated it up for a "fast food" dinner.  As far as I could tell, it had absolutely no taste except for the hot peppers, which were far too hot for me.  And as the most liked negative review said, it had a very unpleasant smell.<br /><br />Judging from the variability of the reviews, I'm guessing this is a work in progress.

review/summary: Really Fresh
review/text: Our pumpkin seeds arrived on June 29, 2011.  The code on our bags is 1441148, which means the production date is May 24, 2011.  It's amazing how it goes from production to my hands in a bit over a month.  The pumpkin seeds indeed look and smell fresh.  In fact, the aroma and taste are really intense.  I'm so used to Trader Joe's and Whole Food's pumpkin seeds that are drier and probably older.  (Unfortunately, my local Trader Joe's stopped selling organic pumpkin seeds and Whole Foods is so expensive that I needed to find something more affordable.)  After I open a new bag, I leave it open to dry a bit.  We are probably losing some nutrition, but it does improve the taste while keeping them raw.<br /><br />The Amazon webpage only says, "Processed in a facility which uses peanuts and other nuts."  The back of the package says, "May contain wheat, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, milk".  The pumpkin seeds are probably processed in a facility that processes wheat, soy, and milk too.

It contains a natural bouillon that makes it REAL easy to cook up. I added some chopped onions saute'd in a bit of olive oil and a bit of butter, then added the mix, 1/2 cup of white wine, let that evaporate, then started ladling in boiling water keeping the rice covered until it was done. I added 1-2 tablespoons of butter and grated parmiggiano, and it was my four guests delight at how delicious and satisfying this dish was.

review/summary: Mild and Interesting Cool Spiciness
review/text: I admit that I still haven't figured out what this cheese might be "ideal" for, but I'm guessing roast beef sandwiches (haven't tried that yet).  I really liked it.  Although I dislike "hot" spicy foods, featuring ingredients such as chilis or cumin, I do find that I can enjoy those "cool" spicy foods like horseradish and wasabi.  To me, while they have a bite, they also seem to have a bit of a fresh breeze quality to them.  I suppose these spices help to clear the breathing passages.<br /><br />In any event - this is essentially a very mild cheese, with a mild horseradish effect (not so bland that you can't taste it, but not overwhelming).  I've had this cheese by itself on rye flatbread, which is an appealing and satisfying snack; on oatcakes (crackers) - again, very tasty and filling; and also with salmon salad on rye flatbread, which it suited very well.  I think this is a good cheese for using with fish because of the horseradish.<br /><br />The cheese is firmish, but not hard, crumbly or "snappy" - it cuts with a bit of a soft folding quality when at room temperature.  It has a very nice, creamy, even texture, is not mushy or sticky or otherwise unpleasant.  It seemed very fresh and the horseradish taste was very fresh and natural as well - there is no weird chemical effect or aftertaste - all in all very nicely done.

review/text: I have tried coconut coffee I purchased at my supermarket years ago which was very tasty, so  I was excited to receive this coffee.  When I open the bag smell a bit of coconut, but the big disappointment came after I brewed it.  There is no coconut taste or smell when drinking the cup of coffee.  I ordered this bag because it came in beans so I thought I could get the maximum flavor of coconut.  This is not how real coconut coffee should taste like.  Who care if the beans smell a bit of coconut if you can't taste it when drinking your coffee.

review/text: I love the flavor of coconut coffee, so when I discovered the Boyer's on Amazon and at the time it was discounted for signing up for auto-ship (very affordable) I was very excited. However, the taste left me so sad. It is not very coconutty at all. I reground it to a finer grind and that helped some but it just doesn't have enough flavor for me. I just got my second auto-ship and will drink it but will also look for something with a little more pizzaz.

review/summary: Truth: Flavor's too artificial, roast too light!
review/text: I'm not really familiar with this brand of coffee, however, I bought it because I had been searching for a decent coconut flavored coffee. I have to say, this was NOT it. People who truly know coffee and drink it on a freakish basis (like me) will recognize that the flavor here is too artificial and the roast is waaay too light!! I typically buy my coffee "whole bean" medium-dark roast but this just didnt cut it for me. I guess most people who would like this are amateur coffee drinkers, but for me I won't be buying this again. The bean itself, is not even dark brown or blackish-brown like most coffee beans. It's actually beige!! I can't even use creamer/milk with this because it will really turn the coffee to water. I recommend [...] for the best flavored coffee along with other gourmet blends. Good Luck.
