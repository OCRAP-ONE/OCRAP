review/summary: good combination of (nonherbal) Tea and other flavors
review/text: This "Vanilla Spice" energy tea is based on a combination of Green and Black Tea with a variety of organic root and leaf flavors to round it out. Both my husband and I like the taste of this tea. The vanilla flavor is mild and I also taste the Rooibos, and some hints of the other flavors. I normally don't care for plain rooibus tea, but it works well in this combination. The tea is slightly sweet, probably because of the addition of Stevia Leaf and the Licorice Root. I am not a coffee or energy drink consumer, so the 80 mg of caffeine is rather much for me, but I did not feel jittery, and I also did feel a bit of a lift. I think any caffiene (most of which is "naturally occurring" anyway) could make you feel jittery, though. The Yogi people have also added a "naturally occurring amino acid found in green tea, [which, (they say)] promotes relaxation by calming the mind."<br /><br />I am definitely going to drink some more of this tea in the a.m.s and check out how it makes me feel.

review/summary: Packs a pow!
review/text: I don't like a lot of herbal teas.  Lots of them taste the way health food stores smell--like herbs and vitamins--or else they go way off the flowery end.<br /><br />Yogi Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy Tea is hearty without being overpowering, the herbs are evident without being weird, and it provides a real afternoon pick me up.  I was a little worried about the caffeine.  Afternoon sodas, regular tea and coffee disturb my sleep at night, but this seems to have no ill effects.  It smells wonderful, the vanilla is the predominant flavor and aroma but it's not all vanilla.  There's enough spice to make it interesting without being a chai.  It's definitely tea and is a true "beverage that cheers and does not intoxicate".  It's a very nice afternoon break and does seem to provide a little energy, though that may just be the power of suggestion.<br /><br />There's lots of stuff in this tea.  Green tea and black tea, and a lot of other things that sound like they came from the ashram in Eat Pray Love.  I haven't had the urge to start meditating since I've been drinking this, so it's safe if you want to stay mainstream, and it really is delicious.<br /><br />Just as an aside, it would also make an excellent base for a hot adult beverage if one felt inclined to add a shot of something to a cup after a long freezing afternoon spent shoveling the mountains of snow we've had this winter. Not that I've tried that or anything.

review/summary: Pleasant Energy
review/text: I am a big fan of teas, including herbal.  During a normal day, I drink some PG Tips black tea for energy and herbal teas for the flavor.  This Yogi tea is essentially a combination of both.  It contains black tea, green tea, and a variety of herbs that create a vanilla chai flavor.  The flavor is really good, albeit similar to other things I've had.  The green and black teas provide an energy boost from caffeine (80 mg), while the organic Gotu Kola leaf and Ashwagandah provide the more hippy resolution to low energy.  I really don't know if the latter ingredients help, but I can say that I don't get jittery.<br /><br />The one qualm I have is that by mixing herbal, black, and green teas, you are not going to get proper steeping on all.  For example, black and herbal are best steeped in freshly boiled water, while green can become bitter if you don't let the water cool a bit.  All types are generally steeped for different times as well.  Regardless, I still enjoy this tea enough to drink it regularly and if you enjoy flavors such as cinnamon and ginger, I would recommend giving it a try.

review/summary: Love the taste- but not energizing
review/text: I think this tea tastes great. It is sweet with a hint of spice, and is very mild (not like a chai tea). BUT, this tea makes me tired. It is supposed to be an energy tea, so I'm not sure what exactly is happening, but within 30-60 minutes after drinking a glass I feel like I want to lay down and take a nap. I'm going to try some of their other energy teas and see if they work any better for me.

review/summary: Subtle and smooth
review/text: This is a soft and delicately flavored tea with a heavenly aroma. I'm a big coffee fan, but I like tea too and for a few days decided to try substituting this for my usual coffee. While I did enjoy it, I think it's better as a middle of the afternoon treat than a substitute for morning coffee. I think that could change if I got used to substituting the mildness of tea for the robustness of coffee, but I think I'll just keep it around for an occasional treat. For those who prefer tea, this one would be a wonderful way to start the day.

No more yawning, feeling tired, etc. I wanted to try a powerful tea because coffee wasn't doing the job for me anymore in the morning. One tea bag has almost as much caffeine as one cup of coffee, but it energizes you much more, and it's very healthy too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT.

review/text: I love caffeine but hate coffee, and it's probably not good to have an energy drink every day. I've found this to be a great substitute. For awhile I was drinking Teavana's Samarui Chai, which has a pretty similar taste, but is far more expensive. Very mild tasting and smells wonderful, "like Christmas," as my husband said. I find I feel more energized without feeling jittery. The price is also great on Amazon.

review/text: I have tried many flavours of Yogi brand tea. I think they all taste good and do what it says.<br />Since its hard to tell the pick up in energy I tried this tea for 1 month 2-3 times a day at work. I was always energised and feeling good. Then I stopped having the tea and went back to Coffee and other cafenieated drinks couple times a day. Feeling was not so great and I was sometimes sleepy afetr coffee in the middle of day.<br />Now, I am back to having this tea and back to my high performance, feel and look good days :-).<br /><br />There is a very apparent and stable energy boost to my body with this. And it comes with many other health benfits of tea. I have it with no sugar or milk added.<br /><br />Cheers

review/summary: Delicious but expensive
review/text: Let's start with the positive - this is a very tasty tea.  The spicy aroma and the perfect amount of vanilla flavor makes for a cup of tea that is worth savoring.  It has caffeine, for those of us that need our tea to provide a boost in our energy levels.  It is also a relatively mild (or weak, if you prefer) tea, which is the way I prefer my tea (this might be a negative for those that prefer a stronger cup of tea).<br /><br />While being 100% Natural is a good thing, I have to balance that against my budget, and this tea, while having a great flavor, simply doesn't provide sufficient value to me to justify the price.  There are a lot of other tea options out there, and it is really hard for me to pass over other, more affordable, options for this.  For people with different budget priorities, this may well be worth it.

review/text: I have tasted other teas that are similar but the boost that goes with this tea is a pleasant boost.  Caffeine jolts aren't for everyone and this tea uses a variety of stimulating herbs that I found pleasant. I didn't sweeten this tea but for those who prefer to sweeten their tea this seemed like a tea that would be enhanced by sweetener. This is an enjoyable addition to the Yogi collection. For those who enjoy Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice Tea, this would be an excellent alternative for a change of pace. The two aren't identical but have enough similarities that they can both be used and enjoyed as I do. I don't buy one or the other but drink both depending on my mood.

review/summary: Good taste.. energy depends on your caffiene tolerance.
review/text: This is a good tasting tea but needs to be steeped for awhile or it's a bit weak. I think the "perfect energy" is a bit of a stretch since there are so many variables to whether or not this will help your energy level. It does have caffiene so if caffiene does anything for you it might boost your energy. I rarely ever have caffiene so for me it did give me an energy boost but also insominia so it wasn't a good trade off.  Overall, I liked the flavor and if I was going to stay up late or needed an extra burst for a specific reason I would have a cup. However, it's not something I would incorporate into my routine because of the caffiene and my low tolerance for it.

review/summary: Great flavor, helps me focus, but still leaves me with jitters
review/text: This tea claims to naturally energize without the jitters. I wish it did that. Although "all natural", it's important to note that each cup of tea contains about 80 mg of caffeine. That's enough to give me jitters in the middle of the afternoon, which is when I've been drinking this tea for about a month. I don't use any sugar, so the effect is completely a result of the tea.<br /><br />That aside, the tea does somehow relax my brain. My mind wanders constantly, and usually by 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon, I need something to keep me focused and keep me from getting cranky. The only way I can describe the effect this tea has on me is "calming". It's easier for me to focus, even though I still feel "jittery". One cup of this tea keeps me going through the late afternoon hours, and the "jitters" usually subside within one to two hours, while I remain focused for at least three or four.<br /><br />The tea has an excellent aroma. I love opening the package and just smelling the tea-bag -- the scent alone is quite calming. You can definitely smell and taste the vanilla. The spices aren't too overpowering, and I find this tea to have an excellent taste overall. It's not bitter compared to other "all natural" herbal teas I've had.<br /><br />Ultimately it depends how sensitive you are to caffeine, but I would recommend this tea for ocassional use.

review/text: With a 2 hour commute, I enjoy a good cup of tea/coffee on my drives home from work.  This tea is one of my favorites.  I drank this tea without sweeteners and I really do enjoy the taste and the smell is nice too.  The only (sort of) negative I would have is that it doesn't keep me quite as alert as coffee does.  With this in mind, I would choose this tea over coffee on any day that I don't need the max amount of caffeine.  I also like the fact that it is 100% natural.  Now I have to try the other flavors of Yogi teas.

Unfortunately it didn't list all the ingredients online so I took a chance anyway.  First off let me say that this smells like heaven and tastes great too but if you have a heart condition you won't be able to drink it.  I was only able to take a few sips so that I could try it for the flavor.  DH said it did indeed make him get a little pick me up after drinking it so I will go with it does help energize you.  The flavor is perfectly balanced and not overwhelming so as long as you don't have a health issue give this a try.  It really is good and I do hope at some point the company can come out with this particular flavor in a decaf.

review/summary: Smooth tasting and very aromatic...
review/text: Can you call a tea smooth?  I don't know if a tea can be labeled as smooth, but every time I take a sip, I can't help but think how smooth this tea is.  And it smells so good...a gentle, light, spicy aroma with a hint of vanilla.<br /><br />As for flavor, this tea has a mild spicy flavor & is not bitter. I can smell the vanilla more than I can taste it. I don't need to add sweetener.<br /><br />The product claims ".... this delicious tea is sure to energize the body while calming and focusing the mind with every cup."  I don't notice an energy increase after drinking this tea, but I drink, on average, 3 cups of drip coffee during the day. So it's understandable to me why I wouldn't feel an energy lift.  I do feel more calmed and focused when I drink Yogi Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy Tea. So for me, the 2nd part of their claim is correct.<br /><br />Ingredients as listed on the label:<br />Proprietary Blend of Herbs:  1660mg per tea bag<br />Organic Green Tea Leaf<br />  "  Assam Black Tea Leaf<br />  "  Cinnamon Bark<br />  "  Rooibos Leaf<br />  "  Honeybush<br />  "  Green Tea Leaf Extract<br />  "  Ginger Root<br />Oreganic Licorice Root<br />Stevia Leaf<br />Organic Gotu Kola Leaf<br />  "  Ashwagandha Root<br />  "  Shatavari Root<br />  "  Shank Pushpi<br />L-Theanine Suntheanine�  15mg<br />Other Ingredients:<br />Natural Vanilla Flavor, Organic Chai Spice Flavor, Vanilla Bean.<br />Each tea bag contains 80mg of caffeine, as compared to approx. 90mg in 8oz of coffee.<br />Warning:<br />Not for use by pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants or children. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, consult your healthcare professional before use.<br /><br />I like this tea and am having my 2nd cup as I finish this review.

review/summary: Not enough energy...
review/text: I handed this tea over to my husband to drink, because he likes/consumes energy drinks a lot, and I figured he would have the best opinion on how well this tea lives up to it's name. To begin with, he was mildly impressed with the flavor. He generally likes vanilla flavor but did not seem to find this flavor to be anything remarkable. I thought it smelled pretty good when he brewed it. Reminded me of those glade plug-ins air fresheners. (Seriously!) As for the energy aspect of this tea, he said it did not affect him one bit. He drank it over several days and said he felt no difference in his energy level as a result of this tea. I was stunned by that, considering it packs 80mg of caffeine per cup! And he did not drink it watered down either! On the upside, though, he said it naturally tasted slightly sweet which he liked (no need to add sugar!), and the long list of the herbs in the tea are actually good for you, so that's a nice plus. Overall it's a good product but if you are looking for a marked energy boost, I believe this tea will not offer that. He never felt any side effects from it either, which is good. That being - no headaches, no stomach upset, no jitters, etc. It seems to be a high quality product. Maybe for people who do not regularly consume caffeine or energy drink products, this might work differently or better as an energy beverage. :)

review/summary: Won't Kill My Coffee Habit But It's Alright
review/text: I've been an herbal tea drinker since I was a toddler. I blame my new-agey grandmother. ;)<br /><br />When it comes to caffiene though, I tend to gravitate toward a steaming cup of black coffee. I like the taste and texture of coffee over tea if I want a jolt of perkiness. That said, lately I find myself shaky after my third cup. That awful jittery feeling is not fun and tends to make me so nauseous I regret my last cup of coffee. I'm not a big fan of tea as my post lunch pick-me-up, white and green teas tend to leave an awful after taste. But I am always open to trying something new when it comes to teas, again I blame my grandmother.<br /><br />I'm very familiar with Yogi's products. Last year I was an Amazon Subscribe & Save customer for their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SFA">Yogi Woman's Nursing Support, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> which is a great product. Their teas are well blended for whatever health benefit they are made for and for the most part they taste pretty good. I expected I would like the Vanilla Spice flavor of this one much more since I enjoy Chai.<br /><br />For the past week I have replaced one of my three daily cups of coffee with this to see how it would do in curing that midday jitteryfest I've had going on. It works like a charm! My problem? I don't like the taste. *head/desk* If you like a very mild, weak tea this one has a very mellow and Chai-like quality. But no matter how strong I've steeped it I just haven't cared for the flavor.<br /><br />If you're someone who likes the flavor of Chai and are looking for a mild caffienated beverage to give you some perk without the shakes I DO highly recommend this one. I would, however, suggest trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004051BLS">Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> as an alternative if you prefer green tea or mint over black teas, I loved it and will be reviewing it soon.

review/summary: The taste is very mild - and it was only so so on the energizing
review/text: I thought this would be a perfect tea to try as I am trying to cut down to one cup of coffee in the AM. So I made this about 9:30AM (I am usually at work by 8am at the latest and am usually having coffee #2 about this time). I liked the flavor but it's not very strong. Definitely can smell and taste spice but not so much the vanilla. I really like vanilla so I would have preferred that be stronger. It is smooth, not bitter, and slightly sweet - it did not need much sweetening to me.<br /><br />So the flavor is o.k. I like it just fine. The energizing part though - I'm not sure it gave me any energy. I did not expect it to give me anything like I would get with coffee but a very small bit would be nice. I didn't feel it delivered that. I did feel more focused - perhaps that's another benefit they didn't mention?<br /><br />Regardless this is a nice tea - it would be fine for a late afernoon or mid morning for those who enjoy tea's like chai with the traditional spices. I wouldn't go out of my way to pick this up but if I saw it in the store I'd likely buy it. I think it would be a nice tea to have around the house. Some tea's have odd flavors (or so the looks on my visitor's face tells me lol). This one seems solid - I think many would enjoy it.

review/summary: Good taste and energy
review/text: I like this tea.  It works at least as well as coffee for me.  Actually, even better in that the energy it supplies seems to last longer than your typical cup of coffee.  As the advertising states, no jitters show up after drinking it.  I'm usually a calm type person, so it's hard to tell about the claimed mentally calming effect of this tea, but for sure it produced no anxiousness.  I remained quite calm.  The taste is good, naturally sweet.  When I first tried it I threw in some natural sweetener but soon learned it was unnecessary.  Seems to me to be a good herbal energy tea, especially if you would like to try something instead of coffee.  It does contain caffeine but also a lot of healthy herbal ingredients.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Too Mild
review/text: I do like Yogi teas, and have tried several kinds over the years.<br /><br />I prepared this tea as per their instructions, letting the tea steep for 4-6 minutes.  I actually let my tea steep even longer then that.  It looked dark enough in the cup, but I found the tea too weak to only use one tea bag for an 8 ounce cup, which is what I used, and what they said to use.<br /><br />To me, it tasted like very weak chai tea, which I do enjoy chai tea.  The vanilla flavor was very faint, at least to me.  I was hoping for a stronger vanilla flavor to this tea.<br /><br />It didn't do anything for me energy wise.  Next time I use this tea, I will be using two tea bags instead of one.  It wasn't bitter to me, so I just drank it straight, using no sweetener, which I normally use honey, but that is more for if Iam drinking tea because I have a sore throat, or if the tea is bitter, which was not the case this time.<br /><br />Some medicinal teas do a very good job at helping with whatever ailment you have, but to me this tea will just be enjoyed as another cup of tea, without thinking it will actually go anything specific, like giving me added energy.<br /><br />What's funny, they compare this tea to having almost as much caffeince as a cup of coffee,80 mg for an 8 ounce cup of this tea, versus 90 mg for an 8 ounce cup of coffee, but to me, even tho I don't like my coffee very strong, one cup of coffee I would feel a difference, it would perk me up sooner, but with this tea I didn't notice any change at all.<br /><br />I agree, this tea does not make you jittery, because it really doesn't have any effect of that kind at all, at least not on me!

review/text: I have been drinking tea for over thirty years, and tea in America has improved! Vine offered me a chance to try another basic tea, and its a good entry level, AM drinking tea.<br />I found the vanilla just a little strong for my taste, so I mixed it with black tea and it makes a large pot, perfect with stevia and a touch of milk.<br />I do not think this would taste well without milk, but then I like the english school of tea, and do not understand why Americans try to drink black tea black, like its coffee?<br />Not impressed my the less caffeine argument on the side of the box, the only way to get no /less caffeine in teas is to drink steeped herbs, this has tea in it, so it has cafffeine, duh.<br />So enjoy, its good flavorful choice when tired of the basic teas.

review/summary: Nice tea blend
review/text: This definitely will appeal to those who enjoy a vanilla spice flavor to their tea.  I tried not to steep mine for too long (the package says 4-6 minutes), but the flavors were still there and pleasant enough.  The tea itself is not the greatest, but it is a mixed blend of a few types of tea so you are not going to get the best of all worlds just something from each type of tea (as pointed out the steeping time(s) are different for each type of tea, so when you mix them you're going to be missing out on at least one of them).  Otherwise, it's an enjoyable tea, I definitely wasn't jittery and the tea did wake me up, so recommended for that.

review/summary: The perfect energy might be coming from the caffeine boost, instead of the herbs!  It also doesn't have much flavor.
review/text: I tried this one and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004051BLS">Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> at the same time.  Well, not in the same cup at the same time, but within the same week.  This one can't compare to the mint one.  Maybe since my palate likes black tea over green.  I can smell the great scent of vanilla and ginger, but something is lost in the taste.  It could be that too many flavors are coming to this party.  There are two types of red tea, then green tea and also Assam black tea in this. There are some herbs that make me laugh, like Shank Pushpi and then oddly trademarked ingredients like L-Theanine Suntheanine.  I have to watch this one when it brews. The other one I tried, the mint, doesn't get bitter if you let it brew too long, this one almost has to be brewed at the minimum time stated on the package, which is four minutes, in order for it to taste the best.  I don't like the flavor of this without sugar.  It's a bit too astringent.  Again, that might be the weird mix of green and red teas, along with herbs and ingredients I haven't ran across before now.  It packs even more caffeine than the mint tea, 80mg when a cup of coffee has 90mg.  It's strong stuff.<br />Overall, I got this box to review and will drink it merrily with a bit of sugar in it, watching closely to make sure I don't overbrew it.  I can't use the bags over again, it's way too  bitter.  I don't think I'd buy a box of this because the flavor isn't that interesting to me, even though it has a lot of the spices and herbs I enjoy in teas -- cinnamon, licorice, natural vanilla flavor, vanilla bean, chai spice, ginger -- I don't get why I don't like this as much as I feel I should.  Perhaps there is too much of everything in this tea, making none of the herbs or teas stick out so it is has a lackluster taste.  It isn't horrible, but it's all the memorable either.  It does energize me, but I am not sure if it is because I just drank the tea version of coffee or if I am getting any benefit from the weird mix of herbs, spices and other ingredients.

review/text: I don't know, maybe I expect too much.<br /><br />"Perfect Energy"? "Vanilla Spice"? Those phrases evoke something pretty awesome in my mind, while this tea is just... fine. Nothing objectionable, but nothing fabulous either.<br /><br />I didn't notice the energy lift being any more perfect than any other mildly-caffeineated tea. About equivalent to an Oolong, maybe. The flavors of vanilla and spice were both very gentle, not strong enough to add milk and make chai. Fine with a bit of sweetener and no milk, though.<br /><br />Maybe the fact that the other Yogi Tea flavor I like is ginger has set me up to expect something with a bit more punch.

review/text: I'm not sure what I enjoy the most about this Yogi tea flavor.  The tea smells so delicious as it is steeping. The taste is also wonderful.  It tastes like vanilla chai.  The tea is sweet and no additional sweetener is necessary. As far as the energy aspect, I do believe it.  I have been drinking a cup every morning after my workout and have had an high energy and focus level for the rest of the day.  It seems to be a long lasting effect with no sudden energy burst or drop.  Perfect.  I'm planning on ordering more before my supply runs out!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />NOTE: I have purchased this item since my review.

review/text: I was expecting vanilla flavor with maybe a true spicy flavor, something like a lingering taste of cinnamon maybe. But there was nothing. Barely could I taste the vanilla. I was really bummed, usually I use energizing teas as a pick me up. I make some, freeze it, and when I'm running around with my kids in the early hours, I have something refreshing and light to drink. But this tea was very flat tasting. And didn't give a boost of energy.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: This is quite an enjoyable tea. There's a bit of a mixed message that comes across when it talks about giving you energy without the jitters, since it is a caffeinated product. I drink it for the flavor, which I enjoy. I didn't find that it energized me, but neither does coffee, so that doesn't mean that it wouldn't energize others. Caffeine doesn't impact me at all so I am not a good benchmark for that.<br /><br />I didn't like having yoga promoted on the box because of the religious connections, but that wouldn't prevent me from purchasing it again. It has been a nice cup of tea on a cold winter day. I've also enjoyed the clever proverbs on the teabag tags. That's a nice addition.

review/summary: tasty with almost as much caffeine as coffee
review/text: Although it advertises energy without the jitters, this is not a caffeine free product.  The nutrition label states that it contains 80mg of caffeine compared to an 8 oz cup of coffee which contains 90mg.  If you don't don caffeine, this is not the tea for you.<br /><br />As for flavor, it is a mild tea with a hint of vanilla and spice.  It is not sweet even though it has stevia in it and I recommend using your favorite sweetener.  I use splenda or agave nectar.  Without the sweetness, the flavor is a little on the light side so don't cheat yourself by a short steep time.  If steeped long enough, and sweetened, it is very tasty and a great substitute for that cup of coffee.

review/summary: Not a plesant combination of flavors
review/text: I am not a tea drinker, so I let my wife try this product since she enjoys tea and has several varieties on hand at any given time.  She was eager to try this vanilla spice tea, since she had never had tea flavored in such a way.<br /><br />She had the tea as a mid-afternoon "pick me up," intrigued by its package claim, "energizes the body and focuses the mind."  Her initial reaction was not enthusiastic.  In fact, she wasn't thrilled with the combination of vanilla and tea.  She looked at the package information and found that an 8-ounce cup of this tea contains only 10 mg. less caffeine than an equivalent cup of coffee, so the "Naturally energizes without the jitters" package claim is misleading.  The tea contains quite a bit of caffeine.<br /><br />She tried a second cup the next day, wanting to be sure to give it a fair evaluation.  The second cup confirmed her opinion.  Yogi's Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy tea is far less satisfying than peppermint tea, green tea, or orange spice tea, three of her favorites.  She would not be inclined to try this product again.

After weeks of extremely bad coughs and bronchitis, we found Halls Plus was the only cough drop that would control our coughs. In fact it was even better than a prescription cough syrup. The difficulty we had was the drug stores and grocery stores very seldom carried the "Plus" product. Finally we checked Amazon and were able to order it and received it within 2 days. The Halls non plus and brand name cough drops did not work. The Halls "Plus" was always successful.

review/text: Tried just about most and these are just okay. I do not use them myself, but a lovely lady I die for is an expert and you can tell when she is seriously pleased, or just satisfied. This product warrants a 3 Star and the comments were that they did not have the punch that. let's say Honey's, have. In our situation the stronger the mix the more satisfied she is. Fisherman's have a very strong one, Riccola are pretty decent, and I guess that what drives her to consumption is that she claims they help her to breathe well and since my job is to find the best for the moola I asked her about Halls Plus Drops, Honey Lemon, 25-Count Drops (Pack of 12) and she said for me to get her the, Honeys?, next time. I suppose people have different tastes and I am not criticizing or putting down the fine reviewers that gave this product many stars. Everyone is perfectly entitled to their own opinion, where one person might like a particular product, another might not. So I guess is all about the average from the number of reviews that I look for. 3 Stars.

review/text: First of all, Amazon, if you read this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make pet food available for Subscribe & Save!!! :)<br /><br />I buy this at my local Walmart. I live in a small bedroom community to a larger town, and I really try to stick to foods I can get easily without having to make a special commute into town to go to a pet store. It's about $30 a bag at Walmart - so close to what Amazon charges. I was looking for something slightly cheaper than Iams that my dog would like better. He would often let his breakfast sit until dinner time because I don't think he cared for the Iams.<br /><br />My dog is a 104 lb German Shepherd, so he is a big boy who definitely benefits from a large breed formula. He seems to really like this Purina, he wolfs it down in the mornings now. I like that it's $10 cheaper than Iams, but still a high quality food that has good ingredients. I think the first one is a meat. There are no fillers or soy in it either, which will save on vet bills in the long run.<br /><br />HOWEVER... and this is a dealbreaker... this gives my dog the WORST GAS. Like.... room-clearing gas. It's utterly disgusting. He has it consistently for an hour or two after he eats... and the only word for it is NASTY. It took a couple of weeks of this food before it set in (and nothing else has changed in his diet or habits)... I think I had already bought the second bag of it before I made the connection.<br /><br />We will be switching to a different food. I picked up plain old Pedigree at the grocery store last time I stocked up. It is a much cheaper food, that requires I feed him 50% more by volume for the same weight (6 cups a day versus 4 cups) so that negates any savings. I think the Pedigree was $20 a bag, and the main ingredient is a filler. =/ I didn't know these things when I bought it, I just wanted something, ANYTHING, other than the Purina and it's stink bombs.<br /><br />We will probably be switching back to Iams, alas.

review/summary: Great Tea!
review/text: This is a great Chai to go along with the many other spectacular Chai's made by Celestial Seasonings. It is light, and a good drink before bed due to it being decaffeinated. I found this blend to be best with half and half with some light brown sugar to make it nice and creamy. This is a great tea!

review/summary: Best Tea Ever
review/text: A co-worker introduced me to this wonderful tea and I am hooked.  Let me see if I can describe it.  I like Chai Tea, but sometimes the "smokiness" of the chai can be overwhelming to me.  This tea combines the lovely sweetness of coconut with the dark rich quality of the chai.  The aroma is a treat as well.  Everyone I have made this for LOVES this tea.  When I brew this tea, I am able to use one tea bag for 2-3 cups of hot water and it still is flavorable.  I drink it with a small amount of cream and one artificial sweetner, but many of my friends like it without any sweetner at all.  I highly recommend this tea.

review/text: This is my all time favorite decaf chai.  The coconut undertone is subtle, but definitely present.  This is a very smooth chai, with a full, but not strong taste, which I prefer at bedtime.  As with all CS chais, I wish they would use a bit more cardamom.

review/summary: Not their best!
review/text: I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends.  This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea.  The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice.  Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Love the moment and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries." Corita Kent.

review/summary: Got me on the tea bandwagon
review/text: When in Boulder this summer I took a tour of the Celestial Seasonings factory.  Kind of boring.  Except for the enclosed room where they keep the various mint herbs.  It will clear your sinuses!  But I digress.  You do get to sample any tea they have and that is worth the trip.<br /><br />In any case, I love this tea.  I have always enjoyed the iced tea they serve at Thai restaurants.  Not the full version with the sweetened cream.  Just straight.  To me, this is very close.  I kind of wish it was caffeinated, but its nice to have something to drink at night.<br /><br />Coconut flavor?  If I had drank it not knowing what it was, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify such a flavor.  But something about this tea does have a very unique flavor, which I like.  And it is also absent vanilla, a flavor I dislike in teas.<br /><br />I drink it iced.  I have gone thru 6 boxes in a couple of months and re-ordered early via Amazon's subscription service and am pleased.

review/summary: My Favorite Chai
review/text: When it comes to Chai tea, this Celestial Seasonings Chai Decaf Tea, Sweet Coconut Thai is my favorite. I really love the Indian and Thai fusion of flavors in this tea. A perfect combination I must say. I like the coconut taste in this tea, and when it comes to Thai-inspired at-home teas, this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Chai definitely tastes better than Yogi Tea's Sweet Thai Delight tea. It's also a bonus that this tea is decaffeinated, and as the other Amazon reviewers have said, this tea is definitely perfect for relaxation and before going to bed. If you like Thai-inspired teas such as this, I also suggest trying Harney and Sons' Bangkok Green Tea with Thai Flavors. It's an excellent, delicious fine tea with coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Thai-picked Lemon Chamomile, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, and Spring Peach Oolong Teas. Another tea with some Thai influence is the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' Organic Berry Berry Caffeine-Free tea. For cold Thai teas, I highly recommend Taste Nirvana's Real Thai Tea Latte and Real Green Tea Latte. My parents were born and raised in Thailand, and thus I'm Thai American. If you actually visit Thailand, which I have multiple times since the majority of my relatives live there, then I highly recommend trying Thai Chrysanthemum tea. I had the best tea I've ever had in my entire life in Thailand. And that's saying something because I've actually traveled up (sometimes my small traveling party and I had to walk a long and grueling hike for intervals of 30 minutes to a whole hour. Even actor Blair Underwood made a comment how he was amazed that even elderly Chinese women could climb up these mountains for long periods of time, and claimed they were in better shape than him! That's how I felt as well. If you visit China, you will see that a lot of Chinese are very physically fit - they walk, hike, bike a lot and do all sorts of exercises such as swimming and Tai Chi and fan exercises in their parks) the tea-growing terraced mountains in and around the Guilin region of China and tasted tea from those Chinese regions and also tasted some tea when I traveled to Japan, but those Asian teas don't compare to the Chrysanthemum tea I had many years back in northern Thailand. (I haven't traveled to England and India yet, but would love to. I bet the teas there are amazing. But like I said, from all the countries I've traveled to so far - Thailand has the best teas, cold and hot.) When I think about it, I was very young then, and I should have asked the Thai waitress where they got their tea from. All I know is that I drank that tea at a restaurant at a Thai hotel resort many years back in Northern Thailand not far from Chiang Rai and the Golden Triangle region. Anyways, I have given boxes of this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai Decaf Tea as small gifts to friends in the past few years. The fact that you can order this in packs of six at an affordable price is great, and allows you the luxury to share some of this tea with friends and family. My verdict is that this is a nice aromatic, delicious tea to unwind for the day.

review/text: I'm really fond of this chai.  I like a lot of chais, but this one is unique with the blend of red and decaf black tea, sweetened with coconut.  It forgives a long steep or a wide range of temperatures (though hotter temps bring out better flavor), and I find the blend of flavors quite nice, particularly for such an inexpensive brand of tea.<br /><br />As with most chais, this tea is not at all bitter.

review/text: I am a fan of many different teas, with my taste spanning from herbal, black, white, green, and roobios. I appreciate the kick of some caffeine, but when evening arrives, that "kick" will keep me up all night. Enter this wonderful Thai coconut chai, and I have a wonderful evening beverage. Add a smidge of milk and sugar and it is honestly perfection. The flavors are well-balanced, and perfectly-suited to any time of the day. My kids (age 7 and 9) are hooked as well. It's their favorite tea, hands down.

To this I add a heaping teaspoon of xylitol, which is a healthy and alkalizing sweetener.<br /><br />I especially like that this tea is caffeine free and features rooibos tea. Rooibos tea is as healthy as green tea, I've read, and it's far more palatable when combined with these delicious spices.<br /><br />I see one reader didn't like the coconut flavoring. Fair enough, but I recommend you try buying one box locally and deciding for yourself. I like everything about the flavor, as do many others who rated the tea. And the prices offered here can't be beat.

review/text: I have been drinking this pretty much every evening for the past year.  I had a hard time finding this flavor in my local stores, and I was delighted to find it at Amazon.  Yes, it might be a bit more expensive this way, but it's worth it to me to have 6 shiny boxes lined up on my shelves, all ready for me to brew a cup.  In a way it reminds me of an old flavor from Celestial Seasonings--Pelican Punch.  I agree with the person who loves chai spice flavor but sometimes finds that to be a bit too dark.  This decaf coconut thai is excellent!  And in the daytime I love PG Tips, another black caffeinated tea that is available through Amazon.

review/text: My dogs really suck this stuff up like none other. They enjoyed it so much that I had to try some myself. It wasn't actually that bad, kinda salty. Now, I didn't have a spoonful or anything, just stuck my finger in and tasted. IAMs is a pretty decent brand and we'll keep feeding it to the boys...

review/text: The shipment of the dog food was quick.  However, when I opened the main box which contained several smaller containers, there was an awful smell which I discovered was a busted can of dog food.  Other than that the product was as expected.

review/summary: Darker than expected
review/text: I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Amazon, I shopped for the next best thing.  I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine).  WRONG.  Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Amazon Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to.  This box of Half-Caff will be for "emergency" use for me.

review/summary: Perfectly fine
review/text: I needed a half-caff coffee to use in my Keurig to get me thru the afternoon (but not keep me up all night).  This coffee does do the job.<br /><br />The only negative is a matter of my own taste.  I MUCH prefer dark roasted coffee, and this is definitely light-to-medium.  Tastes like Denny's coffee.  Just fine, not earth-shattering...<br /><br />My very favorite K-cup coffee is Obsidian (by Caribou) - to get a sense of what I wished it tasted like!

review/summary: Love this K-Cup flavor!
review/text: I've been percolating coffee for 30+ years. To me, there is nothing like a percolator for a really good, HOT cup of coffee. However, even though I only drank two cups per day, if I missed my morning java, I would get one of those 'caffeine headaches;' not very pleasant. So, about 10 years ago, I started mixing equal parts of regular and decaffeinated coffee, thus solving my problem; I could still get a little caffeine boost without the withdrawal. Then we got a Keurig at work, and while I really liked the convenience, I didn't want to go back to 100% caffeineated coffee. I tried two different decaf K-Cup flavors and they were terrible. Then I heard about Half-Caff. It's delicious; a perfect blend of caffeine & decaf, and dare I say, just as good as my percolated coffee, which I never imagined. Actually, I have to say its better because of the convenience. In short, because of Half-Caff, I bought a Keurig for my house, and Half-Caff is the only flavor K-Cup I use (I don't like flavored coffee) Highly recommended! Well, gotta go have my coffee now...

review/summary: Evening Coffee Drinker Again!
review/text: I am very pleased with my purchase of the Green Mountain coffee Half-Caff K- cups. They arrived in a very timely manner and the packaging was excellent. These K-Cups are a great alternative to caffeine free coffee. It has much more flavor, still not as good as regular coffee but now I can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about falling asleep when I go to bed. Great!

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I recently purchased the Caribou k-cups and this coffee came along with it. While I don't like it as well as the Caribou, it's not a bad tasting coffee. It's a very smooth coffee with no bitter aftertaste. And surprisingly I cannot tell that it only has half the caffeine. I usually get a headache if I don't get enough caffeine in the morning. I got no headache or any other side-effects from caffeine withdrawal. I will probably purchase this in the future.

review/text: I have no choice but to drink "half caff" since my stomach does not deal well with full caff anymore.  So this is the only half caff product I could find.  Honestly, it tastes very watered down.  I don't like it but have no choice.  It's either this, or no coffee at all.  Please make it stronger.  Thank you.

review/text: I normally drink half-caff and am very pleased with it, but after trying a sample of the Tully's French Roast decaf that came in a variety pack, I was truly AMAZED at the flavor.  I anticipated it being bland, not much taste but I was sooo wrong.  The flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times I checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated! Although I will continue to drink the half-caf, this product has taken the #1 spot on my coffee list!
