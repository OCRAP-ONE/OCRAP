review/summary: We love these! GMO-free & big hit with the kids.
review/text: I just reviewed the sweet potato variety of these and wanted to share my thoughts on the veggie tortilla. I have bought bagged snacks very similar to these in the past for my kids, but while relatively healthy they weren't GMO-free. My kids loved these and I really appreciated the lack of genetically modified junk.

review/summary: Great bar, pretty good price
review/text: These really are great bars- no I am in no way associated with the company, but can say I have tried all kinds of sports nutrition bars and this is one of the best around for sheer performance.  Use it as directed and you will be impressed too. I think this flavor is pretty tolerable-- after about 10 of them they begin to feel a little like compacted saw dust, but if you mix up the favors a bit it is not a big deal.  My wife loves this flavor, but it is my 3rd favorite that I have tried.  I wish they sold them in larger boxes or you could put them on auto delivery and save a little more on them.  I wouldn't do another tough mudder race with out them!

review/summary: Delicious, Balanced Flavor
review/text: My girlfriend procured a pack of these the other day and had me sample several of the flavors.<br />I generally have a discerning fruit candy flavor- I dislike many flavors (Eg orange, anything blue etc etc) however I was taken aback by the incredible flavor of these gummies.<br />The consistency is perfect- firm but yielding in each piece, lightly covered in non-overwhelming sour grits perfect for chewers and suckers alike. I will continually use perfect to an excessive amount, because this is exactly what these sour candies are.<br />The shapes are all in hearts, which makes perfect (again!) sense. There is a myriad of flavors, including out-there pomegranate and mango, which is not normally found in the sour candy sections. Each pack contains a generous helping of these candies, so each pack, regardless of the count, will last you quite a while (unless you're like me, or have friends).<br />Contains real fruit juice, great flavor and is so addicting I'm going to go steal more from her, and not finish this rev

review/summary: Like Beef Dipped in an Ashtray
review/text: I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.<br /><br />At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.<br /><br />Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them. I may give them away as a gag gift for the holidays and literally watch people gag as they try to eat this.

review/text: It's hard to judge this stuff as jerky, really, since it doesn't have a lot of "jerk" - they're little strips about the size and shape of a french fry - perhaps three inches long, and about 3/8" square. Thanks probably to powerful industrial meat chemicals, they're incredibly tender, and make great little meat-flavored snacks. My only problem with them is that you get maybe a dozen strips per bag, and they're kinda expensive to get so little. Oh well, meat's expensive.

review/text: I by chance found this on the bottom row at a super Wal-Mart. I have tried a few other brands...some made from just corn and some from rice, but this company has got to be the best so far. It is just like eating regular pasta. I am hoping Amazon will carry it, but for now, I will just have to hope they are still being sold at Wal-Mart. Being allergic to gluten is not enjoyable. The alternatives that we find, most times are just not the same, so it was nice the night we sat down to dinner and discovered how good dinner was.

review/text: Like most who find out about the GF world, we've tried all the pastas we could with mixed results.  The rice pasta would be a gummy mess and don't ask about leftovers...  The corn based pastas weren't bad, but still not as close to the old wheat flour pastas as Heartland GF pastas.  There's another GF company who also does a really good corn/rice pasta blend, but comparatively Heartland is a better buy and hard to tell the difference.  Now with both WM and Amazon carrying them it's a great buy vs. others at $4+/box!  Well, until Heartland or the like make the corn-rice blend in a full-size lasagna sheet we'll just have spaghetti night around our house until then.  At least now we're able to fully enjoy it!

Many other products would come out mushy and like oatmeal - but not this one, it tastes so much like ordinary pasta, I cannot tell the difference.<br /><br />I just purchased the "bionaturae Organic gluten-free pasta" because the Heartland G.F pasta has increased in price, is frequently out of stock, and no longer participates in the "Subscribe & Save" option (for those who aren't aware of this program, it saves you 15% and you can cancel at any time).  The other product mentioned, the Bionaturae pasta gives you 6 packs of spaghetti (rather than 5 included in Heartland) and still costs less when choosing the subscribe & save. The Bionaturae is offered in the subscribe & save and also has great reviews, so we'll see how it turns out. If it doesn't measure up to the heartland then I will just bit the bullet and order the heartland product.

Well, she used to eat it when she was three years old until she was diagnosed with celiac.  She loved this pasta.  Now, I'm afraid she can't get enough pasta.  She recently discovered pizza (gluten-free, of course) and now she has it at least once a week.  My hubby didn't realized the Heartland spaghetti was gluten free until I told him.  He thought it was wonderful, as did I.  I will certainly buy it again.  Now, I'm just waiting for it to come back to Amazon, because I don't know what store I bought it locally and don't want to start searching each one.

It's very smooth, can't really tell it's gluten free and cooks fairly quickly.  I'm assuming it's becoming popular as often times we only see few in left at the store so we've decided to just buy them in bulk!  Highly recommended pasts if you miss that traditional starchy gluten pasta :)

review/summary: I love this pasta!
review/text: This is the best gluten free pasta that i have found in the two and a half years that i have been gluten free. i really enjoy that i can bring it and cook it without it being known that it is gluten free. This tastes almost identical to regular pasta. this is also the cheapest pasta that i have found. i originally found it at a super walmart and the other day i saw it at hannfords which is closer. i love this along with the penne and the fusilli as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who is starting or already been on a gluten free diet.

review/summary: Tastes like the real thing
review/text: I had someone visiting that requires a gluten  free diet . I make a mean marinara sauce so I ordered this pasta So that she could try it .  I personally enjoyed it immensely and could not believe it wasn't the real thing . Not only that, but I did not feel full or bloated after two bowls of it. I think I'm going to replace my pasta with this product because it taste so good and feels so good when I'm done eating.  It took exactly the same cooking time as regular pasta and my friend was surprised that the usual gluten free pasta characteristics did not exist with this product Like gooey and stickiness. I would highly recommend this product even if you don't Require the gluten free diet. Another point is as a leftover it was just as good which I understand is not true with Gluten free pasta.

review/text: This pasta is great for Gluten free! There is no film when cooking it and it tastes no different than wheat pasta. My only regret is the cost when buying it on Amazon. The only other carrier is Super Walmart and there is not one close to me so unless I want to travel for it this is the best alternative.

review/text: Since I have had to go gluten free a year ago, I have missed the taste of "real" spaghetti!<br />I have tried nearly all the GF kinds of spaghetti, and though they were alright, they were still not the same.  But I recently bought this, and I thought I was not eating gluten free!  I had to double check the package to make sure I made the right thing!  It was same in texture and taste!  Only I had NO reaction to them like I would a gluten pasta!  It was FABULOUS!<br />I will forever buy only this kind of spaghetti!

My son ate the last of it two days after I made it and he said it was delicious. We don't own a microwave either so he had to warm it in a pan. It held together as well as regular pasta. Found mine at Walmart and the price was reasonable.

review/summary: Such a waste of money
review/text: Purchased these noodles when our family was put on a gluten free diet.  Thankful to find a alternative to wheat noodles I can not express my great disapointment.  The noodles became mushy and break down very badly.  While cooking a package for dinner I carefully watched and stirred the noodles as they shrunk in my pan.  In fear that there would not be enough noodles from this one package to feed my famiy of 4 (both of my children a small and do not eat large portions)  I put on a second pot and started cooking an additional bag of pasta.  By the time they were cooked and serve My husband and two chilren received a 1/4 cup of noodles and I received none.  They were gone it was like they shrank.  Not only were there not enough noodles, they were mushy.  I actually took every bag I had left in the pantry and returned them to the store, I have found the Tinkayana brand to be a much better pasta for the gluten free families.

However, these turn pale brown in color and have a different flavor and a bit softer texture than tree ears I have used before.<br /><br />I do like these, but I miss the tree ears that remain black after I re-hydrate them and keep a higher level of crispness when re-hydrated.<br /><br />The price for the quantity of these is good, but the quality is only B level not A level.<br /><br />I probably would get them again because of the price.

review/summary: Great for Chinese food
review/text: My local supermarket sells one ounce bags of dried woodear mushrooms for four dollars.  For a little bit more than twice the price, you get a whole pound.  These are not available fresh.  I boil some water in the microwave and soak the mushrooms for about 20 minutes.  At that point, I use the liquid to fortify my homemade hot and sour soup.  Woodear mushrooms expand a lot when rehydrated so you only need a few.  I find that its easier to crumble them before rehydrating them.<br /><br />Angelina's packs these in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box.  Four boxes fill a carton and save on shipping charges.  I mixed it up and got some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSX9G">OYSTER MUSHROOMS,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV5C">BOLETES, CHILEAN, FIRST QUALITY,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV02">BLEND, NORTHWOODS,MUSHROOM(DRIED) 1 lb.</a>.

review/summary: If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash
review/text: Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.

review/summary: Dog goes crazy for it!
review/text: I occasionally use this in her Kong - but unless I do it before hand and freeze it, it gets messy. What I frequently use it for is training - instead of giving little training treats that you have to hold, I squeeze a little paste into her mouth. She goes nuts for it so it works great and not messy at all and I don't have to juggle a bag or treats.

review/summary: More economical than the one in the Cans
review/text: So I've used the stuff in the can and I thought of trying this as I determined it was more economical when I bought it on Amazon.  It's a good product, great for squeezing peanut butter in Kongs, though if you are trying to squirt it all the way to the other end of the Kong, this probably won't do the trick.  It's not as easy to use as the squirt can version.  And yes, I know that just using peanut butter out of a jar would be cheaper, but this is so much faster and easier, and has a more viscous consistency the squeezes well so I can get it into the cracks between the dog treats stuffed in the Kong.

review/summary: the idea is good... but pricey
review/text: The idea is good, but wow is it expensive. I got mine in a Kong gift pack. If you knead the pb well and cut the tip at the slanted line (not the straight line at the end of the tip), it comes out pretty well, but a jar of peanut butter and a butter knife will work just as well - honestly, I think the knife works better. A 16-oz jar of peanut butter will cost you less than half what this 5-oz tube will, so if you're into pricey convenience, this is the product for you. If you don't mind washing off a knife, get a jar of pb and save the cash. Or even better, get some freshly ground pb and avoid the sugar and salt! I guarantee your dog doesn't need the additives.

review/text: I love to order this 5 lb bag.  I keep it in the fridge.  Not one bad nut in the bunch.  They are great right out of the bag, but I like to brown them in a cast iron pan with a little butter, cinnamon & Splenda.  I add some of Azar's unsalted macadamias too.  In moderation, these make a nice low carb snack.  My last order was on 2/21/11, it is now 4/04/11 and I am out of almonds.  Waiting for them to come back in stock to re-order.

review/summary: Fresh and tasty. Great healthy snack for during work.
review/text: I work as a swim instructor at an elementary school and classes are back to back with no time for breaks. I needed a quick healthy snack while I work so I thought about buying these almonds and eat a handful with an orange when I felt hungry. The almonds came in today in a clear bag and tasted great. I know some reviewers said they weren't fresh but they taste really fresh to me. I had an empty 5lb container of protein laying around my room and washed it out and poured all the almonds in there. Almonds are the perfect snack, has protein, carbs, and some healthy fats. Will be buying again.

review/summary: Great bag of almonds!
review/text: I first ordered these almonds a couple months ago and was very pleased with the product.  When it came time to order more, I unfortunately went with another supplier that was running a sale. The other company's product was stale and taste was off, and I couldn't wait to get through the other almonds so I could order from Azar again.  Now just ordered my 3rd bag and couldn't be happier with the quality.  Bag is easily vacuum resealed with a Food Saver if you have one.

review/text: There are a lot of nuts in this bag.  They are good.  Bought from Amazon and I didn't have any bad ones.  I ate on them for days until I finally got so sick of almonds that I threw the rest in the trash.  I probably had 80% of the bag left.  It has been about 6 months and I never want to see another almond again.  5 Stars, but I won't buy again.

review/text: This has a hint of vanilla -- no more -- and is actually a fairly dark flavor to begin with. (Usually flavored coffees are a bit milder overall.)  Frankly, as flavored coffees go, it's not that great.  I'd take Timothy's German Chocolate over this anytime, and the best flavored coffee on the planet is Green Mountain's seasonal coconut flavor.

review/text: We have bought many french vanilla coffees and any other coffee that have vanilla in it. I have to say, this is one of our favorites. Of course, I am not a "purest" coffee drinker. Sorry, I add creamer and sugar. The International Delight French Vanilla Creamer increases the natural vanilla taste of this coffee. We tried other vanilla coffees with "vanilla supreme" in their names but they were supremely lacking compared to Timothy's product. No chemical or tangy after taste with this one.
