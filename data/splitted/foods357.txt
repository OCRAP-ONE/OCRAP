review/summary: Delicious and soft bread mix, the whole family loves it!
review/text: For Christmas I got my family a breadmaker from Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FZZ0VE">Breadman TR875 2-Pound Breadmaker, Stainless Steel</a>, and looked around for a bread mix to go with it.  My wife is allergic to wheat and dairy and soy, and my son is on the Feingold Diet, so needless to say, that narrowed down the selection of mixes.  I finally settled on this Namaste Gluten Free bread mix, and oh boy, is this a winner or what.  The whole family loves it.  It bakes in just over an hour in the Breadman Breadmaker, and the bread is just wonderful.  It's soft, fluffy, chewy, just like regular wheat bread.  I signed up for the Subscribe and Save program through Amazon.com to ensure regular delivery and also extra savings.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: too many eggs needed
review/text: I was disappointed to find this bread needs 4 eggs - 1 whole and 3 egg whites.  Yes, it is good, but why have all those allergens eliminated and then use 4 eggs?  Most any bread can be made delicious with the addition of a bunch of eggs.  It is good bread and if you don't mind using all those eggs give it a try.  I am just moving toward vegan and eggs are moving out of my diet.  I would not have bought them had I known.

review/summary: Wish there was a "Package Contains" on it.
review/text: I have tried other GF Bread Mixes and here is my delema; My bread machine has a Gluten Free setting. It automatically goes to a 1 1/2 lb loaf. One mix I have used (Gluten Free Pantry)contained ingredients for a 2 lb loaf. Needless to say it didn't bake long enough.<br /><br />In this one "I think" each package contains ingredients for a 1 lb loaf; hence I will have to use 1 1/2 bags per loaf of bread..? Is there yeast in the package just like the Gluten Free Pantry Bread Mix (I would prefer to use my own)? I guess I will find out when I receive my order. I may add some honey and flax to my recipe and see how it goes. I think this one will produce a more nutritious, lower calorie bread so that is why I am purchasing it. Thank you to all the reviewers.

review/text: This bread mix is one of the healthiest mixes I've found, and definitely healthier than any of the pre-made GF breads in the store. I always just use 2 whole eggs, rather than the four partial eggs the recipe calls for, and a friend who is egg-free uses flax or chia gel as a replacer. I have had great success adding bean and lentil flours to the mix (with additional water) to add more protein.

review/summary: Tasty but had to modify
review/text: Since I've found the gluten-free breads in the market to be pricey, brick hard and barely palatable, I thought I'd give Namaste a try.  After all, it got rave reviews.<br /><br />The directions say to follow your manufacturer's recipe if you have a bread machine, so that's what I did......with a bit of modification as I just couldn't see wasting 3 perfectly good egg yolks (the recipe provided calls for 1 egg and 3 whites).  So I used all of the 4 eggs, but the mixture looked way too runny.  So I added 2/3 cup tapioca flour and 1/2 cup rice flour and VOILA!  The loaf turned out PERFECT - light, fluffy, very tasty.  None of the qualities of the flavorless bricks I'd been buying in the market. Had Namaste included the flour I had to add myself, I would have given it a 5-star review.

review/summary: Best gluten-free bread
review/text: I have been using the Namaste GF bread mix for a couple of years now and really like it. When I first went gluten free, I tried many different brands of pre-baked GF bread as well as bread mixes. They were always too sweet for my taste. I was so excited when I found the Namaste mix because it's not sweet. I now live an hour away from the closest store that sells the mix, so I looked for it online and found it at Amazon. I now buy it by the carton, which saves me time and gas. I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to avoid gluten. It's so tasty that my husband even likes it.

review/text: I ordered this item by mistake.  I thought I was ordering the Pizza Crust which our family just loves.  When I saw that I have made the mistake, I decided to give it a try - we now had 6 packages.  But this was the worst GF bread we have ever made.  Had to keep putting it back in the oven because the middle was raw and outside was hard as a rock.  We tried to eat it, but just threw it out - the first time I have ever hated a GF item so much!

review/summary: Great Spicy Snack - Highly Recommended
review/text: These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet "Thai Chilly" jelly beans are spot on in authentic flavor and are actually fairly spicy (but not in the practical joke range). I love all things spicy (my wife says I'm not human in this regard) and enjoy all sorts of hot peppers, so since it has both spicy heat and a realist taste, these are now one of my favorite things. The rest of my family is split on these, with my wife that saying they are way too hot for her and my son says he enjoys the flavor but is on the borderline with the heat.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those that enjoy hot peppers! Also try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007J6JE82">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Habanero Jelly Beans</a> if you are adventurous!<br /><br />CFH

Altogether, one of the finest blues disks by a contemporary artist that I have heard in a long, long time.

review/summary: Al Dente is critical, fusilli is so versatile
review/text: I prefer DeCecco pasta, so I gave this spinach fusilli a whirl and a twirl.  Although the description says it's made of "Spinich," I know it's really spinach and Amazon hasn't responded to my suggestion to correct the spelling.  Anyway, the pasta is one of the best of this type I've tried.  I've used it with tomato based sauces, in cold salads, and simply with roasted garlic, olive oil and freshly grated parmesan reggiano cheese (grated on a Microplane.) Being that the spinach, egg and whole wheat pastas have a shorter shelf life than others, be sure you can consume this pack of 10 in less than a few months.<br /><br />I wrote to DeCecco to inquire because there was no "best by" date on the boxes, and learned the following regarding the imprinted code which is on the bottom of each box:<br /><br />SHELF LIFE  --  As a general rule, De Cecco dry pasta does not have an expiration date since if it is stored and handled properly it can last for a number of years. However, we generally advise our consumers that to savor the unrivaled quality and taste of De Cecco pasta, it is best to consume it within 18 months (whole wheat, egg, spinach, tricolor) to three years from the date of manufacture.<br /><br />CODE DATE FOR PASTA -- Each De Cecco pasta package is imprinted with the date of manufacture, a four-digit number found on the outside flap at the bottom the package. The code is based on the "Julian Calendar", and reads as follows:<br />- The first three digits identify the exact day of manufacture based on the number of days (100) that have elapsed since the first of the year.<br />- The last digit indicates the year of manufacture<br />**:** is the exact time the product was packed<br />- *-** identifies the production line<br /><br />My order is set to expire in only four months, but I know it will last longer because I keep it in a cool, dry location -- if it lasts that long.

review/summary: Green color not much taste
review/text: Coming from an Italian home, De Cecco has been my favorite pasta since I was little. However, somehow I've never tried any of their spinach pasta before, my store doesn't carry it. I ordered from amazon and I tried the spinach spaghetti and have to say I thought it had no spinach taste at all, it just has a pale green color. The texture was a little weird too, kind of glassy with a very slippery texture. Still cooked to a firm texture but too slippery for anything to stick to it and no spinach taste. Even with just olive oil and fresh parmesan it was just plain to me and all the cheese ended up on the bottom of the bowl because it didn't stick to the slippery noodles. I like a very spinachy pasta, I much prefer Hodgson Mill Whole wheat spinach pasta, it is toothy and hardy and has far more spinach flavor. I wouldn't buy this again but I still love every other De Cecco pasta I've tried and their regular whole wheat linguine is wonderful.

review/summary: Perfect Saltine and size!
review/text: It feels odd to write a review about Saltines but I found a need for these. I usually get the other size saltines that are bigger but when I saw the smaller size I immediately ordered them. I have had them for a few months now and use them several times a week! I love that you can just put them in a bowl or cup or soup without having to crunch them up first. They are also a perfect snack size to munch on if your tummy is feeling a bit upset or you are on a bland diet. Nabisco has always been my favorite brand for Saltines whether they are the bigger size ones are these. But if I had a choice I would stick to these for the size and convenience. They are very crisp tasting and not too salty. Just the right amount of a saltine cracker to satisfy whatever need it is you have. Highly recommend and will be ordering more!

review/text: More often than not, when I want some saltines, they are for a bowl of soup or chili. These minis are PERFECT for that! The smaller size is ideal for stirring into tomato soup and they really "stand up" to chili - never getting soggy before you can spoon them out and eat them!<br /><br />The plastic bag (made from the same material as the 'tubes' the larger size crackers come packed in) keeps them fresh after you've opened the box which is great since (in my kitchen), the boxes seem to last much longer than a tube of the larger size crackers.<br /><br />I've even tried eating a handful or two all on their own - as a snack - and while they are no threat to your favorite chip, they do have a great taste and plenty of crunch for a fast bite.

review/summary: Hot powder, EXCELLENT customer service.
review/text: The shipping of this product was above and beyond anything I have ever experienced or expected for that matter. It first arrived within about 4 days of ordering it, but unfortunately, was returned by the USPS because they could not find my mailbox? The mailbox is beside another mailbox that receives mail everyday, so I'm not sure how this happened. It happened two times in fact, over the span of about 2-3 weeks. But, lucky for me, Sonoran worked with me the whole time, keeping in touch every time the item was returned, and never charged me any extra for shipping! When I finally tasted the product, it was really something I had never experienced before. I've had Dave's, Blair's, and they sometimes include things like "pepper extract", which I've come to find out is sort of like mace, or a major component anyways. The flavor and aroma of this powder isn't smokey like habanero's, but sort of earthy, and doesn't smell all that hot. But when you taste it, it's a completely different story. I sampled just a pinch(no bigger than my pinky toenail) and started sweating. The heat builds, and stays for at least 5 minutes afterwards. I've mixed it in with hot sauces at my job, and it's amazing.

When I checked Amazon, I found this product. And I am happy to have ordered this.<br /><br />I fixed a meal tonight, with one dish being red potatoes. After heating them, I added salt, pepper, butter, and rosemary. That, itself, would have been a fine combination. But I added some of the ghost powder. Wow!!<br /><br />I ate the potatoes about a half hour ago and I am still finding perspiration in my brow (that's good!). The taste as I was eating was noticeable, but not overpowering. I used more powder than I should have (live and learn). But the taste was there--and the burn!<br /><br />Anyway, my first experience with this product was positive, and I have learned lessons about the proper amount to use.<br /><br />All in all, a good additoion to my pantry.

The heat level vs price = NOT WORTHY,<br />The heat level does not justify the high price.<br /><br />In my opinion, including the production cost, labor, management, logistics, etc. I think this pepper is worth not more than $17.40 for 3.75 oz. I'll come back and buy a lot more when they adjust the price 'bubble'.

review/text: I was expecting a lot more from this product. However, there was very little flavor and the little flavor it had tasted fake. I have had many ginger team's and ginger based drinks and just about every single one has been better than this one. Pass on this one unless you like drinks with very little flavor.

review/text: Like most other reviewers have stated, the ginger flavor overpowers the lemon flavor.  Ginger can be ideal for certain types of ailments, so this drink would be ideal for that.  But I found it lacking in taste to be an everyday type of tea.  It does mix easily though, which is a nice trait.

review/summary: Not bad...
review/text: I am not a big ginger guy but this is not that bad. I do like ginger ale soda so I thought I might like this too. I brew it hot but I drink it cold. For me it was way better having it over ice than drinking it hot. The ginger was a lot stronger when hot than cold. Maybe its because the melted ice made it watery and diluted the ginger but I prefer it cold like an ice cold ice tea. You don't taste the lemon much. I would have preferred to taste a lot more lemon since it is ginger and lemon but it is more of ginger with a hint of lemon. Overall it is a good drink but you will probably either hate it or love it.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: There really isn't anything special or outstanding about this beverage. It's just like most of the instant ginger drinks out there in the market place. Though i would say, a sachet of this is good for 2-3 tea cups. It is quite strong and will have a bitter taste if you pour the entire sachet into just one tea cup. Apart from that, it just like any other instant ginger drink. I must also say, the ginger taste is by far dominant, you hardly notice the lemon at all.

review/summary: A Great Herbal Tea for Relieving Nasal Congestion!
review/text: Ever since I moved to Chesapeake, Virginia, over twenty-three years ago, I have suffered from chronic sinusitis.  Therefore, I drink a lot of caffeine-free herbal tea with honey and lemon in order to relieve my sinus congestion in the evenings before going to bed.  [I also wash out my sinus cavities with Alkalol (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YFG0M0">Alkalol - A Natural Soothing Nasal Wash, Mucus Solvent and Cleaner Kit -  with Cup, 16-Ounce</a>).]  Herbal tea is a nice indulgence, especially in the cold winter months.  Well, it may be late April now but, with the temperatures in the forties, it still feels like winter to me and I am slightly congested.<br /><br />  I decided tonight would be appropriate for brewing a packet of the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix that the Amazon Vine Program sent me for review.  I heated water in a tea pot until it began boiling and whistling.  I poured the contents of the tea packet into a coffee mug and added two squirts of lemon juice and approximately one tablespoon of honey (I love honey).  Then I added 250 ml (one cup) of boiling water, stirred vigorously with a spoon and gently sipped, being careful not to burn my lips.<br /><br />  I loved the aroma of the ginger.  However, it's strong, spicy taste made me cough a few times until I grew accustomed to it.  The ginger burned my throat, but it was a soothing burn like menthol cough drops.  The ginger tea also reminded me of horseradish, which often burns my throat while clearing my nostrils of congestion.  The honey I added made this tea very sweet.  Furthermore, I sipped it while watching a classic horror film, "The Dorm that Dripped Blood."  The tea had a calming affect on my nerves.  After all, watching someone in a darkened stairwell get clubbed to death with a nail-spiked baseball bat can be unsettling.<br /><br />  When I dine at Panera, I sprinkle ginger and cinnamon powder into my coffee.  These are two healthy spices, especially ginger.  Ginger relieves indigestion; this is why it is often used during the holidays when celebrants overeat.  It also has anti-viral properties that help fight infections and relieve congestion.  It also relieves the symptoms of osteoarthritis.  Now I know firsthand that drinking ginger tea can also relieve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.<br /><br />  I highly recommend the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix for health-conscious people who love drinking herbal teas.  I recommend it for those, like myself, who suffer from chronic sinusitis.  I definitely plan to look for this product, or one similar to it, the next time I am grocery shopping.  I wish I had received an entire box for review instead of one packet.  I have friends at work who would love to try this product.  Like I said earlier, I have suffered with allergy problems since I first moved to Chesapeake and there are thousands like me in the Tidewater area.  Furthermore, I would like to know how this ginger tea would taste as an ice-cold beverage but it would probably lose some of its decongestant properties.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Very Simple in Flavor, I Like It
review/text: I was not sure what to expect with this drink mix, but I am pleasantly surprised.  It comes in a foil package and inside are little granules of sweetened drink mix- it looks like powdered honey or granulated maple sugar.  The flavor is definitely ginger in nature with a lemon overtone.<br /><br />When mixed with a coffee mug full of hot water, the mixture instantly dissolves and what you get is a very intense gingery drink mix with lemon overtones to it.  The sweetness is PERFECT.  Not too much, not too little.  I had a bit of a sore throat and upset stomach when I made it, but when I drank it, my throat and stomach both felt soothed.<br /><br />I really love this drink mix and will buy it in the future- it is perfect to have on hand during cold and flu season and even if you just really love ginger.  It is also perfect for travel to take with you in case you need it.  Restaurants would also be another place to bring this to go with any foods that are friendly to ginger flavors.<br /><br />If you do not like strong ginger, pass this one by, because it is like drinking a pure ginger drink with a touch of honey and lemon added.

review/summary: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix
review/text: This is surprisingly good... IF you really like ginger.  I was expecting a sweet lemony/ginger drink, but could tell as soon as I added the water that this is very very ginger, with just a hint of lemon and a slight sweetness.  The ginger flavor is very strong and very sharp, like a strong ginger beer (or about 4 times stronger than ginger ale).<br /><br />The crystals dissolved quickly in hot water and the drink was still pretty strong at 1 & 1/4 cups of water (the packet said to add 250 ml -about 1 cup).  While I do not think that I'm likely to buy this by the 6 boxes of 12 drink mixes it is being sold by here,  I would definitely be interested in purchasing this drink in smaller amounts.  I could see this being helpful in the case of an upset stomach or sore throat, as well as as an occasional drink for anytime... If you really like ginger.

review/text: This drink blends the tartness of lemon with the spice of ginger, and then makes it sweet.  I'm not a huge fan of ginger, but found the drink decent when served hot.  If you like ginger, then you'll love the unique way the ginger and the lemon play off each other.  To be honest, the ginger is the make or break for the drink.  Don't buy it hoping to overlook the ginger, it's there.  Also, don't buy it trying to overlook the lemon, because both flavors are pretty clearly present.

review/summary: very, very gingery -- with a bite
review/text: I was skeptical when I saw the package, and assumed that this would be a very sweet, sugary lemon drink with a smidgen of ginger.  Was I wrong!  When I added the mix to hot water, it was very brown in color, so I thought it might taste like a sweet tea.  Was I wrong!  This stuff is super gingery, with much more of a ginger element than a lemon element, and it is not too sweet.  I love ginger, so i was very happy.  But if you're lukewarm on ginger or don't like the bite of fresh ginger, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />One minor gripe -- the ingredients were not listed on the single foil package I received, so I couldn't tell how much sugar, ginger, or other products were in the package.

It took me a little while to finish this one cup.<br /><br />This is a very serious drink because of the ginger strength. Whereas I had not had ginger with lemon before, it's plain to me this is an excellent combination.<br /><br />If you're having trouble clearing your throat and you want to get to 100% clarity in your speaking voice, just have this one cup. It's not to be compared to other things. I highly recommend to try it once.

review/text: Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix<br /><br />If you like your tea Strong and Spicy (with a nice little bite to it), like  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6727O">Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea, India Spice</a> (for example) then you are going to Love Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix.<br /><br />The product dissolves quickly in a cup and 1/4 of hot water (250ml).  Just enough sweetness without over doing it.  No bitter after taste.  Must be the ginger, but there is a definite lingering of sheer hotness (like a mild cayenne pepper) on the tongue -  that lingers for awhile. :)<br /><br />The lemon is not bitter, caustic tasting or over powering -- just very smooth.  No puckering-up here. :)<br /><br />*I'm thinking this may be just the caffeine free "pick-me-up" I need around 2pm, to get me through the day.*<br /><br />Does Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon sound like your kind of Beverage Mix?  I'm off to order more, I like it "that" much. 'nuf said!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/text: I love herbal teas, and thought this was a ginger tea.  It isn't really tea, more like an instant...something. It smelled good, but after the first sip it tasted a little like Theraflu.  There was definitely a medicine-like aftertaste that I was not expecting.  Might be OK if it was diluted to give a little punch to a pot of herbal tea, but as a stand alone instant beverage it had a strange taste that was neither appealing or relaxing.

review/summary: Holy Ginger Batman!
review/text: Wow! They aren't kidding with the ginger in this drink mix! It is all ginger, all the way. I love it though. The drink is almost an indescribably strange flavor with super strong ginger at first, a little hint of sweet, but not too sweet, and a slight twang of lemon. I drank it hot in a small mug and ended up putting a little more water in after a few drinks to lighten it up a bit. I love ginger, so the strong flavor was fantastic to me, but if you don't like a lot of ginger and can't handle the "ginger burn" (if you know what I am talking about you most likely enjoy the ginger burn!), then this isn't the drink for you. It mixes pretty quickly in hot water and is a cloudy drink once fully incorporated. It isn't too sweet, which I appreciated, but I imagine you could add honey if you wanted to sweeten it up. All I have to say is this was one ginger filled drink! I bet it is great for a belly ache!

review/summary: Strong on the Ginger
review/text: You will really need to love the flavor of ginger to enjoy this tea.  I mixed it according to the package directions and hubby and I shared it.  It was VERY strong on ginger, as if I had cut up a fresh ginger root and grated it into the tea.  I was taken aback at the first sip because of the ginger, however, it began to grow on me.  I did pour a couple of tablespoons of half and half creamer into our cups and that softened the ginger flavor some.  I don't recall even noticing any lemon flavor.<br /><br />I am currently suffering from a terrible cold and my throat had been very sore for the last couple of days.  Now, I don't know if this tea was the reason or not, but after I finished my cup, (and my husband's since he didn't like the strong ginger flavor), I noticed my throat was no longer sore.  And though I still have the cold at this writing, my throat is still not sore.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because though it is very strong in ginger, that can be diluted down to one's liking.  After I added the cream I began to really enjoy this tea.  I took a moment or two to get used to it, but afterwards it was really good.  I only received one serving (packet) so I don't have any left to experiment with, but next time I think I would at least double the amount of water from 250 ml to 500.

I tripled the amount of water and thought it was still awful.<br /><br />But, my wife thought it was okay and my daughter, who is just back from college, loved it. My daughter loved it full strength, half strength and a third strength and said she's actually going to buy it.<br /><br />So, I'm torn here in rating this. Had I not consulted my family, I'd blast this with one star. My wife was almost neutral, but my daughter thinks this is the cat's meow. So in all fairness, though I don't like it, three stars.

review/summary: Hard to swallow, painful actually.
review/text: If you are wondering what size the contents are, it is like receiving a Theraflu packet. The foil cover that is in the description is again, like Theraflu where you cut the top of the `foil cover' off and pour the contents into a mug with water. I then warmed the mix and water; I used extra water and warmed it up in the microwave. On the back of the contents, it reads: For Hot Serving: Pour contents, add hot water (250ml) stir and serve immediately.<br /><br />Since it calls for 1 cup of water, I used almost twice as much since I do not like strong flavors. Even with two cups, ALL I could taste was the Ginger. Don't get me wrong, I love to eat ginger, but the flavor is so overpowering. It actually hurt my throat each time I sipped it. Not from the heat of the water, but the hotness of the spices. It states it has lemon to it; I could not taste lemon at all. I tried a few sips and it hurt my throat so much I had to stop. I know ginger is good for motion sickness, I have been suffering from extreme vertigo caused by a medical condition and did not feel the effect, however, I probably did not consume enough of it. I have drunk bad tasting stuff before but this is beyond bad, it actually hurts to drink. A drink should not be painful.<br /><br />After trying to get a few sips down I had a guest over and asked if they wanted to try my drink. They agreed and the word was "awful!"<br /><br />I know drinks and flavors vary by person but I am surprised that anyone would drink this. I can also see why it aids in digestion by your body not wanting it to stay in your body and to get out.<br /><br />I liked that it was caffeine free but the taste was the worse ever. Even worse than medicines I HAVE to take and can't stand. To those who like and love it, more power to you. I will make sure not to buy again and hope there is plenty in stock for those who do praise it.<br /><br />Sadly, I cannot recommend this at all!

review/summary: What Can I Say....?
review/text: Honestly, I always want to write as positive as a review as possible, but I can't think of anything positive to write about this drink.<br /><br />  On one hand, I'm glad i only received one as a sample so I didn't have to waste the rest, but on the other hand, giving it another go would have been feasible if I had more than one packet of mix.  Sadly, I took one sip of it, and had to spit it out, I couldn't taste any lemon, all I tasted was ginger (which is fine since its a ginger drink, but its the TEXTURE I take issue with!) and that it essentially tasted (texture-wise) like I'd put a bunch of ginger powder in a glass with some sugar and hot water in a blender and dumped it in a glass and called it good.  I would have gotten the same results had I done that, and it would be cheaper too.<br /><br />  It was grainy, and it was way too gingery for my taste.  Now, let me tell you, I DO enjoy ginger tea!  I make ginger tea from fresh ginger root for nausea or just to enjoy and it is very tasty, I also enjoy ginger chews on occasion, and crystallize ginger every now and then as a snack as well, so I am not a ginger hater!  But, for me, this drink was just lacking, and you'd be better off making a nice cup of hot ginger tea from fresh ginger root, its cheaper, has a better feel in your mouth, and its not going to take anymore work then this "beverage" will.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

It's heavier on ginger than lemon, so it's not too tart.<br /><br />I tried it in hot water and also in the bottom of a glass into which I poured some Sodastream seltzer and stirred. Ginger, as most people know, is hot. In hot water it is hot "caliente" and hot "calor." Drinking it hot is the way it's supposed to be done (says so on the packet), and it's great for cold weather and when you have a cold. But it's so hot where we live already that I want my liquids cold. Mixed in seltzer, half a packet made for a decent drink but the granules don't melt as well in cold water.<br /><br />If I get more of this mix, I will probably mix it up in hot water, then cool it in the fridge before drinking (at least in the hotter months). Maybe make a jar of it along with my sun tea. The per-packet price is reasonable, I think, for something that has herbal/medicinal benefit as well as being just something good to drink.

review/summary: I Don't Like it
review/text: A lot of people don't like this drink and it kind of feels like I'm piling on and joining the herd, but I can't help it, I don't like it either. I feel bad for the Gold Kili people, but they've got other drinks and maybe all these reviews from people who don't like it will help them to decide to focus their attention on those.

review/summary: Ginger and Lemon All Natural Instant Beverage not so good.
review/text: Gold Kili has been in production for many years in Singapore.  I know most ginger is grown in China.  However, when I mixed this drink with hot water--the taste was so strong, I poured it out.  I love ginger and ginger ale, but this was just too strong.<br /><br /> I think for a really natural drink, buy your own ginger and mix it with real lemon and honey from the United States.  That way you can control the bite of the ginger and the sweetness of the honey.<br /><br />Ad said, made with " top grade ginger and honey to give a unique taste, providing goodness and fragrance when consumed."  The fragrance was nice so I was hoping for a great taste.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Ingredients: Ginger, Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose) and Natural Lemon Flavor.

review/summary: Some like it hot! Cost makes it NOT!
review/text: From Singapore comes a very spicy drink that you can have hot (temperature wise, which I did) or cold.<br /><br />How "hot" is this?  It tasted, to me, on the lines of Thai spicy "hot."<br /><br />Ginger is a natural remedy for "sea-sickness."  You can also get the same result from ginger ale (from personal experience).  [Side note: green apples work as well.]<br /><br />I can't comment on the "restore the balance in the body" claim because it was just one sample packet...  From the one sample, I don't think it made any kind of difference.  If I wake up 10 pounds lighter tomorrow, I'll let you know (and purchase a box or two)... but I don't think that's its point.<br /><br />So what does this lemon-ginger drink taste like?  To me it sort of tastes like like a cross between the "Atomic Warhead" candy and "Mt. Dew."<br /><br />The first sip was shocking but it really is a very good taste.<br /><br />Despite the "hot" spice flavor it did NOT upset my stomach (surprised).<br /><br />I may not be everyone's "cup of tea" but it might be worth a try but NOT at $22.69.

review/summary: Ginger & Lemoon beverage
review/text: this was ok but I didn't really care for it personnally. It dissolved easily and had a good mild lemon flavor. I didn't really taste the ginger. It isn't something I would pay money for to have again, maybe if the lemon flavor was stronger but it's more of a hint of lemon taste and I do love lemon flavor. Others may like it more, everyone has their own tastes, this is just how it seemed for me and I am a daily hot tea drinker, all flavors. I thought this would taste more like that but in a tea bag you can steep it for more flavor. This has quite a bit in each little package for one serving so it would be very expensive to use more and like all crystals, they aren't evenly blended in the package so you won't get the same flavor everytime if you need to add extra.

review/text: Not in the sense of texture, of course, but of taste -- LOTS of ginger flavor, I couldn't stand more than a couple of sips after mixing the drink up per instructions. Pleasant aroma but the taste was like razor wire mixed with fresh ginger and it's still locked on my tongue an hour later. WAY too strong. I enjoy strong flavors and I like ginger, but this was just way too much.

review/summary: strong ginger, weak lemon, sweet
review/text: The gold kili mixed easily, no clumps in my cup of hot liquid. The smell was very nice, although I could really only pick up the ginger.<br /><br />Sipping, the ginger hit me first. In fact, the beverage tasted of ginger and sweet. There didn't seem to be a balance between ginger and lemon. Eventually I picked up a very odd lemon taste, sort of like when I sprayed lemon pledge and accidentally inhaled, it doesn't so much taste lemony as vaguely lemon chemical. Heavy ginger, very sweet, not for me.<br /><br />I think I'd rather squeeze my own lemon, toss in a slice of ginger and a bit of honey in a cup of hot water. Between the way to sweet and the fake chemical lemon aftertaste, this is not my cup of beverage.

review/summary: Ginger has a bit of bite
review/text: I agree with this product's description as it having a unique" flavor. While the flavor is not unpleasant it has a certain Asian quality to it. I am a traditional tea drinker, but tried this one out to see what it was like. I enjoy lemon and ginger, as well as honey so I figured this would make for an interest brew. It does have a bite to it due to the ginger- a slight heat to the back of the throat. On the whole the aroma was divine and made my allergy nose open up a bit and feel great. The overall flavor is that of an herbal healing broth, not so much a relaxation and read-a-book cup of warmth. I would recommend this for those looking for herbal remedies that taste like the ingredients they are made with. This unique flavor is full of ginger and a touch of honey.

review/summary: strong ginger flavor but with bitter aftertaste of lemon
review/text: The ginger and lemon pouch is good for making a cup about 20oz size.<br />Use boiling hot water, not cold water, it may not dissolve as quickly.<br />The ginger taste is strong and natural.  For this part of the flavor test, it doesn't seem to be artificially engineered ginger taste.<br />But the lemon flavor in the mix is a different story.<br />It tastes a bit funny because it has a bitter lemony aftertaste.<br /><br />I've had several different kind of ginger teas, some very strong, some only as a flavor.<br />This one comes in a middle mix--not as strong, and not as a hint of flavor only.<br />Yet, some really natural strong ginger beverages, after mixing with hot water and drinking it, you could be sweating very soon and feeling hot and burning.<br />This tea doesn't give that fresh burning or warm sensation from the gut.<br />It also doesn't taste as spicy as I had hoped, though it should be rated as 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the strongest if you cooked with fresh ginger by yourself.<br />Overall, it's not a bad ginger-lemon mix though I would hope they mix some honey flavor inside as well.<br /><br />I give it only 3 stars because Amazon shipped this one single pouch in a box the size of a Epson printer!!!!  Yes, a size of a box that is 14"x 18" x 8".<br />This could have been shipped in an envelop but they wanted to give me a surprise.<br />I hope they fire the guy who shipped that box!

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: First let me say that it's refreshing to get something from Vine to eart or drink and be obligated to comment on nothing but its flavor, as opposed to half a dozen claims by the product's makers about its health effects, nutritious contents, etc.<br /><br />Alas, that was all the refreshment I got out of this beverage.<br /><br />It's not exactly disgusting, but the taste is pretty unpleasant.  The mix of ginger to lemon is way off, I think, and the ginger is fairly overpowering; the spiciness of it actually burned my sinuses a bit.  And I mixed the powder into a little more water than the instructions called for, which makes that intensity of flavor way too much.  As for the lemon, it's just flavorful enough to provide a sour background to the concentrated spiciness.  The combination is not pleasant at all.  Having tasted it once, I think I can safely say I will never drink this  beverage again.

It tasted good but strong. I think this would be ideal mixed with honey when battling illness. It tasted potent. Someone might like to used this mixed with liquor for a hard lemonade.

review/summary: Great...if you're a ginger maniac
review/text: I've never been the greatest fan of ginger drinks. I tend to associate ginger-ale with saltine crackers and the flu, so you can guess how often I tend to drink ginger flavored drinks. The one time I tried ginger beer, I about ejected it through my nostrils due to the fierce swallowing resistance in my throat. That said, I found this beverage surprisingly tasty and easy to drink. The individual foil pouches are easy to open with the built in "tear notch". The mixture is tiny brown granules that look like Japanese hon-dashi (if you know what that is). It mixes with hot water to make a sickly brown liquid that looks like something between tea with a bit of milk or coffee with a bunch of milk. There is a heavy ginger scent with a lemony overtone. As for the taste, make no mistake: this has a strong ginger flavor with only the slightest hint of lemon and sugar. The sweetness is not reminiscent of honey (even though it's billed as such), but it's as if the drink was sweetened with a plain spoonful of white sugar. The ginger flavor is not overpowering, but it does tend to linger in the back of the throat with that familiar, persistent medicine-like quality. Even for a decidedly non-ginger-liking guy like me, I drank it up and for the most part, enjoyed it. I'm comfortable saying that if you do like ginger drinks or flavored teas and hot drinks, you will probably enjoy Kili.

I tried Gold Kill All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage in the hope that this might be a convenient alternative to fresh ginger tea.<br /><br />Gold Kill All Natural has a strong ginger taste.  I used nearly 50% more water than the amount suggested, but the ginger tea was still much too sweet for me.  If you like your drinks very sweet, you might enjoy Gold Kill.  I would have liked it better if it had 1/3rd the sugar.

review/text: If you have had any Tazo chai - think of this as something 10 times more stronger.<br /><br />First of all, it is not a tea bag, it is small sachet with powered Ginger in it, you empty one pack into 250 ml of hot water and the powder completely dissolves in it.<br /><br />When  you start to enjoy it - almost instantly it gives you an instant kick of strong Ginger flavor + light lemon flavor, you can feel it pass through your throat and feel the spicyness.  Overall, I loved the taste and the strong dose of flavor in it, if you think it is too strong, just add some more water.<br /><br />You can enjoy it on one of the winter days/cool it down for summer drink and I think it is going to be really good when you have a cold/cough - just add a few drops of Honey and it should give a good relief.<br /><br />I emailed the company to get a full list of ingredients and still have not received any response back - hence loses a star on the product rating.

review/summary: Ginger Lemon Drink Makes Your Mouth Tingle!
review/text: This hot and spicy ginger-lemon drink is very tasty, but the high concentration of ginger makes your mouth tingle!  Definitely it's a drink for those, like me, who love spicy foods.  It's a great waker-upper, but you probably won't want to drink it every day.<br /><br />To make the drink, you combine one pouch (0.56 oz.) of Gold Kili Instant Ginger & Lemon Mix with 1-1/4 cup (250 ml) of hot water, and stir.  A sniff of the powdered mix offers a good preview of the drink itself.  The powder dissolves quickly in water heated to about 185 degrees Fahrenheit (well below boiling).  The resulting drink is the color of coffee with cream.  An "instant powder foam" forms on top with stirring, but the foam disappears quickly.<br /><br />The drink itself is sweet, but leaves little sugary aftertaste.  The very dominant flavor is ginger, with a pleasant undertone of lemon.  This drink won't ever replace my daily coffee, but I definitely enjoyed it.  I rate it at 4 stars ("I like it").

review/text: I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and was excited to try out Gold Kili Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage.  I usually add lemon juice to my Ginger Honey Crystals anyways...why not try a brand that has it included?  You can drink it either hot or cold - I added hot water to mine, as I like ginger tea.  To my dismay, the Kili Ginger Lemon Bev was not very good.  The ginger has a very light kick, and wasn't as spicy as most ginger teas.  The lemon flavor was overpowering.  They should rename this the Lemon & Ginger Bev mix, as that's what it tasted like to me.  Even after adding a little milk and honey to it, it still didn't have a good flavor.  If you like the Ginger Honey Crystals, you probably won't like the Gold Kili brand...it's not particularly gingery and the lemon is too strong.  You're better off adjusting the lemon and honey ratio on your own.

Drink has very dark color and in my cuup it almost looked like coffee.  Taste is very interesting.  If you like ginger already, you will enjoy strong peppery ginger taste.  What is unusual about this drink is that it has a very sweet aftertaste.  For me personally, it was too sweet.  I could not find a list of ingredients to confirm if this drink uses any artificial sweateners and that is why I doubt I would try drinking it again.  I just was not sure what is the calorie intake for this beverage.<br /><br />If calories are of no concern to you, than this is definitely a fine drink to try.

If so, there is a good chance that you'll like Gold Kili's Ginger & Lemon drink mix.<br /><br />This is a ginger, lemon & honey drink mix.  It is spicy.  It has honey but is not syrupy sweet.  The ginger is much more predominant than the lemon.  As a stand alone in the recommended 8.45oz of hot water, the drink was too ginger/spicy for me (I like spicy).  After I added milk, the drink became pretty good.  However, the mix is strong enough to hold up to more water + milk.<br /><br />This drink mix is not something that I would reach for as a daily drink (like afternoon tea); however, I think it would be very soothing as a hot drink when I'm not feeling 100%.<br /><br />This ginger/lemon drink has a unique taste.  It is interesting & worth a shot if you like both ginger & spicy drinks.

review/text: I simply did not like this drink. The one plus side to the product was that it dissolved very quickly in the hot water and it didn't leave chunks of power not mixed into the drink. Even at the bottom of the mug there was no residual powder. The taste is not altogether horrid, but it is quite strong and I think needs more lemon to balance out the heavy ginger flavor. I immediately felt my throat start to ache after drinking this and 18 hours later, my throat still feels kind of sore. I did not drink it too hot so I can only deduce that the strong ginger flavor irritated my throat.  I also noticed that the drink left a slight yellowing on my mug which I had to scrub off. I could not recommend this drink due to my own experience with it.

review/summary: Good & good for you
review/text: Gold Kili all natural Instant Ginger and lemon beverage is a powdered instant drink made with all natural ingredients! (The exclamation point comes from my having tried and reviewed so many which were not).<br /><br />The ingredients, as listed on the company web site are: Ingredients: Ginger, Glucose, Sucrose, Honey, Fructose and Natural Lemon Flavour<br />Now, that sounds like a lot of sugar (at least there is no high fructose corn syrup) but really, there does not seem to be that much.  although 4 types of sugar are listed, it is clear that ginger is the dominant ingredient.  It is a strong ginger drink!  If you do not really like ginger, this probably is not the first of their products which you should try, because it is really a very powerful ginger flavor.  As they mention on the site, giner has been used to treat nausea and motion sickness (hmm, think i will get some of these for my next flight)  While I will not try to describe this as medicinal per se, I have used it for nausea, and given it to my kids when they had stomach problems (ginger, that is, not this particular beveredge). to good effect.  In fact, this drink is sufficiently strong that I gave some to my son this morning to help clear his sinuses (poor little guy is home sick over spring break :().  It sure beats medication for minor problems, and is better and healthier than any packaged product I have encountered yet.<br /><br />I am imprerssed enough that I am going to give some of their other flavors a try.  This seems like one of the better things to tuck in a lunch box (or purse for that matter).<br /><br />Gold Kili started as a company around 15 years ago, but i guess I was not familiar with the name because they are out of Singapore.  they seem to have a good rthic: producing and maintaining a line of high quality products: simple and to the point.  So far i am impressed.  I like that it is entirely natural, and it tastes good too. It is also relatively inexpensive (particularly for a natural product) and convienient.  that makes this a winner all around in my book.

review/text: I tried this out when I was a bit under the weather.<br /><br />I drank this hot, like tea.  Making it couldn't be simpler.  Just add about 8 ounces or 250 ml of water and stir.  The ginger is the most powerful flavor by far.  It's sweet, though I couldn't pick honey out.  The lemon is also easy to detect, but it tastes mainly like ginger.  It's actually kinda spicy and you get a mild burning sensation as you swallow (nothing painful).  It's a nice, quality product that tasted fresh.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely not for everyone.  It's very ginger.<br /><br />Though I didn't intentionally take this for any medicinal reason, it did sooth my upset stomach quickly. The price for 72 bags of this stuff is a nice bargain.

review/summary: Perfect drink for nausea or upset stomach
review/text: I added a tiny bit of sugar once I stirred the packet into boiling water. The ginger scent was divine and the subtle taste of honey was there too. The drink went down easily but the ginger was a bit overwhelming and could be a little less spicy. I would love to have had this drink when I was pregnant as it would probably help with morning sickness and it would also be great when you are nauseated or ill.  The kids tried it and the ginger taste was overwhelming to them so maybe adjust that in future blends.  I would buy it in addition to tea to keep on hand for the flu or when solids won't stay down.  I read that another reviewer added it to green tea and I tried it and it cut the spiciness of the ginger and made it smoother to drink.

review/text: I didn't really love this drink mix, nor did I hate it either. It was just "ok". It does mix well and didn't have a bad after taste but the actual taste itself is underwhelming. I think maybe if you like Ginger more than I do you would like it better than I did.

review/text: Soothing and tasty<br /><br />This ginger drink is actually very delicious.  I was pleased that it wasn't too sharp.  Some ginger drinks can be too strong for my palate, but this one was very good.  I recommend it.  It makes an excellent hot tea, or you can also drink it iced.  This makes a soothing drink if you have stomach discomfort or a migraine.

review/summary: A nice bite and pleasant taste
review/text: As a fan of Stash Lemon-Ginger tea, this Gold kili product seemed promising.  I received a single packet to try in with one 8 oz. (250ml) cup of hot water from the Vine program.  So this commentary is from a single usage.  The ingredients are: Ginger, Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose) and Natural Lemon Flavor.<br />Given that I regularly drink tea and in fact Stash Ginger-Lemon tea;  I'm used to sweetener as optional and not included. I didn't like this aspect of this product as for the most part, I never add sugar to any beverage.  But, I wanted to keep an open mind.<br /><br />The product mixed up easily with hot water and was a cloudy yellow-orange. It was not as dark as the one shown in the product page.  The ginger was strong (which I like) and the lemon astringent (so-so).  I found that odd, as usually sugar balances the overall bitterness of lemon. However overall it had a pleasant taste and you ended up with a little burn in your mouth due to the ginger at the end.<br /><br />I think I would purchase this if it did not have honey in it, as a reasonable substitution for the Stash tea. Mind you, this product costs twice as much.

review/summary: Strong and overpowering
review/text: I drink a lot of tea and was looking for something with another flavor to try.  I like ginger and know it is supposed to have soothing remedies so I thought this Instant Ginger Lemon Drink would be something to try.  The first thing I noticed was the aroma, it smells great, a very strong ginger smell.  I added the 250ml of water and tried it and it was just so strong.  I did not taste the lemon and the ginger was overpowering. I added double the amount of water and tried it again.  It is still very strong and spicey and to much for me.  I wouldn't purchase this again.

review/summary: Pairs well with a full-blown head cold
review/text: Except for a cold bottle of high-quality ginger ale, I don't often reach for ginger drinks unless for medicinal purposes. With that mindset, I tried Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix and almost wished I had saved the experience for the next time I'm stricken with a cold or flu.<br /><br />There's plenty of ginger spice here. And lemon...and an aftertaste that wasn't pleasant. Whether you call it `spicy' or `tangy' or `zesty', the drink is cloyingly gingered. I happen to like that when I'm drinking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048KFVMU">Reed'S Ginger Beer Extra Ginger Brew</a> on a hot, summer day. However, I can't recommend Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix unless you are already sick and in need of ginger to soothe your condition.<br /><br />I tested and reviewed this drink as part of Amazon's Vine program, receiving one packet for free. Too bad they didn't send a couple more. I wanted to share a cup with a couple of my foodie friends to hear their take. I'm tempted to place an order using Amazon's Subscribe & Save program: six boxes for $19.29 ($0.48 / oz), but I'm thinking I'm might grow tired of this after the first box or two.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well, I'm sick. A head cold. Runny nose. Head congestion. The works. So, I tried Gold Kili again, taking my own advice from the initial review. Sure enough, the head cold dampens my taste buds, which in turn takes the edge off this ginger beverage. I can recommend this beverage if you have a head cold. Good luck.

review/summary: Auuuuuggghhhh!
review/text: I really tried this with an open mind. I love hot tea in the afternoon as well as other 'soothing' drinks. But this one was a killer. It comes as a powder to mix with hot water. It doesn't say how much water on the packet so I assumed that one packet is for one cup of water (as per the directions on this site).<br /><br />One sip put me into the gag zone. I'm sorry to say that it was horrible. It was bitter, spicy, too strong, and way over the top. I like ginger but in small doses. This was like chewing on a piece of ginger root. I guess there are some people that like that but for me, it was not a good experience. I tried additional sips just to be sure but it was a killer taste each time. And, it's hard to get the strong ginger taste out of your mouth.<br /><br />I know this is a personal choice but my choice is to stay away.<br /><br />*****Added note*****<br />My husband tried it and liked it. He would have given it a 3-4 star rating. It just goes to show the difference in what our taste buds like and how this is truly a personal taste opinion.

review/summary: Good drink!  (fresh spicy ginger taste, not sweet )
review/text: I liked Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage.  I didn't add anything to it, because the flavor was nice as it was, without sugar or honey.<br /><br />Be aware that this is the flavor of fresh ginger, kind of hot and spicy, and not sweet like gingerbread.  Just saying, because if you're not used to the heat, it might take some getting used to.  I drink fresh ginger tea when I have a cold or fever, and I know it has many other medicinal benefits.  There is a light taste of lemon.<br /><br />I will drink this again, and recommend it if you like fresh ginger teas.

review/summary: One of the worst hot drinks I've ever had
review/text: Looking for a change from your typical coffees & teas?  Well, let's give Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Drink to see if it's worth a rank among the staples of hot beverages.<br /><br />This caffeine-free lemon drink comes individually packaged in foil packages, though the name ("Instant Ginger Lemon Drink") is a bit too generic in my opinion.  Still, it's up front about what you're getting.<br /><br />The instructions are simple: Pour contents, add hot water (250 ml), stir, and serve instantly.  Upon first opening the packet, the smell of the mix isn't overly appetizing.  The oddly coloured crumbly mix isn't very appealing either.  Also, after the pour, I realized that the 250 ml it calls for isn't even a full cup.  Maybe that's a good thing (it is).<br /><br />The timing to try this out couldn't have been better.  My sore throat looking for a bit of relief.  Unfortunately, this drink just made things worse.  It was just, for lack of a better word. . . nasty!  The first moment it hit my tongue, I felt my lips pucker and my throat constrict.  Lemon & ginger are both powerful flavours, but they can be used well together.  This is not an example of that.  Instead, it has an overpowering taste of that fake lemon flavouring you'll find in low-quality desserts and drinks.  I even tried adding a bit more hot water to dilute the flavours a bit, but to no avail.<br /><br />Overall, just avoid this toxic concoction.  It's not at all worth it.

review/summary: Zesty Ginger-Lemon Drink - A Nice Alternative to Coffee
review/text: Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon drink is a nice, zesty alternative to caffeinated drinks. Fans of ginger and ginger-beer will like the strong ginger-lemony flavor. It has a bite to it that sticks with you. Consumed warm, it's similar to a lemon tea. The spicy-tangy drink has a slightly sweet, honey flavor as well. It's a refreshing morning drink, or something for when you're winding down at the end of the day. It has no caffeine, so it won't keep you up. It's made from top-grade, natural ingredients. Ginger fans, who use ginger for motion sickness and as a digestive aid, might like to put the drink to the test. For those looking for something a bit unique or new, this is worth a try.

review/summary: Good instant Ginger and Lemon drink
review/text: Th instant Ginger Lemon drink from Gold Kili mixes well and makes a quick drink.  The package does say it is caffeine free, but not much else.  (I just received a single serving from Vine program.)  So you can drink before bed and not have caffeine bother you.<br /><br />You can regulate the strength by how much of the packet contents you use to the amount of water.  The recommended ratio is pretty strong for some people.<br /><br />I'm actually not a big fan of Ginger, but my wife is.  So, while I thought the drink was okay, she really liked it.  She especially liked the Ginger and Lemon mix, since some of the ginger drinks she usually gets from Korea don't have the lemon, they are pure ginger drinks.<br /><br />If you like Ginger and Lemon, you will most likely enjoy this easy instant drink.  The small packets would be easy to take with you and make the drink wherever you have water.  Good product.  My wife wants us to get more of them.

review/summary: Nice Winter Drink
review/text: The Gold Kili Ginger Lemon drink is for people who really like ginger- others beware. There's enough ginger in a one-cup serving to give that warm and tingly feeling as it goes down. It's not too sweet for my taste and the lemon flavor is more or less in the background. Gold Kili makes a pleasant hot drink to enjoy during the colder months, and many believe that ginger helps an upset stomach and aids the digestive process. One could make a similar, and probably better, concoction using fresh ingredients, but these instant mixes are for convenience. It's not something that I'd buy regularly, but Gold Kili isn't bad for what it is.

review/summary: Really really strong!
review/text: I just returned from Singapore and tried a really wonderful ginger tea.  I brought home two giant bags, I was so impressed, so when I saw this product, I gave it a try.  I can honestly say that there is simply no comparison.  Since I only received a packet as a sample, there were no directions on how much to use, but I had assumed it was one packet to a cup of water.  When I gave it a try, I thought it was going to burn a hole in my throat.  Although apparently mixed with honey and lemon, it only enhances the strength of the ginger.  I ended up dumping half the cup out and filling it with more water to see if it would create a more mellow flavor, but it only decreased the flavor while leaving the burning sensation in full strength.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I don't think the lemon is doing this tea any favors.  It simply ends up tasting medicinal, so if you're using it for digestive purposes, colds, and stomach cramping like most ginger teas are alleged to help, then it's probably the way to go, but if you're looking for a good tasting ginger tea with all the health benefits, I would pass on this one.

review/summary: Too sweet for me, but could be good convenience product or marinade
review/text: The ginger flavor here is great if you like ginger (which I do), but when mixed according to directions, I found it too sweet (disclaimer: I don't like things as sweet as others do).<br /><br />Others however may find the amount of ginger to be too strong and medicinal.  For those who don't like ginger as much, you could try diluting it with water, but when I tried that, I still found the sweetness to be too strong and out of balance.<br /><br />I really like that it has simple real ingredients.  With only three ingredients (ginger, lemon, honey), you could easily mix up something like this to the strength you prefer.<br /><br />However, this dry packet which quickly dissolves in hot water is a great convenience product for work or traveling or camping, etc.  It also might make a good marinade or rub for something like ginger-lemon chicken or fish.

review/text: These little packs have quite a punch. Make sure you are a fan of whatever flavor you are buying. The ginger/lemon has a great taste. You can always dilute with a little more water, but I suggest just following the directions. It is one of those things that are way better stronger than weaker. These are very portable and can be easily packed for hikes to add a little something to bland filtered creek water. Overall a good product but nothing that really makes it rise above others in its class.

review/summary: Interesting beverage, but I'll pass on a second cup
review/text: I read many of the reviews on this product before deciding to give it a try myself. I enjoy both lemon and ginger, so I thought there would be a fair chance that I would like this beverage.  I decided to have it one afternoon instead of a cup of coffee and here are my thoughts. It smelled very good after the hot water was added, I used 8-9 ounces.  On my first sip I was overwhelmed by the ginger. Obviously I expected ginger and lemon, but I was hoping that they would be in equal parts so that one didn't overpower the other; this was not the case. I continued to drink it, but after about a 1/4 of the cup I couldn't go on. I thought maybe if I diluted it a bit more that it would be okay, but while this lessened the ginger it made the lemon barely noticeable. Overall this drink isn't bad, it's just not for me.

review/text: With my Chinese heritage, I've been introduced to many ginger tea products. This Gold Kili beverage mix is comparable and generally has natural ingredients (ginger,honey, lemon flavor).  With this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon Beverage mix, I found it refreshing, albeit a bit a strong. The directions say one pouch is intended for 250 ml (one cup), but I would mix one pouch for 1.5 cups to ease the strong taste.<br /><br />Overall, this beverage mix is simply refreshing and is a worthy option to consider. Test out how much mix you want to put into the water and you should be able to find a good balance that is tailored towards your tastes.

review/summary: Real ginger flavor - soothing
review/text: This is the first time I have tried anything from Gold Kili.<br /><br />I added one pouch of this instant ginger lemon drink to 8 oz. of hot water.  After stirring, the color became a muddy brown color, not clear as depicted on the pouch/box.  Nonetheless, the resulting beverage had the pleasant tang of real ginger, on par with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OSDVM0">Blenheim Ginger Ale - Medium Heat</a>.<br /><br />The lemon is not overpowering or cloying as it can be in some instant lemon drinks.  This drink would be perfect for someone suffering from a cold, or anyone who enjoys real ginger.  Even though it is somewhat spicy, the ginger dissipates into a cooling effect.<br /><br />I plan to order another box of this instant beverage mix.  It would be great for travel; particularly if you are prone to motion sickness.

review/summary: Wow, talk about INTENSE flavor. More than just ginger and honey I think.
review/text: I am a real fan of ginger and honey. I drink a lot of Republic Of Tea's versions, plus I love those real ginger - ginger ales, the kind that almost burn your throat and you can feel it going all the way down!  Well, Kili's instant beverage is not quite what I'm used to and that is fine, but I did not care for it. As I say, I've had lots of ginger and ginger/honey drinks, but this had some kind of odd flavor to it.<br /><br />First impression, the drink was not a tea, not in a bag etc. When you open the single serving pouch, there are dark granuals inside that you just dump into a  cup. It says to add water but in MLs so I was lucky to fing out my Pyrex measuring cup had MLs on there. I added hot water and stirred it. The color in my cup was pretty dark brown, a lot darker than my teas etc. The scent was okay, not bad. But the flavor, at a very small sip, was super strong. I don't think watering it down would really help either. Also, the ginger aspect was pretty sweet and reminded me of candied ginger, (which I love) but that other flavor, I don't know what it was..was distracting.<br /><br />Personally I would not drink this again and did not try it cold. That might be better but the flavor really put me off. I did like the convenience that the sweetener was already in there, that it was granuals so no teabag to mess with.

review/summary: Pretty Tasty Instant Beverage
review/text: You never really know what to expect with instant beverages so I suppose it's best to keep an open mind. The Gold Kili Instant Ginger & Lemon was pretty tasty, but given that it was a bit weak on the ginger has made me doubt whether or not I'd actually purchase the product.<br /><br />It's a incredibly sweet beverage. You can definitely taste the lemon. Given the fact that ginger is listed first, I think it's fishy that the beverage tastes more like lemon than ginger. But I suppose that's to be expected.<br /><br />If you like instant beverages then give the Gold Kili mix a try. It's a lot different than most instant beverages I've tried so you might welcome the change. As an instant beverage, it was good but I don't know how eager I am to shell out money for the product.

The product information on Amazon currently doesn't show the calorie count either.<br /><br />Second, the directions tell you to use 250 ml of hot water to dissolve the powder which translates into a hairline more than an 8 ounce cup as around 237 ml is equivalent to one US cup.  For US buyers who are not familar with the metric system or don't have access to a conversion chart, those measurements might confuse the user.<br /><br />Third, the color and consistency of the drink is like apple cider and one sip was all I needed.  The liquid has a heavy ginger flavor that masks any lemon flavoring according to my tastebuds. I felt my throat was burning from this drink and it wasn't from the hot water but from the strong ginger ingredient.<br /><br />I threw the rest of the drink out as this is not for me.

review/summary: Mouth-puckeringly intense
review/text: I absolutely love ginger in every form - fresh, crystallized, powdered, ginger beer, etc. I was excited to try Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix. I filled the teakettle with purified water, poured the contents of the packet into my favorite mug, and waited for the whistle to sound. When the water was ready, I poured it into the mug and stirred until I could smell the aroma of sweet ginger filling the air. It doesn't get much better than this, I thought.<br /><br />I was wrong. I took my first sip and actually considered spitting it out because it was so over-the-top intense. I figured I had made a mistake in measuring out the water, so I grabbed a larger mug--very large--transferred the contents and poured in another 4-5 ounces of water. After another thorough stir, I took a taste and had the same reaction: this is too much! I let the mixture cool and put in some ice cubes to transform the stew into a cod drink. It didn't help.<br /><br />In the end, I determined that the makers of Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix have created a drink that will probably appear to ginger fanatics or health nuts. If you are in either of those camps, have at it. For the rest of us, a nice pouch of ginger tea will do quite nicely, thank you.

review/summary: Nice aroma and flavor with a little bit of a bite to it
review/text: I got a single pouch of this Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix for a taste test.  After opening the pouch, I felt good about the contents' fragrant smell.  I poured the fragrant contents into a cup, added about 8 ounces of hot water to it, then gave the mixture a good stir.  My first sip was a nice surprise.  The gingery taste had a little bit of a bite to it, but this was somewhat smoothened by the honey used to naturally sweeten the beverage. With further sips, the bite became somewhat of a kick, but still a pleasant kick.<br /><br />To get a feel for how the beverage might taste when served cold, I put my drink into the refrigerator.  Usually, I like my drinks served cold.  But in the case of this ginger and lemon beverage, I thought the beverage tasted better when served hot.  Also, I wish the lemony taste was a bit stronger.

review/summary: Unusual Spicy Taste
review/text: The drink mix comes in a foil packet that is not easy to open. You'll need scissors.<br /><br />According to the instructions, you need to add hot water, so it is easy to prepare.<br /><br />I was surprised at how spicy the drink was. It's similar to chai tea, though you can also taste the honey and lemon flavors. I like spicy foods and drinks, so I thought it was fairly tasty, though the flavor had a slightly-off taste.<br /><br />I tried it first as a hot drink. However, since it was a fairly warm day I added ice cubes. Either way is fine, though it reminds me of the kind of thing I would drink if I was suffering from a cold.<br /><br />I suspect it's a healthier drink than most, but 70 calories a glass is a bit steep for me.

review/summary: Ginger drink mix
review/text: I love fresh squeezed juice with lemon and ginger in it. I wasn't expecting this powdered ginger drink to taste like fresh lemon and ginger, but I was sort of expecting it to taste like a ginger lemonade. I tried it cold and it was more like a powdered ginger drink with a small amount of lemon and honey, not enough to be considered sweet like a lemonade.<br /><br />After awhile the taste started to grow on me and I drank the whole glass. I think this drink would be soothing hot, especially if you have a cold or an upset stomach. It is not as good as drinking fresh squeezed ginger juice, but it does make for a powdered ginger alternative if the fresh isn't available or you don't juice. I would consider this a fairly healthy instant ginger drink, but fresh ginger is way better.

review/summary: Sweet ginger drinks with a spicy kick after swallowing. Not for me.
review/text: I made with 6 ounce of hot water to start and it was a little too sweet for me so added 2 more ounces of cold to cool and  make an 8 ounce cup.  The drink is a brown color. It says honey but it tastes of a mix of honey and sugar very sweet. It tasted of ginger and slight lemon flavor; but after each swallow, I got the hot ginger burn. Too much of a burn to sooth my throat. Hotter than most ginger snaps I eat. It was like after eating a jalapneo pepper. Much hotter than the black pepper after burn of chai tea. It was way too hot for me to finish. Maybe milk will melow it out, but I can not mix lemon and milk.<br />If you like hot spicy drinks or love ginger then this is for you.
