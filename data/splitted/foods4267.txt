If you are going for a better flavor with similar texture than go with the Niederegger: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M074OW">Niederegger White Marzipan Loaf, 2.6-Ounce Package (Pack of 4)</a><br />virtually the same price but it has a better flavor. I might buy the tub again for baking purposes but for eating just plain marzipan I would go for the Niederegger bars in a heartbeat.

review/text: We first discovered these bars at HiHealth, but found them a bit cheaper on Amazon. The JayBar tastes fantastic. A lot of bars give you the runs because of the chemicals or whatever, the JayBar does not do that. They taste so darn good. We have only had the Fudge Brownie.<br /><br />Another thing cool, for those that are trying to satisfy their chocolate or candy bar cravings, these do the trick. They also make for quite the filling snack.<br /><br />My husband is a weight lifter, he eats these around mid-day.<br /><br />REMEMBER... they are truley natural, no garbage fillers!!!

review/text: I like the JayBar. It has been tough for me to find a bar that is high in protein and other good stuff, while lower in sugar that tastes decent. The bar is not amazing, but its not bad either, and really does not have a lot of the excess stuff so many other bars have. My husband did not like it at all, he said it felt like it "never ended." Again, I like it, and have found it to be a good choice for my nutritional needs, post workout protein boost, or a healthy snack.

review/summary: No danger of eating too many!
review/text: When I took my first bite out of these, I thought, "Did I accidentally start chewing on the box instead of the cookie?"<br /><br />Because - well - you'll find out.<br /><br />Still, if you've got the "Vanilla Wafers jones" like I do, and you're really trying to cut back on the sugar, like I am, you could do a lot worse.<br /><br />And they are growing on me. Hopefully not IN me, though, because even though these are sugar free, they're not fat-free. But you can have 3 wafers for 171 calories & 11 grams of fat (and 9g of carbs), which isn't bad considering the "real thing" is about that for just one!<br /><br />Oh, and also wanted to add: these are sweetened with "maltitol" which, like a lot of these artificial sweeteners, has a laxative effect. Which you will definitely notice if you eat more than one serving (3 wafers) per day, which I did yesterday, which caused me to immediately Google "maltitol" to confirm that was the culprit. It was. Be forewarned!

review/summary: A good substitute for real tea when none can be had
review/text: The Green Energy Tea Fusion tea powder allows you to make instant ice green tea wherever you happen to be. All it takes is to fill a bottle with a few ounces of cold water and shake. The end product is a green tea that's honey-lemony tasting, low-calorie and, the maker claims, is made of mostly organic ingredients.<br /><br />Each packet has enough powder to make an okay-tasting 8-16 oz. amount of cool green tea. All you need to do is start with a bottle of cold water, take a sip or 2 to make some room for the shaking that's to follow, drop the powder in, then shake the bottle and... here's your cool green tea. It tastes the way you would expect iced green tea to taste when spiked with a little bit of lemon and honey. The taste, when 16 oz. of water are used is comparable to the gallon-size 'green diet ice tea' containers you could buy from some grocery stores only a little more diluted. When used with only 8 oz. it begins to taste like serious tea but than you'd want a second packet. The powder tea packets give you the ability to make instant green ice tea wherever you are and whenever you feel like without having to carry along a gallon-size canister. In addition, the makers claim that the caffeine and the EGCG (100mg) from one packet are sufficient to 'boost' your metabolism if taken three times daily.<br /><br />As far as contents, the main ingredients listed are: organic Japanese green tea extract, organic Yerba Mat&eacute; extract, organic Guava seeds extract, organic Aloe Vera extract, organic honey crystals and some others.<br /><br />The powder has 23 calories but none of them came from saturated fats or trans fats and none of the sweet taste comes from sugar because no sugar was added.<br /><br />I enjoy drinking this when no better options are available - such as the ability to make 'real' brewed green or, better, white tea. I do not see it as a regular substitute to 'real' tea. Since the product does meet my expectations - produce a reasonably decent drink when nothing better can be had, it gets it's 5 stars and my endorsement (for emergencies only) because I can't think of much that could be done to make it better.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />EGCG also known as Epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a powerful anti-oxidant that can be found in green tea but not in black tea.

We considered adding treats to the food (however, treats should be kept at an absolute minimum), but we will probably try a different brand.  She walks over to it, sniffs and walks away.  We've exercised her prior to presenting the food hoping a good workout would make her extra hungry, but no success.  We will try again at this evening's meal, but plan to run out and purchase a different brand if she is still not interested.

review/summary: at my house we use this for all size of puppy
review/text: In the last 10 years we have purchased two puppies from excellent breeders that use their own chow. One pup was an airedale and the current pup in a shorke...aka a schitzu yorkie mix. We had no comparable food except the IAMS. Our airedale grew to be a lanky tally dog of 60 plus pounds and was on this food for a full 2 years. Our little "shorkie" is also doing great... We look for foods that will enhance brain, muscle, and bone, while maximizing hair and skin health and shiny eyes. Airedales have extremely sensitive skin if not well fed they will itch and try to tug their hair out...I can't address the flavor because I dont' eat dog food, but we do know that puppies do not like changes in food, like adding a little milk until older and blend with their prior food for about a week. A dog with sweet breath and great energy is a good deal based on diet.

review/summary: A few caveats and comparisons
review/text: This soup is okay on flavor for the most part, but is skimpy on the main ingredients: chicken and rice. Also, the can wasn't completely full. Furthermore, it contains soy protein isolate, a cheap filler, not something I expected from Muir Glen. And with that cheap filler you'd think they wouldn't skimp on the ingredients, but they did. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised since Muir Glen is now owned by General Mills.<br /><br />If you have soy allergies or like to avoid soy and over processed ingredients then I'd steer away from this soup. Wolfgang Puck's Chicken & Wild Rice is superior in every way: much more rice and more and better tasting chicken. I think the chicken in Muir Glen's soup has been mechanically processed to combine it with the soy, giving it an odd texture that's not at all pleasing. It also looks a bit wrong with its rectangular shape. Puck's soup has actual recognizable pieces of shredded chicken.<br /><br />I might have given it three stars for flavor (it didn't taste appreciably bad), but everything else knocks it down to two. It's also very low in fat, which makes it a bit flat and less filling. I will not be buying it again, let alone a 12-pack. And especially not since I felt a mild MSG reaction after eating this soup, though, that's not conclusive. I can't say for sure that it does have any.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend this soup. Ounce for ounce it is far more expensive that Puck's soup since it provides less calories (a paltry 160 for the entire can), less protein, less fat, less carbs and less nutrients. If you want to pay more for a lot less then Muir Glen's soup is for you.

review/summary: High quality flavor delicous soup
review/text: My mom recommended this soup to me. I was frankly skeptical about anything tasting good from the Campbell Soup Company.  Their soup usually tastes bland and lacks any sophisticated taste.  I was so surprised to discover that this creamy tomato basil soup manufactured by Campbell's was so tasty. It has a rich flavor and is delicous.  I only know it available through Costco, but if you can buy it on Amazon I would recommend trying it.

review/summary: Check the ingredients
review/text: I've been using Avoderm formula for awhile now.  I just recently purchased a bag locally of this particular product (note the new packaging).  Had I not been stressing the importance of ingredients to a friend of mine, I wouldn't have noticed the following on the label:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Whole Corn, Corn Gluten Meal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Ground Whole Brown Rice, Oatmeal<br /><br />These are the first six items that make up this cat food.  Not chicken, but chicken meal (ground up meat, organs and bone)...followed by two corn products.  This is terrible and I am already returning the food I have purchased.  Avoderm, you should be ashamed of yourself for this unconscionable change in your, heretofore, excellent formula.

review/summary: Was too good to be true
review/text: I had high hopes for this new, indie California olive oil, and purchased it based on the rave reviews and the reasonable price.  Sadly, you get what you pay for.  This oil is not a true contender and doesn't remotely approach what I would call a high quality gourmet extra virgin olive oil.  Too bitter, not enough fruit, flimsy body, and what little unremarkable flavor it has vanishes in a nanosecond.  My search continues....

review/summary: A little different
review/text: Baja Precious has a somewhat different flavor than the Extra Virgin olive oils to which I am accustomed. I would describe it as lacking the slight sweetness of my previous brands. Without supporting evidence, my suspicion is that the difference is due to the absence of adulterants added to virtually all other brands, regardless of quality. Too soon to evaluate in use, but whether it turns out better or worse, at least I received what I paid for - 100% olive oil - for the first time, it seems.

review/summary: Awesome flavor and allergy friendly. WOW.
review/text: If you have a nut allergy (or any other food allergy for that matter), this is the only extra virgin olive oil that I have found that is free of cross contamination.<br /><br />The spout on the bottle is great! I've never seen a spout like this. It pops up for easy pouring, then when you put the lid back on it goes back down without any effort. No more adding a pour spout and leaving it uncovered.<br /><br />The flavor is so rich and wonderful I find myself putting it in everything. I'm so impressed by it that I just received my first order of their pepper infused oils today to try out in my next curry.

review/text: I make a lot of Italian dishes and salads for the family and I've been through many brands of oils. I have been using this brand exclusively for the last couple of months, and apparently my family has noticed as I recently ran out of my Baja Precious and had to resort to your typical grocery store brand olive oil for dinners. The comments started rolling in about how my dishes were lacking flavor and just didn't taste as good as they normally do. Back to Amazon to order more Baja Precious, and this time around I'll order two at a time so when I run out I'll have a bit more time to order more!

review/summary: Product of Mexico not California!
review/text: Tasted good. Not rancid tasting like the supermarket oils. Liked the plastic bottle with the spout. Fair oil for the price. The only reason I did not give it five star was that it was a product of Mexico. It was only bottled in California. I prefer my olives to come from the USA because of our stricter pesticide/herbicide restrictions. No where on the Amazon description does it state that the olives are from Mexico. On Baja Precious' web site it does show the back label showing a product of Mexico so I will give the company props for that. I just feel the Amazon listing was misleading. So in conclusion, the price is very good for an average olive oil that tastes fresh. This is assuming that this is truly 100% olive oil and not watered down with canola oil and chlorophyll, see the book "Extra Virginity:the sublime and scandalous world of olive oil" :)

review/summary: WTF?! A PET Plastic bottle?
review/text: I ordered this olive oil as part of my eating healthy initiative.  I just received this product and have not had a chance to taste it yet.  However, any potential buyers should be aware that this olive oil is packaged in a #1 PET plastic bottle.  There are studies that suggest that endocrine-disrupting chemicals may leach out of PET plastic, particularly over time in the container.  See Wiki article:<br />search 'wiki Polyethylene terephthalate',<br />and this:<br />search 'Polyethylene Terephthalate May Yield Endocrine Disruptors' for details.<br /><br />While an effect from leached chemicals is not proven, the plastic container would have stopped me from buying this olive oil, had I known it was not packaged in glass.<br />I will addend the review when I have had a chance to taste this oil, but my initial sense is that the 'Baja' in Baja Precious may more accurately translate as 'sick leave' rather than the presumably intended 'drop in price'.

Maybe my UPS man just handled the package better? The only complaint I have is that there was no expiration date. I know they last long, but who knows when they were made. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It's great for what I'm using it for and it was a great price.

review/text: My family loves this brand of cashews and its great for my son who has an allergy to peanuts.  Most cashews come with peanut oil as an ingredient and these do not.  Unfortunately they are not available at any of the local grocery stores here in NW Connecticut.  The problem here is that the title on this product in Amazon is "Yumnuts Dry Roasted Sea Salt Cashews (8x5 OZ)".  By reading this I thought that there would be 8 5oz. bags in the shipment.  Instead there was only 1.  On top of that, the shipping charge was about as much as the actual 5 oz. bag of nuts.  About $4.50 for each.  There are much better deals on this product out there on Amazon, so just pick a different vendor until these folks change the title on this product.

I do not know why they stopped selling it there, but ever since, It has been hard to find, and ever harder to find it fresh.  I am so thankful I have found it for sale on this web site.  I overnighted a box the other day, and as soon as itt showed up  I immediately ate two of the 3.5 ounce bags for lunch.  Looks like I will be making another order shortly.

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I love Jerky. I use to order it on eBay and other sellers mainly from Seattle. Like pizza, everyone has their preference to the type of jerky they like best. My preference is the harder type and then I'll leave it in my mouth and slowly chew on it. I don't like the soft gooey type. To me, the hard dried out jerky is the best, as 20 or so seconds in your mouth will soften it like a piece of gum ready for chewing. Being a vegetarian my preference is the salmon and tuna jerky. SnackMasters makes both. I ordered a box of each. It arrived in short time and I could not wait to jump in. You must watch out when your friends come over as the jerky will be consumed in record time. I had a friendly poker game with 6 friends and we went through 5 packages of jerky! My friends are now all sold on SnackMasters jerky. This by far is the best jerky I have ever had and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: The perfect afternoon snack!
review/text: I don't often write reviews, but if you like jerky, but prefer a non-beef option, the SnackMasters Teriyaki Turkey Jerky is a tasty snack--relatively low in carbohydrates, high in protein, and less salty than some other brands (though bear in mind, it's still jerky). Happy snacking!

review/summary: My go-to snack
review/text: I started eating this Jerky when I was in elementary school. My parents bought it as a snack from Trader Joe's and I became addicted. I am 24 now and still a fan of the Teriyaki jerky. It really is the best I've ever tasted, and I have tried many times to find a jerky that is just as good or better than SnackMasters. It just doesn't exist. Trader Joe's no longer sells this jerky. They replaced it with a terrible Jerky that really is inedible, so I've resorted to buying this from Amazon. The Gelsons sells a one ounce package for $5 but that is just unreasonable. Lucky, Amazon sells it for much cheaper.

review/summary: The best Turkey Jerky I've had
review/text: This is hands down the best Turkey Jerky I've had. We used to buy it at Trader Joes, but it was then discontinued and replaced with their own, inferior brand. I was then on a hunt to find it elsewhere.<br /><br />This jerky walks a great line of not being either too dry or too soft, has great turkey flavor and a salty, pleasing teriyaki flavor. Some may think this is too salty - for me it is perfect, but I love salty things.

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky on the market
review/text: Snackmaster's makes the best Jerky I've ever had. All of their Turkey Jerky product are exceptional, but I'm quite partial to the Teriyaki. It has a faint hint of sweetness that's very nice. Most turkey jerkies I've tasted had a slight chemical taste. And most were somewhat powdery. Not the case with this brand. Great taste and nice and chewy.

review/text: I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves cheesecake or who is looking for a great gift idea. I purchased this cheesecake gift sampler for my Fiance's birthday. It arrived within 3 days from  ordering, which was earlier than the estimated delivery time - perfect timing because I was worried it wouldn't arrive by birthday. We were completely satisfied with its appearance, quality, texture and most of all taste. I didn't mind paying a little extra for the delivery, as it came packed with dry ice so it didn't melt in the heat of the day.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have a female German Shepherd Dog that is now 16 mos old.  Since we got her at 11 wks old, she has been on a lot of different dog foods.  She came to me on Iams but after MUCH research and weighing pros and cons, I put her on Orijen.  Some say, the best dog food you can buy and it's expensive.  30 dollars for 18lbs I think I paid and that was the cheapest I have ever seen it.  I have also tried Taste of the Wild with her and she did eat that and I was going to use it, until I found 4Heath at Tractor Supply that is wheat, corn and soy free.  I figured... wow, 35lbs for 30 bux, not bad.  Get twice the food and it's still good food. Most food are Chicken based and but 4Health Puppy was mostly Lamb based and she seemed to like that more.  We got a second dog and he couldn't handle the lamb, so we had to switch and I ended up feeding them both Puppy Chow, the only thing that the new pup could eat w/o tummy issues.<br /><br />Puppy Chow turned into Dog chow and more issues w/ the pups skin came up.  He was an eater, fat and a pig.  My girl on the other had had always been very VERY skinny.  I had to mix her food to get her to eat.  In the right light, you could see ever one of her ribs and her spine and I was worried would turn me in for not feeding her.  She was THAT thin.  I had already nursed too emaciated dogs back to health, I know how to take care of GSD's but she would NOT eat or gain weight.  She dropped down to around 52lbs at like 11 mos old and she's very tall.<br /><br />After some issues with the puppy, trying grain free to help with the new found itch, I tried eliminated diets and what not.  I turned to Purina One Sensitive Systems and fed him that.  It seemed to help but we ended up having to rehome him due to the growing issues between the two dogs.  My female is a better only dog.  Too alpha for her own good.<br /><br />I got her a bag of Purina One Beef and Rice.  She's on her second bag now and you know what.  She's at a weight now that I don't want her to gain any more.  She doesn't need too.  Her coat shines, she's mostly black and it's very soft and glossy.  Her ear issues cleared up too.  She didn't have an infection, but they didn't look right and were a little junky.  Now that's all gone and her ears look good.  She'll eat the dog food plain, but I still mix some stuff in from time to time.  She loves the beef, and it's been really good for her.  Her stools are smaller and she goes twice a day, almost always.  Morning and night.  No vomiting, no gas, no itch.  Nothing.<br /><br />After a year of trying food, spending money, switching and hours, HOURS reading and standing in the pet stores looking and comparing, I found this food.  She will be on it until she is no longer with us.  I would venture to say that she's upward of 65lbs now, right were she should be.<br /><br />I love this food.  I'm only sorry that I didn't try it sooner and save us all a lot of time and money.  Not every store carries it, but the Orijin I had her on, only one feed store around here carried it.  It's not that hard to find. I don't care if it contains corn, obviously, it's doing her well.  That's all I can ask for.<br /><br />My sister has had her almost 14 year old GSD on Puppy/dog and Senior Chow her whole life.  Purina is doing something right!

review/summary: Formula change in July 2009 is a nightmare
review/text: When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer.

review/summary: my dog loves it
review/text: My cairn terrier was eating the regular Purina One for almost a year.  He had gotten very tired of it.  He loves the darker, soft bites in this, and will pick them out and eat them, and then go back later to finish it off.  He eats all of his food every day now.  I like that he gets the "yummy tasties" but then also the harder food to help his teeth stay cleaner. The price is better than at the stores, and with Prime shipping, is a great savings and getting the pack of 6 at a time saves trips to the store - always.  Puppy says, "woof" which translates that he agrees.

review/text: Our dog, who has a bit of a sensitive stomach eats this stuff, seems to love it, and has no stomach problems when we keep him eating this one brand. We get this product through Amazon subscribe and save, which has excellent pricing and is hugely convenient once you get your delivery schedule timed up with the rate at which you use the dog food. Just as we're down to our last bag, a new case shows up. Couldn't be easier. Not trips to Petco, and no lugging big bags of dogfood around.
