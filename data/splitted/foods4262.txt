review/summary: Affordable and delicious
review/text: I went to the local Asian market and got ripped off for a poor quality product.  I found this on Amazon and for a much better price I got a high quality real Japanese product.  Japanese soy sauce has more soy than wheat (The opposite is true for American produced sauces).  It is savory with a soft finish, perfect for all my rice needs.  Highly reccomend this product!

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: It's OK, but not really different in flavor or aroma from the huge jugs of Kikkoman Soy Sauce I buy at Costco. It is quite savory, thankfully without sweetness, it is subtle on salt... but there is really not much to add to that. Don't expect any exciting cherry/oak/smokiness undertones. It is quite ordinary, and not any different from the cheaper variety sold by the same company, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: An Actual Healthy Multi Grain Product
review/text: Normally multi grain means that it filled with exoctic grains like bleached flour, bleached rice and the such because they are cheap and multi grain on a title sounds healthy. This product actually puts whole grains in for each grain: Whole corn, whole wheat, whole Oats, whole barley, and whole rice. Now it could have benefited from more protein grains like barley, but that may reduce the quality of the taste for this product. If your familiar with regular cheerios, then know that the taste of this is not far off. It does have a variety of grains that give it more flavor than plain cheerios, more of a nutty taste in my opinion.

review/summary: They like it.
review/text: This stuff is a little spendy for my budget, but it's worth it. We're on our third case, and my two cats clean their bowls. Partly because maybe they're still a little hungry -- splitting a 3 oz. can between two adult cats every morning usually has them telling me they're still hungry, but I really can't afford to give them two cans every morning.<br /><br />But having said all that, they look terrific. The short-haired black cat, who had had an oily, prone to knot coat with tons of dandruff, is now sleek and shiny and nearly dandruff-free. We don't know her exact age, except closer to 20 than 10, and she really looks sleek and younger. Her eyes seem less runny, too.<br /><br />Our long-haired, blue-eyed flame point radgoll-looking beast is 11. His feline acne has cleared up and his eyes are less runny, too. He cleans his bowl every morning, and will lick the spoon when I offer it to him.<br /><br />I signed up for the standing, once-a-month order from Amazon. It's nice to have a case of cat food appear on my front step, with free shipping, that I didn't have to schlepp from a store.

review/summary: This IS a crowd pleaser in our home
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from this food based on the reviews so I contacted the company.  I researched the ingredients for cats and dogs and was very impressed.  Also they sent me an email putting any fears of trying a new food to rest by telling me that if the food didn't work out for any reason, all I had to do was contact them and they would refund my money "no questions asked".  It seemed like a no lose situation so I ordered some of the chicken stew for my cats.  Two can eat chicken and one cannot so I served it to the poultry fans for their dinner.  They loved every bite of it and licked their bowls clean!  I loved the way my older one, who typically inhales her food, had to actually chew it so it slowed her down.  I am going to order more for them and some for my dog.  Great food to add to their rotation.

review/summary: Do not order in warm weather
review/text: This product is probably wonderfully tasty when it is purchased and shipped in the winter, unfortunately for me, I did not consider the temperature when ordering this product. Apparently during the shipping process the chocolate melted and each of the six ounce packages contained a block of melted candy. I tried to taste it but was unable to get a suitable taste due to it's condition. The chocolate I did manage to get a taste of tasted just as good as regular sugar laden chocolate but I haven't yet been able to obtain a taste of the toffee from the mass. I also ordered the three flavor caramels and they survived the hot trip in much better shape and are wonderful so I can only assume that these would be terrific as well when they have not melted. I will try this product again in the winter when the shipping conditions shouldn't be an issue. But I  did want to post a warning for those who, like me, might not have considered that shipping trucks are not air conditioned. All I can say is shame on me for not using my head and shame on Amazon for not making a note that during the summer melting of the product may occur.

You can actually taste the butter and good things used to make this delicious candy.  You can't tell the difference between this and its sugary twin. It's by far the best I have ever had and I would recommend it to anyone looking to cut the sugar without cutting taste. I'm online now looking for more Judy's sugar free items to buy.

review/text: I have to confess that I have been low carbing for a year due to diabetes, and I've had very little real sugar. But these taste amazing to me, the best SF chocolate I have had. And I've tried a few, since I am a chocoholic. Kind of scared to reorder right now since it's getting warmer, but can't get these in my city. I might even pay 2 day shipping to get them.<br /><br />EDIT after getting my order from Amazon: find somewhere else to order these! Amazon must store them wrong before shipping because they taste completely different from the bag I got from another site! Not good, and now I have a big order of them.

You get 8 bars weighing 15 ounces each -- over 7 pounds of chocolate for a ridiculously low price.  Each bar is divided into 15x1 ounce squares for easy measuring.  They are made in Israel and are Kosher/Parve.

Also, I do wish the percentage of cocoa was provided but it is nowhere on the package. I like to pretend that I use bittersweet chocolate for health reasons, so I need the statistics to back it up.<br /><br />I use these bars primarily in cookie and muffin baking, although they have also found their way into my home made ice cream -- always with delicious results. The bars are reasonably priced and the chocolate is deep and rich -- not at all grainy like some chocolate -- and it doesn't have an aftertaste like some bittersweet baking products I've purchased in the past.

review/summary: Another fantastic ZiwiPeak product!
review/text: It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food...but I was indeed surprised at HOW MUCH he loves the ZP canned.  I've been feeding my dog, Titan, another brand of canned dog food so that I could hide his different medications and get him to eat them without having to wrestle his powferful jaws like the late beloved Crocodile Hunter.  While he enjoyed this other brand of 100% venison canned food, he was on to me with the whole pill hiding thing and would root around his bowl and eat around the pills.  Titan is a food motivated dog (you'd think he was a lab rather than a pittie) and usually I could count on telling him to sit, give me paw and then literally drop the ball of wet food with the pills hidden inside into his mouth and he would gulp them down.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, he wouldn't eat the wet in his dish, and when I tried the old 'drop in his mouth' trick, he let the ball of wet food hit him in the snout and didn't even lick it off; he just watched me pick up the mess and waited for me to wipe off his face.<br /><br />Enter ZP canned.  First, this stuff doesn't look like normal canned food.  It has such a fresh quality to it.  Titan loved it instantly.  In fact, I don't even have to hide the pills anymore.  I feed him just like an 80+ baby, spoon feeding him right from the can, except that I place a pill on the spoon as it goes in his mouth.  No getting my hands all messy with shaping the canned food around a pill to conceal it from him.  Titan knows the pill is in there, and as long as he gets a mouthful of the ZP canned, he doesn't care.<br /><br />Oh, and he won't even touch the old stuff with or without pills.  He knows he's moved on up in the quality of food  and there's no turning back!

I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/text: I bought these candies because I thought I recognized the colored wrappers of the strawberry candies we were used to as children... the ones that have been around for about 50 years. These are NOT the original candies. These candies are imitation ones made in Columbia. The same wrappers are used to deceive people into thinking they are buying the originals. These candies from Columbia are dried up on the outside. The papers stick to the candies. Most importantly, this Columbia brand does not have the strawberry gel filling that the original candies have. If you are looking for the originals, they are by Arcor. Don't settle for this substitute. They don't compare.

review/summary: Instant Breakfast Dark Chocolate
review/text: I love Instant Breakfast and especially the Dark Chocolate flavor. I drink this product every morning as part of my breakfast. Unfortunately, local stores do not distribute the Dark Chocolate flavor so I make do with Milk Chocolate. This prohibits me from purchasing it at a reasonable price so I have had to resort to mail orders or email orders which I find inconvenient. Perhaps if more people would try this flavor it would get wider regular distribution.

review/summary: Fantastic Alternative to Solid-Food Breakfast
review/text: I have nervous anxiety issues and have difficulty eating solid foods first thing in the morning. I've found that Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials are a great solution to the problem. I can handle a nice refreshing drink, and it helps keep me feeling satisfied until lunchtime.<br /><br />As for this specific form of the product (envelopes instead of canister) and flavor (Dark Chocolate):  One of my absolute favorites.<br /><br />The packets are convenient, with no need to measure out the scoops from the canister, and no concern about the bulk of the powder having issues in a high humidity area, or on high humidity days.<br /><br />The Dark Chocolate flavor is less 'sweet' than the Rich Milk Chocolate, and a bit more mild. While I enjoy both, I prefer the Dark Chocolate for the less sugary taste first thing in the morning.

review/summary: D Y N A M I T E..... !
review/text: "Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, Dark Chcolate Flavour, 10 Count Envelopes, Pack of 6", is truly delicious!  I had bought the Milk Chocolate flavour before -- both in the no-sugar variety, (see my review of same), and the regular flavour.  They were both very tasty....but I found myself putting in more product than was called for in my milk, because the chocolate FLAVOUR in the "Milk chocolate" varieties was just just not strong enough -- for me, anyway.  This DARK Chcolate variety seems to have more of a chocolatey flavour -- or maybe I just like the dark chocolate flavour better than the milk.<br />I find myself using LESS product to get the same, (or even more!) choclate flavour!<br /><br />There are many vitamins and minerals in this drink also -- so it beats regular choclate drinks.  And perhaps, also beats "energy waters", because this is a POWDER, so you add your own milk, (which can be non-fat dry milk, which alters the taste from whole milk very, very little), and thus save money -- I think, (as you are not paying for water, as in liquid "energy drinks".)<br /><br />The ONLY reason I gave this product FOUR stars, and not five stars, is because of the PACKAGING!  OMMMMMF!  It is S_O hard to open!  (Especially for people like me, who NEED the energy inside those packets!)  I pulled at the packaging -- I used my scissors to try to cut and pry apart the packaging.  Yes, I did make a little headway -- the first day -- but not much.  I even found myself wondering if using DYNAMITE would be advisable for opening this package, but decided against it because: 1) I had no dynamite in my home just then, 2) I didn't know where I could buy dynamite in my neighbourhood 3) A History Channel documentary mentioned that forms have to be filled out with the goverment, before purchasing dynamite -- and I might look pretty silly, writing down that my reason for wanting to purchase dynamite was to open a package of six boxes of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (not to mention looking very suspicious, in these post 9/11 days), and 4) I suspected that the other people living in my condo, and in the nearby apartment houses just might not appreciate my using dynamite -- for ANY purpose!  Yes, I knew I COULD have just asked neighbours to help me open this package....but I KNEW I could eventually do it myself, (even without dynamite) .......some, er, year(?) Finally, three days after it arrived, I used the tip of my scissors to "draw" two "lines" in the recalcitrant packaging -- making a "tear strip" of sorts, to help me open the package.  It worked!  But just barely!<br /><br />Yes, the stuff inside the package, (Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, Dark Chocolate Flavour), is very, very tasty -- and very, very good for one's body.  It IS a treasure, of sorts.  But I doubt very much whether busy postal delivery people -- or anyone else -- would steal even one packet, if this packaging was easier to open.  The only result -- with an easier-opening package -- would be happier customers, opening the packaging, and imbibing and enjoying the prdocut sooner.  So please, Carnation -- re-think the packaging, and make it JUST A LITTLE EASIER TO OPEN!  It's more than enough to have the TASTE of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, Dark Chocolate Flavour, be "dynamite" delicious!  To have the packaging S__O difficult to open that the customer begins to wonder if using dynamite, ( BOOM! ) might indeed be the only way to OPEN the truly inscrutable packaging, is, I think, taking "secure packaging" a bit too far!  Carnation -- make the package a LITTLE easier to open!  Please?????  Thanks!!!!!!

review/summary: Great price for superior forumla.....
review/text: I have tried several varieties of dog food.  Most considered "super premium" types.  What they don't tell you is the difference in the first ingredient.  While having a meat, whether it be chicken or fish or duck or whatever, is the easiest way to separate good from great it doesn't always show which is the best.  Pound for pound, you want as little grains as possible with the highest concentration of proteins for your active pet.  This formula is great because the first ingredient is CHICKEN MEAL.  Meal yields more protein then a first ingredient simply stated chicken.  I used Iam's Mini chunks before but after a recommendation from a breeder, I use Pro Pac for both my extremely active dogs.  They love it and I love the price.  Not only that, I know I am giving my dogs the best dog food for their nutritional needs.  On top of that....every 10th bag is free.

review/summary: These Bars Are Awesome
review/text: I've tried lots of different protein bars over the years and these are by far the tastiest (Triple Choc is the best in my opinion) - I actually look forward to eating these things!  I sometimes eat one of these in place of lunch or as a snack in the late morning and middle of the day (half in the mid-morning, half after lunch).<br /><br />The bars are relatively low-cal and have a decent amount of protein which, per their packaging, is more easily absorbed than other protein supplements.  I can't speak to their science but the bars seem to be working for me . . . I've lost around 10 lbs over the past month and put on a lot of muscle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good protein bar, look no further.

review/text: I am following a low carb way of eating and was looking for a protein bar that didn't remind me of a tootsie roll.  This is nice and crunchy, but a little too sweet for my taste.  So instead of eating it by itself, I add it to my morning breakfast of greek yogurt, nuts, and coconut oil/flax seed oil.  Now the sweetness is offset by the tartness of the yogurt, and perfectly balanced out.

review/summary: Great ingredients, great bar
review/text: These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as "Dense" as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.

review/summary: Great for trekking while on holiday
review/text: I was lucky enough to meet the creator of Power Crunch while on holiday in the Sacred Valley in Peru. We had 2 weeks of day to day trekking in the Andes and our in-take of daily Power Crunch bars really saved the day. The terrain, the altitude and the food were challenging while being of our normal whole-food diet. I felt like Power Crunch really helped my body adjust and get a little extra out of an eXtreme vacation and tour schedule. I'm so excited by the taste and texture I'm ready to find a distributor in Asia so that Power Crunch can be part of my active daily lifestyle. You only need to try one to be hooked; do it when you need a little extra boost and you'll be back for more.

review/summary: Tasty and light
review/text: If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a "super bar" this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.

review/summary: These don't taste bad. They don't taste great, either.
review/text: They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.

review/summary: Not The Best Option Out There...
review/text: I had high hopes for these bars... I am a huge chocolate wafer fan! I am familiar with protein/energy bars and knew going into it that there would more than likely be a hint of that chalky protein bar flavor... but it hit me like a brick wall with the first bite. Luckily my husband has tastebuds that are muted to flavor, so he has slowly been able to work through this box of protein bars so we weren't just throwing money away... but wow. Just overall very disappointing. I went by reviews before deciding to purchase these, and most reviews were awesome...  so I can only assume that these are just one of those bars that is hit and miss. Some are going to love it, others are going to hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter group for this one. (And as a side-note, I shouldn't even call this a protein bar since it only contains 13g protein --- my all time favorite protein bar contains 20g. Granted, 13g is still a lot... but if you can choke this down, surely you can choke down a 20g bar with more flavor. In the future I will stick with my tried and true Chocolate Mint Builder's bars.)

review/summary: Mouth watering!
review/text: Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein "paste" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars.<br /><br />In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar.

review/summary: A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!
review/text: My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars!  They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine.  Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*<br /><br />However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.<br /><br />My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars.

review/summary: Cookies & Cream taste weird
review/text: I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass.

review/text: I was looking for a bar to snack on that wasn't loaded with carbs and sugar. This was it. It only has 4g of sugar in the whole bar and the rest is STEVIA. I couldn't tell at first and i wondered why it still tasted sweet so when i read the label I found the stevia. LOW LOW LOW on carbs too. I hate the gummy yucky..chewy texture of most health bars or power bars. this was a nice change and crisp. I only eat the Triple chocolate and the chocolate peanut butter. Those are the only two flavors that use STEVIA. the other flavors use sucralose and tasted waaaayyyyy too sweet.<br /><br />I bought them online here becuz at the store they were usually 3/$5. SO this was a bargain.<br /><br />Love them, Thanks. Taste even better cold out of the fridge.

review/text: These bars contain hydrolyzed whey protein, which is the highest quality. It doesnt matter if a bar contains 100g of protein if you dont absorb any of it. Hydrolyzation "pre digests" the protein so it absorbs more completely and quickly. These bars are the only ones that contain only hydrolyzed protein that I've found. Hydrolyzed protein also gives less gas. They taste great as well. They are very light and melt in your mouth a bit.
