review/summary: Loved at first, but ingredients are not natural!
review/text: When I first saw this product I thought, great, all natural coconut and shea butter. It's the latest rave and so good for you. This product also smells so deliciously wonderful, like a coconut/pineapple tropical delight! I really like how it feels on my long frizzy hair and makes it so shiney and smooth. Wonderful stuff!!!<br /><br />Once I really looked into the ingredients, I was horrified! I've been really looking at ingredients closely these days and did the same with this product.<br /><br />First ingredient Mineral Oil. Not the greatest stuff since is it a by-product of distillation of gasoline and considered a carcinogenic by some people.<br /><br />Second, HYDROGENATED Coconut Oil. What does that mean? I know coconut oil in it's raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin. After some google research I found out that Hydrogentated Coconut Oil is created by heating to 500-1000 degrees, then a catalyst is injected. The catalyst is typically nickel, platinum, or even aluminum! This stuff is bad for you! It is closer to plastic than a good for you organic compound.<br /><br />Sure, you're not putting it IN YOUR BODY, but there is some absorption that takes place when you squeeze it in your hands and through you scalp.<br /><br />Third ingredient, even worse! Styrene Butadiene Copolymer. Labeled as BHT and most people don't notice this ingredient or even think anything of it. It's Synthetic Rubber used in CAR TIRES, yuck! Embalming fluid, even more yuck! It has been associated to child hyper-activity and cancer.<br /><br />I just can't give this item a good review. It's not even Gluten Free since it has Wheat Germ Oil. Other ingredients are good, like Sweet Almond Oil and Aloe.<br /><br />This product feels really nice in my hair and I will use in on an OCCASSIONAL basis, but not on a daily basis. I have found plain shea butter or coconut oil in raw form is the very best thing for my dry, frizzy hair.

review/summary: Very light weight and moisturizing oil!
review/text: This oil is very light weight and moisturizing and, unlike hair grease, my hair didn't start itching uncontrollably because of the clogged pores.  The only issue I have with this oil is the smell.  I put it on and then fell asleep; the smell woke me up and kept me distressed.  I ended up going outside to try to let my hair air out but the smell is still there.<br /><br />If you are going to use this oil, I suggest you use it in the MORNING right before you go outside so your head has a chance to air out some before you go to bed.<br /><br />What does it smell like?  I don't know if it is papaya or what it is but it some type of sweet fruit.  Think about those fruit smelling perfumes at Bath and Body Works--well, this hair oil smells like that.  Specifically, Bath and Body Works has a perfume called Sunflower ---this smells like that perfume.<br /><br />Edited to add: I see the ingredient list and I think the smell is from the Sunflower Oil.  The first ingredient in this product is MINERAL OIL.  My body normally reacts negatively to mineral oil.  I will update.<br /><br />Update: Smell went away after about a day; relaxer didn't burn as bad because this oil does not cause itching like other hair oils.  I defintely will use it if I know I am going to be outside and can let the oil air out in my hair before going back inside.

review/text: I don't know if I'm going to be able to give this product it's full test.  I love the idea of it, and I don't mind the smell at first.  For me, I find it a lighter scent - like suntan lotion.  However, it's been several hours since I applied the product, and it still smells as strong as when I put it in.<br /><br />My biggest issue is that product is exceptionally greasy.  I put it on dry hair, and there's no way I could go out with my hair like this.<br /><br />I will try it again on wet hair, but at this point, I don't think this is something I could use before leaving the house.

review/summary: Not for my hair type...
review/text: This product is not meant for a person with thin, light-colored hair, no matter what type of processing you've done to make your scalp or hair dry, frizzy, or brittle.<br /><br />The first issue I had with the product was that there were no directions. I'm sure a more product savvy person might be able to intuit exactly how much to use and when to apply it (in the shower? on wet or toweled hair? on dry hair? before or after using a blow dryer?), but I had no clue so I tried it various ways. The end result was the same: greasy looking and matted hair with no body. I tried on both wet and dry hair using a pea sized amount massaged through my shoulder length hair, and I tried using a few drops in water and spraying it on. I tried smaller and smaller amounts. The only time there was much to see besides oily was when I put a smidgen just on the ends of my hair. But the product is supposed to be for dry scalp??<br /><br />I do like the smell, and I guess I thought this was going to be more a "hot oil treatment" as I typically have used in the past, but it's not. My advice to the product maker would be to target the advertisement directly to whomever this product works for (I have no clue but it's not for anyone with my type of hair), and to provide some instructions on how much to use and when for best results.

review/summary: Oily mess that I couldn't even shampoo out
review/text: This has to be one of the worst hair products I've used and I've thrown it out after one use. The only directions the bottle says is "massage into scalp and hair" So while in the bath, I massaged a small amount into my scalp and the ends of my hair and put a towel around it. It was very oily and I tried to rinse it out. I shampooed my hair three times trying to get it out because it was so oily feeling. I then towel tried my hair and tried to blow dry it and it was still a greasy mess. So greasy that I couldn't even wear it up in a ponytail because it looked so oily. I had plans to go somewhere so the only way I could get it out was with Dawn dishsoap (which worked for the most part but left it stripped)! My shower/bath was a slick mess too so I had to clean that up. The bottle claims it "provides light, non-greasy nourishment to scalp and hair" My experience, and I don't see how it can honestly be any different for anyone else, it was a heavy, greasy mess. The bottle also emphasizes that it is ultra shea...yet the main ingredient is mineral oil and shea butter is all the way down as the seventh ingredient.

review/text: I love the Shea Moisture products so I saw this labeled Shea hair oil and said why not give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately the first ingredient listed in this is Mineral Oil which I'm sure most people know is not good for your hair. Suffice to say that I didn't bother trying it.<br /><br />Shame on you for labeling this the way you did. Why not call it Ultra Mineral Oil...

review/summary: Deceptive name, but it works nicely as a hair dressing
review/text: If this had been marketed as a hair dressing rather than as a hair therapy product, and not made such a point of Shea in the name and packaging, I'd have given it 4 stars.<br /><br />The main ingredient is mineral oil. The shea is listed after FRAGRANCE in the ingredients list. Which means there is less shea then there is fragrance.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about mineral oil, but it's in other products that I've used on both my hair occasionally, and more often on my daughter's hair. She has curly, thick, medium coarse very dry hair. When she doesn't use product at all, we call it pouf hair. We've been working on finding the best product to keep her hair in control for years. Mineral oil is the main ingredient in VO5 Hair Dressing (the stuff in tubes your grandfather probably used) and it's in Pink Oil.<br /><br />The problem with mineral oil based hair dressing is that they can be very drying to your hair. The best way to use them is on very wet hair in small amounts to create a barrier that locks the water in and to use them on hair that is washed at least daily. Otherwise the drying effect can cause split ends. Another good option is to use it only occasionally. Don't apply it to dry hair. It won't condition it, and will make it look greasy. Just adding a mist of water and combing it well will work better.<br /><br />If you put 2-3 drops in your palm, then rub your hands together to distribute it over very wet hair, then let it dry normally, it does leave your hair shiny. For my waist length, very straight hair it took 5 drops.<br /><br />The scent is nice and light. I didn't like the smell of either VO5 or Pink Oil.<br /><br />This is something we will use only occasionally, and I suspect the bottle will last a very long time. Even with regular use, at 2-5 drops per use, it's a lot of oil.<br /><br />For every day though, we will stick to jojoba oil. It's more expensive, but it's also more nourishing.

review/summary: Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil
review/text: First of all, let's be honest about what you'll see when you peel back the rear label to have a look at the ingredients: The first ingredient is mineral oil.  Just mineral oil.  So basically, this is mineral oil with a little bit of other oils and scented to smell pretty.  "Shea" falls WAAAAAAAAY down on the ingredients list.  Next, be careful about how much of this you use, especially if you put it right on your scalp, to nourish and soothe it, like the label says you can.  Use it like this, and you'll look like you just dipped your head in a French-fryer.  Don't do that!<br /><br />Once I understood these things about this product, though, I like the way it helps take care of my hair when it's dry.  I don't use much, and I make sure I put it more towards the ends of my hair instead of putting this product right on the scalp.  It can help tame flyaways.  Also, if I'm going to wear my hair up or braid it, and it's too clean and slippery to hold a style, I use a little more of this product on the length of my hair- nowhere near the scalp!- and it helps the hair hold the style better than freshly-washed hair does.  And it does add in moisture.<br /><br />Although the scent is pleasant, considering this is basically mineral oil, if it's mineral oil that you're looking for, why not get a much cheaper, much larger bottle of mineral oil, and skip this product?  You'll get the same results, and will have a little extra cash left over.  If you really, really want the scent that is in this fancy bottle of mineral oil, well, then, click "Buy Now," and knock yourself out!

review/summary: Good product, scent too heavy
review/text: I have used Silk Therapy for years which I will give a ten stars.<br /><br />But this product by Clear Scalp and Hair has a very heavy scent like a coconut and vanila combo. The scent goes away after about 6 hours.<br /><br />The color is a liquid dark yellow but goes on your hair clear. I find it much greasier than Silk Therapy. But if you can immediately comb through and rub the small amount all over your hair, it does make your hair shine all day. The heaviness also works to keep your hair shape.<br /><br />I am not sure whether I will buy again. I think I like Silk Therapy much more.

review/text: I am a big fan of hair oils so I was happy to recieve this product and give it a try. First off it is very light weight,smells great (just like shea butter) but I did find it to be quite greasy compared to other hair oils that I have used. This can be applied to wet or dry hair and is perfect for flat ironing and blow drying.They say to give this product at least 7 days for it to work effectively, so I will try it out a little longer and return with a recent update.

review/summary: Makes your hair and scalp extremely oily and greasy feeling
review/text: I decided to give this product a try because I have dry and itchy scalp at times. I really like the smell of this scalp and hair oil. It has a tropical scent to it that is similar to some tanning oil.<br /><br />The first thing that I done was look for directions on the bottle and there are no directions. I wasn't sure if I should wash my hair and then apply a small amount to my hair and scalp. Or maybe I should apply it to my hair and then wash it out so I ended up trying both ways. First I washed my hair and then applied a pea sized amount of the oil. I quickly realized that there was no way that I could leave this in my hair because it made my hair feel extremely greasy. So I washed my hair a couple times to get the oil out of my hair. A couple days later I decided to try applying a small amount and letting it sit for a few minutes. Then I tried to wash my hair and the greasy feeling was still there. I had to wash it three times in order to get most of the greasy feeling out of my hair. I have tried it several more times since then with similar results.<br /><br /> It certainly adds moisture to my hair and scalp but it I don't like the oily, greasy feeling at all. It even makes my forehead all oily and it's hard to wash off. I might occasionally use the oil but I definitely won't be using this on a regular basis.

review/summary: This hair oil works once applied properly
review/text: I have relaxed hair and a somewhat dry scalp. I found that this product keeps my scalp and hair moist and, because it's rather thick (not too runny), adds a bit of body and style-ability to my hair. The Formulated Moisture Lock System with Nutrium gives your hair a blend of natural oils that will keep your hair from breaking, so that's a plus for me. This oil has helped with my dry scalp and this seems to have just the right combination of ingredients to benefit your scalp and provide a healthy foundation to help your hair flourish! At the same time, The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Shampoo and Conditioner is a great combination of treatment for hair that is dry and brittle. Particularly during the dry seasons. Recommend.

review/summary: Good for pre-treatment for flaky scalp, too!
review/text: I chose to try out this Clear Scalp & Hair scalp & hair oil to see if it would help with my flaky, dry scalp. I've always had dandruff and flaking issues, and have used other oils and creams in combination with dandruff shampoos in the past, with mixed results. I'm happy to report that this product seems to work pretty well. I use a decent sized amount (about the size of two quarters in your hand) and scrub it into my hair and scalp about 5 minutes before showering. I find that it really helps to loosen everything up to help the shampoo work more effectively.<br /><br />This is probably a product that's going to vary in effectiveness between different people and hair types. If you have thicker hair, you might find yourself needing to use more to see any benefit. Most people probably use this as a leave-in solution without washing it out right away - I personally can't see myself doing that because it is very greasy, and I don't use leave in oils or gels. Again, there are different uses and effectiveness for different people. At the low price, you can't really go wrong giving it a try. I'd recommend using a lesser amount first just to make sure your head isn't overly oily, and adjust as needed.

review/summary: Light Weight Oil With a Nice Scent But Not Much Better Than Baby Oil
review/text: The clear scalp hair and beauty oil is a decent hair oil that many will appreciate for its light weight and decent fragrance.  It is not thick like coconut oil tends to be and it also does not have the strong unpleasant smell of coconut oil.  The primary ingredient as others have mentioned is indeed mineral oil so you would expect it to be a lighter weight than coconut oil.  It will leave your hair and scalp with a nice shine (as all oils do) and also leave decent aroma that will not bother most people.  For those seeking a true scalp therapy you will probably still need to turn to a heavier weight oil but for general everyday hair needs this one is  just a bit better than baby oil (though at a much higher price).

review/text: Product delivery in a tapered bottle is a plus, making for ease of application and steady storage base.<br /><br />The overall product composition is good, but the base of mineral oil throws up an unknown, ie, we don't know how much of what is in it.  So, it may be more or less effective for random individuals because of this.  For what it is and if you don't have overly damaged hair and just want some extra moisture or replenish the oils washed out from shampooing, this is great.  Miracle product for other folks, not sure.

Sadly, this is yet another product that utilizes false advertising to rope in unsuspecting consumers.  This isn't marketed as hair care for ethnic women, and yet that's really what it is.  It is really just scented mineral oil.  This was not intended for thinner hair and so my wife was not in for a good experience.  I'd say `read the label' before purchasing, and then again the label makes no mention of the products true intentions.  This product gave my wife greasy hair and made her feel dirty to the point where she raced to get it washed out of her hair, which took a while.

review/text: Ok so I was very excited to try this product out. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner from Clear and am obsessed with them so naturally I thought I would love the "nourishing scalp & hair oil" too. Negative.<br /><br />Not only does it have a very distant smell which can be pretty overwhelming, but it's greasy! I use many hair oils and believe it or not most of them aren't greasy. I was really disappointed. The crowning moment was when I did a top bun on my hair with the product in. I did my bun, ran out the house, started driving to work which is only 10 minutes away and the minute I placed my car into park the bun slid off of my hair. I had all my hair loose. Never again, save yourselves the money.

review/text: So technically I suppose you can call this "non-greasy" since it's oil but make no mistake about it, this is nothing short of pouring olive oil on your head. Having long waist length hair while living in the hot humid summer of Florida, my hair takes a beating especially in summer. I like the idea of nourishing vitamins/minerals and sporadically appreciate a deep conditioner but would be highly unlikely to purchase this again.<br /><br />It is oily and hard to remove even when using a very small amount.<br /><br />Despite the nourishing vitamins/minerals etc, this is still filled with unhealthy chemicals.<br /><br />Worst of all, despite being difficult to remove from the scalp area, it failed to perform to any notable level on the ends of my hair where sun damage etc is worst. All in all, very underwhelming product.

Hoping that massaging it into his scalp would be the answer to stronger hair, we got this product. Nothing has changed even though we follow instructions. The biggest benefit he gets from this product is a temporary smoothness if he applies it to the dryer ends of his hair. Applying at the scalp, massaging it in and combing it through has done nothing. We give it 3 stars, a neutral rating, because someone may benefit from it. We didn't.

review/text: I had hoped that this oil would help with my dry ends.  When it arrived, there were no directions whatsoever on the bottle, which was made of fairly flimsy plastic.  I was unable to find directions in Amazon's product description either.  So before even opening the package, it's not very consumer-friendly.  Reading other reviews, I was able to glean that a little goes a long way, so I used about 3 drops put in the palm of one hand, rubbed my hands together, and then ran my hands over my hair concentrating on the ends.  (I should note here that I have fairly fine, smooth long hair).  Almost instantly, my hair was weighed down and greasy as though it hadn't been washed in a week.  With 3 drops!  Fortunately it did wash out with the first try, and it had a very nice, shea-butter scent, but that's the only positive.  I'll be tossing this and would certainly not recommend it.

review/summary: Easy Greasy
review/text: I've always thought it was kind of strange when people complained about certain products not having instructions on them. I once reviewed a salad spinner, and several of the other reviewers complained about no instructions in the box and not being able to get the salad spinner to work. I thought to myself "What's next? Do we need instructions to use mixing bowls and water pitchers as well?"<br /><br />Even with the shampoo and conditioner from this product line, I didn't understand the complaints of no instructions. The use of shampoo and conditioner is pretty much standard fare; if they don't have instructions assume a nickel sized amount and use daily or as needed. With this product however, instructions would've been nice. Something simple, indicating the amount of product to use and how often to use the product; I don't think that would be too much to ask.<br /><br />As for the product itself, I personally have not had much luck in finding the exact amount that I need. If I use too little, I don't notice any difference in my hair. If I use too much, my hair does have a shine, but it's not a "clean" shine, it looks like a dirty, oily hair shine. Overall, I don't think I'll finish the tube, and I certainly won't purchase another.

review/text: This product comes wrapped in plastic wrap but no instructions. It has a pleasant scent, but it is really just oil, and if you want to revitalize your scalp, oil can irritate, especially if it has a scent or other additives.<br /><br />It took a while to review, because this product comes with no directions. Do I wash my hair, add it to my scalp, and if so, how much? How many drops do I use? In absence of instructions, I washed my hair as usual (I have semi-dry color-treated hair), and after the shampoo cycle added some to my scalp. Instantly, I could feel the moist oily feel this product left on my scalp.<br /><br />So, I proceeded, added conditioner and dried (I air-dry since my scalp is sensitive).<br /><br />Almost immediately, I noticed a problem. My hands came away oily from my scalp, Not good, and NOT attractive.  Also, my scalp felt irritated by the oils and perfume. Not good. I went home and rinsed my hair out completely but unfortunately, the greasy oil remained, and I could feel the prickling of scalp irritation. Whatever ingredients are in this product, my scalp did not feel revitalized or moisturized and my hair looks greasy like I haven't washed it in days.<br /><br />I'm disappointed. Perhaps better instructions and a product guide would be useful. I can't say however, that my scalp is anything but irritated and not attractive after using this.

review/summary: A little goes a long way.
review/text: As with any oil in general, you are going to want to use this very sparingly. The lack of instructions is a fail on behalf of CLEAR SCALP, but since I normally use hair oils, pomades, shine treatments, etc, I pretty much knew what to expect and how to use it.<br /><br />If you have really drry scap issues, put a drop on your pointer finger and rub it in a little against your other pointer finger, then apply it to the areas where you need it and rub it in. You shouldn't have a thick layer applied or a puddle. It should only feel very slightly slick. If you use too much, you will have an awful mess. Do not just squeeze the bottle onto your head! lol You will regret it.<br /><br />You can also use it to help tame frizz, give some added shine, and hydrate/seal really dry/split ends. Again you only need a few drops though. Put a drop or two in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and then sort of grab just above the ends of your hair, and slide your hand down to the end. To tame frizz add a drop or two to the palm of your hand, rub hands together and sort of run your hands over your hair and then finger comb through it. Same technique of you just want some shine or sleekness.<br /><br />This 3 ounce bottle would last months and months. Again the main thing to remember is literally a drop or two at a time or you will end up with a major case of the greasies.<br /><br />It rinses away easily with any shampoo. You may want to massage the scalp a bit more to really get the shampoo on to it and to exfoliate the dry skin you were treating. I typically kinda scratch at the scalp when I am shampooing as I am lathering. I have had no issues with this oil being hard to remove and I haven't had any buildup on my hair or scalp. I am caucasian with long wavy/curly hair which can tend to be on the dry side depending on which styling products I use and how often I use heat tools.<br /><br />The oil is also great for braiding and for straightening with a hot iron.<br /><br />While I like the results while the product is in/on my hair, the benefits are gone once it is shampooed out. It doesn't seem to have any major permanent reparative qualities, but that is expected from a low priced brand like this.

review/summary: Disgusting.
review/text: This stuff is disgusting. As others have noted, perhaps it's for a different kind of hair, but it's super greasy and doesn't really do much to help nourish. Not recommended unless you have the proper hair type, though I don't know what that is...just that mine is not it.

review/summary: More for a different audience
review/text: My step daughter is bi racial and these product ended up going into her bin of products.  It helps to maintain the moisture in her hair which easily dries out.  When I used this on my fine hair it just made it greasy and heavy.  I didn't see any Shea in the product ingredients.  I think the pink stuff I bought for her works best at keeping moisture in her hair and keeping her curls pretty and touchable.

review/summary: Just gross
review/text: I have VERY dry hair; I've been coloring it and/or otherwise fussing with it for literally 35 years.  I love the argon oil treatment my stylist gives me, so I thought that this product would be a nice at-home adjunct.<br /><br />Yuck.  There are no directions at all but the online description says that this product can be used on dry or wet hair.  I've tried it on both, and either way, even with the lightest touch, it weighs my hair down and makes it hang in oily strings.  After I've used it, I have to wash my hair 2-3 times before it looks okay again.  I've tried it 4 times (two times on dry hair and two times on wet hair) and now I'm tossing it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Cheap oil in cheap packaging with no discernible usefulness at all.  Blech.

review/summary: Too Greasy!
review/text: I have super thick, naturally wavy hair that I dye a lot.  It frizzes a lot.  The problem I have with products is always finding that balance between getting the frizz to go away or when it does my hair looks to greasy, blech.  I usually end up just not using much or flat ironing and using higher end product.  Anyways, tried this, it is the greasiest stuff I have ever used, and that's with using a dime-sized amount away from my scalp of course, and again my hair is super thick, I usually get it thinned 1-2 times a year.  Then the smell, blech, not for me.  I just rewashed my hair and went back to my regular $10 a bottle stuff, sigh.  Oh well, tossing this!  Not for me or my hair.  Nothing ever seems to work right on my hair, even the expensive stuff, but at least that helps "some" and tones it down a little, lol.  I wouldn't recommend this.  You're better off just using vegetable oil for all the good it does, seriously.  Not that you'd want to do that!

review/summary: great moisturizer!
review/text: A small amount to the scalp and tips of the hair added lots of shine and moisture to my dry split ends. This stuff is much better than I expected.<br /><br />As a disclaimer, my  hair routine isn't the usual. I do the no-poo thing (instead of shampoo, it's backing soda and purified water, and instead of conditioner, it's gelatin, apple cider, essential oils, and honey. Normally, this means my hair is very healthy and shiny, but lately I've been too busy to do the conditioning and also have to use hair spray for my job as a professional dancer (keeps hair in place, obviously). Anyhow, that has been drying my hair out, so rather than getting my conditioner from the fridge (because it is perishable), I just put some of this in after doing the baking soda "shampoo". Voila! Awesome, silky hair from scalp to waist. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: No luck used just on ends.
review/text: This was used on ends of hair rather than rubbed into a scalp in the hopes that it would reduce "frizz" on dry ends of hair, applied while the hair was wet.  After blow-drying, it did not make the hair oily, but it actually made frizz worse, if anything.  There weren't any noticeable benefits in this case, but it might still help as a scalp treatment.<br /><br />It smells good out of the bottle, but the smell does not linger.

review/summary: Always read the ingredient list BEFORE buying a hair product.
review/text: The label says that is product contains "a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils".  Well, there are many different oils listed on the ingredient list for this product but the first one listed (which means it's the largest quantity) is mineral oil which is not even listed in the "Product Features" section on this website. Mineral oil is not what most people would consider a "natural oil". Mineral oil is a byproduct of the crude oil industry. It is similar to petroleum jelly, but in liquid form. This doesn't necessarily mean it's bad for hair, but I think the product name and product features are deceptive.<br />The "shea" that's in the product name is listed AFTER fragrance in the ingredient list. That means there's more fragrance in this product than shea butter!<br />The scent of this product is pleasant. It has no rancid odor. The consistency is what I would expect of a typical hair oil.<br />My piece of advice is to always read the ingredient list BEFORE buying a hair product so you really know what you are getting.

review/summary: makes you look greasy
review/text: My wife has soft fine blondish hair did not enjoy this product.  The directions, which are non existent are awful.  It says simply to "apply to wet or dry hair" on the product page, and the instructions are simply "clean and apply."  This was her first time using this product so better explanations for applying and removing would have been nice.  It did not do much for her hair, and she stopped using it.  After she applied it to her wet hair, she looked very greasy when it dried.  I have short Asian hair, and I tried it also.  It has a strong coconut smell, which is tolerable after a while.  I used it in the shower, and then washed it off.  My hair still feels greasy after washing it off.  We have used Clear's line of shampoos and like those, but we are not a fan of this.

review/summary: NOT FOR ALL HAIR TYPES --
review/text: Ok, I should have read the reviews prior to selecting this item.  Hopefully, my mistake of not reading the reviews will save you time & money.<br /><br />I have tried several of the Clear shampoo products and they were great.  I have long (middle of my back) thick wavy hair - not to dry but I do experience a dry scalp sometimes and I often use hot oil treatments - so I thought that a nourishing scalp & Hair Oil sounded great.  However, this product seems to be for ethnic hair.  Needless to say I applied a few drops to my hair - I didn't think it was ever going to wash out; my hair still seems greasy/oily a week later.<br /><br />The product advertising needs to be clarified.

review/summary: Very nourishing, but a bit oily for my hair.
review/text: I have very dry, curly/frizzy hair, and was excited to try this out. It added great shine to my hair, but didn't help diminish my frizz at all, and left my hair and scalp feel a bit oily. I have used other leave-in oil treatments, like argon oil, and always find the same problem, so it might be my hair texture that is the problem. I find that John Freida's Frizz-Ease line, especially the Secret Weapon creme, to be the best at taming my wild bird's nest of hair, but I am sure this product works for others. I just had to shampoo so much after, that it felt like I was doing more damage than nourishing!

review/text: I will be another who admits that I didn't realize that this inexpensive oil was intended for non Caucasian folks and that it mostly contained mineral oil and in both cases, Im glad that I didn't because this is a good product for me.  I have dry skin and my scalp is no exception.  I put a little of this oil both on my scalp and on the ends of my hair, wait 20 minutes, then wash it thoroughly.  After drying my hair, I put s tiny amount in my palms and rub it on my ends.  My scalp has stopped flaking and it seems to hold down frizzies very well too.  I will continue to use it and am glad i found it.

review/summary: Does little for my hair except make it a bear to wash
review/text: A combination of different oils, this, like many of the new specialized products from "clear" has no instructions. Do I heat it? Is it for my scalp (all that oil, including mineral oil?) or hair? So I've tried it a few times. Once applies, my hair is of course plastered down with oil. It does not run or drip, but stays in place, so it's no mess. How long should I let it soak in? No idea. Tried five minutes. Ten minutes. Half an hour.  Have to wash the hair three times to get it out, and that seems to defeat the purpose, no?  My hair does look better after it dries, but my tub has an oil ring that has to be scrubbed clean. So I used it in the shower instead. Wound up with oily splotches on the tiles. Even harder to clean.<br /><br />I'll toss the remaining 2/3rds - not worth the effort.

review/text: This is a very nice product that makes your hair feel silky and clean.  It has a nice fragrance and a comfortable price point.<br />You can use this on wet or dry hair.  When I first used it, I started out with a very small amount so as to be sure that I didn't get a greasy, need a shampoo look.  Gradually I found my comfort zone in how much to use.<br />Now my routine is after I shampoo my hair and condition it in the shower, I towel dry my hair and then apply this product to my slightly damp hair.  I work from the scalp out to the ends.  Then I let my hair dry naturally.  I usually do not use a hairdryer.<br />This product then gives my hair body when its dry.<br />I highly recommend this product.  I also like their shampoo and conditioner.

review/summary: Another product that works for me, but only on the dry ends of my hair
review/text: I am not sure if this line is ethnic or not.  I am not going to make that assumption based on the model used for the product line.  I don't think anyone should rub a generous amount of this into their scalp.  I use a tiny bit of it for my ends and it reminds me a bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P9DS4Q">John Frieda Frizz-Ease Extra Strength Serum, 1.69 Ounces</a> but a little thicker.  I am not sure if I should be putting mineral oil in my hair.  My hair is naturally blondish red and very thick and curly, so this works for what I need. Only a tiny bit though, like a pea size for all my ends.

review/text: I use oil on my hair for many reasons. I like to put it on the ends before I blow try it and after for a bit of texturizing. Even just a couple drops on my scalp made my hair look super oily and unclean. So i tried using it as more of a moisturizer for my hair but it didn't really do anything. I'll stick with jojoba oil, thank you. if your scalp is dry, use Clear's Shea Conditioner instead.

review/summary: The best candy I have ever tasted!
review/text: I've tried three other milk candies, and this has proven to be the best of all. Rather than a chewy candy that only lasts a few moments, the little milk marbles melt slowly and last upwards of 10-15 minutes each! So, the review about not getting as much as you pay for is completely wrong in my opinion. They're sweet but not overpowering, creamy, and all around delectable. However, I have found that you either love them or hate them(milk candy in general) so if it's your first time, try a little bit of condensed milk or buy cheaper candies first. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do!

review/summary: Good, but not great.
review/text: The candies taste nice, but I was disappointed with a few things. For starters, it had HFCS listed as one of the main ingredients. I would honestly expect that a candy this pricey would at least be made from sugar, but this was not the case.<br /><br />The price is another thing that I found to be disappointing. For the amount that I had paid, I would have certainly expected at least a little bit more in the package. The bag is roughly the size of a small bag of chips, but is inflated with a lot of air. Each small package inside contains two candy beads roughly the size of large pearls. So the package appears small for the large price and the amount of candy inside is smaller still.<br /><br />I wasn't completely disappointed, though. As I said, the candy has a pleasant flavor--a nice mild, sweet milk taste. It's just unfortunate that the candy is made with seemingly common/sub-par ingredients and yet priced at a higher quality price point.<br /><br />I believe another commenter suggested that you wait to purchase these at a nearby Asian grocer, and if this is a possibility for you I would suggest the same.

review/text: These rice cakes are so good.  I feel like I am eating a cross between a nori roll (seaweed) and a rice cake. The flavor is good - that has to be the hint of spicy wasabi. They are good with a little butter or plain. A wonderful new surprise and discovery!

review/text: This was my first time trying "bush tea."  Apart from its purported health benefits (which are considerable), Twinnings' flavored honeybush tea has a delightful, fruity flavor with a delicate sweetness that is both smooth and comforting.  I would think that it would make a lovely, refreshing iced tea as well.  This interesting tea tickles the tongue with a wide variety of flavors, some slightly reminiscent of Fruit Loops cereal. It also has a pleasant little spicy kick.  I've definitely found my new, favorite tea!

review/text: Excellent falafel mix.  Spicy, but not too spicy, and contains just fava beans and chickpeas while some other brands leave out the fava beans and add wheat flour.  The instructions say add 1 cup water to 1 cup mix but that's too much water.  3/4 cup water is more reasonable.  You can always add more water if it's too thick.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I've bought other falafel mixes and this one is decent, but not the best.  Most mixes take about 15 minutes to thicken after water is added.  This one takes at least 30 minutes.  Even then, it might not be thick enough.  I have broiled the falafels rather than deep frying, so the fact that they are "wetter" than most falafels is actually a good thing since they don't get dried out.  The falafels do taste great.

review/summary: Couldn't be more pleased
review/text: I chose this mix for its ingredients (fava beans, chickpeas, etc) and for the ease of preparation according to the instructions.<br /><br />As another noted, using less water might be a good idea. I used 3/4 of a cup instead of a full cup from the start just in case. Within 30 minutes, it seemed to have been a wise choice. Although, if one has too little water, one can always add more, and if one has too much, one can add more of the mix.<br /><br />I decided to bake them and maintaining a sphere was not a goal. The shape does not matter. They seem to be inclined to form patties, but they do retain their shape when cooking (and slightly expand). I baked them at 400 for a time I do not remember (until small cracks formed on the surface) and ate them according to my preferences. They taste great, and have a good texture (when baked at least) and I put the extras in the refrigerator and ate them later, and they were good even cold.<br /><br />I did not feel it was necessary to add anything to the mix to improve it. If I were to add something, it would be fresh onion.<br /><br />Falafel, particularly this mix, is good for a variety of purposes. One could for religious, moral, or health reasons avoid eating animal derived foods, and this would provide a great healthy filling food to fill any void left by the avoidance of meat. And although I have never had "fake meat" and never had the desire too, this is probably much better because it is its own food, rather than attempting to imitate another.<br /><br />I took a gamble on ordering a pack of 6 boxes of something I've never used before and there was a good outcome. I am glad I have the six boxes and when I finish them, I'll likely get more of this.

review/text: Though I added peppers (this wasn't spicy enough for me, but few things are), this falafel mix is delicious and we've already eaten two boxes in the first week.<br /><br />The big problem is that the final ingredient is corn oil, and a couple of calls to the company were a bust in terms of finding out whether or not they use GMO-FREE corn oil, so I'm guessing they use GMO corn oil. Which means I'll never buy this product again until they start using GMO-FREE ingredients or stop adding corn oil to their mix.<br /><br />It's a shame about the GMO because this is an otherwise fantastic product and the mix would be fine without the addition of corn oil. We shouldn't really eat the rest, but we may, while hoping the tiny bit of GMO in an otherwise GMO-FREE diet won't hurt...but when it's gone we will never buy it again (and we're still not sure we'll eat the rest we have on hand).<br /><br />SAHADI -- PLEASE GO GMO-FREE!!! We could easily eat a box or more a week if that happened.

At first it looked like they were going to be too wet but I scooped out 1/4 cup of mix and dropped it into a Calphalon skillet with a little olive oil over medium heat, then pressed it down with the bottom of the measuring cup. After that side browned, they were easily flipped and the final product was perfect!

I was looking for some candy to satisfy my sweet tooth on the go and found this variety pack on sale with Amazon's Subscribe-and-save program and immediately bought this 6-pack. I love all three varieties and am happy to say that it lasted me almost a month, although I did give a few pieces away to friends and family. If you can get it on sale here it's a great deal, especially for 6 boxes. Occasionally you can find them for cheaper individually at your local grocery store, or in bulk at a large wherehouse store, but with the Amazon Prime program I have them sent to my house in 2 days and am more than happy with the quality of the candy. I'd definitely recommend this deal.

review/summary: Indipensible, all-purpose household product
review/text: I am never without at least two gallons of distilled, white vinegar in the house. It is completely nontoxic, quite inexpensive, and it has endless practical uses other than the obvious ones of using it for cooking and for salad dressing. Here are a few of my favorites:<br /><br />Removing hard water scale: You can easily avoid more expensive preparations to remove scale from a coffee pot or water distiller by soaking them overnight in a solution of half vinegar and half water. Use the same solution to remove the water line in a flower vase and remove stains and white mineral crusts in clay, glazed and plastic pots.<br /><br />Disinfectant: I keep a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SRBYP2">spray bottle</a> of vinegar in both the kitchen and bathroom, and I carry a small, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XW0TG2">travel-size spray bottle</a> of it in my purse. It works great as a disinfectant, and it is much, much cheaper than hand sanitizers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X5FYO0">Purell</a>. For added oomph in disinfecting in my kitchen and bathrooms, I keep a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AOHJZC">spray bottle of hydrogen peroxide</a> in them as well (you can often find an 8-ounce dark-brown spray bottle of hydrogen peroxide sold in drugstores or Walmart next to the regular 16- or 32-ounce dark-brown bottles of hydrogen peroxide). Microbiologists at Virginia Tech discovered that when you spray a surface with vinegar and then with hydrogen peroxide, one after the other, together they kill 99% of household germs, such as staph and e.Coli. These natural disinfectants are ideal for use around children and pets because breathing their fumes is not harmful, unlike the fumes from harsh chemicals in commercial disinfectants such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M5JR9K">Lysol</a>, ammonia, or bleach. However, do note that hydrogen peroxide can fade out colors in fabrics if it splashes on them, and children should be protected from accidentally ingesting hydrogen peroxide (vinegar is not poisonous, and the child will spit it out because it is sour).<br /><br />Dishwashing: Rather than using soap, which leaves scum, when you hand wash dishes use a mixture of 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 cup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXPY8">baking soda</a> in a dish pan of hot water.<br /><br />Laundry: Add 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar to the last rinse to remove soap scum from your clothing. It also works great to eliminate mold and mildew from damp clothing left too long in the hamper, and it acts as a non-toxic fabric softener and static cling reducer. It also removes manufacturing chemicals from new clothes, especially underwear and sleepwear, either in the washer or by hand washing them in a sink of water with a cup of vinegar added to it. It's also a good idea to prewash new sheets and towels this way.<br /><br />Itchy skin: If you have a tendency to have itchy skin after bathing with soap, you can restore the acid/alkaline balance on your skin by keeping a spray bottle of diluted vinegar in your shower (about 1/2 cup to a quart of water). Turn off the shower after rinsing off all the soap, then spray the vinegar/water mixture over your whole body, stroking it along your skin to get it on you everywhere, including on your scalp--it makes a good hair rinse. Then turn on the shower to a cool temperature and rinse it off. Don't worry, the vinegar smell does not cling to you. Note: If you have itching in intimate areas of your body, rather than using the vinegar rinse, see my review of Florasone Cream (http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YR7GN7ZQGPZD/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00016QU3O&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode=#wasThisHelpful).<br /><br />Pesticide and herbicide: Drive away ants from your home by spraying vinegar and wiping up ants along their ant trail, and spraying it around the door or window where they got in. Eliminate anthills by pouring vinegar on the hill. Pour vinegar in the cracks of sidewalks to kill weeds, which is much safer than chemical herbicides. (Be sure you don't put vinegar on your grass or anywhere else that you don't want to kill the plant life.) You can kill slugs by spraying them with a mixture of 1 part water and 1 part vinegar. Catch moths by creating a mixture of 2 parts vinegar and 1 part molasses, placing the mixture in a tin can, and hanging it in a tree or placing it on a table or porch rail near where the moths are bothering you.<br /><br />Discourage cats from getting into a child's sandbox by pouring vinegar on the sand.<br /><br />Bathroom deodorizing spray: Vinegar works as well as natural citrus deodorizers, and it won't poison you with harsh chemicals the way Glade type products will.

review/summary: smells delicious and pups love it !
review/text: This looked like one of the good brands that passed my picky inspection list for our girls' approved foods. First time I prepared it, I wanted to make a bowl for ME... it smells so good - just like it should- like fresh beef and real zucchini. The pups LOVE it- they licked their bowls clean. We will for sure be trying the other flavors as time goes on.

review/summary: A good brand of corn
review/text: It's just a can of corn.  For online pricing, this is a good deal.<br /><br />What I like about Libby's corn is that it's not quite as salty as some of the competitors.  That makes it easier to cook, because it doesn't overpower other ingredients.  Put a small amount of butter or cream in when you heat it, top with fresh cracked pepper, and it's a tasty side.<br /><br />The product is very consistent in quality and I have no complaints.

review/text: Libby is delicious corn, and I like the quality of this product.  I glanced over the 8.5 oz part of the description; make sure you realize this is a little can of corn, not what I would call a normal can size.  For the size, the cans were a little pricey, but you pay for the convenience of having it delivered.

review/text: Libbys Libbys Libbys.... you can do better.  The sweet corn is exactly what it says it is.  Its sweet and its corn.  But it seems lacking compared to other canned Libbys corn products.  I think a sweet creamed style would be more fitting.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this to my friends and family, but I wouldn't dissuade them either - more of a neutral stance, and not worth collecting.

review/summary: Fun way to add flavor to food
review/text: I'm just getting into the whole plank cooking thing, and so far I'm really enjoying it. It is a great way to give a mild, woody flavor to fish.<br /><br />These are the thicker planks, which are nicer than the considerably thinner type. The thinner ones are called disposable because they can really only be used once (maybe twice, but don't bet on it).<br /><br />Another fun thing to try is grilling papers. They are really thin slices of wood that you wrap completely around the fish. It holds the moisture in and gives more of a steamed effect.<br /><br />This same company also makes square planks that are intended to be served on individual plates for serving after cooking.

review/summary: Cedar grilling planks
review/text: I wanted to try a new way to cook meat and add more flavor to pork. I purchased a set of the cedar grilling planks, a small charcoal grill, pork chops, and accessories.  I cooked the porkchops on the drilling planks as well as in a pan. I wanted a true taste test. I am completely amazed at how.easy it was and how great it made the pork chops taste.<br />I soaked the planks for a couple hours in water.  Fixed the charcoal as per directions on the bag. When the grill was ready, I put the plank on the grill for a few minutes till it sizzled and put my chops on it. Closed the grill and continued with the rest of my cooking.  Just in case the plank started to burn, I had a spray bottle ready.  So easy. And they are reusable till there is no more wood to cook on. Then they can be put in with the charcoal.  I plan to cook veggies on them next. I am hooked.  The planks add an amazing flavor.

review/summary: Great flavor, highly recommended
review/text: I really enjoy these planks, especially for vegetables.  I cook everything from beets, carrots, broccolli, green beans, squash, you name it.  They really impart a terrific but subtle smoke flavor.<br /><br />By the way, I have more than 20 uses on the smaller planks because I use indirect heat.  They will start to burn if over the flame, but if you use indirect heat and you soak the planks in water for at least and hour you should be able to use over and over.<br /><br />These are a must have.

review/summary: Yes, it is a CLONE of your fave donut shop java
review/text: This coffee, packed in the new VUE format for Keurig Vue machines, is absolutely a clone of coffee you can buy at (ahem) certain donut shops that are found all over the US. Which shop? Well, if you are in New England, you call those ubiquitous shops by a nickname that rhymes with "BUNKIES."<br /><br />The VUE cup is a #5 plastic sieve-like cup, with an insert of coffee filter, well packed with your favorite blend of coffee for the Keurig and topped with the foil seal. It pops into the Keurig Vue, and you have a choice of regular or strong on the touch screen. After you are finished brewing, you can remove the VUE cup and pull off the foil. The coffee and filter pull out as a unit (if you don't tear or puncture it) and you can recycle the #5 plastic cup if your local recycling takes them. The foil sometimes wants to tear and spill coffee all over, so if you are doing this at your office, do it over a waste paper basket. I would compost the coffee and filter, except that the foil is not compostable and not easily removable; I suppose after it cooled, I could do a very messy job of pulling away the foil and dumping the grounds into my compost bucket. Beware if you are trying to dispose of this right after you brew; it is a bit warm on the finger. I didn't burn myself, but it wasn't exactly pleasant, either.<br /><br />BACK to the coffee, how did it taste? I gave it a good lashing of evaporated milk and some sugar and by George, it tasted exactly like light ("regular" to you New Englanders) donut shop coffee. I tried some black before I adulterated it and it was a bit woody and bitter. It's a medium roast, no burnt taste and a medium dark amber color, not the greenish-black dense color of say, a Sumatra.<br /><br />If you choose 6 oz rather than standard 80z, you get a brew that is rather like European coffee (German, to be specific.) I set it on "6oz" and "strong" and I had a cup that was very similar to Tschibo, Eduscho, Jacob Kroenung, or Dallmayr, all typical German coffees. Rather good, in fact. Not aromatic, but very smooth and stood up to a few Tbs of evaporated milk and just a touch of sugar. This is a somewhat sweet blend, so it seems to reject more than a little sugar, unless you love sugary-sweet coffee. I assume there is a good amount of Central American coffee in this blend as the Germans favor Guatemalan.<br /><br />If you have a Keurig VUE and you like donut shop coffee, this is surprisingly exact. I believe it is one of the most popular blends sold by Keurig coffee cup makers, and I can see why. It's not the coffee I prefer (my absolute fave is Papua New Guinea) but it's absolutely spot-on if that's your preferred java. I knocked off a star, not for the taste, which is absolutely as advertised, but for the cups, which are frankly a pain to accomplish the vaunted recycling and which are pretty pricey compared to the current K-cups. However, they say landfills are seeing an onslaught of those white cups, so ultimately, recycling Keurig cups is a good thing in my opinion. I just find it a bit messy to do it and worry if, in a busy office, the chance of grounds all over the counter is going to discourage the very act the cups are trying to achieve.

review/summary: Had two bad batches.
review/text: Knowing I'd save a lot of money buying these chocolates online, I instantly went to Amazon to see if they sold it.<br /><br />The first time I ordered Rochers from Amazon, it was during summer.  When they arrived, the Rochers were all melted with chocolate dropping out of the foil wrappers. After throwing them in the freezer for a day to let them harden, the foil had been mixed into the chocolate..I either had to break off all the hazelnut chocolate, or eat the Rocher with bits of foil in it.<br /><br />The second time I purchased them for Valentine's Day.  The package looked fine..but when I bit into the first one, it was very stale tasting.  The inside fudge was crumbling apart, and the wafer was real flexible, like what happens to an ice cream cone after a few minutes of dripping ice cream has been absorbed into it.<br /><br />Even if the price is cheaper online, these two bad experiences have made me stay away from buying any food product online.

review/summary: Yummy and convenient
review/text: I first bought the Cherry Pistacio from Meijer and really liked it but when I went back for more they were sold out of that flavor. I then tried the Berry and the Apple and liked those too. I went to two other stores but haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I was happy to find them at Amazon and ordered a dozen in each flavor including the Peach.  I do have to say that at least for me, the cooking directions need tweaking.  I add more water and increase the microwave time or it doesn't seem to be cooked enough and is too thick. Having said that, I think they taste great.  They're not mushy and have lots of texture, not to mention the convenience of having it all in it's own bowl.  Great to take to work since I'm always on the run. It's true that the price is a bit more from Amazon but at least I can find it when I run out so I'm okay with that.

I tried to demonstrate this in the video. If it's still available, clip the coupon.<br /><br />Update 09/21/12: As of 09/21/12, my local grocery store sells the Real Medleys for $1.79 a piece. I just tried Apple Walnut. Apple Walnut tastes like a hot apple pie from McDonalds. Peach Almond tastes VERY delicious as well. I'd still rather have them shipped to my door with free shipping (Amazon Prime) paying no tax and getting a free sample snack bar. Please always check to see if a coupon is available. Recently, there was a $4.00 clip this coupon. It's a shame you can't use the coupon multiple times for one big shipment. Finally, the expiration dates from Amazon are better than the grocery store. I have a month old shipment with an expiration of 01/13 from Amazon, while a local grocery store has the expiration dates mostly in late 2012.

review/text: Ordered all 4 flavors, so far my favorites are the peach almond and apple walnut. The cherry pistachio is a bit sweet but still just as good. I love the fruit in it, because its real fruit not the fake kind that is in traditional fruity oatmeal. I also like its the perfect size to fill up on. The food here in Afghanistan is not up to par come breakfast time so I ordered these to help make better choices over sausage and donuts for a young woman trying to watch her health/weight. They are a bit pricey, I can only hope they are cheaper on the shelves, but once again I was just thankful they ship them to Afghanistan. Will definitely be buying more once I run low.

review/summary: I love sweets but this is too sweet for breakfast
review/text: I saw the Quaker Real Medleys at my grocery store for about 2.50 a container.  I loved the thought of pistachio and cherry in an oatmeal.  When I made the product, I found it to be robust on sweetness, skimpy on cherries, and fairly generous with the almonds.  The overall sensation was that this product was really nothing to cry home about.  The flavor was fine but the brown sugar and sweetened cherries yield something that is a bit too sweet for me to turn to again as a breakfast option, especially at the current price point.  I hated that the manufacturer used a plastic 7 container.  Plastic 7 containers - unlike plastic 1 and plastic 2 - are not easily recycled.  I'll stick with Dr. McDougall oatmeal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFRU3U">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Peach, Raspberry, Oatmeal & Barley, 3-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTM8">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Cranberry Oatmeal, 3.1-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />Note: This product has milk derivatives and is therefore not vegan.

review/text: It is as close as cooking it from scratch. Everyone at work has asked me about. Once I add very hot water to it, it makes the room smell as if it was being cooked on the stove top. It almost smells like out of the oven apple pie. I would suggest that you fill it up with very hot  water all the way to the top. Being careful of course not to burn yourself. I usually place it first on a saucer, so I can carry it that way. If you fill it to the line, it is very thick. By filling it all the way to the top, it makes it taste like it was freshly made and just thick enough but not thick as glue, like it would be if you only fill it to the line. Also, I like to leave it covered with the lid that comes with it for about 5-7 minutes and then enjoy it. I would definitely buy again. I do recommend it.

review/summary: Would not buy again
review/text: I love oatmeal and I usually eat the Archer Farms organic brand from Target. Thought I'd give these a go, but it was nasty. I couldn't make myself choke down the whole carton. This was the second flavor I tried -- the first was the Cherry Pistachio, which was even worse and gave me a stomach ache for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I thought the ingredients sounded promising: WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, MULTI GRAIN BLEND (WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, ROLLED BARLEY, WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED RYE), DRIED SWEETENED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR), DRIED SWEETENED CRANBERRIES (CRANBERRIES, SUGAR), WALNUTS COATED WITH ROSEMARY EXTRACT, BROWN SUGAR, DEHYDRATED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR, FRUCTOSE, CINNAMON, MALIC ACID, SODIUM SULFITE FOR COLOR RETENTION), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED WHEAT, SALT, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />Part of the problem, for me, was that they're just too sweet. But part of the problem was also that they had a "weird" aftertaste. Kind of metallic and "off." I don't know how else to describe it. Something that doesn't taste like oatmeal or fruit or nuts. Maybe it's from the "natural flavors"?<br /><br />Of course, individual experiences will vary from mine. But I think I'll stick with the old-fashioned way. It's a lot cheaper and healthier to just make regular oatmeal and add your own "flavors" -- fruit, nuts, maple syrup, whatever -- and it won't leave a bunch of little cartons to recycle or go in the landfill.

review/text: They have sugar and probably artificial whatever, they're not organic, blah blah blah. They're tasty and super convenient (I have them delivered to my office via subscribe and save; doesn't get much more convenient than that). That is what I was looking for, and that is what these are. They have big fruit pieces and crunchy nuts and... oaty oats. I think the apple is the best flavor, though the peach was pretty good and the berry quite acceptable (if a bit tart). Haven't tried the cherry because I don't like cherries.<br /><br />I do recommend using more water than to-the-line; I fill it to a good centimeter or so (it's kinda imprecise) above the line, and let it sit awhile to absorb.
