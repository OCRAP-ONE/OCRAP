review/summary: Very very tasty snack
review/text: Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected.

review/summary: Delicious, healthier snack alternative!
review/text: I love Smart Fries and plan to order a bunch more for the start of school. They are great as a lunch box snack for my kids. My mom, who has Type 2 diabetes, can have a reasonable size portion as a snack without doing wacky things to her blood sugar, even. And I can have a late-night, TV-watching, salty-crunchy-yummy snack without feeling guilty. Can't beat that! They are very tasty and so light that the single portion bags actually give you A LOT.

review/summary: Best, Healthy and Low-Fat Alternative for Cheetos Puffs!!
review/text: I purchased the variety pack and have been able to try out all the flavors. This Vintage Cheddar variety is one of my faves. If you're a Cheetos Puffs fan and want to cut back on calories and fat, this is the product for you.<br /><br />The texture in both are similar -- light and airy. So is the taste. Of course, it's not an exact match, but nothing else on the market this low in fat content comes close. (And I've tried several alternatives.)<br /><br />To compare nutritional info on a 1-oz. bag, Cheetos Puffs contains 160 calories compared to Gourmet Basics' 110. As for fat grams, Cheetos Puffs has 9 grams and 1 gram saturated versus GB's 2 grams of fat and 0 saturated. On the flip side, the sodium content on the GB is higher at 340mg compared to Cheetos' 250mg. Carb count is also higher in the GB at 22 grams as compared to Cheetos' 16.<br /><br />I'm sold on this product and my next order will be for a carton of this flavor alone.

review/text: The smart fries are really tasty!  I ordered the 6 flavor variety pack.  While I did enjoy all of the flavors, my two favorites had to be the Jalapeno Trio and the Honey Mustard and Onion.<br /><br />I will be ordering these again, but I will pick and choose the flavors I like best.<br /><br />These make a great potato chip alternative.  I've also tried the popchips and I do prefer these.  the serving size is actually very large!  When I saw the size of the bag I figured it had to be all air, or that there were multiple servings in the bag.  Nope!  Granted it is 110 calories vs the popchip's 100 calories.  But honestly, I get way more satisfaction out of these.

review/text: After being on a very strict diet for over two years, the same foods, day in and day out, become repetitious, and it becomes very difficult to maintain the will-power to continue.  However, Smart Fries are an excellent product that offers a bit of a variety to a healthful diet.  As another customer wrote, I, too, was skeptical of purchasing this product, but, at 110 calories per bag, I was very impressed and have become a loyal customer after the first try.  Additionally, I find that I can not eat an entire bag.  My fiancee and I shared a bag of the Smart Fries, and I had some left over for another meal.  A great product for those looking for healthy alternatives, while maintaining a great taste.

review/summary: Folks these delicious snacks are 3 POINTS on the New Weight Watchers Points plan!!!
review/text: I purchased a bag at a local gourmet deli in NYC because they had about 1/3 the calories of all the kettle fried chips.  First, I was shocked that there was only 1 serving in the bag (even though the measurement says 1 once the bag is bigger than you think).  After calculating the points I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I almost felt guilty for having soo much to crunch on (there are a lot of these fries in that there bag).  I must reiterate 1 bag (1 oz) is 3 points!!! This is major.  The flavor is great and you will not feel hungry.  I am ordering a bunch of these right away.

review/summary: Good for Low Cal Snack
review/text: I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they are so light and airy but they are filling and only 110 calories, 2grams fat, 1g fiber. A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet.

review/summary: love love but take out some salt please!
review/text: I was so excited about receiving these and wow the crunch and flavor is great! 1 ounce for only 110 calories is awesome. At the bottom of the bags though I found a lot of salt so I re-checked the nutritional info and found one bag has 11% of daily intake of salt! That is just too much for me with my BP issues etc. The pop chips are yummy too and only have 6% daily salt.. for a little less than one ounce and the pop tortilla chips are also 6% per 1 oz. bag. With the great taste of the fries you just don't need all that salt anyhow! So to people not worried about their salt intake ( everything else is very healthy) go for it.. but for people like me just be a bit cautious. This was to be my newest best healthy snack but guess I will have to enjoy sparingly and keep on looking. My score would def. been a 5 if not for the extra, in my view, unnecessary salt. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Large portion for 110 calories.
review/text: I purchased the 1.1 oz.-24 bag variety pack.  I actually didn't care for 2 of the 6 flavors though I realize this is just personal preference.  I thought the other flavors were tasty.  You get a lot of snack for the calorie content.  I think they are very comparable to PopChips but you get a much bigger portion(1.1 oz. of Smart Fries for 110 cal vs. popchips - 100cal for 0.8 oz.). I like PopChips but I'd rather be able to have more snack for the same calories. The Honey Mustard & BBQ flavors are delicious & were my favorite.  If you're a chip addict like I am, this is a good deal.  It was a big enough serving to satisfy my craving without completely blowing my daily calorie intake.  I will definately purchase again.

review/text: Looking at the shape of this snack you will think you are eating Cheetos. But rest easy there's no grease here. This is the perfect snack if you're trying to diet. There should be something fun if you're fighting the calories, and this was perfect! For 110 calories, you get 65 smart fries, and I actually felt full after eating a bag. They're light and crispy and very flavorful. Here's what I thought about the flavors:<br /><br />Honey Mustard and Onion: My fav by far! I can taste the honey dijon and the sweet onions. Delicious!<br />Vinegar Splash: Lots of vinegar flavor!<br />Honey BBQ: More subtle in flavor, but very tasty.<br />Vintage Cheddar: Classic Cheese Curl flavor, light and salty.<br />Sea Salt: allows the potato flavor to shine through. Yum!<br />Jalapeno Trio: I liked this one the least, if I'm going to eat a flavor like this I would want something greasy with it, which would defeat the purpose of a healthy snack!

They have a strong tart vinegar flavor with a touch of salt.  The acid of vinegar may pair well with the bland or complement something less intense.

review/summary: Smart Fries taste great!
review/text: I purchased these for my kids. I am always purchasing alternatives for chips (that they love so much) and I stumbled upon these. I ordered the variety pack so the kids could experience different flavors and they were so happy when they ate them. I usually purchase Pop chips and Pop corners, but I thought these would be a fun change for my kids and I was right. After they each tried their own bag, they immediately told me how much they liked them and almost everyday during the Christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack. They have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and I have not heard any objections yet. I tried the sea salt, cheddar and salt and vinegar varieties and enjoyed the flavors of each. If you like Pop chips, then chances are you will like these too. Although the seasoning on the fries are not as intense as the flavoring on Pop chips, I still think these are an enjoyable snack for kids and adults.

review/text: If you're ever in the mood to just munch on something and not have it kill you in calories, this is it.<br />It has crunch and a little salt. Looking at other reviews, it IS a lot like eating air, but again,<br />for those of us who can't afford to eat a bag of chips, this is the best substitute. You're not going to<br />eat one and be like - WOW. This is the best snack I've ever had. BUT, it's the  best when you're looking to find something crunchy that you can eat while watching a movie. It works for me so well, that when my local BJ's stopped carrying them (which is a sign I know), I had to go directly to the vendor to find where I can get them. Now I have to buy at Trader Joe's and they're much more money now. Still - they work for me like nothing else.<br />I must add I only like the Sea Salt. I've only tried one other flavor and didn't like it. If anyone finds out where I can buy the huge economy sized bag that BJ's used to sell, PLEASE tell me! It's a great deal! I wish they didn't stop selling it...

I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly. I'm happy with the price too so I think I"ll stick with these.

The best part was the nutrition stats: only 110 calories, 1.5 fat, and 2 fiber per ounce (which is a much larger portion than expected and very satisfying). The original flavor is very good, but could use a touch more salt. The jalapeno is also really tasty: a little sweet, a little smoky, and just a little spicy.

review/text: I love Smart fries so they get 5 stars. However this pack is not the best mix of the flavors. It good if you don't know what you like and want to try 1-2 bags of each different flavor. However, if you know you like certain flavors and are looking for a bunch of them you should just buy the seperate flavor packs.<br /><br />The flavor of the smart fries themselves are amazing. I have been using these as a subsitute for eating other salty or sweet snacks. The whoel bag is only a little over 100 calories and if you swap them out for the right cravings they are going to save you a junk load of calories.<br /><br />The price here is alot better then local stores that I have seen. At my work cafe they have these for about 2 dollars a bag. So anything under 1.50 would have been great but under a dollar a bag that's just awesome. I am planning on stocking up on some of the 1 flavor packs for a long road trip since these are an excellent "snacking food" when your not starving but want to munch :).

If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.

review/summary: Potato Styrofoam Tubes...
review/text: These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless "potato sticks" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the "sea salt" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual "fry"<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better.

I would say they will pair with almost any kind of hearty sandwich or make a filling snack.  Yummy!

I gave them to my grandkids and they LOVED them!!<br />I was VERY surprised when I opened a bag and saw how many were in a 1 oz serving! WOW!!! Not like your typical lo-cal/lo-fat snack chip where you get about 10 chips and you're done. I love the texture and everything about these fries. I'm already trying to decide what flavor/flavors to reorder. This is definitely on the top of my snack list.<br />My only suggestion is if a little bit more salt could be added to the Classic Sea Salt flavor. They didn't have quite the flavor punch I was expecting but they were still very good. I think a bit more salt would make them PERFECT!!<br />I'm so glad I came across these fries and I'll definitely spread the word to friends and family.

review/summary: It's okay, but not delicious.
review/text: I made one of these cakes this afternoon.<br /><br />I saw another review that said that the cooking time was too long, so I was careful to check on the cake early, to be sure that I didn't overcook it.  For my cake, the recommended time seemed to be just right.<br /><br />I also made the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUWET4">Dr Oetker Organics Organic Chocolate Icing Mix (12x11.3 OZ)</a> to frost the cake with.<br /><br />To be honest, I was pretty unimpressed with the cake.  Even though I'm sure it was not overcooked, this cake is very dry.  To me it tastes a lot like a store-bought pre-made cake.  Even though I just made it a few hours ago, because it is dry it tastes a little stale, like a cake that is a few days old.  Or a store-bought cake.  The Dr. Oetker icing makes it somewhat better, but you have to be sure to get icing with every bite.<br /><br />It also has kind of an interesting chocolate flavor.  I think maybe the chocolate used is not from a very high quality cacao; I attended a chocolate-tasting class once, and we learned that lower-quality cacao beans are deliberately burned in processing to mask the poor quality of the chocolate.  I kind of smell and taste the burnt-cacao flavor in this cake; most people just identify that smell and taste as regular chocolate because Hersheys and other cheap chocolates all have that flavor.  Of course, just because we're purchasing an organic product does not mean that the manufacturer selects high quality cacao beans, and surely organic cacao comes in all different grades just like conventional cacao beans.  So, that is what it is.  It isn't the end of the world.  The flavor is not very rich or complex, though.<br /><br />I will say something about the mix that did impress me: it is not totally homogeneous.  Usually if you purchase a cake mix that's just a conventional one, the powder is very finely ground, and it all looks really uniform.  With this cake mix, when you pour it out of the bag, you can see the little sugar crystals, and I did like that, because it made it seem more like "real food".<br /><br />Honestly, if you can just mix up a homemade cake, you'll be happier with the result of that than you will with this.  If you desperately want the convenience of a cake mix, this product is okay, but not amazing.

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

Hummus is something I make once or twice a week, so good tahini is essential.  The batches I have made with the Roland brand have not been very good. (Not inedible, just not very tasty.)  It has a more bland taste, less nutty tasting and the texture of the hummus made with it isn't blending creamy or smooth like it should be.  I have yet to open the second jar, but I cancelled the auto-ship so I won't receive any more "less than satisfactory" tahini.
