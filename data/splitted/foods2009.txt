review/summary: Kitties love them, and fewer messes to clean-up!
review/text: I didn't have very high expectations for these treats when I first bought them - we were just out of their other treats and I thought I'd give these a shot. Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

I have tried other flavors of the Temptations with her and her internal system rejects them.<br />So thank you and a meow from her.<br /><br />Susan

review/text: I ordered these Whiskas Dentabites for an 8-month old kitten we adopted.  The cat was in good health, but his breath was a little stinky.  One bag of these treats plus a carefully balanced diet was it took to clear up that breath.  I ordered the 12-pack and plan to re-order when we run low.

review/text: My cat loves these treats.  Her name is Precious and this is one of her favorite treats.  I did not buy mine from Amazon but got them from Walmart instead.  She has tried some of the other flavors of Whiskas Temptations as well and loves those as well.  She always gobbles these down real quick.  I am thinking about trying her on the tuna flavor next since she loves tuna so much.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

review/text: Crunchy addiction<br /><br />I treat my cats to 8 different Temptations flavors, and they love them all.  I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats; they don't seem to chew them long enough to taste them.  But they insist on two or three each time they come in the house, I'm sure it's a form of addiction.  I'm buying these on the "Subscribe & Save" program, which save money and time compared to buying them locally.<br /><br />Cats love these things!

review/text: We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need. Well, you'd never know it! They seem to always be hungry, day or night. What goes? I don't want to feed them again and get them to looking like Garfield. So, I got these Whiskas Temptations cat treats and I give them a few every now and them. Boy, do they go fast. The treats barely hit the dish and they're gone! Well, I notice they're only 2 calories per treat so they can't be doing much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day, so I can go through a bag of these pretty quick. For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them.

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/text: We have two cats and one has very long hair and of course after cleaning themselves they get hairballs. We tried several hairball control treats and these are the one our cats seem to prefer. I purchase one case every six months,giving the long hair cat 10 each day and the short hair cat 5 each day, and they do help to control the frequency of the barfing. They always arrive quickly and we will continue to purchase them from amazon. The long hair cat likes them sooo much he greets me each morning and bugs me until he get his whiskas.

review/summary: best. tuna. EVER.
review/text: This brand will spoil you for all other tunas. Period.<br /><br />First of all, when you open a can of American Tuna, Dorothy, I can assure you, you are not in Kansas anymore. It's a sashimi grade tuna steak, not crumbles, pieces or flakes. It's from one piece of fish, not Charlie D'Tuna and 49 of his fishy friends. You CAN'T squish the can lid down to where there's about a quarter of the height left as with other tunas; in fact when you open the lid you'll probably do as I do and drink the broth. All Omega 3s baby!!!<br /><br />If you compare how little product you actually get out of a "regular" can of tuna and one of these, there is probably about 2.5 to 3 times as much tuna in a can of American Tuna. Relatively speaking then, it's not really any more expensive. What it *IS* is totally worth the extra cost, on EVERY level. 42 grams of protein in every can. Hand filleted, hand packed, caught and canned in USA.<br /><br />more things to love about American Tuna:<br /><br />Real fishermen, real families, sustainable fishing practices. Plus excellent customer service provided by the real families that catch the fish. I actually spoke with one of the fishermen's wives after calling for more information about the mercury testing. I could not have been more impressed.<br /><br />Pole caught fish means I don't worry about mercury levels; they do independent tests for that too just in case. You can ask for copies of the testing.<br /><br />Tastes better than any other brand of tuna I've ever had. Folks that say it's dry maybe have not read the part where it's not meant to be drained.<br /><br />This salt free version is the one I use in recipes which helps me control the flavors a little better. There are also salted, jalapeno, and garlic versions too.<br /><br />Once you open a can though, there is no going back. You'll be spoiled rotten for anything else. You've been warned.

review/summary: Just all right!
review/text: After hearing so much about this produced-in-America canned tuna which was placed high in one of the tuna tasting tests, I wanted to try it before I would commit to buying 6 of it from Amazon.  Therefore I spent $ 4.99 plus tax for one can of this tuna from the local Whole Foods.  I also saw two different types of Wild Planet canned tuna there but passed both because they were all processed and packed in Vietnam.  Well, this can of American Tuna was 6 oz. comparing with most other canned tuna which was usually 3.75 oz.  Therefore, it was enough for both my wife and me after she turned it into a tuna salad for us to make sandwiches.  Its texture was just a little bit too tough for my taste and it tasted just like tuna.  Now, it did taste closer to chicken than other tunas I had tried.  I am just not sure it is really worth $ 5 a can.  I guess I have to continue my quest for the "perfect gourmet tuna".

review/text: I bought both this tuna, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB8AZC">Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Skipjack Light Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> at the local grocery. Normally, I like a olive-oil pack tuna, like Cento, but I want to eat less Mercury, also be less disruptive to ocean ecosystems. Waters off the NW U.S. tend to be lower mercury than other oceans. The American tuna claims to be pole caught, which *is* sustainable. But skipjack is a faster growing fish, and the current population is sustainable.<br /><br />Regarding taste, the American Tuna was a dense and slightly dry hunk of fish surrounded by some fish juice and oil. The consistency was a little like canned salmon. It tasted ok from the can, but once mixed into a salad with chickpeas, it was a little too catfood-like.<br /><br />If you are in the market for sustainable + lower mercury tuna, I think the Wild Planet Skipjack tastes better.

His favorite coffee house is Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, but they aren't as convenient as Starbucks and he now has a professional set up at home to make his own.<br /><br />Before this product, my husband used Hershey's dark chocolate powder. I actually bought the sugar-free vanilla for myself to recreate a sugar-free, chai-tea latte. Husband was skeptical because it was sugar-free, but tried it and loved it, so I bought him this sugar-free chocolate to replace the Hershey's.<br /><br />Please be advised, my husband found the best results with his mocha by adding both this sugar-free chocolate mix and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QGODTO">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Vanilla Powder, 16-ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a> mixed into hot milk.

review/summary: It's just coffee creamer.
review/text: I bought this product based on the favorable reviews.  I wish I had read the ingredients list first.<br /><br />It is just coffee creamer; nonfat dry milk, sodium caseinate, etc.  Cocoa is so far down the ingredient list that it appears after "dipotassium phosphate" and silicon dioxide (aka beach sand), used as an anti-caking agent.<br /><br />So ... this is basically an unnecessarily complex and expensive way to buy coffee creamer.  As creamer it tastes fine, but it is not "chocolate" anywhere but in the advertising copywriter's mind.

review/summary: Yummy Strong Malt Chocolate Flavor, Pricey tho
review/text: Kosher. High quality no-added-sugar excellent chocolate powder. The aluminum cans it comes in are liable not to hold up to mailing all that well, but there's also a plastic bag around them, so it's not a huge deal straightening it all out after arrival. The powder is gourmet, really delicious & goes a long way, and has a unique malty chocolate flavor that 99% of chocolate lovers should love. Pricey, yes, but if this is for you, IT IS REALLY A TREAT. (I use it as a secondary flavor additive 1/2 & 1/2 with cheaper "Frappaccino" mixes for blended coffee drinks at home, and it is indespensable. Only minus one star- for "pricey".

review/summary: Extra Smooth and hard to find
review/text: Having picked this up on a whim a few years ago, I am now worried about it's future.  The smoothness is perfect for this coffee-addict with GERD.  This is the only coffee that lets me drink more than one cup.  My husband, a Starbucks fan, is now a convert.  We've put the fantastic coffee maker we got for our wedding in storage and only get it out when the friend who bought it comes to stay with us.  The smooth flavor and the convenience of instant has limited any other coffee purchases.  It is now unavailable within 50 miles of St. Louis, MO.  We drove to the only store remotely close that Nestle said carried it and they were out, with no plans to reorder.  Hopefully, the internet orders will be enough to sustain this.  There is no mention of Mountain Blend on Nestle's corporate website or the Nescafe website.  That is worrisome.

review/text: This has been my go-to coffee for decades. Yes, decades. I love the smooth, mellow taste. Many instant coffees have a chemical, bitter taste to them, this one does not. It goes perfectly with cream and sugar - especially hazelnut or French vanilla flavored creamers.<br /><br />It is becoming harder to find in my area. In fact, only one grocery store close to me carries it and it is more expensive than what's listed here on Amazon.<br /><br />Yum!

I ordered 2 and got 2 packs of 3.  This is very disappointing and really upsetting.  I don't plan to return them since in the end it will just cost me more to fix it one way or the other.  The coffee at the price I paid for 3 is still about the same as I pay locally and I ordered online because I can't find it locally.  But the mis-representation has left me a little bitter.  Ironic since the coffee is so smooth.

review/summary: Best instant coffee ever!
review/text: I have been using Mountain Blend for several years.  I do not like very strong, bold coffees (like Starbucks).  I also do not like many of the instant coffees available in most stores because of the bitter taste.  Mountain Blend eliminates both of these problems.  It is flavorful, but mild, and has the smoothest taste - never bitter!  I love this product but have been informed by King Soopers that the product is no longer available and they can't order it.  I hope this is not true, but I have been unable to find it on the shelf anywhere.  I hope you will forward this on to the Mountain Blend company and encourage them to continue producing this exceptionally good product.  If Amazon will continue to carry it, I will certainly order it from you.

review/summary: B L E N D.....O F......W H A T....... ?_?_?_?_?_?_?
review/text: When I first bought Nestle (Nescafe) Mountain Blend Coffee, (with the extra smooth taste), several years ago, I thought that the "blend" in the name referred to several different types of mountain-grown coffee.  Silly me!  The "blend" herein is instant coffee mixed with another, NON-COFFEE ingrediewnt!  It's been several years since I bought this coffee, and I'm not near a supermarket, so I can't give you the name of the other ingredient....but I do remember it started with an "M". It's an OK additive for instant coffee, I guess....but when a customer, (at least, THIS customer), comes across a coffee which calls itself "Mountain-Blend Coffee", with an "extra-smooth taste", one would expect the "extra smooth taste" to come from the COFFEE BLEND.  But no such "blend of coffees" here.  Nope.  Just coffee, (I suspect only one type), and the for-now mysterious "M" ingredient, (you cn read it, in small letters, on the label of every jar of this coffee....in the supermarket, that is.  (There is, as of this date, NO mention of this extra ingredient here on Amazon.)<br /><br />Of course, it's possible that NOW, there really IS a blend of several different coffees in this "Mountain Blend Coffee."  It's been several years since I was SO disappointed, that I haven't spent the time or energy looking for this particular instant coffee in the supermarket for at least fuur years.  However, the ingredients are NOT listed here on Amazon, (be they several types of coffee OR just the one coffee with the non-coffee "smoothing" ingredien), so one does not know.  However, the label STILL proclaims how "smooth" this coffee is, so I suspect it's the same one I hurriedly bought without looking at he label, several years ago.  My advice:  Look At The Label.  Of thi coffee....of every coffee, and of everything else you buy, in the supermarkt or out of it.<br /><br />Nestles makes the excellent "Taster's Choice" Coffee line.  EVERY one of these coffees is totally superb.  And every one of them is also 100% coffee.  If you really want a "coffee blend", do what I do -- mix the various Taster's Choice Coffees, (and Maxwell House Instant, and any other intant ccffees you happen to have around the house, togther.  Place in a large cannister, (usually used for flower or sugar), and shake or stir.  THAT is a blend of ALL COFFEE!<br />100%.  I sadly suspect that Nestle's "Mountain-Blend" coffee, is still NOT a coffee blend, nor is it 100% coffee.  Go the supermarket, check the label, and see!  :(

review/text: I ordered a bottle of this hot sauce  to try after the company started following me on twitter.  Straight out of the bottle, the heat hits you first followed by a nice curry flavor.  There is no sweetness or saltiness to this product--it's just straight up flavor.<br /><br />When added to scrambled egg, some of the curry flavor  did come through and complemented the eggs very nicely.  And  the heat is not overpowering at all. Very nice.<br /><br />I also used some in a butterscotch pudding, which turned out to be one of the best puddings I've ever made.  The curry underscored the butterscotch flavor, and there was some nice heat on the back  end.<br /><br />Excellent product; I would definitely buy it again.

review/summary: If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...
review/text: UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue.

review/summary: Delicious -and- satisfying? You got it!
review/text: These are the typical red bags of premium beef-jerky you see at the store, only...you get FOUR of them! These four bags of delicious, mouth-watering beef nuggets are a tasty and healthy snack, and I don't feel bad about eating a whole bag throughout the day at my desk.<br /><br />I love all of the varieties Jack Link's has to offer. I've been a die-hard Teriyaki fan myself, so I'm hesitant to sway away from my typical "go-to" bag.<br /><br />If you're looking for a satisfying feel-good snack to take on road trips, sporting events, at your desk, or what-have-you ' you do NOT want to pass this up.

review/text: These are pretty good, but a little overpriced - I would only buy if there was a promotion. Some pieces are deliciously tender and seasoned perfectly, but there usually are more that are too dried out and tough, or overseasoned.

review/summary: Great for snacking or for a small meal!!!
review/text: These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones. I agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as I bet these would taste even better warmed up!  I bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when I get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs.  These would be great for someone doing a low-carb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body.  One bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar.  Bottom line is this... if you love hot wings and can't get enough give these a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: I just tried these recently and I can't get enough of them now.  They don't have the texture of buffalo chicken wings, it's more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizza...just chunks of plain old chicken smothered in hot sauce.  Haven't tried it yet, but they seem like they'd be REALLY good warmed up or tossed on a pizza before it goes into the oven.<br /><br />They seem to be a bit more expensive than other Jack Link stuff, but so worth it.

review/text: I wanted to get some jerky and since I like buffalo wings I tried these. The problem is there is way too much salt, it's disgustingly salty, way more than normal jerky. I can barely eat it. If you eat a 3.25 oz package of these you will have eaten 1840mg of sodium, instant high blood pressure.

review/text: Little morsels of moist, pure beef that taste like high quality roast.  I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.<br /><br />Lean, good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises.  My only criticism is they must cook these in crack cocaine, because I'm absolutely addicted to them.

review/summary: Wouldn't buy it again
review/text: I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.

review/text: I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.

review/text: Flamin' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites. The meat is tender, and the taste (based on the ones I've bought) are extreme with flavor. The only problem with jerky is the salt, and these have a ton of it. I wouldn't consume more then one bag a day, but it's your choice and body. I'll definitely be buying more in the future though, because these are delicious.

review/summary: Mildly Spicy
review/text: I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.

review/summary: Awesome "Hot Wing" supplement
review/text: Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!<br /><br />I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even brought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought "buffalo" flavors don't accomplish that.<br /><br />As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.  I do have to say these are impossible to find in WI though, so luckily amazon has them, and at a good price for a pack of 8 bags!

review/summary: dark meat
review/text: All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)
