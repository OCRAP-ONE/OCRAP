review/summary: Great treats!
review/text: My vet recommended these for my overweight Scottie.  He loves them and they have helped him lose 4 lbs. compared to the grocery store treats that are loaded with chemicals and just kept making him gain.  He never seems to tire of them and I only give him one or two twice a day.  The vet charges more for these so I am glad Amazon sells them through EntirelyPets.  Their delivery speed is outstanding and I have never been disappointed.  My lab/pit mix dog loves them too but he's a skinny boy so he doesn't need them.  He would say, "delicious!"

review/text: My dog loves these.  Our vet originally was giving them to him and we bought a bag from the vet for $6.  The price for a pack of 10 comes out to like $1.60 a bag, what a deal!  Plus being lean treats, we don't have to be quite as concerned about our pup's weight and we can still give him some nice treats.

review/summary: My English Bulldog puppy loves them
review/text: The size of one treat is about 1cm x 1cm x 1/2cm. Which I think is a bit too much for medium-sized breeds. However the treats can be easily split into small peaces. They are like modeling clay, you can split them into small peaces and put them back into one big chunk. Tried them myself, smell good, but nothing special, don't know why the dogs love them :).

They are very well loved by both our dogs. We occassionally purchase other treats for them, but we buy this stuff by the case (not easy to find at pet stores). I can only judge the product by how our dogs relate to them; they go CRAZY for them.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was delicious -- the lemon added a freshness that you don't normally expect from popcorn, and the sea salt was just right.<br /><br />The oil and spice pouches are generous -- in fact, we popped extra plain popcorn that we had at home to use the leftover oil and lemon/sea salt. All in all, a great product, and I'm looking forward to ordering more.

review/text: I enjoy popcorn and I do like the convenience of microwave popcorn but not all of the chemicals that are associated with it.  I was looking for something that had fewer chemicals but still had good flavor.  Quinn Lemon and Sea Salt popcorn is wonderful.  The popcorn is popped dry in the bag and they you add the oil packet and seasoning packet so if you want less oil or less salt you can control that.  I was amazed at how lemony it was, which was a nice change from plain.  The popcorn was nice and crispy and popped well.

review/text: The meyer lemon & sea salt is delicious and the packaging is adorable. The popcorn popped well in my microwave though the bag is a little tough to open cleanly. I remove a full tablespoon of oil from the packet before adding it to the popcorn. This saves a lot of fat and calories and the popcorn is still delicious.<br /><br />My only complaint: the nutrition facts (like a lot of microwave popcorn) take an advanced degree in calculus to understand because they're based on UNpopped popcorn and the popped calculations are based on cups intead of ounces. Who eats popcorn unpopped?

review/summary: Excellent for Baking!!!
review/text: I have my own wheat grinder and find that baked goods made with freshly ground flour are SUPERIOR to using whole wheat flour from the shelf in any store.  They taste better, rise higher (in bread), and are all-around fresher.<br /><br />These wheat berries were fresh and yummy.  I made everything from whole wheat:<br /><br />waffles, banana bread, muffins, dinner rolls, pizza crust...next to try is homemade bread<br /><br />My husband AND 3 kids under 5 loved everything I made.  (Also sweetened with no sugar, just honey and/or maple syrup.)  The white wheat is much lighter in consistency and even guests would never guess the waffles are whole wheat.  They are much better tasting, in my opinion, than white flour, and have many more nutrients.<br /><br />By the way, the white wheat is still WHOLE wheat, just a different type of wheat!<br /><br />We used the entire 25 pound bag and just ordered our second.  I also ordered 10lb or the hard wheat so I could try mixing them together, since the harder wheat has more protein.  I hope you enjoy it as much as our family does!  :-)

I love Angelinas too. GREAT prices and fast shipper.  Be sure to store your wheat in a cold place-like the freezer--not your garage!.... away from possible mice helping themselves to it....they like it better too!

When I took her to the vet the vet gave me some science diet for allergies (after giving my kitty a shot) and the cat refused to touch it.  After not eating it while in the bowl by itself I mixed it in with deli cat and she ate the deli cat and left the science diet in the bowl.  I order it online now because the local stores stopped carrying it.  I tried another dry food while I was waiting for my first online order and she refused to eat that too.<br /><br />If you are going to order this I would do it from Amazon because it's cheaper to get it here than other places online (Petco...etc).

review/summary: If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash
review/text: Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach "is green and sticks in your teeth" in comparison to the water that "comes in a cool bottle." Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual "special" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids "buying power" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Don't trust #7 plastic for heat-and-eat
review/text: The #7 ("other" ?!) plastic bowl packaging is supposed to make for microwaving convenience. But I could *taste* that plastic whenever I took a forkful from the edge of the bowl.<br /><br />Should I be concerned about ingesting plastic that is of the "other" variety? #7 is often polycarbonate, which is often hardened with BPA, which is under fire. And, of course, #7 has no recycling program.<br /><br />It's hard to know much about the health effects of "other" plastic. Using this container for "heat-and-eat" convenience sits poorly alongside the vigilance involved in choosing organic food! At any rate, the plastic just tastes bad.<br /><br />I'm still happy to have a case of these at my office so I can make a decent hot lunch without planning ahead -- but I now always dump the contents into a real ceramic bowl, put a small plate over it (to provide a non-airtight lid), and zap it for 60 seconds. (Package recommends 90 seconds, but 60 suffices.) I assume the worst health risk of plastic packaging happens with the microwave heating, and I am happy not to be tasting that "other" stuff.<br /><br />Minsley, please give us a #1 or #2 recyclable bowl (or #4 bag, or perhaps a #5 heatable bowl) -- and admit that the convenience is just about vacuum-packing the right quantity of cooked rice with the right moisture for re-heating in a proper container -- and then this will become what it should be.

review/summary: Tastes fine - but best with a topping ...
review/text: I'm always looking for a quicker way to put together dinner.  Thought this would be a good choice -- 1.5 minutes in the microwave, and you have hot rice ready to serve.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br />It comes out kind of sticky and gummy.  Taste is OK, but the texture is a little odd. Definitely not "fluffable."<br /><br />However -- it TASTES great with a saucy topping of some kind.  Sauce (doesn't seem to matter what kind) seems to "loosen" the gumminess, and you end up with individual rice grains.  I've been using it lately to go with my stir-fries, and the sauce seems to cut through the stickiness, leaving a bowl of very nice-tasting rice.  I tried it tonight with a chicken dish and it's great with that, too (3 large chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces; 2 cans of Sauce Arturo; 1/2 C wine; some chopped onion, sliced ripe olives. Mix sauce, pour over chicken chunks and olive slices in a shallow baking dish, cover and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.)<br /><br />I'll be buying this again, for sure.  I prefer to make rice the "old fashioned way," but this is good when I need something in a hurry.

review/text: Love this product!  This is best tasting instant rice out in the market now.  Takes only 90 seconds and your ready to eat.  The one negative that some people have mentioned is that the container is plastic and when you heat the rice in the plastic bowl, the rice does have a plastic taste and smell to it.  An easy way to avoid this is to just remove the rice from the plastic container before heating it.  I usually put the rice in a ceramic bowl then stick it in the microwave.  Problem solved!

review/summary: Really great instant rice bowl
review/text: Pros: organic, fast, convenient, tastes good, relatively inexpensive.<br />Cons: slightly weird texture, plastic taste sometimes, non biodegradable plastic bowl<br /><br />Details:<br />I first ordered this as an alternative to Annie Chun's Sticky rice and am really happy I did so. I find it to be a perfect serving for one person, probably 'cos I am of East Indian origin and rice is a staple for us. It is very convenient and not too expensive either. Especially if you compare it with Annie Chun's sticky rice. It doesn't taste like rice you have made in a rice cooker or in a pot on the stovetop, it tastes like rice made instantly in the microwave. The texture is somewhere between that of sticky rice and regular rice. The only thing I don't like is the plastic bowl it comes in, for two reasons: 1. you can "taste the plastic sometimes, especially at the bottom and the sides. 2. it goes straight into the landfill. It would be great if they replace the plastic bowl with some sort of natural/biodegradable material. That's the reason I took off one star, otherwise it is a pretty good product for the price. If you are getting it this rice, I'd  suggest doing what I do and what some others here have said, dump the contents in a creamic/glass bowl and follow the instructions on the package to microwave.  Bottom line, it is fast, convenient, organic and tastes pretty good. Put it on subscribe and save and get even better value for money.

If you are looking for something that screams "minty," this is not it.<br /><br />The mint flavor is delicate, not heavy or annoying, and, in my view, absolutely perfect.  You can drop these into a thermos and go to work, and whether you leave them seeping for 20 minutes or 10 hours, the tea will be delicious-- not over-seeped or too strong.<br /><br />The bags are indeed foil (foil-lined).  They have a paper coating on the outside, and when you open them you find that the inside of each tea packet is lined completely with foil.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite teas personally, but as the other reviewer said, if you want something with a very heavy mint taste, look elsewhere.

Then, I ignorantly switched her to Purina Puppy Chow before I knew how bad corn is for dogs, the number one ingredient of that awful formula. She didn't really like that, either, thankfully.  Then, I switched her to Large Breed Puppy EVO.  She liked that a bit better, and it didn't have corn.  But, I still had to put a bit of hot water on it and essentially drag her to the bowl.  She did gain weight, though.<br /><br />Then, EUREKA, we found Taste of the Wild.  NO GRAIN!!  All the nutrition she needs - I think she eats better than we do with this stuff.  I guessed that being a bird dog she'd like the Roasted Fowl flavor.  I opened the bag in the store and she wolfed it down like nothing else I'd ever seen.<br /><br />Since then she's eaten the amount of food she's supposed to for her age and weight with no water added or cajoling into into eating.  Granted, she's still not a huge eater, but by the end of the day her allotment is eaten.  Her weight is perfect, and she really does like the food.  I'm glad I don't have to add water so her teeth stay clean - it's nice and crunchy.  Her coat is gorgeous and her muscles rippling (we exercise her a lot).  She's got an amazing physique, and her dry skin/dandruff seems to be markedly reduced.<br /><br />Taste of the Wild is worth every penny, and I believe in my heart that she'll live a longer, healthier life (possibly years longer) for our having found it.  Thank God for Taste of the Wild.  We love her so much and this is the best dog food out there.

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food
review/text: I decided to try this dog food because of many positive reviews I read, and it is a good price for such high-quality ingredients.  This is a better value than many other top-tier dog foods.<br /><br />My dog (a 9-month-old German Shepherd) loves this food.  I transitioned her from the more expensive Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula, and she's doing very well on TOTW after a month.  Her poops are small and easy to clean up.  Her coat is shiny and she has no doggie odor.  She also doesn't scratch much at all.  TOTW is good for allergy-prone dogs because it is grain-free.<br /><br />One benefit of TOTW is that your dog eats less of it per day than other dog foods, thus saving money, because the food is high in protein.  However, it's also rather rich, so be careful when changing to this food to prevent diarrhea.<br /><br />I highly recommend TOTW because it's for all life stages, has proper ingredients for a dog's diet, and is a good value for the price!

review/text: I've been very happy with Taste of the Wild ever since switching my dog to it last winter.  It's grain-free, does not contain unnecessary fillers like some other foods do, and my dog absolutely loves it!  So far, the Wild Fowl seems to be his favorite of the three formulas.

review/text: The package arrived on time. The contents were not damaged.<br /><br />My 3 pups eat Taste of the Wild on a regular basis. We usually get the roasted bison and venison variety, but will try the Roasted Wild Fowl this time. Prices are comparable to my local pet store, but the benefit of having the 30-pound bag delivered to my door is a bonus. As you may already know, this product is grain free, and similar to other grain-free dog foods. There is 32% crude protein.

review/summary: Dogs do not need grains
review/text: Browsing the dog food aisle of the pet store, you see all kinds of labels like "hearty grains" and "delicious oatmeal". But dogs are carnivores. They don't sit down to a bowl of oatmeal on a winter morning. They eat meat. Buy them a meat based diet, they will expel less waste, they'll be fuller for longer and this one is full of super healthy stuff so you don't have to add in yogurt for their coat or berries for their digestion.

review/summary: Too Much Fat...
review/text: Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog. At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it. The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating. Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this. He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog. He did seem to be more "chipper" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat. Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food. I'm not sure I agree with the "good for all life stages" philosophy either. In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels. Much as humans do. Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Excellent grain-free dog food
review/text: We normally feed our dog the Taste of the Wild Hi Prairie Bison formula, but from time to time we like to buy a bag of the Wetlands food to provide him with a little variety in flavor and nutrients.  Our dog loves both flavors and never has an issue switching back and forth (although the Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream formula doesn't agree with him).  We generally like Taste of the Wild because it doesn't cause some allergic reactions that other brands that contain grains caused in our dog, and because it is grain free.  Dogs don't need grain, and because grain free food is more nutrient rich dogs need less volume of the food for the same nutritional benefit.  The great news is that less volume of food converts to less waste.<br /><br />While we will stay with the High Plains version of Taste of the Wild for our Dog's primary food, we will continue to buy a bag of the Wetlands formula occasionally.

review/summary: Something has changed and the food smells terrible
review/text: I've alternated between Canidae and Taste of the Wild for the past year or so with my 4 year old Gordon Setter.  He's always done well on Tast of the Wild, but the last two bags I have received (via Amazon Prime) have smelled absolutely terrible.  While it's possible I could have got a bad bag, it seems unlikely I'd get two bad bags in 6 weeks.  The food did not use to smell like this -- the smell is so awful I'm not going to feed it anymore.  Diamond Dog Food (the company that makes Taste of the Wild and a number of other foods) also seems to have a hard time with recalls ... for as much as I'm spending on dog food I want to feel good about what I'm putting in my dogs bowl.

review/text: I came across this at tractor supply originally and looked it up on dogfoodanalysis.com.  It's rated very well and so I decided to pull the trigger.  The food smells like most kibble.  The pieces are small, so you could feed it to a small dog or a big dog.  My dogs absolutely love it.  Their coats have become so soft since we switched them on this food.  They don't poop a whole lot compared to cheaper foods because there is less filler and more nutrition.  I highly recommend this food as the dogs love the taste, it's good for them and their health and coats have greatly improved since switching them to it.

review/text: This food is wonderful.  My dogs LOVE it.  I feed it to my scotty (23 pounds) and a very energetic mutt (50 pounds).  It's the only food I will buy them, as it is grain free.  They both act more energetic since they began eating it about 7 months ago.  They both also have lost a little weight, and look healthier with better coats since the switch.  Yes, taste of the wild is a little more expensive, but if you can afford it, your dogs will love it.  There are several flavors, try them out and see which ones your dogs like.

Started off with Rx diet food but WOW is that expensive stuff, works great but not for my budget.  Switched to Taste of the Wild Wetlands Formula and he is doing great on it!  Another plus, he is actually gaining weight and keeping it on.  He was emaciated when we adopted him almost a year ago and we could not get him to a decent weight no matter what, now he is looking healthy again!!!  Excellent food for working/sporting dogs IMHO.

review/summary: Bromley's Estate Blend (regular)
review/text: I began purchasing Bromley's Estate Blend Tea at Reny's in Maine after Red Rose went 'flat' on my palate.  The Bromley is labeled "Superior Blend of Fine Black Teas".  Bags are swirl-through (similar to Lipton tea bags).  The flavor of the Bromley is reminiscent of what Red Rose used to be - robust, bright and slightly astringent.  I drink it black but I'm told it stands up to milk well.  Color is a pleasing reddish-brown.  My only complaint is that the bags are packaged for commercial trade (i.e., each bag is individually-wrapped).  Bottomline: It's a great value for the money.  Also available at Ocean State Job Lots.(Note: This review refers to Bromley's Estate Blend Tea which is caffinated.)

review/summary: The only bully stick  worth buying
review/text: I have a lab mix who gets bored really easily. She's fussy with treats and wont touch rawhide. Someone introduced me to these a few years ago and they are great. There are other brands of bully stick I've tried, but she goes through a single one in minutes. None have the staying power of Red Barn. She just loves them and will sit and gnaw on it for what feels like hours..takes a break and then goes back to it. Its great if I need to get something done and want to keep her out of trouble and occupied. I don't even bother with steer sticks anymore because they too have no staying power.<br /><br />I only buy this product if I can find a deal online. At the  local pet store one can easily pay $5-6 or more for a single 12 inch Red Barn stick. I never thought Id say this but I might even go down a size to the 9 inch ones.. then maybe the next time I'm barefoot I'll be spared the pleasure of stepping on a half inch saliva soaked stump!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: The first time I gave these to my son, he gave me a weird face. But then, he couldn't get enough of them! He used to really enjoy the HappyMelts when he was younger but has grown out of them, so I'm delighted they came out with these. I love that they come in individual packs he can handle himself. We also took some of these to a playdate once and all the toddlers gobbled them down! It's so reassuring knowing I'm feeding my son (and his friends) healthy, organic snacks instead of the other unhealthy options you so often see on the shelves.

review/summary: Satisfies our sweet tooth
review/text: We are getting ready for 1st grade over here and I have been looking for some organic snacks to pack for my son for school. We have tried these (and others from this line) and have really liked them! They are very tasty and sweet enough to satisfy our sweet tooth. The caramel and apple combo is a big hit with my son and his friends. I love that they are organic, and as such they do not contain any dyes, GMOs or preservatives. Two big thumbs up from my 6 year old means that these are definitely going on the school lunch list!<br />The backs of the packages have a spot to leave a "happy" note for your child - perfect for our son learning to read. He loves to find notes from me in his lunches!
