review/summary: delicious!
review/text: Madhava Agave Nectar has a suprisingly mild flavor- pleasantly sweet, but not overwhelming.  I purchased the "light" nectar and have found that it is perfect for coffee and tea, hot or cold. It also works well in recipes that call for honey as an ingredient. I have made dressings and dips with it and have been delighted with the results.  Take note, however, that the consistency is a bit thinner than honey, so you may not need to use as much.  I strongly recommend this product, which is delicious and so much healthier than processed sugar products.

review/summary: Agave, natural sweetner is just okay
review/text: I can attest that the product gives an initial taste of being really sweet, but it seems to have a lingering aftertaste to it. It looks like regular honey but is not as dense. If I had nothing else to use, I would be okay with it, but since I have a choice I tend to still use regular sugar sometimes. I have never enjoyed using sugar substitutes.

review/summary: Can't Open
review/text: The package of the product is appealing, until it's ready to use.<br />There has been several methods used to open this product: pulling the nozzle, twisting the nozzle, squeezing the bottle, snipping the nozzle, etc.<br /><br />What is the point of a nozzle that can't be used? Only by opening the entire top can the syrup flow, which produces a sticky residue and doesn't pour to well. How can you open this??

review/summary: Good variety
review/text: This gift basket had a good variety of sweets (truffles, cookies, nuts and fruit mixture, napolitans, chocolate covered raisins, caramels) as well as some savory (cheese spread, crackers, peanuts, almonds), plus a few things that got eaten before I had a chance to note them for this review.  Other than the Sunmaid chocolate covered raisins I was not familiar with the brand names. For example, the most of the sweets were made by Kenzi, of whom I had never heard. Their quality was O.K., but not outstanding (but then again I am very picky  - my son thought it was just fine, but he was probably full from eating the pilfered items). The quantities of each product were the small sizes common to gift baskets. All in all, this is not a basket that will wow a chocolate connoisseur and, again typical of gift baskets, is not a great deal, but it would definately make an appreciated hostess or other gift.

review/summary: Pretty basket with practically nothing in it!
review/text: I got this basket today and it was the biggest waste of money.<br />There were two small truffles, 1.43oz and 1.60oz. 4 thin small biscoffee .85oz, almonds 1oz, peanuts 1oz. Bag of ginger snaps 2.13oz. Chocolate napolitan milk and dark chocolate 6 pieces each at 1oz each. Stoned wheat wafers at 1/2oz. nuts and fruit 1oz, carmels flear de sol 6 pieces, and Italian herb cheese 3.5oz that was overpowering garlic flavored.<br />Basically what you paid for was a basket and cellophane with samples inside.<br />The price was outrageous. DO NOT ORDER THIS BASKET FOR A GIFT, YOU WILL BE EMBARASSING YOURSELF.

review/summary: Looks good, mediocre to decent value
review/text: This was an accidental purchase, but fun to get. This gift basket was visually appealing! When my hubby and I opened the box from Amazon (well packed!) We saw a brown bow and big bold square sticker proclaiming "iG4U" in brown on a red background. We tore off the cellophane right away to find many little white and brown boxes layered one after the another, pretty much the way the photo depicts. Each little box has (only) a few bites of goodies. The middle-sized boxes had a little more, of course. Everything tasted all right, and fresh enough, too. There were truffles, caramels, ginger snaps, and Newman's Own black tea, plus a funny addition of italian herb dip without crackers!The straw stuff was a natural looking material, to my liking, and the basket was unfinished and somewhat lightweight/flimsy but usable with cute brown leatherette handles on the sides. I'd classify this basket as a mediocre/decent value at $16.00, and suitable for casual or supplemental gifting to someone who likes brown and white. Hope this review is helpful, and Happy Gifting!

review/text: I have to say that I read the reviews and thought that it might be an alright basket. Let me tell you after ordering another at the same price and looking at the quality of the product I am pretty disappointed. I should have gone with another choice, any other choice- I am glad I did not ship it TO my friend and have time to find something suitable for her because this would be an insult. Send this to an a co-worker you don't quite know well (if the price is right and you must send something) But if you want them to like you FIND SOMETHING ELSE! The price was right so I thought I would order, a cheep box of raisins in a movie package is the first thing on top. I could have put together a better basket myself.

review/summary: NOT FUNNY!!!!/ UPDATE:  SECOND GIFT BASKET I RECEIVED
review/text: I must admit, I haven't gotten many gift baskets in my time. If this one is any indication of what a gift basket is like, Iam not missing anything!!!!<br /><br />To start with, the gift basket is wrapped in cellophane, with a wide dark brown ribbon, with a sticker that says Back Mountain Gift Baskets.  The basket looks like a generic, cheap looking Easter basket, with two handles, one on each side of the basket.  Iam not sure what they are made of.  Inside where the items are, they are nestled in what looks like straw.<br /><br />Now, on to the items inside.<br /><br />1.  A wrapped box that says Kenzi All Natural Dark Napolitans.  Inside that is a box of Raisinettes.  Inside of that is 6 individual, small, solid dark chocolate, thin, red  wrapped bars, which had a gray tinge to them.<br /><br />2.  Next was a wrapped Chocolate Chip Crispie Marshmallow Bar it said on the package.  Inside was a box of Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard..  Inside that was a rice crispie bar with small chocolate chips.  I took a bite of it.  It was not nearly as good as the rice crispie bars you can make at home.  Not by a longshot!!<br /><br />3.  Next was a box of Venus Stoned Wheat Wafers. Inside were 3 cracker wafers.<br /><br />4.  Next was a Lindt Lindor Truffles Mint Chocolate package.  There were 3 inside, individually wrapped.<br /><br />5.Next was a Belgin Truffles box, with 4 individually wrapped inside.<br /><br />6.  Next was a Italian Herb Cheese Spread Box, 3.5 ounces, in a white plastic container.<br /><br />7.  Next was a box of Caramels Fleur De Sel.  Inside that was a box of Crystal Light Lemonade Box.  Inside that was 5 individually wrapped caramels.<br /><br />8.  Next was a box of Ferrara Milk Chocolate Covered Raisins Box, with grayish what looks like covered raisins.<br /><br />9.  Next was a box that said Milk Chocolate Napolitans.  Inside that was a Royal box of cherry gelatin.  Inside that is 6 individual, thin, small brown wrapped bars.  Like the Dark, Kenzi All Natural Napolitans.  They too had a grayish tinge to them.<br /><br />10.  Next was a box of Cafe Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee Bars. Inside was 4 Coffee Vergano thin, solid packaged bars.  Not sure it it's coffee or not.<br /><br />11 and 12.  Next was a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Oven Roasted Peanuts, and a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Fruit and Nuts.<br /><br />13.  Next was a sachet type box of Ernest Hemingway Highland Select Tea with 4 individually wrapped Ernest Hemingway tea bags.<br /><br />14.  Next was a box that said Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.  Inside was a box that said Stauffer's Original Animal Crackers.  Inside of that was a 2.3 ounce package of Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I didn't see any coffee that I know of, and I definitely did not see any salami as stated in the description that I read.<br /><br />When I asked to receive this basket, by the description it sounded like it would be a United Nations Basket, with items from other countries which intrigued me.  Instead each item was made in the United States.<br /><br />Sadly, I would have much preferred the fake boxes of Jello, Crystal Light, Flan Custard, and Animal Crackers, rather than what the real items was.  At least I recognized the fake boxes, and they would have actually been something I could have used.<br /><br />What I got, most of it I plan to throw away.<br /><br />If in the description it says with a celebration in mind, the joke is on me, or I didn't get the joke, even tho I do have a good sense of humor.<br /><br />The endless unwrapping of each item, I wouldn't have minded if they had been quality items, but when I was finished unwrapping everything I was  just glad it was over!!<br /><br />I don't at this point know what this gift basket will be selling for, but to me, even a dollar would be too much!<br /><br />This basket was more like a gag gift to me.  I didn't find it funny at all!! I definitely would NOT send this to someone else, especially if it were someone I loved, or even liked, unless you are trying to get even with someone, but I couldn't even do that!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am disappointed, to say the least! This just proves to me, that what you see online when you order something, it may not be what you thought at all when you actually do receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />These are my opinions only.  Someone else might enjoy this gift basket. I didn't!  It's cheap looking, the items inside are cheap looking, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did receive another gift basket today. The one that I received today was NOT the same gift basket that I had received when I wrote my original review above.<br /><br />By that I mean the gift basket that I received today was NOT the original one that I got, not the prototype above, but not even the same gift basket that I had received minus the wierdness, tackyness, and about a hundred other words that I could write to give a description of the FIRST nightmare of a gift basket that I had received.<br /><br />The only similarity from the original gift basket and then this second gift basket is that it's the same gift basket, but the one I received today is a darker color.  Everything else about it is the same as the first gift basket I received, the actual basket.<br /><br />There was a note taped to the outside of this gift basket showing that the orginal gift basket I received was a pre-production, prototype, mock-up that was never intended to be released to the general public.  I HOPE NOT!!!<br /><br />It never occured to me that any gift basket I would ever receive would not be the one that anyone else would have received.<br /><br />Obviously this company needs better quality control, because the one I originally received I never would have let it see the light of day, period.<br /><br />I was hoping that the gift basket that I received today would be the one I originally was supposed to receive to see how it really should have been, but the one I got today is an entirely different gift basket all together.<br /><br />The gift basket I received today was one entirely devoted to coffee, period.  It included:<br /><br />1.  A can of Ground Irish Coffee- 1.75 ounces. The brand is Bewley's Of Ireland, but on the back of the can it says Comfort Foods, Inc.  North Andover, MA.  I will be giving this coffee away.  I can't stand anything that is Irish Cream, no matter what it is.<br /><br />2.  3 packets of different ground coffees, each 1.3 ounces, in flavors of Breakfast Blend, Amaretto Royale, and Moca Java, from a company called Arbuckle's.  The city is Verona, PA.  Each packet of coffee is supposed to make about 10 cups of coffee depending on how strong you like it.<br /><br />3. A coffee mug that says a warm mug of Coffee, the best at igourment.com.  Your standard sized mug.  The writing is in a brown color, the mug itself is like an off white/beige color.  I will also be giving this mug away.  It's just not the kind of mug that I use either for coffee or tea.  The mug is ok, for what it is.<br /><br />4.  A small box that says Sugar in the raw, that has 6 packets.  I know I can buy this same brand in any grocery store.<br /><br />4.  A taller box that says Creamer for your coffee.  Inside that box is 10 packets of a generic looking non-dairy creamer.  I will also be giving this away as I don't use powdered creamer at all, but a liquid flavored creamer.<br /><br />5.A taller box that says Coffee Stirrers.  Inside that are 9 wooden coffee stirrers, like a thin popsicle stick. They aren't even plastic coffee stirrers!<br /><br />6.  A roll of King Original Peppermints which I assume is some kind of mints- 1.55 ounces.<br /><br />7.  A box of Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee- 0.83 ounces.  I did receive this same thing in my first gift basket.  They taste like almond cookies.  The box says Product of Italy, but on the back of the box the state shown is PA.  Hardly Italy!<br /><br />8.  Several small packets of biscuit type cookies, to have with coffee.  About 6 of those total.<br /><br />In summary this gift basket was not the tacky, etc one like the first gift basket that I received, but I wouldn't call this one great either.  I wouldn't send this gift basket to anyone I know.  It doesn't look gourmet to me at all.<br /><br />The only things I will be keeping are the packets of coffee, the sugar in the raw, tho as a rule I don't use sugar period, and never in coffee.  I just use flavored liquid creamer in my coffee, and maybe the basket.  The rest I will be giving away.<br /><br />It's really hard to give an update since this second gift basket is not like the first one I received as far as the contents of the basket.<br /><br />I hate to say this, and I will leave it up to anyone who cares to read my review as to if they want to purchase either of these gift baskets or any others from this company, but I  don't like this company, period.<br /><br />They lack any imagination as far as the products/packaging they include in their gift baskets, which if I had to rate the gift baskets based soley on the contents of what was included in either gift basket, I would have to say the first gift basket I received had more variety than this second gift basket did.  I could see what the contents of the first gift basket would have contained, minus all of the wierd packaging that it had, tho some of the products of that one looked old, non-edible.  I threw most of that one away, period.  I didn't even give any of that gift basket away.<br /><br />My real question and my summary of this company is if it's named igourmet, where is the gourmet in their products?  Also, they are supposed to be products that are not from the U.S.A., but once again both gift baskets contained items only from the U.S.A.<br /><br />Most of what they include in their gift baskets, I could find either the same products or higher quality products than theirs in any grocery store.<br /><br />Like I said, it's hard to update a review if the gift baskets are entirely different, how can you compare them to post a review?  All I can do which is what I did in my first review, and that is to state what products were included in this second gift basket, and leave the rest of it up to any potential buyers out there who are considering purchasing a gift basket from this or any other company.<br /><br />I do appreciate getting a second gift basket, which after the first one I was kind of dreading what I would receive in this second gift basket, but this one too does NOT have any wow factor, or quality look to it.<br /><br />To me, especially if it were something like a gift basket it would not only be about the products included, which would be high quality products, but quality packaging too which I enjoy trying products from other companies, perhaps products I had never tried before, but to me it's not only about the items included in the gift basket, but the presentation too matters to me.  It shouldn't show cheap.<br /><br />Also, I don't understand how any company who specializes in gift baskets would include items that you could easily find in any grocery store, but their's is lower quality.<br /><br />How much thought goes into this companies gift baskets?  If I were a company who made gift baskets, I would want it to look like alot of thought went into what they included in their gift basket, from the items they include to their packaging, etc.  It's the total package that matters to me in the end.  I would want my gift baskets to be memorable, thoughtful and enjoyable.  With this company their gift baskets are forgettable, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to rate this second gift basket by how many stars I would give it, I would have to give it a 2, and that is being generous.<br /><br />Sorry, that is just how I see it!

review/text: I ordered these gummies last week for an 'angry birds' themed birthday party and they were a HUGE success with the adults and children alike!! I also had angry birds cupcakes and sushi amongst other themed snacks but the gummies WON HANDS DOWN. I ordered the combo case which is 12 theater boxes and not a single one was left at the end of the party! I also used the boxes for decoration since they are super cute and colorful. I scattered them around the table and the kids took turns cutting out the angry birds characters. I tasted the gummies myself and they taste fabulous like they were made with real fruit juice instead of just artificial flavors. So I definitely recommend this product to everyone since it made my son's birthday party a hit! Oh and make sure you order enough, trust me they don't last long! Hearty Appetite :-)

review/summary: A Ceylonese Blend.
review/text: Although often used as a quasi-blend name (particularly in connection with Indian and Ceylonese teas), "orange pekoe" is in fact a reference to a black tea's grade. Loose leaf black teas come in two basic groups - whole leaf and broken; in addition, there are "fannings" and "dust," the lower-grade remainders usually found in tea bags. Whole leaf tea grades are as follows (top quality within a grade is denoted by adding the number 1):<br /><br />* Orange Pekoe (OP):<br />Long, thin, pointed leaves (larger than FOP, see below), rolled lengthwise and picked when the final buds open into leaf. Rarely contains "tips," i.e. the very ends of the bud's leaves, which constitute a guarantee of quality. Produces a light or pale color. The predominant whole leaf grade in Ceylon and Java.<br /><br />* Pekoe (P) and Flowery Pekoe (FP):<br />Short, fleshier and less refined leaves without tips. Produces a stronger color than OP; found mainly in Ceylon and Southern India, but also in parts of Kenya.<br /><br />* Flowery Orange Pekoe (FOP):<br />Fine, delicate, young leaves with a certain proportion of tips. Second grade tea in Assam, but top grade in most Chinese regions.<br /><br />* Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (GFOP):<br />FOP with "golden" tips (tips of the particularly fine, golden-orange variety).<br /><br />* Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (TGFOP):<br />FOP with many golden tips; the predominant grade in Darjeeling and Assam.<br /><br />* Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (FTGFOP):<br />Outstanding golden-tipped FOP.<br /><br />* Special Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (SFTGFOP):<br />Highest grade FOP with a large share of golden-tipped leaves; very rare.<br /><br />Broken leaf ratings correspond to those for whole leaf teas, i.e.:<br /><br />* Broken Orange Pekoe (BOP):<br />Less refined black leaf tea; the main broken grade in Ceylon, Southern India, Java and China. Produces a rich color and full-bodied taste. BOP1 (sometimes designated FBOPF - Finest Broken Orange Pekoe Flowery) is primarily found in the lower districts of Ceylon's tea-growing areas and consists of approximately 40 % OP and 60 % Pekoe and/or BOP.<br /><br />* Golden Broken Orange Pekoe (GBOP):<br />Less refined broken grade; inhomogeneous leaves, some tips.<br /><br />* Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (FBOP):<br />Less refined broken tea with some tips from Assam, Ceylon, Indonesia, China or Bangladesh.<br /><br />* Tippy Golden Broken Orange Pekoe (TGBOP):<br />Refined broken grade with a substantial number of golden tips.<br /><br />* Golden Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (GFBOP):<br />Top broken grade in Assam and the only tippy broken grade from Kenya.<br /><br />* Tippy Golden Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (TGFBOP):<br />Highest-grade broken leaves in Darjeeling and some parts of Assam. High tip content and uniform leaves.<br /><br />Twinings Orange Pekoe is an invigorating Ceylonese blend with a distinctive flavor: Nothing to splurge on, but a reliable choice for every day.

Ltd. which (as a lucky coincidence would have it) happened to have lots of 2 and 3 to sell at a high price :)  And here we have a famous brand of 'orange pekoe' which might be related to 1. It works for me.

review/summary: bitter
review/text: I was greatly surprised by this, and now am stuck with 6 boxes of tea I can't stand.  ANY other tea is better-even the cheapest in the grocery store.  BTW, true Orange Pekoe tea has no orange flavor- it refers to grading by leaf appearance, and the appearance here is very good, so I am at a loss about the taste.  If I use 1/2 tsp of this with 1/4 c of other loose teas, it ruins the flavor of the whole batch.  I have not been disappointed by Twining's other varieties.  This tastes NOTHING like Ceylon tea.

review/text: Passionfruit by itself isn't as interesting as what the flavor does when mixed with other juices, especially citrus, and a little goes a very long ways. It doesn't go so well with apple juice.<br /><br />One of these small bottles should be enough to add an interesting taste to about 2-4 quarts of citrus-flavored beverage. It may remind you a bit of Hawaiian punch, but you can mix it much less sweet to adult tastes.

review/text: I bought this juice to make a drink my wife and I had while in Bora Bora, French Polynesia. It was called "Tahiti Drink" and the ingredients called for passion fruit amongst other things. The juice was priced very reasonably and arrived quickly and well packaged. The juice itself was delicious. One reviewer stated it was too sweet, I dont believe this to be true at all. It does have some sweetness to it but by no means is it too sweet. It is very refreshing, has a good balance of acidity and sweetness and did the job in recreating the Tahiti drink.

review/summary: Make your own vitamin water-like beverage.
review/text: My favorite brand of vitamin water has been discontinued so I have been on a mission to create a drink of my own. In experimenting, I tried the popular brand of guava concentrate in a can, but it is so full of sugar that I just can't justify using it, even watered down. I decided to find an alternative guava product, and bought this one. It comes in square cardboard containers, which is great for storage and recyling. It's made with cane sugar as opposed to the high fructose muck. It's also inexpensive, compared to the canned nectar. If I have any complaint it's that it isn't sweet enough, but I find adding an artificial sweetener helps with that. Guava has a rich grassy aftertaste, which takes some getting used to -- especially if you're new to the taste. For those who love fresh guava, they will LOVE this product.<br /><br />With all my experimenting, I discovered that I also really like the flavor of passion fruit. If you're interested, here's my beverage recipe:<br /><br />In a 24 ounce glass container, add:<br />1/2 cup guava or passionfruit nectar<br />1 pkg of sweet n low (or whatever you like)<br />2 tbls of Torani syrup (mango or passionfruit, etc.)<br />then fill container with cold water and shake well.<br />Serve over ice.<br />Makes 4 - 5 servings<br /><br />It tastes better than the vitamin water I thought I couldn't live without, it's less expensive, I'm not throwing away all those plastic bottles anymore, AND I can control the amount of sugar, type of artificial sweetener, and the amount of filtered water I use to dilute it.

review/summary: Best Canned Tuna I've Had
review/text: This is an amazing canned tuna. The tuna is line caught and canned in the US. There is only one other canned tuna available today that is both caught and canned in the US and while it's a good product, the taste and texture of the Henry & Lisa's tuna stands alone. Henry & Lisa's tuna is moist and meaty but at the same time flakes nicely. You will be amazed that this tuna is packed without salt or oil. The saltiness from the fish itself adds to the tastiness of the fish without being too salty as much canned tuna is. It's also amazing how much oil there is in the fish itself. It gives this canned tuna a luxurious, silky texture much like really good Pacific King Salmon. I can never go back to oil packed tuna after having this tuna. You may not even want to dress this tuna, just eat it straight from the can. Henry & Lisa's tuna is spendy (not more than really good Italian tunas though I would argue it's even better than those) but I'm willing to pay more for tuna that is this delicious, that is sustainably caught and very importantly, canned in the USA.<br /><br />FWIW, the other tuna caught and canned in the U.S. is American Tuna. American Tuna is the tuna I will use to cook with (pasta and baked tuna) given that it is more modestly priced and also available in a more economical 4 lb. can. For eating on its own or in tuna salads it will be Henry & Lisa's, a remarkable product.

review/text: I know the directions say to measure it out but I've yet to do that I just kinda dump it in the pan with the popping oil and toss a handful of popcorn in and start cranking on the good old whirlypop.  I get tasty caramel popcorn every time, rarely do I get a burned issue but then I'm diligent about cranking the handle so I would guess if I slacked off, I'd have a black stinky mess that would be a pain to clean out of my popcorn popper.  I find it just as good as some stuff I had gotten with the whirlypop in the first place that I can't seem to get anymore.  I find if I dump the popcorn out into the bowl and immediately set my whirlypop in the sink with hot water and a squirt of dawn dishsoap and let is soak for a half hour it wipes out easily.  I've yet to burn anything so I can't say what happens if you scorch the coating to the pan, but its delicious. go buy some. your tummy will thank you.

review/summary: You have to be speedy-quick for this.
review/text: I tried using this coating twice in my big kettle machine.  You have to be speedy-quick to dump it out or it tastes burned. The first batch was ok with just a little burned popcorn that came out at the very end when I dumped the kettle.  So I thought I wouldn't use so many kernals and see if I could dump it out faster.  It ended up with the whole batch tasting burned since there wasn't enough volume to push the popcorn out of the kettle as it popped.  The taste of the non-burned batch was good but I don't know if I'll use it again. It sure takes a knack to know the right timing. I didn't think clean-up was any harder than normal.  I did add a small amount of water to the kettle after popping and let it start to boil and then dumped it into a bucket.  I did this 2-3 times and it got the kettle quite clean.

review/text: The bars arrived from 'Indian Foods' in Houston today.  They are all melted and hardened into lumps!  I know its hot in Houston in the summer but to send out a product like this does not do Amazon's reputation any good at all.  I DO NOT recommend buying this product from Amazon if the supplier cannot supply a decent product. I will attempt to be reimbursed by Amazon for this product.<br /><br />Went back to Amazon who referred me to the seller.  Money refunded with good will and personal recommendation to not buy during hot weather.  Good advice and, since I want my Lion Bars, will reorder when the weather cools.  The supplier seems a very decent and ethical person with whom I'll be doing business in the future..

review/summary: Love those Poppers!
review/text: Several companies now have products called Chicken Poppers.  However, what I like about these is that they aren't at all greasy.  I have to be careful what I give my dogs because one gets Pancreatitis very easily and the other is a little piggy so I have to watch how much he eats.  These are a great size to satisfy without overdoing it.  And they are especially crunchy so the pups really enjoy them.  I'm sure they taste quite good as well, considering how quickly the little popper disappears.

review/text: Well, I noticed these disappeared off the shelves, gradually fewer and fewer stores seemed to have Quaker Old Fashioned White Grits.  So, I did a Google search and it seems only Amazon has these at present and maybe somewhere else but for an exorbitant cost.  I was very happy to find these on Amazon.  There are some other types of grits online (Arrowhead?), but not this brand. Will have to try the other brand if and when Quaker is unavailable.  These are great for breakfast. Perhaps there is a recipe to make the instant grits with the really, full,rich taste as the Old Fashioned. I hope Quaker decides to re-introduce this line.  Once they're gone, they will be sorely missed. I wonder which brand The Waffle House uses?  The other pancake chain seems to use instant and they just taste watery. So, I am thankful for Amazon having these available. I appreciate Quaker Old Fashioned White Grits, and will savor every spoonful, while they last. Also, delivery was fast and efficient.

Quaker won't give me a straight answer, but from the many people nationwide searching for them, I have to believe that they are no longer manufactured.<br /><br />A pity, because Quaker's "Quick Grits", or even worse, "Instant Grits" seem to be the only alternatives widely available, and neither of these products are even a reasonable facsimile of REAL grits.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a way to obtain real grits, I would be very happy to find out how.

review/text: The pill pockets have been improved to make them softer and tackier. This allows me to more easily hide the pills from the cat and to even break a pocket in half to get two minipockets from one original Pocket. The one cat needs only 1/4 a pill each day of one medicine and 1/2 a pill of another so this is helpful. Glad Greenies added more glycerin to the formula. If you are in doubt, try them.

review/summary: Don't follow hype read for more
review/text: I worked in the pet food industry for 13 years as a nutrition specialist my job was to research the market for trends break down nutrition and work in a team to create formulations based on digest ability and work on points of interest for sales teams.<br /><br />I also worked on the sales teams for 6 out of the 13 years In the field as inside sales so I'm well informed on the in and outs of how the industry works, looking at a ingredient label the first 4 ingredients make up 95% of the product while minerals etc are important what is the most important out of every thing else is the protein !<br /><br />Your dog and cat have not evolved over time to digest grain or vegetables so protein is the number one ingredient you are looking for in a food and there are several different types used while a lot of companies try and put a marketing spin on shapes colors and brightly target advertising on vegetables and fruits which are targeted more at the people not the dogs or the cats.<br /><br />Dogs and cats can not break down vegetable protein as well as meat they do no get enough out of it, and despite what common sense tells you do not want a whole protein in a dry food because through the baking process water is removed and you only end up with a faction of the mass it started out as.<br /><br />So in a first ingredient you want a protein meal not counting by products and it is not that by products are bad it's just that they include a lot of bones and cartilage that take away from the actual protein that you are looking for, a protein meal simply means concentrated source of protein with water removed<br /><br />If you have a protein meal in the first ingredient and then say ingredient 3 or 4 is a byproduct meal that is okay because the main source of protein is a more pure source no matter what dry food you get you need a grain as a binder to hold it all together and over the years there has been a huge amount of attention on corn while not all for nothing corn or any grain should never be a main ingredient of the source of the food It is cheaper than rice and not nearly as digestible there are different types used<br /><br />Corn gluten simply means the hard outer shell removed which means its mainly a vegetable protein source with very few minor minerals, which is usually used as a protein filler or binder or both the level on the ingredient list depicts what is it used for in the formulation if it is in the main ingredients the first 4 it's a protein filler to boost protein levels which is essentially adding false readings on the nutritional label usually found in foods high in byproduct meals<br /><br />Ground yellow corn is the most common and has not had the hard outer shell removed which is used as a filler and binder also reduces the digest in the animal<br /><br />Ash you want very low ash content in any food source it will raise the PH balance of the urine causing spots in your yard but most importantly causing urinary tract infections in dogs also but cats are very susceptible to this<br /><br />Any way on to my review of this food this is what I use for my cats it is a reasonably priced food that borders on the good and the bad but more to the good while not the best there is on the market, working in the industry for far to many years i can not bring myself to buy over priced foods when there are decent options out there like this one, like I said I worked in the industry and I know how it works in pet stores you walk in and the "best foods" are closer to the front door and this is not because they are the best those company's buy those spots on the shelf and at the end of the day every single employee has been bought also by the company they work for in that pet store, I used to train those employees in those stores "propaganda" it's not that the company with the big white bag is the best  those veterinarians had there schooling paid for by that company information is so convoluted<br /><br />It's not that corn is bad for your dog or cat it's how it was processed and how it is implemented in the formula. Your bag of food says farm raised chicken well so is foster farms, we only use white meat, what makes that better than dark meat ? Is it the price does it taste better to your dog ? No of course not ... Yogurt ? When it is the 19th ingredient on the list how much do you think is in the bag ?<br />And in the wild how much yogurt did your dog eat ?<br /><br />It's all marketing you can achieve the same effect as yogurt for a upset stomach with oatmeal and it is much cheaper the point in my rant here is to educate and make you think there is a science and once you know it every thing becomes more clear there is no reason to break the bank and don't believe the hype just because they work for a pet store does not mean they are a know all.<br /><br />Have a Great Day !

review/summary: MY CATS GO NATURAL
review/text: I have 4 cats who will eat anything I put in front of them and a few thing I don't. I will buy other brands when they are on sale, so I am able to conduct taste tests with the cats to see if they have a preference. I will say my cats prefer this to "Kit and Kaboodle" and "9 Lives." They like it slightly better than the kidney friendly Walmart brand.<br /><br />My vet recommends this brand, if I am not going to spend the big bucks on Iams or canned food...which they get from time to time. Like another reviewer stated, I too have a cat with a sensitive stomach that likes to decorate with recycled cat food. This brand seems to be best to calm her tummy.<br /><br />I am unsure of these flavors. The well balanced flavors my cats seem to like are: baby bird, vole, grass, lizard, baby squirrel, rhino beetle, and for desert a good lick of cat butt. There's a challenge for someone.<br /><br />In my neighborhood, Wal-mart has the cheapest price about $9.00 a bag.

review/text: Not exactly health food but God this ramen is good! I discovered it while living in Australia a few years back. I was delighted to find it on Amazon as I can't seem to find it any stores here in the States. It's good and super easy to make. So much tastier than the cheap ramen you find in every grocery store.

review/summary: Good stuff...
review/text: I'm a beef jerky, sausage, and all-things-meat junkie. So I figured I'd order some stuff in bulk off the net. These are pretty darn good. The trick is to let them hang in the open air for as long as you can resist eating them. The longer the better. I imagine letting them hang for a really long time (months) would be detrimental, but I never managed to let them hang for more than a week or 2. After the first week or so they hit their stride and are prime for eating.

review/summary: Marvelous sausage
review/text: These people from Bavaria really know how to make this stuff. The Landjagers are super (you have to let them dry for them to develop their full, intended flavor), and it is worth any sausage fan's time to check out their complete offering of German style sausages and hams.  Due to the perishability of some of their products their S&H charges appear outrageous but I guess that sending frozen or refrigerated foods costs money.  Personally, I recommend their coarse grind liverwurst but that is a matter of personal taste.

review/text: This stuff is pretty good.  I used to get the best landjagers from a place in Salt Lake City . . . unfortunetly they have changed their recipe recently; they now taste much like these bavarians.<br /><br />I buy these and stick them in my smoker for several hours to help dry and age the sausages.  Then I like to hang them to dry further.  I'm hooked on these.

review/summary: Amazing taste
review/text: I love these. That is the easiest way to put it. I purchased these because they have always looked so delicious. The only complaint I might have, is that these couldn't last. Everyone in the house ate them right out from under me.<br /><br />I would purchase more, but the one thing that has stopped me from doing so is that the shipping price is quite simply put, outrageous. Maybe the next time I have a bunch of extra cash I'll pick up another batch, and hide them very well.

review/summary: Fantastic product, WAY overpriced, shipping unbelievably expensive.
review/text: I purchased both the regular and peppered Landjager by Bavaria.  Followed the recommendations of other purchasers and immediately unwrapped the product and placed it on a cookie sheet between layers of paper towels in a cool dry space to dry.  Tried some the following day, it was excellent and it improved even more the following day as it continued to dry.  Terrific flavor and consistency, once it dries more will surely be as good as that I ate in Germany hanging in the bars.<br /><br />The cost is another issue, $20.63 per pound plus freight which adds another $6.32 per pound for a total of $26.95 per pound (shipping would have been far more had I only purchased one package) and that's for Postal shipping, not UPS or Fedex.  There was no notice of shipment from Wisconsinmade, so I was informed that it was here with a friendly postcard in my mailbox left by the postman who wouldn't walk up the drive to the house.  So after making a 10 mile round trip to the Post Office the following afternoon after work I had my Landjager.  Please be advised you will pay a dollar amount for shipping that would pay for UPS delivery, but the product is shipped USPS and you'll discover that Wisconsinmade makes a substantial profit on the shipping end as well as their exhorbitant product costs.<br /><br />Again, the Landjager is great !  I just can't afford it.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Landjaeger!
review/text: This landjaeger is the REAL DEAL! I have actually been hunting in Germany (for boar, which was a blast and a TOTALLY different story), and, lo and behold, what did we eat in the field? LANDJAEGER! No lie. The product from Wisconsin made must be made by the cousin of the guy in Germany because it tastes exactly the same, and believe me, both were excellent. I had one little problem with a shipment (and I am POSITIVE that it was an aberration in the shipping process) in that the vacuum seal on the package was not intact. Well, let me tell you, within 12 hours, not 24, TWELVE hours of my feedback on Amazon about it, I had been contacted by a very nice and concerned person @ Wisconsin who was 1. apologetic (how rare is THAT in today's bad customer service world, and 2. Sending me a whole new shipment. This place is the BEST! Get your landjaeger here! I am going to explore what other goodies they have, too. SERVUS!

review/summary: Gluten free, vegan, kosher, and very concentrated.
review/text: O.k., so it's not officially kosher--but this is how you make gelatin without cow's hooves, for those of you who get grossed out by Jell-O if you think about it too much.<br /><br />Now foods is a company that sells gluten-free stuff, and this is no exception:  if you have celiac this won't make you sick.<br /><br />Even better, this is powdered agar agar, not flaked agar agar.  That means this will last for months, if not years--although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes = 1/2 tsp of the powder.  The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1/4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice.<br /><br />However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell-o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell-o--for that, you need Jell-o or kosher gelatin.  (You can add more agar agar to add firmness; but then it starts to taste like what it is:  seaweed.)
