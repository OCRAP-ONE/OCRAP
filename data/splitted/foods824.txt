review/summary: Awful!!
review/text: I am so upset that I didn't read the reviews first before buying this coffee.  I "assumed" all k-cups had coffee grounds inside.  I wondered why the k-cup was so light when I removed it, so I opened it ....and no grounds. This is nothing but instant coffee in disguise.  So much for a good deal on what I thought would be good coffee.  Never again.

review/text: This is actually instant coffe in a k-cup.  I was so irritated that I was sold instant coffee under deceptive practices that I informed Amazon how unhappy I was.  They immediately refunded my money and I threw the coffee out!  Maybe if enough people let Amazon know how unhappy they are they will stop selling this brand.

review/text: When I saw this product on the shelf at Wal-Mart, I instantly tossed it into my cart (both medium and light roast).  I like to have a supply of different coffees on hand.  I immediately made a cup when I got home from the store.  Actually, I love the flavor.  It is easy on the tongue, and leaves the mouth refreshed.  I thought there was something odd about the K-Cup itself, different sound when shaken, and appeared to be empty after use!  I did some quick surgery on the Cup and realized that I have been duped.  While I would still drink this had it been advertised honestly, because it has great flavor, I do not care to reward dishonesty and deceptive advertising.  It seems that rather than conducting any research to find the best combination of flavors, they chose to use word-tricks and lies.  Shame on them!

It is stronger than most American instant coffees and resembles the instant coffee I have tasted while in Italy....however, it is still instant and should be better referenced in the product description.

review/summary: Great price, awful product
review/text: So like a lot of other reviews have said, this product is awful. I bought it due to it's price point, and after trying San Francisco bay (which is pretty decent for the price), I figured why not give another cheap brand of kcup a try? Big mistake! As soon as I opened the box and gave the cup a shake, I could tell something was strange. I brewed it on large setting, and even my keurig didn't like it as it only pushed the smallest settings worth of water through the cup. I took the cup out to see if my keurig was possibly malfunctioning, and realized the cup was empty. I peeled back the foil cover, and saw that there were no grinds, heck, there wasn't even a filter. Instant coffee in a kcup??? It completely defeats the purpose of even having it in a kcup! I have learned my lesson that for the most part you pay for what you get, and I should have spent the extra $4 to get some real kcups (Starbucks, green mountain, caribou etc.).<br />With all that being said, the only reason this product even remotely earns 1 star is that for an instant coffee, the flavors not the worst I've tried, but it's still instant and has that nasty instant taste.

review/text: This product is merely instant coffee in a less than sturdy cup that happens to fit Keurig coffee makers.  The product itself tastes as bad as I remember Sanka tasting in the 80's.  There is no filter in the cup and no grounds left after you run water through it.  The dark roast is bitter, not well-roasted beans bitter, but a little more like tar on a summer day bitter.  If you enjoy coffee enough to use a Keurig, spend a little more and give yourself a real cup of coffee.

review/text: because I never saw the (Instant Coffee) tag in the description. Was it there when I bought it? Not sure. All I know is that anyone who would go through the trouble to get a Keurig coffee machine wouldn't want to drink instant. Yes, the flavor is good for instant coffee, but if I wanted instant, I wouldn't have the machine. There are tiny instant granules in each pod pack, and the hot water runs through and dissolves the granules. Pull out the pod the wrong way and you get a drippy, coffee goo mess on your hands. Yuck!

The coffee tasted even worse than instant in a jar. You could so easily put a table of instant coffee in hot water and get the same thing. I probably should read the box more carefully, but on the box it said "instant & microground coffee". There's no ground coffee whatsoever. Avoid this, and if you love instant coffee flavor, get a jar, it will be cheaper. I felt cheated.

I emailed the company and a rep called me back and explained that the pods are light as this is a new brew process.  I decided to try them and they are actually pretty good.  My daughter really likes them to make iced coffee.  They are strong and richly flavored.  I prefer other bold pods to these, though.  Buy them if you like espresso, really strong coffee, or want to brew over ice.

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: Stay away from the Grove Square products. I ordered this because I'd been so happy with the Amazon Subscribe and Save service in the past and these were the only K-cups available at the time I placed the order.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for making this the only brand available! These are not "true" K-cups with the filter inside, etc. They are basically instant coffee sealed in the K-cup packaging.<br /><br />Many times when you put them in the machine, the cup doesn't fill all the way. I estimate I didn't get a full cup out of 15-20 of the K-cups and had to start the process over with a new K-cup, wasting a lot of time and money.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee is also bad, and has the exact taste you'd expect from instant coffee. Ick.<br /><br />To sum up, save yourself some time and money. If you want instant coffee flavor and lots of hassle, these are for you. If not, get another brand of "real" K-cups.

review/summary: It tastes like what it is: instant coffee
review/text: Like many of you, I'm tired of paying big bucks for K-cups and when I saw this product on my grocer's shelf, I just had to give it a try. How bad could it be? Well, it tastes just like what it is: a spoonful of instant coffee in a plastic cup that kinda-sorta works in a Keurig coffee machine. It's not the most vile thing I've ever tasted, and I'm going to finish the box I purchased, but I won't be buying it again. Besides, even if I liked the flavor of this product, it would be more economical to buy a jar of instant and use the Keurig to dispense hot water.

review/summary: Don't bother, unless you actually like instant coffee
review/text: What would have been a 1 Star review, is now a 3 Star review only because Amazon and/or the manufacturer have corrected several information listing problems. When I purchased these K-cups at the beginning of January 2011 there were no reviews and in the Product Name or Product Features it did NOT say Instant Coffee.  Because we do have an abundance of K-cups in our pantry it took over a month before I tried these out. I didn't even need to drink it to know that something wasn't right.  The weight and sound of the K-cup was the first tip off, then watching the brewing of it and finally the taste - Yuck! Now if you like instant coffee then you will probably like these, BUT you could save money by buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee</a>, adding a spoonful to your cup and then brewing just hot water through your Keurig. Either way I won't be purchasing any more, but it wasn't a total waste as my daughter did like them and has used them up.

review/text: So I ordered this stuff fairly quickly and I thought that the "Instant Coffee" on the label was just a marketing thing as all K-cups brew instantly right... BIG MISTAKE!<br />This is actual freeze-dried, Instant coffee there is no filter no coffee smell and the taste is pitiful.<br />The packaging is exactly like the other Keurig K-cup "real" coffees, but what a huge disappointment...<br />It wasn't even significantly cheaper than any a good Timothy coffee..<br />In my opinion Instant coffee should not be allowed into a K-cup, I got my Keurig to replace my Auto-Drip coffee maker not my tea-kettle!<br />I also strongly believe this Grove Square nonsense is just a trick to dump cheap instant coffee on the unsuspecting Keurig owner, What a rip off!

Like me, he thought it was "the ususl" K-Cup and was very surprised when he brewed a cup and discovered it was not. Now he's stuck with 47 "imposter" K-Cups that he doesn't like. We both really wish this product had been advertised in such a fashion that would have made it obvious that it was instant coffee. I would never have purchased it had I realized what it was.

review/summary: A Sad Excuse For Instant Coffee
review/text: I am sorry, but this was not ground coffee.  Amazon should clearly identify that this is mostly instant coffee.  Knowing that, when you compare it to other instant coffee products that are available this stuff is at or near the bottom of the flavor quality you expect from instant. So... that means it is cheaper to get yourself a cup of hot water from you coffee brewer, then add your favorite instant coffee.  There are two additional benefits of using your own favorite instant coffee - your cup of Joe will taste better and you will not have to clean your coffee brewer as this stuff leaves a residue in the brewer.

review/text: It is beyond me why anyone owning a keurig coffee brewer would want instant coffee.<br />I usually read all reviews (unfortunately I did not have time that day and did not want to<br />miss this "friday special.)"  This is the way it was marketed to buyers on Amazon-<br />"Grove Square (TM) Single Cup Coffee - Dark Roast - 24 ct Box".  I find this deceptive and unfair<br />to unsuspecting customers.  This is instant coffee.  If you go onto Amazon, it now 2/22 it states on some<br />of the grove square products that it is instant coffee.  I use my keurig for making<br />tea and hot chocolate and have even bought the chai cups.  Don't buy it is worse than<br />any instant coffee I have ever tasted and amazon will not let you return!  It does not<br />deserve the 1 rating I had to give it to get this to post!  Thank you and I hope this is helpful.

review/summary: "Soluble and microground coffee with natural flavors"
review/text: This is basically the same technology as Starbucks VIA (whether it tastes better or worse is your call - I don't like VIA; this stuff is OK but not great.)  It's essentially freeze-dried instant coffee (that's the "soluble" part) mixed with ultrafine coffee powder to give it more body... and to leave that little extra dust in the bottom of your cup and grit between your teeth.<br /><br />The actual box does tell you - but you won't figure it out from the listing here on Amazon unless you read the reviews, so I'm pretty irritated.  It's a decent price for real coffee, but it's actually pretty damn expensive for instant.<br /><br />Now, as for what really matters: flavor.  It's actually not terrible; it reminds me of Douwe Egberts toddy coffee - full body and a fairly rich, mild flavor.<br /><br />The medium roast Grove Square is better than the Dark, IMO, and the Dark is a lot grittier in your mouth.<br /><br />Would not have bought this stuff if the listing had been up-front; will not buy again.

review/summary: Micro Grind
review/text: Just had my first cup of this coffee.  It is strong, just how I like it, and has a nice aroma.  Because this is micro-ground it comes through the brewer much faster than the regular K-Cups.  I am not a coffee snob but do enjoy a good strong cup in the morning to get my motor running, this fits the bill just fine.  The price makes it a deal breaker, I just ordered more to add to my collection of different varieties of coffee.  I am well satisfied and hope you will be too.<br />____UPDATE from my original review.  After using this for several weeks, I will have to agree that this is not up to snuff with regular K-Cups---I don't think it's as bad as some think but is not as good as the regular ground coffee.  Some people drink instant coffee and have no problem with it and others just don't like it.  This will wake you up in the morning, but does lack the flavor of the regular ground varieties.

I pressed the small cup of coffee button on the machine and four ounces of coffee came out.

review/summary: Tasteless Tea
review/text: I am so sorry I purchased a 24-pack of this tea for my new Keurig. It is absolutely tasteless. Celestial Seasoning's Sleepytime Tea is far superior in every way. Before I switched to Keurig, I used STASH Camomile, and it was great. This one is tepid and tasteless. I am never going to order any Bigelow product for my Keurig. It's too expensive to waste. Right now I use the Sleepytime and put an "Espresso" shot of the Bigelow Camomile in to use up the 24-pack. If you love Camomile, don't buy this one.

review/summary: Acai Matcha by RedLeafTea carries more protein than eggs!
review/text: I hate eggs. I developed this aversion to them because my mother used to make me drink them raw when I was a kid. I felt more punished than healed and nothing in the world can make me eat an egg, no matter how well it is cooked. One problem, though, their protein source is excellent. I need the protein but not the egg. My online search finally bore fruit the other day when I came upon Acai matcha tea. This fine tasting tea has more protein than eggs. Hurray! What a relief...

review/text: Was shocked at the skinny size of this item!! They are five inches long as I expected, because that's the size I wanted and ordered, but can't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that's a BIG stretch!! WOW, I'm sure disappointed considering the cost ~~ $7 and shipping. Won't be ordering these again.<br />  Of course my dog likes them ok, but wouldn't call them her fav by any means. :(  Will I send them back? Don't know if it's worth the hassle at this point. But I will NOT recommend them either. Because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from!  Keep looking is my advice. :)<br />  The other Beefeaters' products I ordered well met my standards. This one was a DUD!!  What's the old saying?  Buyer beware?  I fell into that trap big time!<br />  Here's the product link at this time:<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176AIDU">Beefeaters Great Fillin Porkhide Rolls with Meaty Chicken Filling, 5-Inch</a><br /><br />  Wish you luck if you try this product...but again "Buyer Beware!!"<br /><br />UPDATE 2.15.2012: My little dog got VERY SICK not too long after I wrote this review...I contacted Cust. Service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money!! How's that for Customer Care?? :) Great!! Thank you Amazon.com ~~ you are TERRIFIC!!

No, it's not for drinking. But powdered milk has never been for drinking, it's for preople who need to drive 30 miles to a grocery and need to cook a dinner party at the last minute.  I love this stuff, better biscuits and life easier.<br /><br />Keeping kitchen inventory up can be tough with perishables. This is a great idea.

review/summary: Not like store bought
review/text: I bought this buttermilk at the same time I bought Bob's Non-Fat Dry Milk. They both came in the same box in a few days. I don't use buttermilk other than for cooking, but it seems you have to make a trip to the store if you need some, or plan ahead. It tastes reasonably close to the store-bought variety, but is not that thick oozy stuff that comes from the store. So far I have used it to marinate chicken and it seems to work great, and augment or replace regular milk in other recipes. Seem fine. The plan is it check it out as a scratch mix substitute for store bought box mixes and dressings, but first I have to use up the store box mixes and dressing. The four bags from Amazon may last quite a while, but according to Bob's shelf life specifications, it should be fine.

review/summary: Excruciatingly good.
review/text: It's sooooooooooooo good.  I love it.  When I've finished a bottle, I have to remind myself to stop at the bottom of the bottle, because the plastic does not taste good.  It tastes like plastic.  And after you eat the plastic, you usually get down to the countertop.  We have a cheap formica countertop and it tastes horrible.  And beneath that is a particle board-type substance that is very dry.  And it swells too.  So when you get to the bottom of the bottle, where the sauce stops, stop and open a new bottle, then begin eating again.  I'm currently working on a helmet that would hold 2 bottles (minimum) and dispense the crimson yumminess at my mere thought that some Sriracha might be nice.  But it's ruined several T.V. remotes so far in testing.  I know what you're thinking, but it takes weeks to get the smell out of your truck.  So, for now, I'll continue my work, and most folks should just stick to normal containers.

review/text: I love this stuff!  I put it on just about every thing I eat.  It's the perfect amount of heat, but not over-powering.  My only complaint is the packaging.  Of the 12 bottle in my order, 2 had been busted open and went everywhere (this stuff turns in to concrete when it dries so it was quite a task to clean the remaining 10 bottles).<br /><br />I realize that this may be more of a complaint better directed to the shipper (i.e. UPS), but as the customer, I feel this is Amazon's battle to wage.  On that topic; I submitted this information to Amazon, along with a couple photos of the mess, but they never even responded with a confirmation, let alone offered a partial refund.  I'm not sure why Amazon even bothers to offer a way to submit satisfaction issues if they just ignore it.<br /><br />Regardless, still a great product...I might suggest you just buy it at your local grocery store instead of purchasing it here since there's no guarantee you'll get every thing you paid for from Amazon.
