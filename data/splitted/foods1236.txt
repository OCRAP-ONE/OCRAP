review/summary: Dessert in the AM
review/text: I have the Creme Brulee flavor of this Melita coffee.  It brews a great cup, I did not taste any bitterness in the flavors.  I tend to use slightly less than the recommended amount when I brew a cup of java.  I make my coffee with french vanilla creamer, and the creme brulee mixed with the creamer made my cup of coffee extra sweet.  It was like dessert which I loved but may not be the preference for everyone.

review/summary: Excellent aroma and taste
review/text: I've had this coffee a few times, both on ice and hot.  It has a great aroma, and tastes very good - not too sweet, but the hazelnut flavor is definitely there.  My coffee purist roommate didn't like it, but he doesn't like any flavored coffee.  You can't go wrong with this coffee.

review/summary: Very Good, but at what price?
review/text: This is really a good coffee, but perhaps not for a true connaisseur.  Nonethless, this is quite good:  it is very smooth, and has a good flavor of hazelnuts.  It is not smooth enough to make truly strong; it starts to get a bit bitter.  If you are an afficionado of coffee houses, this may not be for you, but if you will settle for higher-end grocery store coffee, this is a good pick.  The package is 11 ounces so the price per pound is 42% higher than per package.  Still, at this price, not a bad buy.

review/summary: Very mild, enjoyable flavor
review/text: I've tried a lot of coffee in my life. I'm not a huge fan of plain, black coffee so I generally stick with flavored varieties. Hazelnut can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes the hazelnut flavor can be so subtle you'd almost forget it's flavored coffee. Other times, the flavoring hits you over the head and tastes like you're chewing on a nut instead of drinking coffee.<br /><br />This coffee is a wonderful balance. You can definitely taste the hazelnut, but you can also taste the creme brulee, which mellows it out nicely. It has the perfect mix of nuttiness and sweetness with the bite of coffee in there too.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this coffee and will definitely buy it again in the future.

review/summary: My husband LOVES this coffee
review/text: We've tried and loved other flavored coffees, but were a little worried that the Melitta version would not be very good because it costs so much less.<br /><br />We were pleasantly surprised, the coffee itself is a very smooth and rich blend, and my husband (who loves hazelnut creamer) is absolutely enamored of this Creme Brulee Hazelnut flavor. I'm not a fan of nutty-flavored  coffee, so it's not my favorite, but I can't wait to try some of the other Melitta versions, like the Vanilla Bean.

review/summary: bitter sour
review/text: I mostly enjoy bold and extra taste coffees. Among the flavored ones, I like hazelnut flavored ones better. So I expected something really good from melitta's hazelnut flavored. I have never tried one before, but I knew they make good coffees and the prices are not that cheap either.<br />However, the taste of my first brew was not that great. It was too strong, bitter  and sour. I thought I might put too much coffee, although I knew I put right amount of coffee for my daily ritual. So I tried second time with less coffee and same amount of water. It still had this very sour after-taste with less bitterness. Finally, I tried putting more water with less coffee and now the taste was too watery. However, there was still strong sour taste left behind in my mouth. Since I am not a coffee expert, so to speak, I could not figure out what made this coffee so sour. I even checked the expiration date, but  it was still valid.<br />After all, it took little bit of time to get used to this extra ordinary taste, yet it was not too pleasant coffee experience for me. Maybe it can be better with sugar and creme, but unfortunately, I enjoy black, nothing added coffees.

review/text: Different strokes for different folks.  I am not a certified coffee sommelier so I can only give you my average "joe" opinion.<br /><br />For my coffees I happen to like slightly bitter, slightly sweet coffees with a hint of nut so this one was in my wheelhouse.  I found this cup of joe to my liking with slight bitterness and subtle hints of hazelnut and caramel while not being too overpowering in any one area.  I would buy this coffee again.  Minus one star for being bit higher on price side.

review/summary: Wife loved it but the jury is still out for me.
review/text: I know that people today are looking for unique and different flavors for everything they ingest.  Because I am not against trying new things, I am willing to try most.  So, when I found this coffee, I thought, what the heck.  I made it 2 ways.  First, I made a hot version which with a little cream and sugar, made for an okay cup of coffee.  Secondly, I made it as an iced coffee which, when prepared the same way, I found to be a little better than the hot.  My wife, who only drinks flavored everything, liked it a lot and said she would like to get more of this.  So, while I liked the flavor, to me, nothing beats good old fashioned "coffee flavored coffee."

review/text: This coffee tastes great!  The hazelnut is subtle, which I liked and the creme brulee taste was a really nice addition.  I made it two ways: one was with my 12 cup drip coffee maker and the other was with a 6 cup french press.  The taste was consistent both ways.  The coffee was smooth and never bitter.  I will definitely get this coffee again.

review/summary: For those who like a sweeter cup of java
review/text: I am pretty hard core when it comees to my morning cup of coffee.  A Starbucks addict, I grind my own, and prefer the more robust blends.  No cream, no sugar, just black bold coffee.  So, it was a step out of my comfort zone to try the Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.<br />The coffee comes packaged in a foil vacuum sealed bag.  Smells delicious when you can finally get it open.  The grind is perfect for my French press, and would also work well with a coffeemaker.  I use the "usual" amount of coffee for brewing and the result is a smooth, if rather sweet, cup of delicious coffee.<br />Flavor:  I can't speak to whether it tastes like real hazelnuts or creme brulee from a fine restaurant, but it definitely has the scent and flavor of other "hazelnut" flavored coffees.  I did not find the flavoring to be overpowering, and thought it enhanced the coffee nicely.<br />Acidity:  A very smooth cup of coffee, which no bitterness, and no heartburn.<br />Use:  This is a little too much for me for my morning cup of coffee.  When I'm not awake, I'm looking for my standard Starbucks.  But later in the morning, or sometimes in the afternoon, this is the perfect cup of coffee.<br />It is possible to "subscribe" to this coffee, and Amazon will kindly deliver it to you on a regular basis.<br />For those of you who like a lighter, flavored coffee, you will probably love this.  You may be able to skip your coffee additives and drink it black.  While it won't replace my regular morning brew, it has definitely found its place in my house.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, a tad pricey
review/text: My wife and I tried Melitta Cafe's Hazelnut Creme Brulee with three different coffee machines, even had it iced once, and the results were pretty consistent across the board: A rich coffee with *hints* of hazelnut rather than an overpowering flavor, ideal for a quiet weekend morning.<br /><br />That the flavoring didn't dominate the coffee was a welcome change from flavored coffees that seem intent on telling you, "WE'RE FLAVORED." No need to throw it in the drinker's face. Here, the flavoring is a small enhancement, tempering the coffee's natural bitterness (most noticeable here in the aftertaste) and adding complexity to the aroma. It's very nice.<br /><br />For those who enjoy their coffee iced, this was especially good prepared that way. Over the course of a large cup I tried it just on ice, then with sugar, then with sugar and cream. Very tasty in all three variations.<br /><br />Recommended for those who'd like a flavored coffee without being hit over the head with artificial-tasting flavors. Maybe a few bucks more than you'd normally spend, but worth it for a change of pace.

review/summary: Good coffee but takes trial-and-error re: amount to use.
review/text: I brought this coffee up to my parents' cabin on a vacation and we all drank it for about a week. No one in my family is really a coffee connoisseur (including myself), so I can't really speak to the complications of the flavor or anything like that.<br /><br />We did all think it was good coffee, the hazelnut flavor was clearly present but not overpowering, and it wasn't too sweetsy as some flavored coffees can be.<br /><br />Downsides are the proportions of coffee / water seem to be a little different than the plain ol' coffee my parents normally use. I couldn't tell if it was too strong or too weak, but something tasted a little different to me (I mean besides the hazelnut flavor). I think this coffee might require slightly more to be added to the maker before brewing to bring out the hazelnut flavor as opposed to the amount you'd add for normal coffee.<br /><br />This coffee tastes good w/ cream and sugar, if you're into it, or black, as I prefer. One thing I'd caution against is mixing it with those flavored 'Coffee Mate' creamers. My mom and sister were doing that and had some pretty nasty cups (Pumpkin Spice and Caramel were nasty to me). Best off drinking this stuff black or with normal cream/sugar. Probably obvious to everyone else, but some people in my family are addicted to Coffee Mate.<br /><br />Anyway, that's it. I'm no coffee snob but do think this is good coffee, with a nice hazelnut flavor. A little pricey compared to the good sales I can get on coffee at my local grocery store, but worth a shot if you're interested.

review/summary: Nice Coffee, Not so nice package
review/text: I tried this coffee with a bit of trepidation. I'm not a fan of hazelnut. I've always found the flavor to be a bit overwhelming which is odd because I really like hazelnuts. Not so here. This was a very tasty hazelnut. The smell was subtle and not at all over-powering. The flavor was nice, nutty without getting into oily & nasty. The coffee in the package is a nice dark color. It's very finely ground so should work well in capacino machines. It brewed up very nicely in our french press and our drip coffee machine. I really enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />The bag on the other hand, I struggled for quite a while to get it open and finally just had to cut the top off. Which made it more than bit difficult to use for later storage. I understand that to retain the freshness, sealing the bag is very important, but in order for me to consume the product, opening the bag is equally important. And since I may be under the assumption that I can continue to store the coffe in the bag, like other brands, making it so I have to partially destroy the bag in order to open it seems slightly counter-intuitive.<br /><br />Anyway, great coffee, not so great packaging. If you get it, make plans for alternate storage.

review/summary: Good coffee, but needs a bit of cream
review/text: Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the "two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended "two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial "pure" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the "department-store" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />"Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love."<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review. This coffee is much improved with the addition of cream. However, I got a very noticable hazlenut flavor from the coffee.

review/text: The packaging looked like the usual pull open coffee bag but was very tightly glued closed. I had to use scissors to open it then put the whole bag in a zip lock bag. This is a pretty good coffee, it makes a nice morning brew. The caramel and hazelnut flavor is  rather subtle but it grew on me. This is not as aromatic as some  flavored coffees. The coffee brews up quite strong and has a bit of a bitter edge at full strength  which one does expect from Creme Brulee flavored products. Though it was  not ecstatically wonderful it was a satisfactory everyday coffee which we enjoyed throughout our coffee drinking day.

review/text: I had never tried this particular brand of coffee before and I must say, I was impressed.  To be honest, most times I don't go for the flavored coffees;  to me they tend to be a little too artificial tasting or overly powerful in aroma and weak on taste.  While this coffee is not for my everyday morning, this was a great treat to have after dinner.  I liked that it was smooth, flavorful, and not overwhelming.  It even replaced any ideas I had had about having a dessert or a snack because it was so fufilling.  My husband even wanted to try some after the smell of the coffee lingered into the living room, and he is not a coffee drinker at all.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know and I already have.

review/text: I think I have a new coffee!  This coffee brews up perfectly each and every time. It's not bitter, but exceptionally smooth, flavorful and honestly, has now become my morning coffee.  If you're not overly fond of hazelnut, don't worry about it in this coffee.  You can hardly note it's presence with the creme brulee, it just acts more of an enhancer than anything else.  I honestly hate hazelnut anything and was quite wary of trying this coffee. Am I ever glad that I did!  I can't wait until it's done brewing every morning, if that gives you some idea!  It's not overpowering, just a very rich, flavorful, smooth way to start the day or even finish with an after dinner drink.  I take mine black and even those friends who don't, love this coffee black.  The true test of the flavor of an excellent coffee.  Highly highly recommend!

review/text: Actually a 3.5.<br /><br />As others have said the bag was quite impossible to open. I gave up and had to cut the top of the bag which makes the little wire reclose hinges useless. So that was annoying.<br /><br />The coffee smells wonderful in the bag & when it starts brewing, it smells even better. So great smell all around.<br /><br />The flavor has hints of nut, but not necessarily Hazlenut. We didn't get any creme brulee, but the flavor is fine.<br /><br />For the price (6$ a bag) it's about the same as a good bag of flavored coffee from our local grocery. Were this there, I would buy it for this price. Comprable to "Eight O'Clock" or Dunkin Donuts. Give it a try.

review/summary: "It's all right, I guess. Nothing I would rush out to buy."
review/text: I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.<br />~T.S. Eliot<br /><br />He was my cream, and I was his coffee -<br />And when you poured us together, it was something.<br />~Josephine Baker<br /><br />I'm more of a tea girl than a coffee girl, but I definitely like some java on occasion and tend to associate it with good things: warmth on a hot day, sitting around the table with friends and loved ones, that extra jolt that helps the world make sense. And I really tend to like flavored coffees. I tried this product twice and it really left me feeling right down the middle. I didn't love it or hate it, but it was okay. The first pot was made after Sunday dinner and drank black and the second one was made yesterday morning where I drank it on the front porch while I read and bird watched while the rain fell gently and I had it with cream and sugar. These are two nearly ideal set-ups to evoke good coffee feelings, and I just wasn't impressed. There was mild gratitude for the caffeine during the morning session.<br /><br />Yes, it tasted like hazel nut, and I guess Creme Brulee, and I like both of these flavors and the coffee was smooth, but the end result wasn't as pleasing as it should be, as I anticipated it being, as the random cup of coffee at one of the local restaurants is on any given Sunday.<br /><br />Later on in the day, my husband asked me about it since he was the won I conned into brewing the second pot. I told him pretty much what I said here and that I'd probably assign 3 stars. I asked him what he thought, "It's all right, I guess. Nothing I would rush out to buy. 3 stars sounds about right."<br /><br />I'll drink it, but like the man said, I won't rush out to buy it.

review/text: Okay coffee lovers, this is a wonderful product!<br /><br />First, this is a very smooth blend, which means that there is no bitterness, no bad after taste, no acid burning later. The low acid in the bean selection is especially excellent. Also, the hazelnut flavor is great, but the touch of creme brulee is wonderful! The flavor makes this coffee very rich and full-bodied tasting. I usually like creme and sugar in my coffee, but this particular blend is very nice without the extras - that is how good the flavor is for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this particular Melitta coffee blend.

review/summary: okay but not great
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee each day and I drink it black with just a bit of sugar.  I prefer to drink organically grown coffee but I made an exception for this one.  My first impression was the packaging - it's terrible and I ended up having to open it using a pair of scissors.  After brewing several pots of it I have to say I'm not that impressed with it.  It's smooth enough, with no bitterness but the overall flavor is weak and bland.  It's not a bad coffee but it's by no means the best coffee I've ever had and once this bag is used up I wouldn't buy any to replace it.

review/summary: Love this Coffee
review/text: The flavor is not at all subtle, even when I reduced the amount of coffee to make it less noticeable. The hazelnut definitely tends to overpower the coffee flavor. That being said, I still like this coffee so much I don't mind. It smells great while it's brewing, and I feel like I'm having a treat, rather than a regular cup of coffee. The grind is very fine and the coffee is smooth. I always add a little cream to my coffee, but I also tried this black with sweetener and it was still very good. In fact, I like it so much it's the only coffee I'm using right now and my regular brand is staying in the cabinet.<br /><br />As others have commented, the packaging wasn't so great. I gave up trying to open it and used scissors. Other than that, a great product.

review/text: If you are like me and like your coffee "strong and black" you have to be careful as most coffees tend to become bitter when strong and black. MELITTA HAZELNUT CREME BRULEE has a bit of a bite to it, but not as bad as most coffees. The coffee is pretty smooth, but the flavor is not as rich as I would like for it to be. This is an ultra fine grind so you won't use as much coffee. Overall, this is not bad coffee, but I was hoping for something better.

review/text: I'm not a fan of flavored coffee, but the hazelnut flavor was balanced well and didn't get overpowering after the second (third, fourth then fifth) cup. My only issue was that the coffee is quite weak - and I'm comparing this again Peet's standard brew blend and Costco's ubiquitous-but-cheap Kirkland Signature coffee. If you enjoy flavored coffee to taste more like the flavor that the coffee, this may be a good choice, whereas if you prefer a hint of flavor then you may be wondering where the coffee went.

review/summary: nice flavor (if you liked flavored coffees), but packaging is not so good
review/text: If I could, I would give this product 3.5 stars.  I do think the flavor is good -- though not exceptional; if you like flavored coffees, you'll probably like this.  The coffee flavor underneath the "hazelnut creme brulee" flavor is mild.  The beans are finely ground -- a little more finely than prepackaged beans from Starbucks, for comparison -- which makes this product suitable for drip coffee makers but unsuitable for percolators or any other coffee maker that requires a coarser grind.<br /><br />What prompted me to knock my rating down to 3 stars rather than rounding up to 5 stars is that the packaging is not very good.  How can this be?  There are many, many brands of coffee that use similar, vacuum packed, foil lined bags.  With very rare exceptions, these bags are easy to open without tearing and easy to reseal.  This Melita bag, on the other hand, seemed like it was glued to keep children out.  When I eventually got the glue to give way, the bag ended up with a few large tears around the top, making it difficult to get the beans out of the bag without making a mess.

review/summary: Just the Right Blend
review/text: I was hesitant at first when I saw this coffee. I'm not a big hazelnut fan since most companies over do the hazelnut in the coffee and creamers. But I admit that I was pleasantly surprised. This is a fine grind coffee that smells rich and slightly sweet. I loved the smell of the brewed coffee and the taste was better than the smell. The cr&egrave;me brulee made the coffee slightly sweet and I didn't need anything to sweeten my coffee for once. Also, there is a hint of hazelnut and that just adds to everything.<br /><br />If you like a slightly sweet, bold coffee, you will like this. The price is also pretty good compared to the cost of other flavored coffees. I think I'm going to have to start ordering my coffee from now on.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/text: Bag is tightly vacuum packed in a sturdy plastic/aluminum pouch.  It has a strand of aluminum wire so you reseal its top every time you use it.  Important, as coffee looses much of its aroma and freshness when not properly sealed. I also regularly replace it back to the refrigerator once opened.<br /><br />This coffee is good, but not exciting enough.  The flavor is somewhat a little bland. The aroma likewise does not have a strong punch to it.  I do like the hazel flavor coffee, but the taste here is very subtle.

review/text: I received one 11 oz bag of Melitta coffee from the Vine program. I had requested Hazelnut Creme Brulee and that is what the shipping tag indicated. However, the coffee bag shows it to be Blanc et Noir so that is what I am reviewing. I am a morning coffee drinker and usually have one or two mugs. This blend of light and dark roasts is a fairly average coffee blend. It is somewhat heavier and darker than what I am used to having. I find it to be slightly more bitter than what I prefer. The aroma is somewhat pleasing. For a fairly inexpensive coffee it is a somewhat interesting change from my usual brand which is Gevalia. I would not use this on a regular basis but for a change of pace it offers an acceptable different experience.

review/text: So I brought this coffee into the office to get a few opinions instead of just one. First of, some people may like their coffee REALLY strong, but if you don't, don't follow the instructions on the pack. The recommendation on the pack was to use 2 teaspoons of coffee per 6oz of water. I went by the instructions and the coffee packed some punch! I could only drink it after diluting it with a LOT of creamer.<br /><br />My favorite part about this coffee was the aroma while it was brewing - the whole office smelled awesome. We all liked the taste alright. It definitely had a hint of hazelnut and was even better when combined with hazelnut creamer. All in all, I'm giving it a thumbs up!

review/summary: Excellent coffee with attractive flavor
review/text: The Melitta Cafe Collection coffee is billed as being 'extra fine grind', which made me a bit worried, since I've had problems in the past with coffee that is little more than powder.  I was happy to find that the extra fine grind is only a little bit finer than the regular ground I use every day at work.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavoring imbued in the coffee tastes very good, with a nice finish.  Sometimes these flavored coffees are overpowering, making it seem as though you are drinking coffee-flavored spices rather than the other way around.  This is a very nice balance of coffee and hazelnut.  It saves me from using an additional flavoring, such as in the creamer or in a separate syrup.<br /><br />Melitta has a winner here.  I'm looking forward to trying the french vanilla flavor (Melitta calls that, 'Parisian Vanilla').  If it's anything like the hazelnut, I expect another winner.

review/text: I don't typically drink coffee much these days as 1) it's a bit too messy at home to grind and brew and 2) I like those flavored sweeteners and sugar is on the *no* list these days. That said, I decided to get this when it showed up on Vine and brought it into the office to share with everyone and see what they thought - and the opinions were all over the board. The boss hated it, but he doesn't like the flavored stuff at all. The lads at the sales counter were thumbs up (of course, after the Folgers they usually get anything's a treat).<br /><br />Me, I'm kind of *meh*. I picked up on a sharp, bitter taste and while it was OK enough it didn't bowl me over. I prefer to stick with freshly ground Starbucks with a vanilla flavoring added to sweeten the pot. And since I can't have that I'll stick with my morning tea. Two stars from the boss and I, four from the lads, rounded out to three.

review/text: Hazelnut Creme Brulee sounds like it might be too sweet, but it is smooth and flavorful, not at all bitter and makes a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I have used it in both a Melitta one-cup drip and also in a french press with success, but the french press demands that you use a little more coffee to begin with.  I drink my coffee black but I can easily imagine cream or milk turning this into an almost guilty pleasure.  I also intend to make it a little stronger, chill it and add ice for a refreshing iced coffee on a hot summer day.

review/summary: Makes a most enjoyable cup of coffee.
review/text: I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy this flavored coffee. I like it both as a dessert type after dinner coffee as well as an anytime coffee. I only drink coffee sweetened (preferably with honey) and with half and half, and that is how I sampled Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee. My coffee of choice, which I've been drinking for about 2 decades, is Peet's brand coffee (which I get shipped to me and of which I enjoy and drink several varieties, with my top favorites being French and Italian). I always buy whole beans and grind beans one cup at a time. I then make it in a filter cone, and every once in a while in a French press or an espresso machine. If I'm making coffee for 2 or 3 people, I either use the French Press or I make each cup separately, using a separate filter cone for each cup. And I'm always careful when measuring beans and ground coffee so that I can keep the flavor and body of the coffee I drink day after day consistent. (The Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee is ground to an "Extra Fine Grind," which means it's unsuitable for use in a French Press.)<br /><br />On a caffeine buzz scale, I find that Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee weaker than any variety of Peet's (or Starbucks), but that's fine with me because I don't always want or need a caffeine buzz as strong as the kind I get from a tall cup of Peet's (or Starbucks). Sometimes I regret getting a strong caffeine buzz because it leaves me feeling a tad headachey. So it's nice to know that there's a tasty, good quality alternative that is less intense on a caffeine buzz scale.<br /><br />I would, and probably will, buy Melitta Cafe Collection ground coffee on occasion (e.g., if I'm running low on Peet's or money to buy Peet's, or if I'm asked to bring ground coffee to a holiday gathering where it will be prepared in a coffee maker of some sort). I would like to try the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla variety, as well as their Vienna Roast (Peet's Vienna Roast was one of my favorites but they discontinued it) and Blanc et Noir (which, according to Melitta's site, is "Deep with a Rich Finish"). I have tried their Classique Supreme variety (and will review it separately), and like it as much as I like the Hazelnut. I received free samples of the Hazelnut Creme Brulee and the Classique Supreme for review purposes, but based on the prices listed at Melitta's site and here at Amazon I'd say that the price is right and is lower than I would've expected for coffee of this quality.<br /><br />Update: I spoke on the phone with a Melitta customer service representative about the difficulty I had opening both 11 oz. sample bags of their Cafe Collection coffee I received, and she said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top. I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag.

review/text: I ordered this and Amazon was great about refunding my money.  It says the product is by Kuerig in the ad and the cost is about ten dollars more then the Nifty.  The weight and size are also different.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035DUVCQ">Keurig 5771 35 K-Cup Carousel, Black</a> It arrived on time and in good condition.  Howerve when I opened the box, I found a Nifty brand and not the Kuerig.  On the bottom of the Nifty box the seller had placed a label noting it was the Keurig that I ordered.  Opposite the label was written that the item was not manufactured or distributed by Keurig.  I really cannot rate the item as I never received it, so I shall give it a 1 star.  Take your chances with this 3rd party.

review/summary: The "leaning tower" rotates annoyingly
review/text: We decided to buy this carousel rather than the one made by It because it held more (35 vs. 27) and because it was taller and narrower, thereby taking up a smaller footprint. The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the It version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons. However, when we received it, it wasn't as well-made as we had hoped, mostly because it didn't stand straight, so when you spin it, the "leaning tower" rotates annoyingly from side to side. Decided to live with it rather than dealing with a return.

review/text: Works as advertised. No balancing issues even if one side is full of kcups and the other side is bar. spins like a charm. made out of what seems to be wrought iron which makes it look more of like a decor piece. it does look bare when you start running out of kcups but i usually just spread them around when that starts to happen to make the decor piece look even. kcups slide right in not too tight not too loose. each row holds five kcups great for organizing or separating sides. at the time of this review it holds the most kcups for a spinning kcup holder. would buy again does what it says it's supposed to made out of great material

review/summary: I can't believe I'm reviewing this, but....
review/text: ...it's just one of those awesome little things you have to share.<br /><br /> I was stationed in Hawaii for more than 8 of the last 24+ years at different times and one of the joys of Hawaii (among many) is the great local food. The downside is that finding the particulars that make local Hawaiian cuisine so fun and tasty are hard to locate in one place in most of the rest of the USA.<br /><br /> A common favorite is a dish called Ahi Poke. Though you can Poke lots of other fish, Ahi Poke is the most frequently enjoyed. Ahi is just tuna, though a slightly different type. The one used for this dish is a sushi grade raw Ahi. The part that is Poke is a blend of various spices, oils and a specific seaweed and it gives an absolutely unique and delightful flavor. It is a firm family favorite whether we simply scoop some over a dish of rice or make it into a sushi wrap. Most people who like any sushi at all love Ahi Poke.<br /><br /> Alas, thinking I should be able to find all the various spices and ingredients in any big city I didn't bring any with me from Hawaii. Getting all of those ingredients in one spot proved impossible. Even just consistently locating all of them anywhere was an exercise in hours of cross city driving and frustration.<br /><br /> So, on the off chance one day I typed in a search for the brand of pre-packaged Ahi Poke mix I used in Hawaii..Noh..and voila: Amazon had it! I bought a case just in time for my nephews birthday and he was absolutely gobsmacked to have a nice big bowl of his favorite food.<br /><br />  This package makes THE Ahi Poke. You can find recipes using more common seaweeds or other substitutions all over the net, but this is the real deal. That same rich and exotic flavor blend you remember from that shabby shop on the North Shore is right in this package. Each individual package is labeled to work for 1 pound of fish but I found that using 3/4 of a pound gives about the correct flavor. A pound makes it a tad weak. Of course, that's a lot of fish anyway. We tend to think in terms of hamburger or steak but the richness of raw Ahi means people will generally eat significantly less in ounces than they would other meats.<br /><br />  Love this stuff and I certainly recommend it. The price may seem high for a packet of spice, but the bulk prices on that seaweed, when you can even get it, is pretty high so this is actually quite reasonable. Happy Sushi!

review/summary: NOH Brings the taste of Hawaii to You
review/text: Every time I traveled home to Hawaii I use to buy bags of Limu seaweed and Hawaiian salt in bulk and take them home. One day while shopping in my local supermarket I spotted NOH Poke Mix in the Asian food section and it blew my mind that someone figured out a way to make an instant Poke mix! Using this product to make a pound of Poke is real easy and you can add your own personal touches. I like to throw in diced garlic and chili paste. The Limu seaweed is the main ingredient of Poke and I always felt Limu seaweed had to be kept frozen if it was not consumed immediately. But NOH discovered if you take young cultured Limu seaweed it will reconstitute perfectly that is the how they were able to dry the seaweed and package it. Although I prefer mature Limu seaweed, the NOH Poke mix will not disappoint you.

review/summary: Poke Mix Too Salty for Tako Poke Recipe
review/text: I made a pound of baby octopus and used this mix to make tako poke.  It didn't turn out at all like the tako poke I've had in Honolulu with my "local boy" husband.  I would recommend that when preparing this with tako (octopus) that you add only a little at a time and add extra flavors such as onions, tomatoes, soy sauce, rice vinegar and a bit of sugar; also the amount of sesame oil is too much for the tako.  It's overpowering (maybe it's because it doesn't absorb the flavors like ahi tuna does).  I'd start with maybe a quarter of the amount of sesame oil and add according to taste.  This particular review is only for the tako poke, not for the ahi or tofu recipes they suggest.  I'll likely try this seasoning for those, as the reviews have been favorable otherwise.

review/summary: ONO
review/text: After living in Hawaii for 61 years we moved to Panama last year. I have had Poki from almost every Supermarket or Fish Store on Oahu over the years and have a few favorite spots. After about 6 months here really started to miss my Hawaiian foods. Poki being my favorite. Bingo, were we are now I found a line on fresh Ahi and at only $3.50 a lb. Got 1 package of NOH Poki mix to try. WOW how good can it get. 1 lb. fresh Ahi, NOH Poki mix and a couple hours in the refrigerator. Time to test it out and sit down with a cold beer and my chop sticks. Jackpot, it only lasted 2 beers and maybe 30 min. Good thing my wife does not eat Poki. It was the best and wish I had know about it back in the Islands. All the money I could have saved making my own. Recommend this product 100%. Need to order the 12 pack right away so I can let my Panamanian friend try Hawaiian Poki. Next have to try Kim Chee mix. Aloha from Panama.

I used Ahi(tuna),a good quality sesame oil(Tahini)and about 1/2 lime juice with the Ogo/spice pack.  They also suggest tofu!?!  I thought it was very close to several versions I'd had in Hawaii.  I good barley Hawaiian beer or Mai Tai,with it,adds to the pleasure.  A little expensive(even in a 12 pk.),but a nice gift for anyone who has experienced the Islands.  Looking for Ogo seaweed or  a good substitute to create my own Poke.

Much more accessible than other 85% chocolate, and after a while, everything else tastes too sweet. I keep trying others and come back to Vivani. Also, I'm very sensitive to stimulants and have noticed that different brands have differing effects on me--I can't sleep, for instance, if I have a teeny piece of Choc-O-Love. Vivani makes me happy without sending me to the moon.

review/summary: Enticing if you can tolerate the %of cocoa
review/text: I have to admit that I tolerate the 70% cocoa level much better than the 85%, so I found this bar a bit bitter, as expected.  Yet I found it really enticing, with me returning to have another little square a little while later.  In small doses, this bar is delicious.  And it enables the dark chocolate consumer to get used to the higher percentages of cocoa.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this dark chocolate bar, as I said in small doses.  It is smooth, rich, and satisfying.  The quality of ingredients and production are quite obvious in the taste, the melt experience, and the overall enjoyment of the product.<br /><br />If you're at the 85% level of tolerance, I would highly recommend Vivani's 85% Dark Chocolate bar.  If you're getting there, use it as training wheels to reach that level.<br />Vivani Chocolates Dark Chocolate With 85% Cocoa, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 10)

review/summary: Best Chocolate I've Ever Had
review/text: I've become somewhat of a dark chocolate snob :) ever since I changed my eating habits for the better. Now a piece of dark chocolate after dinner is my dessert (instead of cake, ice cream, etc - not that I don't splurge once in awhile :)<br /><br />I've tasted big brands, local brands, organic, you name it. There's some great chocolate out there, but when I tasted Vivani - it took everything to a whole new level. Now the other chocolates don't taste as good. Ok, I feel like a really cheesy commercial writing all of this - but that's how much in love with this chocolate I am!<br /><br />The first reviewer was correct about bitterness. If you're used to milk chocolate (and you are if your only chocolate experiences are things like Hershey's, Dove, a Snickers bar, etc), then you'll want to start with a lower percentage of cocoa. But you *can* train your tastebuds to like the higher percentages. My kids have done this. I recommend starting off at 50% then going to 68%, then 72%.<br /><br />But you'll really only get the healthy benefits of chocolate that your'e always hearing about (antioxidants and what not) when you're able to go above 80%. So aim high :) And this is the perfect brand to do so :)

review/summary: Probably the Best Dark Chocolate I Have Ever Tasted, and it's 85% Cocoa!!
review/text: I eat dark chocolate because I like it.<br />I eat 85% dark chocolate for health benefits.<br /><br />This week my order of Vivani Dark Chocolate with 85% Cocoa arrived. I expected it to taste bland as many 85% chocolate bars do. It didn't. The last brand I tried was so bland that I had to eat it along with a tiny amount of sweeter dark chocolate, which defeats the purpose. The Vivani is great as is.<br /><br />This is probably the best dark chocolate I have ever had in my life!  It had a rich, full, taste that was naturally sweet rather than tasting like they poured sugar (or fake sugar) in it. It's very satisfying, so I just break off a row, about 3 squares, and that's enough.<br /><br />I know that when I'm out shopping and find one of the chocolate bars, I usually buy a half dozen or so of them so I don't run out. Buying the one that tastes this great online can't be beat. I'll be buying more when I get down to one bar, which will take me a while.<br /><br />ETA there is still a lot of fat in these and the fact that they taste so good means I'm going to have to use an enormous amount of self control.<br /><br />Ingredients: cocoa liquor, cocoa utter, raw cane sugar, cocoa solids: 85% minimum<br />Serving Size: 10 sections  (5 is enough for me)<br />Servings per bar: about 2.5<br />Calories: 240  Fat calories 202<br />Total fat 22g 34%<br />saturated fat 14g 71%<br />trans fat 0<br />cholesterol 0<br />sodium 0<br />Total Carb 6 g 2%<br />Fiber 6g 22%<br />Sugars 6 g 12%<br />Protein 3g  7%

review/summary: wait, you mean...chocolate i can eat any time?
review/text: i'm sensitive to what i eat, and for many years i've avoided sweets except sometimes right before bed (and then only when i'm sleeping alone) because the sugar crash they give me within about 15 minutes of eating them pretty much renders me useless for interaction with other carbon-based lifeforms. while i imagine it has less to do with this particular brand than with its relatively high cocoa and low sugar contents, still, it's wonderful to be able to wake up in the morning (or the afternoon, or whenever i wake up) and have some delicious chocolate with my wake-up tea and not have to go back to bed and nap a quarter of an hour later. this chocolate allows me that luxury.<br /><br />as at least one other reviewer has said, chocolate with an 85% cocoa content takes some getting used to; you might do well to work your way up in steps, rather than try to slam yourself straight from milk chocolate, or much lower-cocoa-content dark chocolate, to this. the sweetness of this chocolate is *very* subtle compared to more mainstream options, and at your first taste you might wonder why anybody would eat this stuff on purpose. but stick with it...give it time, let it melt in your mouth...and you will certainly become very fond of it. this Vivani chocolate is German-made (why Germans would want to give their chocolate an Italian-sounding name, i don't know, but these Germans did) and very fine; it's rich without being too sweet, and as smooth as any chocolate i've ever eaten. and now that i've grokked its subtle charms, i don't know if i'll ever eat sweeter chocolate again.<br /><br />now if you'll excuse me, i have to go EAT MORE CHOCOLATE!<br /><br />nom.

It covered everything with with the sauce.<br /><br />I let it sit and ferment. I like the flavor very much. It is hot and spicy; just enough to be delightful.<br /><br />I already have a second batch fermenting now.<br /><br />September.24.2011 update:<br />I've really enjoyed Kim Chee made with the Noh of Hawaii seasoning mix. I've experimented with adding more produce and now I make larger batches of Kim Chee so that I need to use two packages of Kim Chee for the following:<br /><br />1 Napa Cabbage (large),<br />1 bunch of green onions<br />1 carrot,<br />1 cucumber.<br />1/2 leek.<br />3 Jalepeno Peppers.<br /> Diakon Radish 1/2 lbs.<br /><br />I clean, rinse off everything and slice it up into bite sizes. Then I soak the cut produce in brine. Finally I rinse it three times before mixing in the seasoning mix with fresh water.<br /><br />I like the flavor a lot more with all the above ingredients in it. It is full of flavor with interesting textures and looks.

review/summary: The cup-o-noodle of the chimchi/kim chee, world
review/text: The good:<br />-product has the basic ingredients needed for kimchi seasoning.<br />-One bag will take care of one large kimchi cabbage(I can't remember the actual name but its the huge leafy green traditionally used for this).<br />-Just add water & a little chopping action<br />-after day 3, it starts to smell and taste like the real deal (I followed the direction except for the salt water bath.. I just salted each leaf & let it sit for 30 minutes, then rinsed. I also added more mix from another bag cause I wanted to be sure the flavor would not be watered down.)<br />-It wont win any taste awards but it gets the job done if your tight on money & time (college students rejoice!)<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />- Your not working with fresh herbs so the finished kimchi "red stuff" is watery rather than thick & rich red (I guess because you are working with a fine powder & only "just enough" to do one batch).<br />- if you're looking for the kimchi "look" & taste you are used to from pre-made.. get ready to be disappointed. See above reason.<br />- I have seen flour used to make kimchi, there is none here.<br /><br />Side note: Nothing beats fresh made so my next adventure will be hunting down raw ingredients. That said, I don't feel like I "wasted" my money.<br /><br />---UPDATE---<br />By day 8 it was good kimchi! After it was all done I was left feeling a bit sad. I still have 4 more packets of this brand mix & will finish them off before moving on to make kimchi from all fresh ingredients. I had a great experience with this product and definitely feel its worth having it around for when you don't have time/money to buy all the ingredients FRESH, aside from salt and cabbage.

review/summary: Kimchi is the Best
review/text: Do you know Kimchi? This is the most popular food in Korea and is a renowned traditional Korean food throughout the world. Most Chinese enjoy eating this, and one of my American friends likes Kimchi. There is this in every store, and you can even find it in Wal-mart and Kessler's in Aberdeen. I would like to talk about Kimchi, and then recommend you to eat Kimchi.<br />What is Kimchi? Kimchi is Korean, a spicy pickled or fermented mixture containing cabbage, onions, and sometimes fish, variously seasoned, as with garlic, horseradish, red peppers, and ginger, according to http://www.dictionary.com. Actually there are lots of types of Kimchi in Korea, but the Kimchi that we talk about in daily life is `Baechu Kimchi', and its main vegetable is a white cabbage which gives out a special flavor. What makes it smell special is that it is not only fermented food, but also made of different vegetables that have unique flavors respectively with special Korean seasonings, including garlic, hot pepper and onion. Due to these reasons, Kimchi is loved by Asians, while it is not loved by Americans and Europeans.<br /> I have several reasons why I like Kimchi; first, I like spicy food, such as hot pickles. When making Kimchi, a lot of Korean traditional hot pepper is used, and this gets Kimchi to taste very spicy. In my case, I have trouble in the process of digestion, but Kimchi contains lots of fiber that helps my intestine clean, and it promotes the secretion of an enzyme needed to break down the protein.<br />Except these benefits, Kimchi has important efficacies. It has antimicrobial action as it is getting fermented; lactic acid bacteria generated during fermentation control growth of other harmful bacteria. It not only prevents adult diseases such as heart attack, hyperpiesia, obesity and diabetes, but also gives abundant vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B, vitamin C, calcium, iron, etc.<br /> If you are looking for something good for your health, why don't you try Kimchi? It keeps you healthy, as well as tastes fantastic, moreover, capsaicin, which makes spicy flavor in hot pepper, helps you lose weight. If you are worried about the spicy flavor of Kimchi, don't worry about that! A few years ago, non-spicy Kimchi was developed for you and is on sale now. It is necessary to eat Kimchi to the west people who live on bread and meat because another ingredient in Kimchi makes meat and bread soft and smooth. And finally it helps people digest well.<br /> Nowadays, as developing technologies of transportation and internet, numerous countries in the world can share their information and culture. Since there was active cultural exchange between Korea and America, several Americans have started to know Korean food's benefits and to be interested in them, and then the demand has increased. Especially, the superiority of Kimchi is so well-known, `Kimchi cans are on sale.' How about eating really nice Kimchi? Kimchi is waiting for you to eat it!

review/summary: Very good -- quick and convenient
review/text: This is a very good (for store-bought) spicy chili.  It's a little spicier than the regular Campbell's chili, otherwise very similar.  These microwave well and are quick and convenient, but the canned version is a bit better value.  Very satisfying beans and meat in a good sauce.  A few crackers and one of these and you have lunch.  At 14 cents an ounce (subscribe and save), these are a very good value.  I never get tired of chili and always keep some of these and/or the other variates (my favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EQI4I">Campbell's Chunky Grilled Steak Chili With Beans, 19-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>) around.<br /><br />Campbell's has nailed the Chili thing and their whole line of canned chili is pretty good.

review/summary: GOOD CHILI FOR COMING OUT OF A CAN!
review/text: Seriously, this is pretty good.  It is not like the New Mexican chili we all know and love here, nothing can compare to that but  for a good "Tex-Mex" it makes the grade. There is so much meat in it and it actually tastes good. It is a little hot for me at times but adding crackers and ice cold  milk makes it just right. We have bought it twice from amazon and and will buy it again.

review/summary: Fantastic Taste for What It Is
review/text: Now I'm not going to compare this stuff to home made, and especially not my own home made but for a container that you buy off the shelf, it's pretty darn good. I've been getting tired of Wolf Brand Chili for a few years and recently decided to try something different. I got some of this and thought it would probably be mediocre at best. What a great surprise. The stuff is very tasty. It's just spicy enough to get your attention, but then it settles out and isn't bad at all. It's sort of like "false alarm" chili. It's got large beans (maybe kidney) and nice chunks of meat. The sauce is a little more fluid-like that other brands so you can see the beans and meat better.<br /><br />I think I just found my new favorite instant chili.

review/summary: Good Taste For Microwavable
review/text: For a microwavable meal, this stuff actually tastes good. I eat it with wheat crackers. The spice is actually quite mild, but may be more than some people really care for. In my opinion, the spiciness of this chili should be what the roadhouse chili is.<br /><br />One of the great bonuses of the firehouse chili is that it doesn't tend to explode like the roadhouse chili does. I suspect this is because there is more liquid and less chunk in the firehouse chili and it doesn't plug the vent holes on the plastic lid during cooking.<br /><br />In all, this is a great quick lunch meal when combined with some good wheat crackers.

review/summary: Decent chili
review/text: When I received my package from Amazon, the actual product was slightly dirty. I had to wash the metal area with soap before I could open it since I didn't want any of the mysterious dirt to fall in.<br />I shared this with a friend of mine and we had it with some white rice because it is quite spicy. It has a lot of beans and not enough meat. I would prefer chili to be thicker and not so liquidity.<br />For a microwavable meal, its not bad. It's affordable and quite filling with a few additions even for 2 people. Although not the best chili I've had in a prepackaged form, I would still recommend it for the convenience and the price.

review/summary: Awesome rub..
review/text: I used this rub for the first time about 3 weeks ago.  I saw it in the store and decided to try it since I LOVE BBQ and trying new spices.  I used it on a tri-tip that I was planning on smoking later in the evening.  I rubbed the tri-tip down with garlic olive oil and gave it a light-medium coating of this rub, threwe it in a gladlock bag, and let it marinate in the fridge for about 3 hours.  I got my Big Steel Keg up to about 300 degrees and threw 4 chunks of hickory wood on the lump.  Put the tri-tip on over direct heat this time because I like my to have a little bit of the char flavor vs just plain indirect smoking(for this meat anyways).  I left it on for about 1.5 hours or so(don't remember the exact time because I do not BBQ by time but I would guess around this time).  I took it off and let it rest for about 10 minutes.  I have to say this was by far the best tri-tip I have ever made/had.  This rub gets two thumbs up from me.  I just ordered the 10pk from Amazon with free prime shipping.  I just noticed that they have a Memphis flavor "slow and low" rub as well that I will try next time.
