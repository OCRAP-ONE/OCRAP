review/summary: Miracle noodles are a miracle
review/text: I love pasta. I've tried white, wheat, veggie, gluten free (which is aweful). I found miracle noodles. At first it was hard to get past the irredescent look of the noodle but I washed them, parboiled them and put them in my favorite sauce with veggies and it was perfect. Why wouldn't everyone try these. On special occasion like at my Italian grandmother's dinners I will eat pasta but these miracle noodles are an awesome replacement otherwise. I haven't yet tried them with an alfredo or pesto sauce. There is one other noodle that compares with the miracle noodle and that is shirataki noodles. Both are amazing. I can have my pasta and eat it too.

review/summary: Pleasant Surprise
review/text: After reading several reviews with the pros and cons on this product I decided to take the plunge and give it a try. I was expecting a fishy smell as was described  in some reviews. It had almost no smell at all. I would describe it more like a whiff of rain or a fresh water lake---definitely not a turn off and the rinsing completely took care of any scent. The consistency was pretty much as the other reviewers described---somewhat chewy but not like rubber bands. I prepared it per package instructions which was very easy---just rinsed and parboiled. I used a tomato sauce and grated cheese and I do plan to try it again with olive oils and other sauces. It doesn't taste like pasta. I tried it without sauce first and there was no taste.

review/summary: Great taste but .....look at expiration date
review/text: I ordered these noodles in bulk after trying them out first. I really like the taste of them especially when I add spaghetti sauce. I would not recommend ordering in bulk, unless you plan to eat them all in a month. My entire box had an expiration date approximately two months after I purchased them. I ended up sharing them with friends so that I didn't have to throw them out, when my intention was to have it for months of meals. I rated them on the low end only because of the early expiration date.

review/summary: Pasta savior
review/text: I love these noodles.  Being the only one in my family with grain allergies I always felt like I was missing something when pasta nights rolled around.  Not so anymore!  Sure, they are not like the noodles we are 'used to', but then, why should that matter?  They hold any type of sauce or flavoring you put on them and are certainly better (for me) than going without.  I like them simply with butter, salt and romano cheese.<br /><br />As for filling, they are that also.  When I need to drop a few pounds they fill me up without added calories.  I never noticed anything fishy about them, and don't mind the different texture (really, if you have had gluten free noodles, texture is not something you get too picky about.  Moreover, they act like pasta and my eyes, mouth and brain are all too happy to have some pasta like thing in our diet again.<br /><br />They are portable, palatable and guilt free.  If you are looking for any of that, then give this noodle a try.

review/text: I am on a low carb diet, and these noodles have been wonderful! Do they have a horrible fishy smell? Yes, absolutely. Does it last? Not if you take care to rinse them properly.<br />1. Dump the noodles in a strainer and rinse for a few minutes.<br />2. Soak them in a bowl with water and a dash of white vinegar for at least 5 minutes.<br />3. Rinse the beejesus out of them again<br />Your noodles should be fishless.<br /><br />If you are having problems with the texture, make sure you cook them at the right time. I take care to cook them for only a minute, and the texture is fine for me.<br /><br />I have found these a great substitute for spaghetti, and next I will try them as a ramen dish.<br /><br />And yep, they do take on the flavor of the foods you cook them with!

review/summary: I'm not a picky eater, and this is the grossest thing i've ever put in my mouth
review/text: I bought these noodles because of all the stellar reviews I read. I am not a picky eater. I eat sugar free, low-carb, low sodium, fake cheese, cardboard-like things all the time and like them. In fact, there is no food that I absolutely don't like or won't eat until now.<br /><br />When I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was the terrible smell. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it's kind of like joint compound or drywall spackle, or something that is definitely NOT food. I figured it might be the packaging, so I spent a little extra time rinsing the noodles than the directions called for. Smelling them again, I knew it was the noodles, but stayed hopeful that parboiling and sauce would fix everything. I followed the directions, and since I love asian noodles decided to dress my Miracle Noodles with good ole soy sauce. The noodles tasted just like they smelled, AWFUL. However, being the daughter of someone who grew up very poor with little food, I couldn't waste them, so I took another bite. The taste and smell mixed with the texture of rubber bands started to gross me out and make my throat clench. I took a breath and looked into my bowl. I own two cats and thought there was a cat hair in my pasta, so like any other time, I plucked it out; no problem. I took another bite, and noticed another "hair." I picked it up and found that it was attached to a noodle. I poked around the bowl with my fork and discovered these strings everywhere. In fact, you know when you clean your hairbrush and you pull out hair balls with spider-like hair legs? Well, I found a "miracle" hairball happily squatting in my bowl. That was my last straw and I had to stop eating. This wasn't the worst food experience of my life, but it ranks up there. Zero gluten and zero calories is just too good to be true. Don't waste your money.

review/summary: For us, not worth the money
review/text: I was excited to receive our Miracle Noodle as both my husband and I are limiting carbohydrates.  When I opened the first bag (noodles ship in some kind of liquid), the odor was very off-putting but I washed, blanched and dried the noodles as instructed on the package and proceeded to prepare one of our favorites, Singapore Noodles.  I figured that even if the flavor was not the same as rice noodles that the strong curry, shrimp, onion, garlic and ginger flavors would help disguise it.  We found that NOT to be the case.  The noodles do not absorb the other flavors as rice noodles do and the mouth feel was not tough and spongy.  Neither of us liked for the noodles.  Especially at the high cost.

review/summary: dried and chewy, not freeze dried and crispy
review/text: I bought these expecting freeze dried apples and I was disappointed. These are dehydrated apples; they are chewy, have the skin on, and are oxidized (brown). The taste is good for dehydrated apples but for some reason they have been cut into matchstick sized pieces and since the skin becomes hard in the dehydrating process it's uncomfortable to chew them. I've started soaking them and adding to pies, it makes for a very expensive pie filling.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of just tomatoes products, these apples are the one exception. Every other JT product I've tried has been crispy and freeze dried, I wish they had made it very clear that these are not like their other products. Maybe calling them "just dehydrated apples" instead would help customers to know exactly what would be arriving before purchase?

review/summary: Very nice bold, non-bitter coffee
review/text: Review Update: 1-12-2011 When I bought these originally, they were sold directly from Amazon, and therefore were eligible for super saver shipping. They were also eligible for subscribe & save. Since then, the price has apparently DOUBLED (from $21.25 for 3 boxes) to almost $50. Fifty dollars is totally unacceptable for three boxes of these, I don't care how good they are. Don't know if Amazon is going to sell this again themselves, but if they don't, Dolce Gusto may yet go the way of the Senseo. Great coffee, now nearly extinct in the US. Watch your prices, especially on subscribe & save with these!<br /><br />If you like a bold coffee, but not a bitter coffee, these Americano capsules are great. I like the stronger (and somewhat bitter) caffe lungo capsules, but I also like these. They couldn't be described as wimpy or weak, as I feared they might be when I tried them. They have a very nice bold flavor in their own right without being bitter in the least. Caveat: Don't try filling up a huge mug using only one capsule - the dolce gusto recipe book calls for 6oz of water with these. So if you have a super large mug, you may have to use two to get your preferred amount of coffee. Unless you're like my husband and like really weak coffee. If you do, brew away! But if brewed properly, they aren't weak and wimpy. Very nice! I'd recommend for mild to bold coffee drinkers who don't like bitter.

review/summary: Excellent - don't get the reviews.
review/text: This coffee is great - reminds me of what I get in Dubai and the Middle East.  Easy to make.  No problems.  I also love the Capuccino and Latte - definitely coffee house coffee at home.  And everyone I've made if for has agreed that it is fabulous!<br /><br />I've read the reviews and I think people don't follow instructions or know what they are doing.  This has one pod - it has no milk pod.  You put it in, set the machine on the correct number of bars corresponding to what is on the pod, and push the button.  Viola.  It is done.  And if there is a milk pod (like for the latte) you use BOTH a milk and a coffee pod not just the milk pod.<br /><br />You will love this coffee and machine!

review/summary: Terrible tasting and defective too!
review/text: I ordered these capsules to go with the Krups Nescafe Dolce Gusto one cup coffee maker that I purchased from Amazon.  Unfortunately I have to return the coffee maker (unless they take other coffee pods NOT made by Nescafe) The coffee from these pods taste terrible and one out of five pods used so far are defective duds! They are filled with only powdered milk (yuck) and no coffee or cocoa.  I don't know about the other one cup coffee pods but these are definitely instant coffee in a pod. Heck I can pick up some Taster's Choice and powdered creamer and save me a lot of mess and money! I wish the manufacturer would specify that these capsules contain instant coffee and not ground coffee.  I still do not know if the other coffee pods contain instant or real coffee.

Although I find the sugar coating a bit overpowering to the almond flavor,(I dislike sweets) I am sure my shower guests will love them.  They're substantial in size, fresh and not so hard that you cannot chew them.  My local party goods store has these at $7.99/lb so the sale price is well worth every penny. I took advantage of the 5lb bag, more than what was needed but plan on giving each baby shower guest more than the planned amount in celephane bags.  They're a nice addition to the favors already purchased.  They are a medium pink and true in color to what I saw in the website. You won't be dissappointed in this bargain.

review/text: Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk.

review/summary: Best White Chocolate (after Leonidas Manon Blanc & Cafe)
review/text: I had no shipping problems with my first order of this Lindor White chocolate from Amazon. Pricing is excellent! Each box clocks in at 1 pound and 9 ounces, and you get two boxes in the package, for an amazing $33.18 with free shipping. I live in Utah and it is mid-April now - I didn't get any hard or deformed chocolates.<br /><br />Taste is very good! Creamy, almost buttery center, with a fragrant vanilla white chocolate shell. I wonder if Lindor and Leonidas are related somehow? Leonidas is a Belgian company and Lindor is Swiss, but it appears that they are mimicking each other through this white chocolate. However, make no mistakes! Leonidas is the clear winner here! The so-called "truffles" center of Lindor's chocolate is completely synthetic flavoring - there are no true white truffles according to the ingredients on the box. As far as I know, there are no synthetic flavorings for Leonidas Manon Blanc and Manon Cafe. For those who have tasted both companies' chocolates, there is a slight hint of salt in Lindor's creamy center whereas Leonidas' is a heavenly creamy butter. Besides these differences, Lindor's makes a great substitute to Leonidas for those who do not wish to splurge every month on decadent chocolates.<br /><br />Lastly, I'll close with a warning for those who are still wavering about buying this chocolate. It will not help you lose weight (but it will make you very happy)! Just three balls of Lindor's contains 70% of your recommended servings of saturated fat. This type of fat can be good or bad for you depending on your health. The good news is that there is zero trans fat - the really bad kind - and only 5mg of cholesterol (2% of recommended daily doses). Sodium levels clock in at 1% for the 3 balls. You also get a decent dose of fiber, protein, calcium, and vitamin C, according to the box. So if you don't already have an exercise routine, these bonbons can make you really fat (which is true of any good chocolate)!

review/text: What a waste...I bought these Lindt Truffles to put in a goody bag for my annual bash.  I was so excited when it came in as I opened the package I saw grease stains had saturated the plastic wrapped truffle box.  As I opened one of them up I was horrified to see each and every one of the White Chocolate Truffles had melted and leaked all over the box.  I didn't even bother to open the other box because it was in the same leaky state.  I quickly called Amazon to let them know, but when i called I was told that these are non-returnable items and they can't do anything about it.  I guess they have faced this countless amount of times to have made this policy.  So please unless you want a great messy box of melted white grease I would stay away from this item.  I even paid for 2 day shipping...what a rip off.

review/text: The chocolate had softened then re-hardened at some point between factory production and getting to me. It's possible they were boxed up as failed quality control stock and then sold to Amazon. Who knows? Because of this, they arrived all misshapen - hard but having taken on the pattern of the foil wrapper. There was also no difference between the shell of the chocolate and the truffle inside. In effect, they were misshapen balls of white chocolate that had none of the 'crunch' effect Lindt balls usually have. Don't buy them.

review/text: Being in Afghanistan - Dr. Pepper is hard to come by. I always have Dr. Pepper within arm's reach back at home. Here... not so much... So I went on a Dr. Pepper search. $50 shipping for 24/pk cans... That was not happening, but I bought other things with the goodness of DP flavor... icy pops(yummy btw)and the jerky. The jerky is just jerky... There might be a hint of DP flavor, but it's so light that my mind might be playing tricks on me wishing to taste it so badly.<br /><br />Also. it IS ONLY 4oz! just like the title says! that's $5/oz... I read the title then I saw the picture with three packages a little deceiving in my opinion I figured for $20 I was getting three 4oz packages. As far the other review saying the jerky is dry... It's jerky...<br /><br />It is not bad jerky but it doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper, and it is definitely not worth $5/oz. IMHO... live and learn but the DP icy pops are pretty good :)

review/text: LOVE THEM!!<br /><br />The Glutino GF Pretzel Sticks are my very favorite.  They are great for dipping.  Any pieces that are broken I save to put on top of a bowl/cup of soup.  They stand up well to carry a few in a plastic baggie and keep in my purse.<br />Before going gluten-free stick pretzels were a favorite and now the delicious Glutino GF Pretzel Sticks are.

review/summary: Excellent Product. As good if not better than "normal" pretzels!
review/text: I have been gluten free for over two years and have gotten quite used to gluten free snacks having their own "special" taste somewhat like cardboard with the gritty after mouth feel to remind you that they are healthy.  LOL.  These pretzels are even better than I remember "normal" pretzels to be.  My husband who is not gluten free constantly steals my stash.  I do not live in the US and have to go through a complicated process to get them as AMAZON only delivers these to US mainland addresses. They are worth every bit of the expense and complications as they are really really fantastic.

review/summary: Gulten Free
review/text: Let's face it. If you have Celiac disease and have to be Gulten free you are very limited in what you can eat. Before I was diagnosed I loved pretzels and while nothing Gulten free tastes as good as the real thing this products comes very close. I now eat them every day and buy the product by the case. I would highly recommend to anyone who cannot eat Gulten to try this product as in my case it is a life saver!

review/text: My son's celiac so we buy these pretzels by the case.  I was never a big fan of pretzels but I eat these all the time.  They''ve got just the right amount of crunch and salt, and they're good for dipping in things like hummos.  My kid loves them too.  They're a bit expensive but definitely worth it.

review/summary: The best GF pretzels!
review/text: All the other GF pretzels I've tried have an "off" flavor. These ones don't! They have a great texture and flavor. I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!

review/summary: The BEST GF pretzels available
review/text: We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are "ick" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call "Finnie Mix" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once.

review/text: I regularly buy the Glutino pretzel sticks for my family. We had been missing pretzel sticks after going on the gluten free diet and were so happy to find these. They taste really great, almost like their wheat counterparts. Each of the many bags we've eaten has always been fresh and crunchy - never stale. A bag of these pretzels doesn't last very long in our house.

These Gluten free pretzels taste great. They're light, taste just like regular pretzels, and have just the right amount of sea salt. I was a bit concerned when I read the sodium content, but figured I could just brush the extra salt off...no need. Both of my finicky kids love them, & I've even shared them at outtings with other children & adults who had no clue that these pretzels were gluten free. I would definitely order them again.

review/text: I just bought these for the first time. WOW! They are wonderful--not at all  something that simulates  pretzel taste. Many times the  gluten free products I try are not even a good imitation of the real thing. This is not the case with these pretzels. I took them to my office and let everyone try them. I had a hard time keeping everyone away after one taste!<br /><br />One serious word of caution--They are so good you will find yourself eating more than you should!
