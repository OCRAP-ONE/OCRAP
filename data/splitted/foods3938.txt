review/summary: Lets coffee taste come through
review/text: Discovered this at a hotel breakfast buffet, and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  I've always used the refrigerated versions of Coffeemate creams, but for some reason sweetened original is not an option.  The nice part about this cream is that you can taste the coffee rather than the flavoring of the cream.  I can't drink coffee "black", so this is the closest I can get to enjoying the coffee itself.  It's A LOT of cream to have on-hand, but it keeps well, especially since it does not require refrigeration.

review/summary: Good Product, Tastes Great
review/text: I bought this thinking I could eliminate the liquid creamer I buy from the store and save money.  However because its sweetened, the people in my house pump until it tastes the way they want it to instead of pumping for the cream and adding sugar like we did with the liquid coffee mate.  All in all, we almost used the whole bottle within a week.  (Between 3 adults, we probably drink about 12 cups of coffee a day.)<br /><br />Like the other reviewers have stated, when the bottle gets close to the end, there is quite a bit left and you can't get it out without cutting open the bottle and pouring it in the coffee or transferring it into another container. That SUCKS!<br />I have not had an issue with the pump getting stuck...Probably because we use it every day.<br /><br />Other Comments:  The creamer came with a tip on it that points the stream of cream downward (not pictured with the bottle.)  I still have to do some testing however I'm not sure if 1 pump with the tip equals 1 liquid creamer cup as pictured on the bottle.  I do know that three pumps with the tip on it equals 1 tablespoon, so I'm able to get an accurate calorie count. (Unless you at �'s way down the bottle and the pump won't pump out.)  I also need to figure out if at all there are any cost savings compared to just buying the big bottle of liquid creamer and using sweetner.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy it again for the following reasons:  Taste great, quick, easy calorie counting, and no refrigeration needed so my coffee stays hot.

review/text: I love this stuff.  It makes any coffee the best.  I first tried it at one of the local casinos and had never been able to find it anywhere.  I even wrote the Nestle company to find where I could buy it.  It seems it's not available for retail sales.  It's available through commercial vendors for office type businesses or places like a casino that have beverage counters.  I'm glad I thought to look for it here on Amazon.  This is a great product and although it's pricey once shipping is added, it's well worth the cost for that great cup of coffee I can now enjoy.

review/summary: Prefer to International Delight
review/text: I have used International Delight's (ID) hazelnut coffee pods for years but balked at the fact that they forced me to use more creamer than I wanted (how do you save a 1/2 pod at work) and the cheapest price I could find was at Publix.<br /><br />I bought this huge pump bottle of Coffee Mate hazelnut creamer at Sam's Club for less than $15 and figured I'd just put it out at the communal coffee pot if I didn't like it.<br /><br />Turns out I actually like the creamer better than ID's and one pump of the stuff is the perfect amount, less white and less sweet than a full pod of ID's.  I also like that it has less than half the saturated fat of ID's creamer and I'm using less. If it truly provides 300 pumps, it'll also cost me 1/2 as much as the individual pods.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it really can't compete with the taste of real cream.

review/summary: great idea
review/text: My husband does like cream in his coffee but hated to take it out of the refrigerator and did not like to open the little creamers by the coffeemaker as it was too much of a hassle and just drank his coffee black until I discovered this when visiting my daughter...he loves it and it is great to leave it on the counter.  It has just the right amount of sweetness for him but others like to add a bit of sweetener to it to taste.  Too bad it went up in price but you do get 2 of them and I haven't found them anywhere else to buy, so we usually keep one and give one to our other daughter who lives locally.  It's really great for the summer not having to worry about spoilage like I do with real cream.

review/text: This is by far our favorite creamer choice in my office.  Instead of the awful powdered stuff or having to deal with a million little plastic cups, the pump is easy, doesn't require refrigeration, and the cream is actually creamy and tastes good.  Although it is "sweetened" it is not very sweet.  Most people that put sugar in their coffee, still do.

review/text: I have to have my coffee every day, and I have tried many different kinds of flavored creamers.  This is the best, hands down.  I keep one at home and one at work.  It adds the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, but it still tastes like coffee.  I wish it was more readily available.  I've seen it for sale at other places (Sam's Club, for example), but Amazon definitely has the best price.  I highly recommend it for all coffee drinkers.

review/text: I purchased this because I was in a dorm room without access to a refrigerator. I had a Keurig coffee maker and I thought that this would be a great addition to my morning coffee. Well it was for the first week or so, but this industrial container is very hard to drain on your own. After a few weeks, it started to taste strange and I noticed that each shot of creamer was loaded with trans fats, which grossed me out so much that I threw the rest away and even tossed the second bottle. Yuck.

review/text: For years I just bypassed this stuff at the checkout counter because it seemed like a gimmick, but holy cow I tried it and it's great.  The advertising is right that you don't really crash when it runs out, and it doesn't make you as jittery as drinking a huge cup of coffee - for me, no jitters when I drink half, a little jittery if I drink the whole thing.  I also find that it has a mood enhancing effect. The taste is fine, like a concentrated energy drink, but you're not drinking it for the taste.  The price on Amazon is the best I've found online if you consider shipping - although watch out because they change around the prices for different flavors, I guess depending on their stock.

review/summary: Works wonders!
review/text: I tried the DynaPep version of an energy shot, and while I feel it did the job, I experienced low blood sugar often when I was on it, as well as a few other side effects. I bought a 2 pack of 5 hour energy just to see how it works, I wasn't expecting anything other then a gimmick; it was sitting in my closet for a week or two.<br /><br />Anyway I finally took the plunge and drank one- I only need to down a half a bottle- it does the job. I drink a half every day I work to get through the day, and let me tell you, I have missing cartilage in my hips and it was getting really uncomfortable to walk. I tried taking glucosamine, but due to my diabetes, the glucosamine was a no no. The only thing I found that works tolerably well is Aleve. But 5 hour energy puts Aleve to shame. If I have hip discomfort I don't feel it at all. I have all the energy I had when I was in my 20s, and for me a half bottle seems to last 8 hours or so!<br /><br />No problems whatsoever sleeping, in fact, due to all the activities it enables me to perform, I think it aids sleep! No swings in my blood sugar levels. All in all, perfect. So far...

review/summary: I'm surprised, but so far it works for me
review/text: A friend mentioned that 5-Hour worked well for him.  I had been tempted before to buy a bottle & try it, but I don't drink a ton of caffeine products and I almost never drink "energy" drinks.  So I was very skeptical and wary of this product.  But after my friend said he liked it I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />My problem is I'm either a zombie in the morning, or I feel good in the morning but by about 3:30pm or 4:00pm I can barely keep my eyes open.  I decided to give this a try to see if it made any difference.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it does seem to work for me.  I've noticed that it works better when I'm tired in the afternoon than when I'm tired in the morning.  I don't feel extremely jittery and I suppose the claim of no crash is true because I never feel like I hit a wall.<br /><br />I usually notice it takes 10, maybe 15 minutes to kick in.  And I generally go from feeling like I'm going to nod off at my desk to at least being able to keep my eyes open & get some work done.  I don't feel like it gives me any super powers, hyper concentration, etc., and I don't feel like I have so much energy I'm bouncing off the walls.  Just a little boost.<br /><br />The flavor is okay; these are berry and it's kind of tart - like the flavoring is covering a bitter taste.  It's not awful, but it's not a flavor I would want to savor in a drink, etc.  I chug the thing and try to taste it as little as possible.<br /><br />I think it's kind of pricy for what you get, but I'm also not using it every day.  Maybe 3 days a week.  So in that respect it's no worse than a daily Starbucks habit price-wise.  If I ever start to build a resistance to the combination of stuff that makes it work, I wouldn't try drinking MORE to counter act the effects, I would probably save my money and try something else.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm happy with how it's working for me for now.  I do feel more alert and I don't feel jittery or like I have nervous energy to burn.  When this batch is gone I'll probably get more, but I don't know that with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Pros<br />* It does give a boost of energy and I don't feel like I crash<br />* The flavor isn't as bad as I would have guessed<br /><br />Cons<br />* They're expensive, even buying them in bulk<br />* The flavor isn't as good as I would have hoped<br />* Doesn't give INSTANT energy.  Takes 10-15 minutes and is gradual<br />* Possible to build a resistance to the product? More time/use required to know for sure

One day I was really dragging and felt like I was going to fall asleep<br /><br />at the wheel while driving to pickup my son so I pulled into a Walgreens to see if there was something I could buy to wake me up.  I quit drinking soda's a long time ago and cannot stand the<br /><br />taste of coffee so I decided to purchase a 2 pack of 5 hour energy to see if maybe it did work and I was wrong all this time.<br /><br />To my surprise it actually did make me feel peppy!

When I pick my son up I take him the gym and the '5 hour boost' has really helped my workout.<br /><br />I haven't seen any negative side effects and I have been taking 1 per day, Monday - Friday for 2 months.<br /><br />If you add the shipping and handling fee, Walmart has the same price as Amazon.

I've also noticed a big difference in my focus.  I can concentrate on my back muscles a lot better when doing lat pulldowns and things when taking this as oppose to not.  Def would recommend this, and use the subrscibe and save.  No other price on the net touches it.  I've been getting mine shipped for $19.83 for the past few months.  Thats less than $2.00 a bottle where my gas station by my house sells them for $3.99.

review/summary: Skeptic, converted
review/text: I saw the commercials over the years and said "yeah, right".  But somewhere along the way, i decided to give it a try.  Like an earlier reviewer, i cant stand coffee.  So i tried it and was amazed how effective it was.  Of course the primary ingredient is caffeine and i had never used caffeine products as a performance aid.  A cup of coffee is much cheaper, but if you cant tolerate coffee, then this is the way to go, even if you have to pay quite a bit more.  I make it a point not to use it daily, but just when needed, so i dont build up a tolerance for the caffeine.<br /><br />Having said that, i raved about 5-h-e to a friend of mine.  He said he had tried it and was disappointed.  After further discussion, it came out that he was a big coffee drinker.  So if you already drink high caffeine products such as coffee, you probably wont get as much of a positive effect, if any.  For everyone else though, highly recommended.

review/text: I have a horrible time sleeping which produces even worse mornings for waking up.  I set my alarm a little early before the time I need to be awake and drink a bottle of 5 hour energy.  Within minutes I am fully awake and ready to start the day.  It works great and I do not have any side affects, spikes, or energy drops after the 5 hours.  I recommend the product highly!

review/text: Reading the reviews of this products it seemes like it can affect people in different ways. With something with such a high levels of vitamins you have to be careful as an overdose of vitamins can make you feel quite unwell and even be dangerous. You certainly should stick to the reccommended doses.<br />I found it did give me a bit of an energy boost, but I felt it didnt give me the long term boost in energy that I was hoping for, plus I didnt really like the taste all that much.<br />Since I prefer all natural supplements I thought I would give a all natural supplement called Gene Eden. It gives me the long term boost of energy that I was hoping for and with it being an antiviral supplement it helps me recover from colds and viruses much quicker.<br />If you interested it is also available on amazon Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula

review/summary: A college student's best friend!
review/text: I can honestly say that these shots are sometimes crutches for me when I feel like I'm about to just pass out. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering and these things are PHENOMENAL for when you need to get some late night studying done, or if you need some energy to focus on exams. It takes about ~20 minutes for me to feel the effects, and it lasts for 3-4 hours for me. I feel only slightly jittery, but there's a significant difference in the amount of focus you get from a 5 hour energy than your regular energy drink. I suppose the B vitamins are to thank for that! And of course, the best part... NO CRASH! I highly recommend these if you are a college student. They are VERY beneficial and will give you that extra boost and focus you need!

review/summary: 5-Hour Energy Saves the Day
review/text: 5-Hour Energy is probably one of the best energy drinks out there, and the effectiveness is simply amazing. I'm an vegetarian high school student taking 4 AP courses. Sometimes, I get so loaded with work that I have to go to bed at two or three in the morning and still wake up at seven. Before I used 5-Hour Energy, I'd sometimes doze off or fall asleep in my classes. However, after I used 5-Hour Energy, my life changed. Now, with only 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy, I can power through the school day and swim practice easily without feeling tired at all. My grades rose significantly, and I can actually pay attention in class. Just yesterday, I managed to power through the day with only 2 hours of sleep and 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy. The extra energy that the product gives you is definitely worth the money. The product is simply amazing.

I was having a hard time waking up in the afternoons (you know, after lunch, the work day just drags sometimes and puts you to sleep) but taking one of these gave me the energy I needed to get through the days. I buy them bulk like this from Amazon because they're cheaper than buying them anywhere else. Although, I have been wondering lately what the long term disadvantages are to taking these on a regular basis.<br /><br />Either way, good product and some great tastes if you're not a fan of coffee.

As a suggestion; I like to mix my 2oz shot with Gatorade or juice of some kind. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor, so mixing it helps it blend and allows for taking in the energy over a longer period of time.<br />Only real disappointment with the product is the higher price, but it's not bad if you buy it here!

review/summary: They need taste testers
review/text: I don't know who essentially taste tested these little shooters but they're awful in my opinion.  It's comparable to drinking soda syrup.  I think that it's best served chilled or diluted with ice.  I bought this at a gas station during a lunch break and had it room temp. NOT RECOMMENDED in my opinion of course. To each their own.<br /><br />Despite the taste, I believe this product really works.  I'm not jittery or shaky as described in the product info and so far the only negative effect has been a very slight light-headed feeling.  I also notice that alot of tension keeps returning to my shoulders but that could be just me.  Overall, I highly recommend this product a try for anybody not overly sensitive to caffeine.

review/text: I have used many types of energy drinks/pills over the years. This product actually works, but in reality you do not really know what is in there. One of their ingredients is "Proprietary Blend". It doesn't get vaguer than that. However, if you're looking for sustained energy it does do the job. Do you get exactly 5 hours of energy, probably not? Do you get a little jittery, yes sometimes? Everybody is different so results will probably be different than mine.

review/text: My job demands a lot of energy and attention to detail.  I find this to work very well for me when I am feeling physically and/or mentally tired. Some people, like my husband, may not respond to this stuff so try a bottle from the store first.  I don't think the taste is so bad.  I have te berry kind and it just tastes like a sugary drink to me.  It does have a bit of a "kick" to it, that is the B vitamin. I can't swallow pills, so I have had to chew my vitamins which sometimes have a bitter or tangy taste.  I would recommend this to a friend to try.  I get no crash from it, no "withdraw" either.  Some energy drink will give me a spell of extrem sleepyness if I have been drinking them for a while and stop, I don't get that with this stuff.

review/summary: Amazing strength at such a small size
review/text: I had to pull an all-nighter but I hate the huge cans of energy drinks (sometimes they make me go to sleep). I saw the commercial for this product on tv and decided to try it out. The berry flavor's not too bad-it tastes like liquified smarties. I also liked the fact that it promises that you won't crash (I had several classes and work the following day) and that it's only 4 calories. The no-refrigeration is also handy when you only want to drink half of the bottle.<br /><br />I drank a whole bottle after deciding that half wouldn't give me enough juice to stay up. I did start feeling it after a couple of minutes and I actually lasted for about 8 more hours before I started feeling drowsy. There was no crash and I didn't feel any bad effects. I definitely recommend this to anyone and plan on using it again.

review/summary: Five hour energy - expensive, but seems to work.
review/text: I'm a big health proponent, so I look down on most of the "energy" drinks out there because looking at the bottles tells you it's mostly sugar and caffeine. Not to mention most of them taste like crap.<br />These little gems seem to contain mostly vitamins, some natural supplements and some caffeine. I'm a big coffee drinker, so I know when I've had to much, like when I'm jittery or my stomach gets queasy. But I don't get a big rush from the 5-Hour drinks and I don't get a big crash.  It's pretty even for several hours, and it helps keep me focused and a bit more motivated.<br /><br />I usually take regular vitamins and some B vitamins and a little coffee to keep me going, but the formula in these things does the trick on it's own. Wish they were a bit cheaper so I could take when I want - the price limits me to just a couple times a week when I need to get things done.<br /><br />Probably won't work for everyone, but worth a try. Amazon has the best price I can find - down the street I can get them 2/ $5 but that's the best - otherwise they're way over priced.

I am now fully awake and glad I didn't try to drive home sleepy once again. All the flavors have a bite, but I put mine in the fridge when I get here and it takes the edge off the flavor by the time I'm ready to shoot in the afternoon. I don't notice the transition from sleepy to awake or when it's wearing off. This stuff rocks! Too bad about the cost tho.

To counteract that, and also to make this expensive product last longer, I've drank only half a bottle at a time, which really seems to be spot on perfect for me. Great product!

Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.

review/summary: Preferred energy drink!
review/text: This drink is the best energy drink I have found!  I like it because I can feel it work.  It works fast and sustains my energy without giving me shakes or making me hyper.<br /><br />I recommended it to a friend who regular drinks the big cans of energy drinks, and now he drinks these.  It is a lot less of all the bad stuff like artificial sweetener or sugar, and the same amount of the important stuff Vitamin B, caffeine, etc.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/summary: A Nice Way To Level Off
review/text: I've tried quite a few energy drinks, mints and pills and have favorites in each area.  5-Hour Energy isn't my personal favorite as far as energy drinks go, but it is quite exceptional.  When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night's sleep.  I wasn't going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn't going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It's somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to "take it up a notch" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice.

review/summary: After first, just okay
review/text: The first of these I had was wonderful.  I got renewed energy and it helped me get through the rest of the day.  I've drank most of the rest of these and generally it gives me a bit of energy and does help me get through the day, but not like that first time.  There is one other time I did get the same blast as the first time.  Maybe it has to do with how much I've eaten before drinking this?<br /><br />The best thing about this, though, is there's no drugged feeling.  And I sleep well the night after I take this.  All-in-all, it's been a good boost for me, though.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone like me who gets very tired in the afternoons and needs a boost of energy.<br /><br />I do like the berry flavor of the caffeinated version better than the citrus flavor this comes in.  But I haven't found the decaf version in anything other than citrus flavor.

review/summary: The commerials are true! Feel like working out for a change...
review/text: My friends think I am crazy when I rave about it, but my husband and kids know that this stuff has been life changing for me! For the past 15 years the only thing I drink 99.5% of the time is water because I prefer to eat my calories. :) But I see these 5 Hour Energy bottles EVERYWHERE, so I wondered what was the deal? Then I saw the tv commerial and figured I would at least try it, because I am an avid runner always trying to get my 5k time down, so how awesome would it be to FEEL like running rather than dragging myself to do intervals sometimes. I've been drinking it for the past 3 months and it has worked wonders for me! I'm telling everyone about it.<br /><br />I found for best results I drink half the bottle around 11am and the other half around 4pm usually after eating a snack or drinking a protien shake. This gets me through an tough afternoon workout, and once I get home from work I have the energy/motivation to cook, clean, do laundry, or whatever tasks I would normally just lay around and wish I had the energy to do. Even more amazing I can stay up about an hour later each night, but still wake up early, feeling refreshed and ready for a morning workout. I always drink some about 30 minutes before a race and usually before a hard workout.<br /><br />Cons....Well, I did find that if I drank it on an empty stomach I would get some pain in my right side. :) But I'm still sold on it!  I sometimes just drink half a bottle all day and don't drink it on the weekends or on vacations because it's not good to be addicted to anything (but Jesus) :), and you don't want to get immune to it because you want it to work when you need it to plus it is kind of expensive...<br /><br />Honestly, I haven't found anyone else who loves it as much as I do, but I still say TRY IT!

review/summary: Good taste, terrible value
review/text: 5-hour tasted fine and I felt somewhat "energized" as I hoped. But, 5-hour, like all of these energy drinks (Monster, RockStar, RedBull, Cocaine etc.) is obscenely overpriced liquid caffeine. As of 2008, there have been no large scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials that show the ingredients, other than caffeine, in these "proprietary blends" actually work in healthy humans as advertised. When pressed, the manufacturers cannot come up with the data that support their hype. To date, only good ol' caffeine is the only over-the-counter drug that does what people who buy these overpriced snake-oils desire. So, save your money. Buy ANY drink you like and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill like max strength NoDoz or Vivarin. Cheers.

review/text: I know the effects from this are different for everybody, but this is just how it was for me.<br /><br />Within ten minutes of taking the whole bottle, I noticed that my heart was practically beating out of my chest. Within thirty minutes I felt exhausted to the point that I had to plop down on to the couch. If that was not a crash, then I don't know what is. But within a few hours I felt normal again.<br /><br />I would say that for the money it is not worth it. Just take a multivitamin and a strong cup of coffee.

review/summary: Not for Me!
review/text: I wanted to try this product to see what all the buzz was about with the "5 Hour Energy" drinks.  Seemed like everyone is using them.  I had trouble finding them in local stores, so I ordered this box from Amazon.  The price was good and there were no problems with the shipping.  There is only enough caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee in each bottle.  I'm a huge coffee drinker, so this product did not work for me.  I did not feel any more energy when I needed it and it did not keep me awake or alert.  In fact, I got stomach cramps and diarrhea for several days after using this product.  I'm physically fit and do the P90X workouts. I eat healthy food and rarely have abnormal bowel movements or diarrhea.  As a test, I did not use this product for a week and felt fine with normal bowel movements.  I then used another 5 Hour Drink and the next day, diarrhea again!  It may work for other people, but it did not work for me!

review/text: On this particular flavor: I find this is the best when chilled or at room temp, with Lemon Lime as a second.  I keep these in my desk at home and at work.<br /><br />I've been a fan of 5 Hour Energy for a few years now, and it certainly works.  I have noticed there are particular times when the coffee buzz is more preferred than 5 Hour, but basically, I use it like so: Before noon, I'll use coffee.  When that afternoon/post lunch slump comes on, this is the perfect time for HALF of a 5 hour energy.  It's enough to keep you awake.  If you really need to get up and go, drink half, and then an hour later, drink the other half.  Of course, YMMV, but I've converted a few of my co-workers to using this method.

I would recommend persons use it only under special circumstances like a long automobile trip for a lift and safety. I would also recommend drinking only 1/2 the product and saving the remainder for later. The manufacturer recommends use within 72 hours of opening the bottle. For those who are having a caffeine problem the smaller dose or the decaffeinated product would be better.

review/summary: The Oomph That I Needed
review/text: Being a busy SAHM of 3, I occasionally get the days where I want to wave my white flag & give in. But that is never an option. Usually my go to source is coffee, but depending on the level of energy I need, several cups might be the answer. But that answer has me going to the bathroom more than I have time for. So I was pleasantly surprised when I drank a 5 Hour Energy instead. I had more than enough energy to make it all the way to bedtime! I never felt bogged down or sluggish at any point. & I had zero issues when it came to falling asleep. Not to mention not having to stop to use the bathroom every 30 minutes. Definitely my saving grace! & although it is very tart, I have to admit I'm a fan of the berry flavor.<br />"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360."

review/text: 1am, downtown going-away house party. I've been here for hours and I'm starting to lose energy but the fun is only just starting.  What to do?!?  So I drank a 5-Hour ENERGY� and never gave my tiredness a second thought! I felt naturally alert and energized like the night had just began. If I had chosen an energy drink instead, I would have felt jittery and bloated due to the carbonation in the drink. Just a little sip is all I needed. I would definitely buy this again!  FYI, I also snacked on a banana at the same time.  I think the two together really gave me the shot of energy so I would suggest hungry 5 hour energy fans to try this healthy snack along with the drink,<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360.

review/summary: Lives Up to Its Promises!
review/text: I'm a busy mom who normally runs on coffee, but 5 Hour Energy is a great lower calorie alternative. I don't get the shakes like I do after one too many espressos, and I can tuck one of these into my purse easily. A quick shot and I'm good to go, without the possibility of coffee stains or spills.<br /><br />I was amazed at how long it lasted as well. I was used to having to refuel my caffeine tanks around 2:30 pm, but I took the shot at 7 a.m., and kept going until 6 without a hitch.<br /><br />I may have to start buying by the case. Great product.<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360.

review/summary: Fabulous Energy
review/text: 5 Hour Energy is great for an on-the-go lifestyle because it is a quick shot to drink down. It is also conveniently packaged in a small, easy to store bottle that is perfect for your pocket, purse or gym bag. There is little sugar & caffeine so it keeps those yucky feeling crashes away. The energy it gives you is subtle yet helpful, comparable to a sugar rush I would get from drinking soda as a child. The only difference is that I don't feel awful afterwards. 5 Hour Energy comes in some yummy flavors too. Berry is pretty good but I do prefer the Pom. One star off because these could never replace a good old fashioned cup of coffee; but they are a fabulous alternate energy boost!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360

review/text: I wasn't a believer, until I tried for myself. I received a free sample from 5hour and smiley360. So I tried and wow. I don't understand how a little bottle could pack so much energy. No crash afterwards, no jittery feeling, no heart racing. Gave me the energy to get through the day when I was super tired. Would I recommend? YES!!! Again I received sample from 5hour and smiley360.com. No compensation and I never tried before. I have though bought since the sample and recommend to put in fridge b/c I like 5hour cold as I do everytthing I drink

review/summary: Morning Workout Booster
review/text: I like to work out in the morning, and at times it can be hard to jump out of bed when I'm tired. I've started drinking half of the 5-Hour Energy bottle as soon as my alarm clock goes off. By the time I put on my workout clothes and sneakers I'm already more awake, and the 5-Hour Energy keeps me going for a great workout! The berry flavor is my favorite, but I have tried others as well.  p.s I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY� from Smiley360 (the first time I tried it out).

review/summary: did not work for me unfortunately
review/text: I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I'm a pretty big wimp so I didn't do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!  I try to stay away from coffee and based on my own experience and research green tea extract is the most natural and effective energy booster I know of that I can take without any side effects.  Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: Great Source of Energy but Expensive to drink everyday : (
review/text: I've always been a huge fan of 5-hour energy drinks, but it's just too expensive for me to take on a regular basis, I know I tried! I've always preferred not to drink coffee, the only way I can stand it is if I overload it with sugar so that's kind of a bust. My co-worker who is a crazy health nut introduced me to this energy stack, Energy Booster Stack (90 Day Servings!) Better Than Jack3d, Red Bull, Monster, Hemorage, Caffeine, Rockstar Drink which I've been taking in the morning and really liking it. If you ever taken raspberry ketones, dmaa, or yohimbine extract then you know what I mean when I talk about an energy high that feels different from caffeine.<br /><br />I also like the cost, very affordable. I'll always be a 5-hour energy drinker here and there but if you need a consistent source of energy and are concerned with price, this is the most effective and cost effective energy booster I've found. Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: Tired of paying out the ying-yang?
review/text: After looking at a site that referenced 5-hour energy and finding out that NALT (N-Acetyl, L-Tyrosine) was an ingredient, I went to wikipedia to find out the other ingredients and lo and behold all five major cognitive-enhancing supplements (I'm including the B-Complex Vitamins here)including in this drink were the four that constituted my core stack for mental-intensive tasks (I substitute Alpha-GPC for CDP-Choline on occasion, due to it's effectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier . The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are "Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine". ALL which can be bought cheap on here and combined at 1/5 the cost. Not to mention you can split the caff. tabs in half when you're already "up" and don't want to risk the anxiety that comes with a full tablet, which consists of 200mg of caffeine. Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't "hate it", as it does work, but I "don't like it" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it. But that markup is straight nasty. Good luck!
