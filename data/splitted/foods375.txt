review/summary: The commonest hing
review/text: Unfortunately, this is the only asafoetida (hing) that is readily available in the US. It is preground and mixed with edible adulterants to make it easier to handle. Unfortunately, due to this processing, the quality is not high. While it will certainly work for your recipe, it is nowhere as good as the chunks of pure sap that are harder to find in the US. Search out the good stuff if you know a reputable spice merchant.<br /><br />If you're in NYC, I've found better quality hing at Dual Specialty Store in the East Village. It's still not as good as the super stinky chunks of Afghani asafoetida that I picked up in Varanasi, but it will do.

review/summary: Asafoetida is wonderful
review/text: This Asafoetida is great.  It does not smell very appetizing raw, but once subjected to heat it adds a depth of flavor that some compare to garlic or onion.  I think it's more subtle that that and adds a savory flavor that is unique to this compound.

review/summary: The Best Thing I Have Ever Put In My Mouth
review/text: I don't even know where to begin... this is honestly the best soup I have ever had... and out of a bag!!  The flavor is amazing... its spicy but sweet, tangy but creamy all at the same time. I am a texture freak and the texture of this soup is unbelievable... its everything you would expect from soup but so much more with added crunchy and mushy veggies. I was skeptical of the bag that this soup is packaged in... but it actually cooks better than heating your soup in a bowl (it is actually entire hot... no cold or warm patches)... Campbells also added flaps on each side of the bag (where it is natural to grab while getting it out of the microwave) that make it so you don't burn your fingers. Let's just say I am in love... everyone should give these soups a try... I will be going back to the store to purchase more flavors to try!!!

review/text: I just happened to see this item at the store when I was looking for Chunky soup, and decided to try it.  IT IS AWESOME!  It bursts with flavor and texture.

This stuff is really good.  (I hope it doesn't turn out to be "The Stuff".)<br /><br />NOTE: This item, like all prepared soups, is high in sodium--not recommended for the sodium-restricted.

review/text: Bought several of the different flavors of this new line of soups, and the Coconut Curry Chicken Mushroom was the first I tried. Soup was great, but I did have a bit of malfuction with the bag falling over in the microwave and about 1/2 the soup ending up getting thrown out. Next time I will pour the soup into a bowl before heating. I will be adding this to my rotation of choices for lunch.

review/summary: Coconut Curry Chicken Unexpectedly Amazing!
review/text: I saw these pouched soups while I was shopping at Wal-Mart and was surprised to see that they were not only Campbell's brand soups but how  out of left field the flavor choices were for Campbell's. While different, that didn't immediately make me confident that the flavors would actually be successful.<br /><br />I decided to buy only one pouch of the Coconut Curry Chicken to try it out. I like curry so if this worked out yay me! Well Yay Me! This was RIDICULOUSLY good. While it was heating in the microwave (as it said to do in the directions) the fragrant aromas started seeping out. I was shocked. This smelled almost exactly like when I make coconut curry sauce on my own. It smelled so fresh and authentic, the only thing left to doubt was the taste. Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together. And unlike Campbell's canned soups, where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat, here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts, the shittake mushrooms were small however, but not negligible.<br /><br />Seriously try it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. As for me I'm going to go buy a heck of a lot more.

review/summary: Yummm!... what a nice treat!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I can't stand hot chocolate mixes that you add water to .. for me, it must be made with fresh milk!  I recently read some online reviews on hot chocolate and this brand received rave reviews.  I've tried both the organic and the old world and both are fabulous.  The organic is a powder mix and the old world is chocolate shavings. I guess I'd say the old world is more intense and rich, but you can control the strength by how much you add to your hot milk. Both are definately worth the extra money and makes a nice holiday gift (with a couple festive mugs).  You can also find this brand at Whole Foods Market.

review/text: I like hot chocolate and I drink a lot of it.  Naturally, I have experimented with many different hot chocolate mixes, including the big national brands.  Lake Champlain hot chocolate is my favorite. The Organic and the Old World are very good, but Traditional is my absolute favorite and I used to make special trips to out of the way stores just to get it. The Aztec is an interesting spicy change of pace. Sometimes when supplies run out I have had to make do with other brands and you can just tell the difference if like a really chocolaty taste. I am glad that Amazon is finally stocking it.  Try it and compare.  Try it for baking your favorite chocolate desserts.  Their chocolate bars are very good as well.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SNYFAM">Lake Champlain Hot Chocolate Mixes</a>

review/summary: Cocoa Mojo : )
review/text: I was very lucky to receive a gift package of Lake Champlain hot cocoa mixes. Very lucky. The three varieties included were: Traditional, Mocha, and Aztec. Three wonderfully chunky one pound cans of hot cocoa mix. Oh, boy! This is an all-natural product without additives or preservatives. The Lake Champlain company has been reverentially producing chocolate goodness from its factory in Vermont for over 25 years. They offer a variety of chocolate indulgences, including gift baskets and gift samplers. In addition to the addictive hot cocoas, they also tempt you with truffles, caramels, chocolate bars and other items of divine decadence. The hot cocoa mixes are rich and satisfying, made with milk and soothing to the soul and the senses. The flavors of the mixes are so full-bodied that I even added spoonfuls of the hot cocoa mix into the batter for brownies, cookies, cakes and etc. I also made my own gourmet mocha madness mixes by combining the hot cocoa dry mix with instant coffee granules and powdered creamer. I had my own private stash at work, and the scent of my cocoa-powered coffee creations had others asking what I was drinking. I was benevolent and shared some of the mix. I think I started something ; )

review/summary: Larger kibble, Persian CANNOT get it into his mouth!
review/text: I honestly think I've been through the entire world's selection of dry cat foods.  The winner?  Purina Pro Plan's Salmon formula.  That's wolfed down entirely and no teeth marks in them either.  This stuff, however, he desperately tried to eat but could not because of the huge size of the kibble.  Now, I have had dog food that had a smaller kibble than this stuff has - but he really wanted to eat it so being the dedicated cat person that I am, I smashed a few of them and hand-fed them to him.  The guy just gobbled them up!  He just loves the flavor, but I can't buy it unless I take stock in Sears - all those hammers I'll have to go through just to break it up small enough for him.  Looks like this one gets to go back to the store as well. If you have a hefty 20 pound Tom cat like I had, then give this a try.  If not, try Pro Plan.

review/summary: Great product but it majorly leaked during shipment
review/text: Great tasty product and great price, but Roland has a packaging problem with the pail which had cracked and seemed too weak for the contents.<br /><br />The top of the pail was completely snapped off and the protective foil seal burst open during transit - the entire glaze contents spilled out like slime - Fed-X wrapped the box in a plastic bag to prevent further leakage. There was adequate bubble wrap from Amazon, but the box they used for shipping was too big and the pail had room to smash around inside the box. So, this is an EXCELLENT product, but Roland's plastic pail is just too thin.  Amazon is looking into the issue - I sure hope they resolve it!  And then I'll gladly order again.  By the way, Amazon's customer service Rocks - they are the best company to deal with when things go kapooey!<br /><br />** UPDATE: Ordered another one a few months later and it arrived in perfect condition with much better packaging.  It looks like Amazon resolved the shipping issue. Order with confidence.

review/summary: GREAT ROOT BEER - NO HFCS!
review/text: I bought 4 six packs of this brand at a local "Good Earth" store where I was seeking sodas without HFCS after being thoroughly disgusted that every single soda in the grocery stores where I shop had high fructose corn syrup in them!  I really liked this one! I bought the same amount of "Hansen's Creamy Root Beer" and a couple of "Virgil's Root Beer" at the same time--in hopes of finding a root beer my family liked minus the HFCS.  Both "Blue Sky" and "Hansen's" were winners at our house.  Half my family liked the "Blue Sky Creamy Root Beer" the best, and the other half liked "Hansen's Creamy Root Beer" the best.  I got the "Blue Sky" on sale at $.37/can. "Hansen's" was $.49/can. No after taste with either, just good old fashioned root beer!  Another thing we liked was none of these were so carbonated that they burned going down.  Plenty of fizz, but more like the old fashioned root beer I grew up with--anyone remember "Frosty Root Beer" or "A&W" in the mug--pre-HFCS days???  The "Blue Sky" brand was a tiny bit less carbonated than "Hansen's."  "Virgil's" was excellent too, very unique root beer taste, but more expensive at $1.45 per 12 oz. bottle.  Glad to see all three we tried, here on Amazon, which means you can get them wherever you live!!!<br /><br />P.S.  Another family favorite "Blue Sky" soda was their "Cherry Vanilla Creme Soda!"  Yum!  Serve them all ice cold for optimum flavor!!!  Also, loved "Orange Creme" (Like an orange creamcicle with natural orange creme flavor!)and Lemon Lime (Natural lemon and lime flavors!) These sodas are so good, you'll want to try all their flavors! We did, loved them, and our family is never going back to sodas with HFCS! Why aren't these in the chain grocery stores??? Thank you Amazon!!!<br /><br />P.P.S.  Blue Sky does make a no sugar "Creamy Root Beer" too.  It is sweetened with Stevia.  Not my choice, but I felt I should clarify the other review about that here.  The one I bought lists these ingredients on the label:  Filtered carbonated water, real sugar, natural root beer flavor, and caramel color (from sugar), citric acid.

The only difference here is the cake flavor. If you are a fan of yellow cake, you will probably like this. I saw nothing wrong with this.

review/text: I use this flour for making bagels- both white and one third wheat. The gluten made the crust very chewy while retaining a crunch. And the inside was very soft. This was a much better result than using all-purpose flour. I'm hooked.

review/summary: I love this flour!
review/text: I've been using KAF Bread and AP flour for a couple years now. I particularly like the Bread flour. I use it for making a variety of breads, but I mostly use it for homemade pizza. I am super-pleased with this flour and really enjoy using it. The quality is very good and always consistent.<br /><br />Before trying KAF flours, I did try other brands and was just not as satisfied with them as with KAF. So I will continue to use it as I can get consistent results from it.<br /><br />I especially like the bread flour for its 12.7% protein level. This makes it very easy to use. It is quite extensible and stretches very nicely. I can stretch it out by hand to make a 15" pizza dough and it doesn't seem to tear or rip.

review/summary: Revised Rating
review/text: At the time of my original comment, the product description did not appear to match the item that I received, in that it was advertised as 100% Wasabi, but the product I received appeared to have horseradish and mustard in it. So it seems that there may have been a mixup between the product and description, which may have been entirely unintentional and an accident. The product itself and description apparently have changed, apparently all for the better. So, I am changing my rating to a 5 star. I have to wonder if the color of the iodine-starch reaction produced is not merely based on 1) the amount of starch, but also 2) the ratio of iodine concentration to starch concentration to insure there is enough of each reagent to react, 3) the temperature, 4) the type of solvent, and 5) the type of iodine used. I did my test with a special low concentration organic iodine, Iodine Trichloride. That said, I'm glad that the seller has sorted this out and is now selling a product that matches its Amazon description. I hope everyone trys this product now, because it looks like a great deal for dried 100% Wasabi powder. Enjoy!

review/summary: Very Good REAL Wasabi - Highly Recommended
review/text: Sushi Sonic "100% Real Powdered Wasabi" is just that, real Japanese Wasabi with no additives. The product description was a little confusing but the bottle states "Ingredients: 100% Wasabi (Wasabia japonica)" and no other ingredients.<br /><br />The 1.5oz (43g) jar contains roughly 17 servings when mixed with water as per the directions. The wasabi is a fine light green power that on its own is fairly mild tasting. It mixes it into a paste fairly easily and does not tend to clump, but don't be lulled into complacence by the complete lack of "heat" immediately after mixing as it will develop a respectable wasabi kick after sitting 10 minutes or so.<br /><br />I really enjoy the flavor and it is more subtle than the normal horseradish based "wasabi" found in tubes and most Sushi restaurants. I think it is worth the extra expense for special occasions, but for everyday use the normal wasabi will do for me.<br /><br />Note that this is a "Product Of China", which might be a concern for some people.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: There good but not for me.
review/text: Ok, these taste great.  My wife and mother-in-law eat them all the time.  They both were on my case to eat these for a healthy balance diet. I researched and found a lot of good things about them. I don't have a problem going to the potty but thought Omega-3 was needed in my diet.  One day we went to the 99 cent local store and we found this brand there. I figure can't go wrong 99 cents, Omega-3 and if I don't like them my wife and her mother will definitely eat them. I purchased them took them home and ate for the first time in a plain yogurt. After about 2 to 3 days My intestine were going wild.  Violently moving about and cramping really bad.  I did not connect the dot "Duh" at that time. After 5 days it dawn on me this was the only new thing in my diet. I stopped eating them and after a few days the horrible craps went away. I was not allowed to be deterred, :(. So I took a much smaller amount after a few days same result.  At that time I was ready to call it quits, again I was coerced one more try! ;) This time I took about half a tea spoon every other day in varied ways. It took a bit longer but my intestine protested.  That was it for me, I began to buy Shelled Walnuts for the Omega-3 and my intestines are much happier.  Oh! As for why not just eat fish? I used to but Gout pay me a nasty visit. All other people who I know personally do not have this issue at all!  So please don't be deterred by my terrible experience. I gave it 5 stars because there really is nothing wrong with the product itself.  It seems to me that my body simply will not tolerate these. My advise, take it slow, specially if you have never eaten them before. PS I have eaten these in every imaginable way and dose, well my wife's imagination that is.

review/text: Honestly, I feel terrible writing this review because I searched and searched for an alcohol-free, liquid vanilla in a larger amount and really wanted to LOVE this product!  I bought this product specifically because I live abroad and needed a larger bottle and they offer this in 16 and 32 ounces.<br /><br />This product is very thick and tastes very strongly of chemicals.  I could barely get any vanilla flavor from it - and it makes my icings and frostings taste horrid.  The propylene glycol (not safe) just makes the product taste terrible.  It's listed as the second to last ingredient - but really - it just takes over any vanilla in the bottle.  And it comes out like glue into the measuring spoon and sticks!  Really a disappointment.

It has worked well as is in everything that I have used it in.

review/summary: It was a good deal but not likely to buy again
review/text: I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.

review/summary: You couldn't pay me to drink this!
review/text: I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is "supposedly" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.

review/text: After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.

By the way, it is also awesome as a mixer (or so i hear).

review/text: Summary:<br />This Zico is a weak shadow of its former self.<br /><br />Pros:  Bottle looks cool?<br />Cons:  Price, from concentrate.  Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.

review/text: I drink a lot of coconut water.  The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico.  Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.

I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids.

My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their "new" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.  Hope you don't make the same mistake that I did.

review/text: Love coconut water, really don't like this brand, kind of tastes like plastic.  Vita Coco and Naked is much better!  Will never buy it again!

review/summary: Tastes like plastic
review/text: I have bought the version in the boxes before, but thought the plastic bottles would be more convenient.  Unfortunately it makes the drink taste like plastic.  The plastic taste is very strong, and awful.  Stick to the boxed type.

review/summary: Never again
review/text: My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via "subscribe and save" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the "from concentrate" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying "top dollar" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the "liquid" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our "subscribe and save" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will "subscribe and save" to another brand that uses the real stuff!

review/text: I couldn't take two sips of this. Tastes like chewing on a plastic bag. I used to LOVE Zico in Tetrapak - what happened?? Now I have a case of this and don't know what to do with it!
