review/summary: Two Havanese Love These
review/text: I really like these Zukes (made in the USA) treats.  I break off small pieces for my 8 lb and 9 lb dogs.  They like the peanut butter flavor.  However, I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten.  (I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful.)

review/summary: I'm a believer!
review/text: Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I read the reviews and was dubious but my dog had stopped walking up the stairs and not jumping on the chaise to sleep at night. I started Zuke's Hip Action  a little over 2 weeks ago. Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: After a month, I am a believer
review/text: I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.

review/summary: My PUPPY loves these!  They aren't just for older dogs
review/text: I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit, they smell good to me too, haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically, and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life - there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China, and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.

review/summary: Absolutly a Godsend
review/text: This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!

review/summary: Hip Hip Hooray for Zuke's
review/text: We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.

review/summary: My 3 dogs love these
review/text: I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large breed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.

review/summary: Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog
review/text: I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.

review/summary: Fixed My Dogs Hip
review/text: I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.

Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and brittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!

review/summary: I like them. My dog doesn't like them so much.lol.
review/text: I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.

review/summary: Great for my older dogs...
review/text: I've been getting these treats for the last year for my two senior dogs.  Both have had various hip and joint problems in the past, but have not had any problems since they've been taking these.  And they love them!  I've tried all the flavors, and have not had a problem with them eating it.  They think it's a yummy treat, and get excited when I pull them out.  I would definitely recommend for anyone with older dogs.

review/text: My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!

review/summary: Best way to give glucosamine that I've found
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far "over-medicating" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats.

My dog loves peanut butter and these treats are full of peanut butter as well as 300 mg of glucosamine and 50 mg of chondroitin which keep her 6 year old joints flexible for those long hikes and swims.<br /><br />And Zukes donates a portion of its proceeds to the dog & cat cancer fund every year and makes all its products wheat,corn and soy free-who ever heard of a vegan dog?

review/text: I bought these for my 13 year old pug, who has very bad hips and arthritis, and very few teeth.<br /><br />Poor ole girl, she's a sweetheart, but getting around was hard on her.  These are soft, so she can chew them with no problem, and while she's still stiff if she's been sleeping a long time, she loosens right up once she starts moving.<br /><br />She was on Metacam, which worked just about the same, but is waaaay more expensive.  I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win-win-win all around for us!<br /><br />Almost for got to mention....she loves them!

review/text: Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once - when she takes off at top speed.  So I now get her treats with glucosamine - so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best - she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints - vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good-for-her treat.

No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages, no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.

review/text: My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.

review/text: I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.

But he loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, so I thought I might as well give Hip Action a try. And he loved them!<br />They are also a great value - I actually took the time and counted the number of treats in a 1 lb bag - and I got 64, which means more than 2 months of hip protection for dogs under 46 lb (you only need to give one a day).

review/text: I have been buying this product since sep 2010.  My dog loves this the most.  He sometimes refuses other treats but never this.  So it must be good.  It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training.  We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price.

review/text: My mom purchased a variety of treats for my dog to try.  He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.

review/text: I love all of the Just the Cheese snacks.  They can be a little salty, but otherwise, they are a yummy crunchy snack.  There is a bit of an oily aftertaste, but even my kids don't mind that, they all like these as well.  I love the fact that there is no soy (so bad for you!), no gluten, and pretty much just cheese.  For anyone looking for a crunchy snack that is also good for you, try them.  (and natural fats are good for you!  don't fear natural fats.  you should avoid man made processed fats, like in most snacks)

review/text: Doesn't really taste like cheese. It tastes like burnt cheese. Try this before you buy. Put some cheddar cheese in a pan and burn it. Don't just fry it up, burn it. If you like that you might want to try this. The flavor would be comparable but remember the texture will be different as Just the Cheese Rounds are much drier (not greasy).

review/summary: Outstanding
review/text: I thought this product was excellent.  I felt the only way it could have been improved was to put 6 bars in every box, instead of 5, and make them larger.  To begin with the product is organic which is an excellent start particularly in today's world of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO's) in just about everything you can eat: see my blog at[...] to learn about GMO's.  The bars were soft and chewy with just a very subtle hint of both cinnamon and vanilla while it contained a fair amount of berries.  These were an excellent buy which I would have continued to purchase except for the $11.00 delivery charge: terribly prohibitive. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028MO8R4">New England Naturals Organic Antioxidant Chewy,Granola Bar, 5-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Not good
review/text: Mostly for the novelty, I have tried many, many of the packaged, pre-ground foreign coffees available on Amazon, and I must say that very few of them are worth your time or money.  They have obviously been sitting around or in transit for a very long time, and you would be far better off just buying the same crummy coffee at the super market where it would probably be much fresher.  The packaging is certainly cool and fun, but it just is not worth the awful taste and very high shipping prices.

review/text: Not too long ago, I received these 16 brownies as a gift. They were probably some of the best brownies I ever tasted. Knowing that the person who sent them to me has impecable taste, I wanted to see just how much she actually paid for these things...yeah, yeah...I know...<br /><br />Wow! When I found out how much these things cost I wanted to download a brownie in my pants. I couldn't believe it! I began to think that this person shouldn't have spent so much money on me, that she could've just as easily bought me some Oreos and it would've been okay, that I didn't deserve this, yadda yadda yadda....<br /><br />And then I stopped myself before I went completely over the edge. I told myself, "Wait a minute, John...this person obviously bought these brownies because she appreciates and values you as a friend, that you are worthy of the best, that it was money well spent..."<br /><br />If you should be lucky enough to receive these as a gift, don't look  a gift horse in the mouth and lead it to spilt milk and crumbled cookies, appreciate the fact that somebody wanted you to have something very special (and very delicious)and then call them up and tell them just how much you appreciate them and love them and value them as a friend, unless they're a stalker, then quickly call 911, but let Love be known and shown.<br /><br />So, to my beautiful friend who bought me these, thank you so much. Thank you saying it with chocolate.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings<br />john "the Light Coach"

review/summary: Yummy...but sadly broken
review/text: These are very, very good.  They have a nice, hard pretzel crunch while still being a light chip.  It is like having only the outside of the pretzel without the dense inner bits.  Unfortunately, this large bag isn't the best transport container for them.  They arrived quite broken up, which doesn't hinder the taste any but makes for a difficult "reaching into the bag" experience to say nothing of the unsightly mess they would be if tipped out into a bowl for company.  Best to save the bulk packaging for your own eating pleasure and then, only if you like broken bits.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.
