review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower-priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.<br /><br />This is what I found:<br /><br />- In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn.<br />- While Great Northern has a 6-ounce portion compared to Wabash Valley Farms 5.5 ounce portion it exceeded the capacity on both my Whirley Pop and Stir Crazy poppers.  (Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.)  So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping.<br />- Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped.<br />- Great Northern Popcorn had a "chewy" texture to it.

review/summary: Not tender
review/text: We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product.  The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad.

review/summary: Chewy Popcorn
review/text: I just bought a new Great Northern 8 ounce Popcorn Machine and I bought the 6 ounce packs and 8 ounce and both taste chewy. This popcorn seems to have a lot of moisture in it because all the windows tend to steam up really good. I also tried leaving the doors slightly open and metal try completely open which helps with the steam but the popcorn still comes out chewy. I'll try ordering a different brand.

review/summary: Not as good as everyone claims.
review/text: I read all the reviews before giving in and buying. After all the comments on how good this tasted I really expected to like it. For the price it better be as good as the reviews claim. I was completly dissapointed. So far I have tried 3 bags, all of which have been stale and not what I expected at all.  Nowhere near the taste of movie theater popcorn either. I think I'll stick to buying plain kernels from the grocery store. The only positive thing I can admit is that it did pop up nicely in my popcorn popper.

review/summary: popcorn is too salty
review/text: the pre-measured bags are quick and convenient, but the popcorn is too salty for my taste buds. I made several batches for my daughter's slumber party. Some kids liked the popcorn, and some kids thought it was too salty and didn't eat it. Unless you like very salty popcorn, I would look for another brand. Lastly, it wasn't as fresh tasting like at our local movie theatre, which uses Orville Redenbacher. I'm going to google and see what Orville Redenbacher makes for kettle popcorn makers.

review/text: I wanted to have the best movie theater tasting popcorn for my son's upcoming carnival birthday and was very disappointed in this popcorn.  I love salty foods, but this was way too salty even for me.  And the tast was just off.  It tasted chemically or artificial.  Based off of the positive reviews, I bought to boxes - 48 packs - and it's just a waste because they will go in the garbage.

review/summary: High Calories, Fat but Less Good Taste
review/text: This popcorn is distinctly different tasting from the Country Time, and not in a good way! My initial thought was that it was "stale"  though in date, and both of us (hubby and self) got an upset stomach from eating it, like you do at the movies if you add their "butter". I would return this if I could I've had it since July, and just opened the pack last night) and would not recommend it, at least not for the big home popcorn machines. AND, has a higher calorie count and fat count than the Countrytime, too! (Sort of explains the upset stomach, I guess!)

review/text: Popcorn oil solidified once it was in my house. This does not do so well in my new popcorn machine. I have to squeeze the oil out of the compartment then microwave it to make it liquid,  then I have to put it in my popcorn machine. Also when my shipment arrived the box the popcorn was in, looked as though one of the oils had leaked. Not sure if this is normal for all of this to have occurred but I'm just not happy with the way the oil has set up like concrete in the package. I was not happy with the popcorn purchase.

review/summary: good taste, solidified oil
review/text: I was concerned when I received it because of the oil being solidified.  I looked for a date on it to see if it was old product, but did not find any dates.  I tried one package to see how it tasted.  It tasted normal.  It was a little more difficult to get out of the package since I had to do just the oil first to let it melt before putting the popcorn and seasoning parts of the package in.  It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.<br /><br />So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.<br /><br />Added 11/28/11 - I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt.  It's pretty salty for me, so I just don't use it all and it tastes fine still.

review/summary: Saturated Fat Nightmare
review/text: With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.

review/summary: Great Popcorn
review/text: Great product, its really more popcorn than the 4 oz kettle can handle at one time, you have to experiment with it to figure out how much to use, I use about half of the corn for two popings and use very little salt.  The oil can be divided into two batches and it works out really great.  Makes a lot of popcorn, plenty for two or three people, and has a good taste, comes packed in a handy packets and just cut small corners out to pour the oil and popcorn into a measuring cup to put into the kettle.  Use the salt sparingly, there is way to much salt if you use it all.

review/text: I will not be trying any other popcorn for as long I can get this from Amazon. The 4oz portion pack is perfect for our whirleypop and the popcorn is great.  As I have read in other reviews the oil can be solid while in the package, but once you put it to the heat it melts fast.  We have had a couple packages that had a few extra unpopped kernels, but no more than any other brand we have tried and with the subscibe and save price you can not beat the price.

review/summary: Results **Depend on how you make it**
review/text: I used my Stir Crazy popper - almost every kernel popped, but it's quite dry for an oil popped corn. I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel.

review/summary: Great popcorn, a little salty
review/text: The popcorn arrived the same day as our new Great Northern Foundation 8 oz popcorn machine. While using these packets couldn't be simpler, they are just a smidge too wide for easy access to the preheated popping bucket. You're having to dump the whole package, oil, salt and popcorn, into the bucket from the side, and if the oil, salt and popcorn were all in one compartment, it might be narrower and easier. That said, we found the popcorn that came out of these prepackaged packets just a little salty for our taste. In future, we'll probably make it without using the whole packet of salt. The butter-flavored salt is a great idea, just maybe a little less of it.

review/summary: Movie Style Popcorn in the Comfort of Your Own Home
review/text: We just LOVE this popcorn. We got introduced to it when I bought my wife a true popcorn machine (Great Norther 4oz Chaplain Popper and Cart). The popper and popcorn have been a wonderful addition to our home for the last 4 years and I have no plans to change any time soon.<br /><br />The simplicity of the popcorn kit packaging is great. Premeasured popcorn, salt (with butter flavor), and oil (which is solid at normal ambient room temperature make this such an easy job of making popcorn any time we want it.<br /><br />Turn on the kettle and let it heat up for 3-5 min. Squeeze out the oil and add the salt. I will say that if you use all the salt, it's quite a salty batch. We have found that using about half of the salt is about perfect. Wait till the oil is heated through and then add the popcorn. Pull down the kettle lid and wait.<br /><br />Part of the fun for us is the magic of making our own popcorn. Our kids just can't not watch the machine do the work.<br /><br />Now if one wants to complain that not all the kernels pop, I would argue that it's likely a combination of both the popcorn and the dimensions of your popping kettle. Do we lose some kernels? Yes (about 10%). Do I care? No. And why don't I care...<br /><br />The TASTE and Quantity! Even with loss of some kernels, this 4 oz package will feed 2 adults and 2 kids (5 and 2) for an entire movie. Just the perfect amount for us too. As for the taste - I don't know how anyone can eat any other popcorn once they've tasted Great Northern. I simply refuse to eat the microwave popcorn that we might make because we just don't want to clean the popcorn machine after use. The secret to that amazing, delicious, and addictable popcorn taste? Coconut Oil. It seems like such a simple ingredient, but the popcorn flavor that it helps to generate is simply amazing.<br /><br />The price is extremely reasonable too. And when I found that you could sign up for Amazon's subscribe and save, I signed up immediately. What a way to keep our machine fully stocked with the most authentic flavored movie popcorn ready for our weekly family movie night.

When I first ventured into popping my own, I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>. I then went to the store and bought some popcorn oil and some kernels. I was so disappointed when I had it.<br /><br />Then a friend recommended this popcorn to me, and I absolutely love it. I've bought two boxes so far from Amazon. It tastes as close to anything I've ever had to movie popcorn (minus the butter).<br /><br />A few suggestions if you use this with the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />- If you use a Stir Crazy, the 4 oz. packs will fill it up perfectly.<br />- Separate kernels on both sides of the rod in the middle, and distribute the oil in 2 portions on either side also.<br />- Enjoy!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+ All ingredients in 1 pack.<br /><br />+ Tastes incredible.<br /><br />+ You can use as much or as little butter salt as you want.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Coconut oil is a bit sticky when you squeeze it out of the pack.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.

review/text: I purchased a 6oz popcorn machine so of course I thought I 'd give this pre-measured product a try. When following direct instructions off of the Great Northern product you will be left with 20-40% kernals unpopped which is VERY disappointing.<br /><br />The fix for this is to only pop half of the contents (salt, oil, and kernals) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half. Annoying? Yes. But this will reduce your unpopped kernals from 20-40% remaining to about 5% or less.<br /><br />This brand taste amazing but I will botch it a star for this small issue.

The popcorn isn't terrible, but I didn't think it was great either.  This popcorn has a bit of a manufactured taste.  I prefer the hot air popper with melted butter on it.  I also find it easier to control the salt when I use it from a shaker.

review/summary: Tasty, but too many unpopped kernels
review/text: Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much.

review/text: Bought this popcorn along with the Elite Popcorn maker.  Great taste, I like the fact that it has three separate pouches so you can vary the seasoning (I like mine salty so I use it all).  Can't be any easier to use, no measuring, popcorn & oil stay fresh because they are sealed.<br /><br />Came back to add my review and got some great tips.  Such as actually heating the oil first instead of dumping it all in at once.  Also liked the tips of adding the oil before turning on the popper (always worried about melting plastic or burning my hand) and pouring the popcorn/seasoning into a scoop to add to the popper.  Thanks to those who took the time to post the tips!

review/summary: Excellent machine for the price.
review/text: This popcorn is very convenient and tastes great.  The coconut oil is in a solid state, which it should be.  Once it hits the kettle it melts.  You heat your oil, and then add the popcorn and salt.  I do recommend putting the popcorn and salt together in a scoop or something for ease of emptying into the kettle (if you have a popcorn machine), otherwise it gets messy.<br /><br />I read several reviews that using all the salt makes the popcorn too salty.  We didn't find that at all.<br /><br />There were several unpopped kernels, so I'm not sure if this is the popcorn or not being used to our machine yet.<br /><br />This is perfect for our 4 oz popcorn machine and leaves the whole house smelling like a movie theatre.  Yum!

review/text: Convenient, cost effective and delicious.  I went to the local grocery store and for the same amount of money, the ingredients weighed about half the weight of Great Northern.  Worth the buy and I recommend it.<br /><br />I just don't recommend following the included instructions.  Before you turn it on, add the oil, then turn it on and add the rest of the ingredients ... you won't accidentally melt the plastic package. IMHO

review/summary: Popcorn
review/text: This popcorn isn't bad tasting, but doesn't live up to the claim that it's like theater popcorn.  I think it's a little pricey based on the quantity of popped corn and the overall quality.  However, it is very convenient and hasn't gone to waste when made.  This full pack produces about the same corn quantity as half to three-quarter cup of Orville's.  If more of the corn popped (lots of kernels wasted) and/or the price was reduced, I would give it a 5 rating because of the combination of decent quality, good price, and convenience.

review/text: Like others have said, this stuff tastes great.  What I could find out is if it popped well in a microwave bowl like my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BBAHV8">Fireworks Popcorn Microwave Popping Bowl and Gift Set,  Gift Box</a>.<br /><br />I emailed Great Northern Customer Service a couple times with that question and a request for a sample if the didn't know so I could try it.  They never responded and I took a chance and ordered some.<br /><br />This time taking a chance paid off.  It pops great and tastes great too.<br /><br />My only issue is the 4-ounce pack overflows my popcorn popping bowl.  My next order will be for their 2.5 oz packs.<br /><br />Bottom line: regardless of the size, this stuff tastes tons better than any other popcorn I've tried and works great in a microwave popping bowl.

review/summary: Good product except
review/text: This is a pretty good product in the fact that everything is pre mesured for you.  Just cut the top and pour it in.  The only problem for me was there was waaaay to much salt.  And since it is already in the product the heat makes it stick to the popcorn so each piece has a lot of salt.  You almost need to drink a lot of water during and after you eat this.  If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.  But if you like salt, its perfect for you, the best example I can think of, is that it does taste like and smell like movie popcorn, but purchase a movie popcorn and then pour about another 3 tablespoons of salt on it.

review/text: Pops up light and fluffy, and tastes just like what you get at the theatre.  If you have purchased a home popcorn machine as we have, you will appreciate the convenience of the pre-measured packets.  No guess work involved; just great popcorn every time.  We buy it by the case in 4oz and 8oz packages.  This way if it's just my husband and myself, we make a 4oz package, and if we have company over, we can use the 8oz.  I'm sure it would be cheaper to get plain popcorn and oil, but this is well worth the cost, and isn't the popcorn what you like about going to the movies anyway?

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I use this with a Whirly Pop and it is a great combination!  As others have said...tastes and smells just like theater popcorn, due to the use of coconut oil.  Very few un-popped kernels, and total cooking time is just about 3 minutes on medium heat.  I just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking.  I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.<br /><br />I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.<br /><br />We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.<br /><br />I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2-3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.<br /><br />*Update* 8/25/11<br /><br />Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.  You will not go back to microwave popcorn again.  While cooking, you will swear you are in the movie theater!

review/text: I love this popcorn so much.  I pop it in my Whirley pop stove top popper, and it comes out perfect everytime.  I just had a bowl and it was scrum-del-e-icious.  nowhere near as greasy as microwave popcorn, but still just as flavorful.<br /><br />Update 2012<br /><br />The first time I bought this popcorn it was so delicious, but I noticed when I received the 2nd box a few months later it wasn't nearly as good.  the popcorn was a little stale.  I thought it was because I switched to a new popcorn popper and it was over steaming the popcorn.  Now after reading some of the current reviews I am a little scared to buy it again.  That's too bad cause it was once really good. I see the price has gone up a few dollars too.  So now you have to pay more for lower quality.

I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un-popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.

review/summary: Bad Taste! &lt;-- I was confused!
review/text: I was very confused when I wrote my first review. Yes, everything below was true but it was no fault of the product. The KEY to kettle style popcorn machines is proper temperature. The process to get big kernels is simple and is as follows:<br /><br />- Let the kettle heat empty for 5 minutes.<br />- Put popping oil in kettle and let it heat for another 5 minutes.<br />- Put in popcorn and salt and wait for the magic to happen.<br /><br />All of the problems I was experiencing below went away when I followed the procedure above. Popcorn pops real big and fluffy. I'm all out of corn right now and will be giving the Chiefs Choice brand a try to compare the two.<br /><br />--------------------OLD INACCURATE REVIEW BELOW -----------------<br />I had read a few other reviews here on Amazon that said this popcorn wasn't very good (Coconut oil flavor) and I have to agree. I thought I could suck it up and eat all of it but there is no way I will be able to do it. It's just nasty plain and simple. I'm using a Paramount popper and it works very well.<br /><br />My findings:<br /><br />- Kernels pop real small and are very chewy. Not big light and fluffy.<br />- Overall taste of the popcorn is not very good. Popcorn has a nasty coconut oil flavor to it. I thought maybe reducing the premeasured oil to half would help but it still has a coconut oil flavor to it.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty bad and maybe I just ended up with an old batch or something because when you taste the popcorn you could swear that it's old. I'm hearing there is a brand called Chief's Choice and I will order some of that today and give it a try.

We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long.

review/summary: Really Great Popcorn!
review/text: We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a "popcorn machine" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.

review/text: I purchased the 2.5 bags for my  new Whirley Pop pan. I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie.

review/summary: Minor's Chicken & Beef Bases---Far Superior to Canned Broth &Cubes
review/text: I first found Minor's bases at BJ's and quickly decided to chuck buying canned chicken broth and beef broth and boullion cubes. It's cheaper than canned, too, if you can find a local source. In using these to make recipes, I add the appropriate amount of base for the amount of water or liquid called for and do not add any salt called for by the recipe until the very end, when it can be added to taste.  I note the amont of salt added and record it for future use.  This is especially applicable in recipes calling for boullion cubes (horribly salty usually).  Of late, in talking with restaurant owners,I learned Minor bases a what many restaurants use.  The base keeps in the refridgerator seemingly forever.  Search the internet for sources or, better yet, ask your local restaurants if they use it and where they get their supplies locally.

review/summary: THE BEST SO FAR
review/text: This is amazing stuff. The Minor's bases were recommended to me by one of the instructors at the New Orleans School of Cooking. He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken, and both are superb. They have a flavor that is identical to home made stock. The stuff keeps forever. Give any of the Minors bases a try and you will be sold. The only problem is the ridiculous shipping charge from Soupbase, the vendor. It's almost as much as the cost of the product.

review/summary: Heart palpitations after eating
review/text: I had heart palpitations after eating gravy made with this.  I searched for all of the ingredients online and found that disodium inosinate seems to cause this for a LOT of people.  It also contains MSG, which I don't have a problem with, but I know some people do.  Why can't companies make food that doesn't have crap in it?!?!?  $20 down the drain, I probably should have looked at the ingredients first.

review/text: I was surprised to find wasabi peanuts for such a low price, but after receiving them I now know why.  These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor.  These would best be described as one part tiny, stale peanut and four parts crunchy wasabi coating dumped into 2 one pound bags.  Learn from my mistake: pay a little more and get less for higher quality in a tin.<br /><br />On a positive note, the vendor was prompt with the shipping.  Their other products are probably good, but this one is not.

review/summary: Cheap knock offs are not that hot
review/text: I remember years ago the first Wasabi peanuts I bought from a local gourmet food store were 100 times hotter then theses cheap knock-offs.<br />They were truly wasabi covered peanuts. These peanuts are covered first in a layer of soybean paste than a very thin coating of wasabi for color. I would say they are using a green food colored horseradish not true wasabi.<br /><br />If you like something crunchy and very mild heat, buy these. They are like eatting M&M candies. I read the other reviews before buying and all said "Wow these are HOT! I say Bologna!<br /><br />Which goes to show... you can always make something cheap.

I let the bread machine do the hard work then remove the dough (it is very wet, sticky dough) and place it in a lightly greased plastic bowl.  I let it rise  for a couple of hours, punch it down, then place it in greased & floured bread pan, let it rise about an hour.  Bake at 400 for about 25 minutes.  It comes out great.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
review/text: I purchased one of these packages recently to try out a new bread maker and I highly regret that I did. 1 & 1/2 pound loaf? Yea right, I followed the instructions to the T and What I got was a 4-5 inch tall ball of baked doughy mess. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I was already skeptical that such a small amount of dry ingredients could make a 1 1/2 pound loaf of bread and they just proved me right. It was so horrible and inedible that at first I thought the problem might have been my bread maker. Then I tried the "Light Oat Bread" recipe on allrecipes.com on the same exact setting and what do I get? a PERFECT loaf of bread with very little more effort/time.  Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of bread mix, or just look up a Bread Machine recipe on one of the several sites on the internet that have them, Buy 10-15 dollars of ingredients (instead of wasting nearly 3 bucks on this crap that gives you an inedible less-than-half-loaf) and that will probably be enough for at least 10 loafs of bread.

review/summary: So good!
review/text: This is one of the most delicious teas I have ever tasted! It's so smooth, rich and flavorful. A perfect dessert tea. The best way to enjoy it, in my opinion, is plain/black. That way, nothing interferes with the flavors and you can taste each one distinctly - the black tea, caramel and vanilla (despite the name, the caramel is stronger than the vanilla) - as well as experience how they interact and balance each other. It truly is a harmonious blend.<br /><br />For an extra sweet, creamy treat, I sometimes like to add Half & Half and one sugar cube (about 35 calories total). It tastes amazing that way too, though the sweeteners do mute the caramel and vanilla a bit.<br /><br />Whatever you do, please do NOT add honey to this tea. I did that twice and ended up with a bitter cup. (Honey brings out a sharp burnt flavor in the caramel.)

review/summary: Tastes like cheap pancake syrup
review/text: I bought this tea after reading all of the positive reviews. I have long enjoyed Lipton's Caramel Vanilla Truffle tea and read that this tea was better, so I gave it a try. It smells awesome when steeping, but that is when the positives stopped. It seriously tastes like a thinner version of cheap pancake syrup. There is no vanilla flavor whatsoever, just a strong butter aftertaste. If you haven't tried this tea before don't buy the 6 pack - get a single box. I understand that different people have different tastes, so know what you are getting into before you commit to 6 boxes.

review/summary: The best tea ever!
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for about 6 years. I drink nothing else but an occasional water. I have suggested this tea for several people try. Nine out of ten people agreed with me. I drink it hot or cold. The aroma it gives off smells delicious. If you drink tea a little or a lot you will love this one.

review/summary: bigelow vanilla caramel tea
review/text: This tea is very good.  Even when just adding the hot/boiling water the aroma is very pleasing.<br />I enjoy it without sugar and sometimes with milk, though it is not sweet to taste.  I recommend<br />it.

review/text: This is delicious tea and my Safeway no longer carries it.  It was about the same price to order it and it came right to to door.  What could be more simple?

review/text: I love this tea. If you are a tea drinker and haven't tried it, please do so. This tea is hard to find where I live in the South. Very good price when ordered like this from Amazon.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Thought I would love this product but found it to be rather tasteless.  I always use Vanilla Chai and love it!!  Have to use 2 teabags to get a decent flavor with the caramel.
