review/summary: Great Food for Cats with GI issues
review/text: My cat loves canned food, but after an ounce or so she has screaming diarrhea. I've tired every food known to man (and cat) without success. BUT, then came Best Feline Friend canned cat food. I've been using the formula with aspic and my Stella can finally enjoy her canned food. She enjoys every variety of BFF, and I limit her to one 3 ounce (any more than that and she has GI upset) can daily and she's fine. This is quite an improvement over all the other brands we've tried. Two thumbs up for Best Feline Friend.

review/text: Hands down one of the finest Hot Sauces you can purchase. I've purchased (and thrown away) many different Hot Sauces of different types and brands and haven't found any (yet) that come close to Marie Sharp's Fiery Hot Habanero Sauce. It has an excellent flavor with just a hint of garlic and a good bite. I couldn't recommend this one enough.

review/summary: My favorite hot sauce.
review/text: Sheer perfection!<br /><br />Not too vinegary, not too hot. Great habanero spiciness but with some flavor that you can actually taste.<br /><br />Her sauces have really spoiled me. I'm finding Mexican hot sauces (Tapatio, etc.) too smoky and not spicy enough, I find Tabasco is great for Cajun/Creole cooking, but it's too vinegary and watery to use on my meals. The thickness, spiciness and flavor of Fiery Hot are perfect for me.<br /><br />I also enjoy Marie Sharp's "Belizian Heat", but I find it a little too watery, and not spicy enough.<br /><br />Only thing better than eating a tasty meal with Marie Sharp's hot sauces is eating a meal in San Pedro, Belize with Marie Sharp's hot sauces. Some Mayan chicken or a huge, fresh fish burrito from Waraguma's with Marie Sharp's was something special.

review/text: I was thrilled to learn that this novelty candy actually tastes like mustaches. To most people, that would be horrifying, but I used to have a dearly beloved boyfriend...who I stalked for 15 years...that had the most glorious mustache. After he disappeared leaving no possible trace, I often became nostalgic and sad over not being able to kiss his beautiful mustache as I stood over his bed and watched him sleep at night...shards of broken glass from his bedroom window still sticking painfully out of my limbs. This was a great substitute. Don't worry, I'm working through my issues now. My prison psychologist says I'm making great progress.

Beverage is like ginger ale on steriods.  Love the taste, especially if a wake up at night with a bad taste in my mouth.  A couple swigs followed by some water to rid the sugar, and my mouth feels better.  The small bottle is sufficient since the taste is strong, spicy, with a tinge of a hot peppery feel.

review/summary: Tuna with Taste
review/text: When I was a little girl, my mother always bought tuna packed in oil.  She never bought tuna packed in water.  I did not find out why until I had a tuna sandwich at school, it had no taste!  There was a very faint hint of tuna flavor, but mostly what I could taste was celery, mayonnaise and bread - not tuna.  From them on, I did not like tuna sandwiches, at least made from tuna packed in water.<br /><br />Tuna packed in oil got harder and harder to find as people were under the impression that the water packed variety was "better" for you.  Not so, according to [....] "It has been shown that tuna packed in oil mixed with 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise is actually lower in fat than tuna packed in spring water and mixed with 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise. Starting with tuna packed in oil allows people to use less mayonnaise to achieve the desired consistency and taste, thereby cutting down on fat and calories and providing a better tasting salad."<br /><br />Olive oil, of all the oils, seems to be the most healthy. "Olive oil contains the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid, antioxidants such as vitamin E and carotenoids, and oleuropein, a chemical that prevents the oxidation of LDL particles. It is these properties that are thought to contribute to the health benefits of olive oil" [...].  It's pretty tasty, too.<br /><br />So now we have the best of both worlds here, tasty tuna that's good for you, too!

review/summary: It's cheap, and it's bad for your cat.
review/text: I was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed Meow Mix. Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the "baseline," and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable). Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch.

review/summary: Very cheap, poor quality
review/text: I've had my cat for four years now, and I've almost always fed her Meow Mix because its inexpensive, and its what my family used to buy to feed her and other cats we've had in the past. Since she seemed to favor it, I continued to feed it to her after I had moved out of the house, taking her along with me. Although I'd clean up her messes before, she tends to vomit almost all the time (or maybe I just notice it more?)<br /><br />What I've come to realize that she vomits up this food at least once or twice a month. Once I did some research on cat nutrition, and then looked at the ingredients in this food, its really not what you want your cat to be eating...<br /><br />I know it'll be more expensive, but I'd rather give my cat something that she can digest and enjoy, with quality, than give her something cheap that makes her sick.

review/text: Made the big mistake of buying Meow-Mix.<br /><br />Cat vomited (as all cats sometimes due) after eating Meow-Mix.  Unfortunately the cat vomited on carpet.  Usually unfortunate but no big deal - just clean it up.  WRONG!  Meow-Mix has red food dyes that will not come out - even if you start cleaning right after the event.  We have tried three different cleaners and a carpet machine.  We still have two big red/pink stains in the carpet.<br /><br />I called the MeowMix customer service number and asked for some help on how to clean their red dye out of the carpeting.  They told me to use a carpet cleaner - Really?  Wow. Insightful.<br /><br />I asked them why they put in apparently un-cleanable red dye in the cat food when they know cats are virtually color blind (for reds apparently) and when the cat pukes it is going to ruin their customers carpet.  They said market research indicated the human buyers prefer to see a red, meaty, color and their was nothing they could do about it.<br /><br />Yeah, how about not putting the red dye in or using another red dye?<br /><br />Through almost and entire 25lb bag of MeowMix out in the trash and purchased Iams which is no issue to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.  Don't buy MeowMix unless you live outdoors.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Makes my cat puke 1-2x per week.
review/text: I've been feeding my wife's kitty Meow Mix for at least a couple of years--because it's cheap and I don't care enough about the cat to spend more money on cat food.  Now, I'm annoyed enough at having to clean kitty puke that I'll spend money to make it stop.<br /><br />I'm changing my cat's food after reading that Meow Mix is mostly of corn and tends to make cats puke, often.  My cat overeats, then pukes, Meow Mix a couple of times a week.  I can minimize the puke by giving her a 1/4 cup twice a day, but we have 2 cats and the other one is very active.  Since they both have access to the same food bowl (cat door), it's inconvenient to keep the bulimic kitty away while normal kitty eats.<br /><br />A couple 20 lb. bags ago, kitty ate not-Meow Mix.  I don't recall her puking while eating that food.  Now it's time for more research.<br /><br />I'm changing cat foods when this bag runs low.  I'll also start weighing the cat food to find out how much she's eating at a time and per day.  If the puking stops with new food, I'll reintroduce meow mix and see if it returns.  I'll stop blaming Meow Mix and update this review if I find that bulimic kitty pukes with other food.<br /><br />If your kitty pukes Meow Mix, please post a review and spread the word.

review/summary: This food makes her vomit :(
review/text: I have a 5 yr old cat that has a sensitive stomach and when I fed her this food she vomited all over our house! She loves the taste of it just the vomiting afterwards is what I do not like. So, today I bought her a small bag of Iams to try for sensitive cats, though a little more pricey...I feel comforted knowing she is not gonna be throwing up all night. I won't be purchasing meow mix again.

review/summary: Animal cruelty
review/text: Meow Mix is in the top five worst things you can feed your cat. What should be a filler in most cheap cat foods is listed first on the ingredient list. So if corn is the main product, then cheap meat by-products are the filler? Exactly where is the nutrition?<br /><br />Also, on the vomiting thing. We used to have cats growing up, and while my mom didn't know any better, we fed them this food often. One of our cats would vomit frequently (almost every day) and I vividly remember walking through the house and stepping in large piles of red-dye vomit from her stomach rejecting this mass-marketed cardboard garbage. It would stain the carpet and we'd spend more time cleaning up rejected cat food than we did feeding it.<br /><br />Look, if your cat is vomiting, it's obviously not good for them. Most poor cat foods a cat's body will at least tolerate, but if they can't even keep it down, well, you do the math.<br /><br />Meow Mix's dry food should be taken off the market. It's unhealthy, unethical, and harmful to animals.<br /><br />If you're looking to save money, spend money on a medium-high grade of cat food. You won't spend as much on litter and your cat will get full faster. Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLWC4">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat</a> for starters. You can find it at most fleet stores or you can choose to order it online. It's only a couple bucks more than this garbage and it's 7x better for your cat and your cat's health. Don't put your cats through what mine went through growing up.<br /><br />If you love your cat in any way shape or form, you will avoid this food.

It's funny to hear 60 cats asking for it by name at supper time. The only con I have is the price has gone way up. My kittys don't understand.It makes it harder to set an example for others to do TNR when its to expensive...Still it is a great product because my cats are fussy and do ask for it by name...Delightfully Dori Denver CO.

review/text: I love Sumatran coffee. With great hope I ordered these pods. I find the flavor of these pods to be no more than regular coffee. Didn't taste any hints of Sumatra grown coffee. Was very disappointed. To me it tasted like a cheap dark bitter French roast coffee. I was looking for that coffee that would give me that "wow" taste but these miss the mark. I have found better but was on a quest for the best available. I used to buy another company's pods but they stopped calling it Sumatra Mandheling and the flavor had changed. I now think that these are overpriced for the quality. Of course, taste is subjective. Hopefully others who have tried these will comment.

review/summary: Good Stuff, good price
review/text: I recently bought this at Costco, and really liked it.  It is a nutty grain, has a nice consistency, a chewy texture.  It cooks 3 cups water to one cup of grain.  You cook it somewhat like rice, but can drain off excess water.  I have not tried other brands, but this one seems inexpensive (3 lbs for 16 dollars as opposed to 1.1 for 8 dollars on Amazon) compared to other brands.<br /><br />I enjoy cooking it and putting uncooked vegetables on top with various sauces, as well as using it as a side dish.  You can use it as a rice substitute, and I have also used it in salads and have incorporated it into my wheat bread.

On the other hand, it's so good, every time I run out I want to kick something. Both me and my 4-year-old go through tons of this stuff. It's got a great texture and flavor. Also, at only 90 seconds in the microwave, I don't have to worry about picking something less healthy just because it's quick. I like it with a splash of truffle oil (my other unfortunate expensive food addiction).

review/summary: Beware BPA- microwave safe?
review/text: What caught my eye at Costco was the brand SEEDS OF CHANGE- ORGANIC.<br /><br />I wish I had not wasted my money and had researched this product first.<br /><br />Be aware that the convenience of microwave food could be harming you and your children. Food or drink containers made from #7 plastic should be approached with a good deal of suspicion. The bag doesn't say anything about BPA free!<br />Plastic #7: This number basically means "everything else"-composed of plastics which were invented after 1987.  Polycarbonate falls into this category, including the dreaded BPA. So do modern plastics used in anything from iPods to computer cases. It also includes some baby bottles and food storage containers which resist staining. Use of #7 plastic is at your own risk, since you don't know what could be in it. It is difficult to recycle #7 plastic and most curbside recycling programs won't accept it.

review/summary: Warp Speed Quinoa, Tasty but Overpriced
review/text: After hearing about benefits of quinoa, I stumbled across this product in Costco. It struck me a bit expensive but I decided to give it a try anyway. While the rice/quinoa blend is quite tasty, the product is overpriced given what bulk rice and quinoa cost. Personally, I don't shop organic so any premium for this attribute is something I don't value. What is valued is the speed of preparation. These pouches can be microwaved in 90 seconds. Just rip a small vent, place in the microwave and 90 seconds later, you have a meal. No water is needed.<br /><br />The taste is superior to rice alone in my personal opinion. There is a notable taste difference compared to other rice-dishes, so the added variety could be worth the price premium for individuals who don't have the time cook rice and quinoa conventionally.<br /><br />One of the touted benefits of Quinoa is the protein content.  Yet, this product only has 6 grams of protein for every 240 calorie serving.  This is a lower protein/calorie ratio than whole grain bread.  Protein has four calories per gram, which would mean that 240 calories of pure protein could yield 60 grams of protein.  Realistically, high protein foods would have four to six times as much protein as this product per calorie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy, high carbohydrate snack or small meal, give the Seeds of Change quinoa/rice a shot. Longer term, you would be much better off making a similar dish using bulk incredients at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Fast preparation<br />Tasty<br />Potential health benefits<br /><br />Cons<br />LOW protein content<br />Expensive

I would have NEVER ordered only 3, 8.5 envelopes because the shipping is prohibitive.  I always buy in bulk to save time and shipping fees.  Now I had to file a claim after speaking to an English-challenged, Amazon customer service rep (who confirmed she's in the Philippines) who couldn't understand or answer my questions.  I don't know about anyone else here, but I do not need this type aggravation.  I buy a lot on Amazon but may rethink that now that I know that yet more American jobs have gone overseas under one of my (previously) favorite company's direction.  Money is power, I ask Amazon to bring all jobs back or I may direct my buying power elsewhere, even if it costs a me little more.

review/summary: Don't waste your money...
review/text: If you like rice, quinoa or garlic then don't buy this product. I love quinoa and quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course.The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. In the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this.

Yes, that is why I bought it because the first 2 ingredients are fruit puree.<br /><br />So this is what the first 4 ingredients on the actual package are:<br /><br />"INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, WATER, SEEDLESS BLACKBERRY PUREE, SEEDLESS RED RASPBERRY PUREE"<br /><br />guess what the 5th ingredient is?  "NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"<br /><br />some other ingredients on my packaging that aren't listed on Amazon are "CELLULOSE GUM, MALIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE, CARRAGEENAN, GUAR GUM, XANTHAN GUM, RED #40 AND BLUE #1"<br /><br />Hold on a second!!!  That is a HUGE difference, I thought I was buying a product that was mostly puree with some "beet sugar" to sweeten it but instead I bought 2 large bottles of Sugar with water in it and a small amount of fruit puree added, and then artificial flavoring!  Bait and switch technique for sure!  Amazon.... why????

review/summary: More fruit than sugar
review/text: It's easy to make your own wonderful yogurt smoothies w/ this stuff at a fraction of the cost, and there's no high fructose corn syrup like in the commercial brand smoothies.  I use my own homemade yogurt made w/ organic 1% milk and usually add some fresh or frozen blueberries w/ it, and I put about half as much syrup as it calls for.  That makes a fairly healthy drink.  It's also yummy in vanilla soy milk.<br /><br />And, to correct the previous reviewer who claims it has more sugar than fruit, the label does list both the pur&eacute;ed berries as the first two ingredients on my bottle, meaning that there is more fruit by weight than sugar, which is listed third.<br /><br />I used to buy Smoothie Blast at Costco, where it was a little cheaper, but they don't carry it anymore, so I'm glad to have found it on Amazon.  Plus, Amazon has more flavors.

review/text: I switched to an Ayurvedic hair care regimen nearly a year ago. This product along with other herbs (like Brahmi, Amla, Neem & Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder) when mixed with Bhringraj or Neem oil acts as an effective treatment against brittle hair, hair loss, and dryness. I use this mix as a deep conditioner, and apply it to my hair every three weeks. My results? Stronger hair that's no longer brittle and major growth (compared to when I wasn't using this product).

review/text: I am not exactly sure if this worked in my hair.  I can't really tell if my hair felt cleaner or not, I do know it was a bit difficult to wash out.  I used this alone in place of a shampoo.  I think next time I will try this with my mud wash (which will hopefully give it more effort).  I don't know if this is worth purchasing again.  But we will see the second time around.  Maybe I need a new technique to use, but I didn't want to use it like a conditioner like many do because it is suppose to clean your hair.  So we will see.

review/summary: Great Kitten Food!
review/text: After experimenting a bit to find dry food all three of my felines would eat, and after reviewing and researching ingredients and labels, I landed on Blue Buffalo's kitten food.  My oldest cat, KatKat, age 3, will sneak eat the kitten's portions.  I don't think it hurts her. All three are healthy, trim, with shiny coats, abundant energy.  I free-feed this food and supplement with wet food in the a.m. and p.m. (amazingly, the best wet food I've found so far Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, Flaked Fish & Shrimp Feast; it has good ingredients and seems a good value for the price; I am currently waiting on a delivery of Best Feline Friend Canned Cat Food, Tuna Too Cool Recipe--will post a review when the furry ones had a chance to taste-test it).

review/summary: Unfortunately, count me in for "stinky poops"
review/text: I had high hopes for Blue Buffalo Kitten food. I feed all my animals high quality food, my 3 dogs are on Nutro Ultra Holistic (small breed), and unfortunately there is no equivalent for cats. I narrowed my food choices down to Blue, Innova, and Wellness. You get the most Blue Buffalo for the money so that is what I decided to go with. Within days of bringing my 4 month old kitten home from the humane society he developed diarrhea. I chalked it up to stress and switching foods. Imagine my surprise when the diarrhea never went away. I wanted to see if anyone else was having the same problem. Google "Blue Buffalo kitten diarrhea" and you will see others having the same issue. If it's not diarrhea it's smelly poops in general. I wish I knew what was causing this, if it's an ingredient he's allergic to or something else. I just started him on Innova and will update if the diarrhea subsides.<br /><br />My kitten seemed to enjoy the food though, he would gobble it up no problem, life source bits and all. The small kibbles make it easier for a mess to be made if you have a messy eater. If you are going to try this food, just monitor their feces for changes in consistency and smell, as this food has been shown to cause issues in some cats. If my kitten wasn't having issues on this food I would probably give it 5 stars for value, flavor, and ingredients.<br /><br />Edit: After a few weeks on Inova the diarrhea has completely cleared up and not returned! It was definitely Blue Buffalo that caused his issues. I guess this food really isn't for all cats.

review/summary: Allergic? Food gone bad? I don't know, had to go back to Merrick.
review/text: I was excited to use Blue Diamond again because of the reported quality of the ingredients. My old kitty wouldn't touch it- we tried with "trial bags" - so I was excited when the new kitten was home and it was time to get her some food that wasn't Purina cr+p.<br /><br />WHOOO BOY - do I resonate with the reviewer who's poor kitty had stinky poo. As you know, kitties are very clean, and they don't like to stink anywhere. Poor little Sky kitten had the worst farts I've smelled, and that means a human too - and loose stool, she stopped having healthy bowel movements and often cried when she was in her litter box. It was either the treats or the food - and since the food smelled icky, we took a few days and transitioned her to the Merrick Before Grain Chicken. (we kept feeding her the treats so we could find out in a singular fashion what product was causing her distress). As soon as she was on the Merrick for four days - no more stinky kitty, stinky poo or loose stool.<br /><br />Sorry Blue Diamond, I tried!<br />Now I have this huge bag of food, and no idea what to do with it. Sigh. It's like tossing money down the toilet.

review/summary: Thank you Blue!!
review/text: Our kitty is 5 months old, and we got him when he was 11 weeks old. Since day one, he's had terrible gas! We were using the cheaper dry cat food because i was convinced cat food was cat food, but after trying Purina Kitten chow, Meow Mix, Purina Kit and Kibooble, Whiskers, I've realized they're not all the same and that it really is worth spending a little more for a good quality dry cat food. After researching all kinds of dry food online, and being desperate for this cat to stop with the terrible, smelly gas, I decided upon Blue dry kitten food because of its high quality, all natural, no junk added ingredients, and after about a week of him eating this consistently, NO MORE GAS!!!! It's a miracle! His coat is beautiful and shiny, he's lively, energetic, and just a very healthy, non smelly cat! Fabulous product!! Highly recommended by our cat, Tom, and his owners who are no longer afraid to have him sit on their laps or even be in the same room as him :)

review/summary: Three 14-week-old kitties
review/text: Firstly, this is WAY too expensive here on Amazon. My local mom-and-pop pet store has this for $17 for the 7 lb. bag.  I regret getting this here, as I feel a bit ripped off. Two of my kittens are doing fine, but the third is having some major diarrhea, and after doing some research, I suspect it is this food. I am in the process of figuring it out what exactly is the issue. Besides from the Amazon price, and my one sick cat, this food is great. High quality ingredients, and kitties seem to like it!<br /><br />UPDATE 8/18/2012: I believe it was this food that was causing my little kitty to slide into first, where she then proceeded to feel a'something burst. She stopped having issues once we switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X49XC">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Formula, 15 Pound Bag</a>. Also, I gave her a squirt of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8WOC">Nutri-Vet Probiotics with Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Cats, 4-Ounce</a> down her throat, and sprinkled it on her new food. Using the probiotics was probably part of why she got better, but I also really think getting her off the Blue Buffalo helped. Kitty is now slid'n into home WITHOUT feelin' something foam!<br /><br />I am still keeping this review at 4 stars because I know this is a great product, and my little one was just overly sensitive.

review/summary: Great kitten food
review/text: When I first received my kitten, we started her on Science Diet. Noticing her stool was not solid(and that it was not a product of changing her diet), we brought her to the vet and discussed possible options.  One thing we considered was slowly transitioning her diet to Blue Buffalo Dry Kitten food.  After we switched her food, the loose stool issue was resolved and she was a happy, healthy little kitten again. We consistently used Blue Buffalo Kitten on our two cats until they reached a year old and did not have any problems whatsoever. Not only did they not have any issues, but they also loved it! I would recommend this product to anyone who has a kitten and desires to give them a balanced diet.  It is a bit more pricey than some of the other brands, but it balances out by giving them the nutrients they need to be healthy and, in turn, minimizing vet bills.

review/summary: Great food!
review/text: We have two five-month-old kittens that we brought home when they were 12 weeks old. We had no trouble transitioning them from their shelter food to Blue Buffalo. Our boys love Blue Buffalo, and it is made of ingredients that I for the most part would be willing to eat. It is about the same price range as some of the fancier brands, but take a look at the ingredient list sometime - there is no "[animal] byproduct meal" in this food - ew! Look at most other brands' ingredient list for comparison - scary stuff!<br /><br />The 7-lb bag lasts us a month - my understanding is that since there's less filler, they actually don't need to eat as much food to get what they need. Our kittens have grown like weeds and are full of energy. They have amazingly shiny coats even though they are only 5 months old. They don't shed as much as I would have expected (granted, this could be partially because of age). One of our kittens does get some smelly farts occasionally, but they, um, don't linger, so we don't mind and neither does he.<br /><br />We supplement with a can of wet a day - Blue canned food is just waaaay too expensive ($1.40 for a small can!), so we use Authority (sold by Petsmart) which has decent ingredients and you can get a big can for $.70 when it's on sale.

review/summary: The winner!
review/text: Transitioned my kittens from Purina One Kitten formula to this brand after researching ingredients of at least a dozen natural kitten dry foods and after reading the (somewhat frightening ) book: " Not Fit For A Dog", which exposes the down side of the pet food industry. I put out a small bowl of Blue Buffalo and the usual amount I had been feeding them of Purina One Kitten.  When I went to fetch the dish, I expected a few nibbles  to be taken of the Blue Buffalo...instead, the dish was completely cleaned up and the Purina left untouched.  After three weeks on a combo wet/dry Blue Buffalo kitten food diet, my kittens look the picture of health, shiny luxurious fur, bright alert eyes, and abundant energy. I realize that this small company sold out to Proctor and Gamble to avoid bankruptcy, but the product continues to be produced in its own facility under the highest quality standards. (Ben and Jerry's did the same thing... and,still wonderful ice cream!).  I highly recommend this (and the price is right on Amazon as well.)

review/text: I am loving this food so far. Or, my cats are. Which means so am I. :) They were on a diet of Purina dry food + Iams canned food before I made the switch. My vet had always said that Purina was up there with all the top name brand foods, so I just took her word for it. After doing my own research, I found that was definitely NOT the case. I switched both of my cats to a Buffalo Blue diet (one eats kitten, the other eats weight control) and they are both happy, healthy kitties. Of course it's more expensive than what you can buy in your local grocery store, but for the health benefits, it's worth it to me. Amazon sells it for exactly the same price as the stores in my area, so I choose to get it shipped--saves me time and gas!

review/summary: The best Kitten food!
review/text: I have been feeding this food to my Ragdoll kittens/cats for years. The Blue Buffalo Spa Selects are the best food I have found for my kitties. I have one that has a sensitive stomach and will not keep any grain foods down. With Blue Buffalo Kitten, she has never gotten sick and loves it! I have Tom that was frequently getting urinary crystals. He hated the Hills Prescription Diet A/D food the vet wanted him to eat, canned or dry, but this stuff he loves. Kittens have grown strong and healthy with beautiful coats!<br />I have noticed also, for anyone considering switching to this food versus most others, because this food is very digestible, they eat less of it, process more of it, and actually seem to use the catbox less! With other grainy foods, they have trouble processing the cornmeal and it just passes through the system, creating more bowel movements, and eating more food. You can even SEE, if you look, the grains in my cats' stool with other brands compared to grain-free brands.<br />This at least is the case with my cats.

review/summary: Feed them the best.
review/text: My mom feeds her 5 year old cat, 6 year old Viszla and 6 year old German Shorthair Blue food. Naturally when I moved out and got my own kitten I started him on Blue. He loves both the Healthy Growth as well as the Wilderness Kitten. He is growing like a weed (10 lean pounds at 7 months old) and has so much energy. His coat is soft and shiny and his eyes are bright and clear.<br /><br />This product can be a little more expensive, but it often goes on sale at the pet store. Plus since it is higher in protein you have to feed your animal less than you would with cheaper brands. Make sure you read the serving instructions if you have not tried this food before so you don't overfeed your pet.<br /><br />In short this product is quality food that keeps my little buddy healthy, and when it comes to his health I am glad to pay the little extra $$.

review/summary: Our Finicky Girl Loves Blue!!
review/text: After my husband and I rescued our little girl from the humane society, we found out we had a VERY picky eater on our hands.  Since I am a picky parent, I wanted her to have only the best food.  I wasted money on other top brands that were grain free or minimal grain, all natural, and/or organic.  She hated them all.  Then I found Blue at the Tractor Supply in my county and was a little hesitant to buy due to the price.  Since Blue is all natural AND loaded with the good stuff, cats eat less of it that they do the grain laden cheaper stuff.  So I did some mental math and chose Blue.  She LOVES it!!  She will finish her bowl and meow for more.  All I can say is THANK YOU!  Her picky nature was driving me nuts (and costing me money in uneaten food).  Blue is awesome.  Just ask our little girl.

review/text: Just tried this for lunch and it is delicious.  I made some Nori rolls stuffed with salmon, vegies, quinoa... all stir fried and used this for a dipping sauce and it definitely enhanced the meal.  Mostly sweet with just a little hint of "kick" on the finishing note.

review/summary: So yummy, low sugar too!
review/text: Bought this from the local grocery store and it was at room temperature. I didn't want to wait to get home and chill it, so I gave it a try, and it was fine! I love this drink. I also got the Coconut Water from Taste Nirvana and I found out I like the CocoAloe wayyyyy better now!<br />I love that it's only 9 grams of sugar per serving, and it's natural since the ingredients show only Coconut Water, Aloe Vera, and Fiber.<br />Also, it's a good source of Magnesium (do a search for the benefits of magnesium if you want to be amazed).

review/summary: The best so far!
review/text: I recently saw the Vita coconut water for sale at Costco with a discount of $5 off.  Even though the final price of the 6L of Vitacoco water cost much less than the individual pack that I saw at Safeway/vons supermarket, I decided to by an individual tetrapak for Vitacoco, Naked Juice, Zico, Zola, One, and Nirvana (No C2O, Amy & Brian) .  The test subjects were myself and my two nieces (6 & 11).  They didn't get to drink that much fresh coco water from a real coconut but I sure did; however, they results were similar.  My two nieces held on tight to the 17.5oz can of Zola and loved it but said that it's a bit sweet.  The 6 years old said "yuck" after taking a sip of the Vita coconut water, the 11 yo frowned, and I liked it the least also.  Why did Vita add vitamin C to their coco water?  I'm glad that I spent $2.50 on a small tetrapak than $15 for 6L of Vita.  We also agreed that ONE coco water tasted a lot like Vita but a bit better.  Naked followed it.  Zico was as bad as other reviewers complained on their review on Amazon.com about the plastic bottle compared to the tetrapak they had before.  The last coconut water we had was the Nirvana.  It went down really smooth and didn't have any after taste like Zola and other coco water.  IMO, I'll always get Nirvana.  If it's not available, then Zola which is rather a good deal because it's a 17.5oz or so for $2.50; but, I wouldn't touch ONE, Naked, and Vita ever again.<br /><br />I am glad that Safeway carries those 5 brands because I was able to do a taste test without buying junk that I don't like and regret it.  So, I you want to buy any of the coconut water, go to Safeway/Vons supermarket and buy a little bit of each like I did and test them for yourselves.  Nirvana is my and my nieces # 1 choice and Zola is # 2 so far, yours might be different.  So, experiment!

review/summary: Hands Down My Favorite Coconut Water
review/text: I have tried pretty much every kind of coconut water I have found and this is hands down my favorite.  It definitely tastes different than most of the coconut waters out there that have a very bitter flavor and a yellowish color.  This is clear w/a little hazziness to it, and tasty little gel drops (that's how I describe them).  There is a slightly sweet taste, but it is oh so good and refreshing.  I love one of these after a 30 minute run.  I like the Coco Aloe slightly more than the regular coconut water from Taste Nirvana.  Plus, they taste better out of the bottle than out of a can.  Only issue is don't buy them on here unless you absolutely can't find them in a store.  I get mine at Meijer right next to the Gatorade.  It is normally $1.99 a bottle and often it is on sale for $1.79.  So it costs about $10/dozen more on here.  If you haven't tried this and you have been trying to reap the benefit of coconut water but can't stand downing the other bitter tasting products on the market, give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/text: I have never purchased this from Amazon, only my local co-op. I love this drink. You MUST drink it chilled or it won't taste good. IMHO, this is true for all coconut water. I drink this before and/or after a Bikram class and I feel amazing!!!

review/text: My ex 2 years ago bought me 750 of these babies. It was the best gift i have ever gotten. Honestly. You know how you go the the 25 cent machine and get one of these guys out, and you honestly try your best not to lose it while your seeing how high you can bounce it. Then when you do (like 10 mins later) your pissed off. Well you dont have to worry about that when you buy a couple bags of em. Then you start getting crazy ideas like getting out the tennis racket and (when i was in college) seeing if you can hit people going into the cafeteria for dinner while your so far away no one knows who did it. Another good one is while your driving (on an empty road) throw one out in front of your car and see how many times you can hit it while it bounces down the street. Or have someone in the passenger seat bounce it out the car and into open shop doorways on the side of the road. Many have jumped off the top of the 'sunshine skyway bridge' in st. petersburg florida, they say hitting the water from that height is like hitting concrete, so did they bounce? dumping dozens off of roofs is pretty cool too, ive bounced one off a roof 16 floors up to the ground accross the street and into the 8th floor or so of a parking garage. I only have about thirty left rolling around my apartment from bouncy ball fights so im planning on buying more. I think everyone should have a bag. wow. who writes this much about bouncy balls.

review/summary: Best Ever
review/text: It all started when a co-worker and I found a trade show branded super ball in a forgotten box of office supplies. You know - you throw it, it bounces - it's all fun and whatnot. We got a coffee break's worth of entertainment out of it before we moved on and forgot about it.<br /><br />Well, I never forgot about it. I jumped on Amazon where I found these bad boys (seriously, what _can't_ you buy here?!), and they shipped in just a few days. I brought the bag in to the office a couple weeks ago, just for fun. Since then, I'm quite surprised that we haven't gotten fired with all the crazy pranks and games we've come up with. From rigging them to fall when the door is opened, to hiding them in the mini-fridge for an after lunch store-the-leftovers WTF, we've certainly gotten every cent worth of entertainment out of these things.<br /><br />Sure, we made up games to pass the time during rainy lunch breaks (I bet you can't bounce it from the whiteboard to the wall, off the window and into the trash can), but the situation quickly devolved into all-out war. Some afternoons start out mildly enough with a simple game of double-bounce into the coffee mug, but wind up with tables overturned and 250 bouncy balls flying at near-mach speeds to land squarely between the eyes of a hopeless co-worker. I don't care that you volunteered to implement the latest changes to the product at the last sub-committee meeting; when the super balls come out, there are no friends anymore.<br /><br />At any rate, I don't know what you're expecting when you buy a bag of bouncy balls on the Internet for eight cents apiece, but trust me, whatever your plans, it's worth it.

review/summary: Amazing fun for a Physics experiment!
review/text: Okay, I got 5 boxes of these and filled a big box and dumped them, all at once, 4 stories down onto a big high school gym floor and it was amazing. I'm not suggesting  you do this unless you have permission but it's a great experiment to do for your students, if your a teacher... Its well worth the money and there actually kinda pretty. Some of them do have a rather large ridge but it's still worth it if your looking for some Bouncy balls.

review/summary: Fun in the Sun
review/text: Who would expect a bored 22 year old (at the time) would have so much fun with little bouncy balls?  I ordered this item a couple years ago and never wrote a review... until now!  Well basically I ordered these for "office wars" during the down times; some used those nurf guns and I used these rubber bouncy balls.<br /><br />They bounce and are round... a real bouncy ball.  If you are looking for those little balls (and a lot of them) that come out the quarter machines at grocery stores and corner stores... this would be them.

review/text: I have a 4 and 8 year old boy.  We throw these around in the basement.  Some of them bounce really nice the majority of others do not.  I have a gut feeling they are rejects or something that did not quite make it past quality control.  The boys like them so that is all that really matters but take note most of them are duds and not considered superballs in my opinion.

review/summary: Not just for Kids
review/text: I bought these to pack into a party gift bag for my sons bday. As soon as the kids saw what was in the bags they all went directly for the balls leaving all candy and other things by the wayside. I even started giving the to all the adults and everyone was just bouncing away even as they left the party. These balls are the exact same as you would find in a vending machine. If your looking for these type of balls these are perfect.

review/summary: fresh, bouncy, and in bulk
review/text: I wanted a lot of bouncy balls to toss around a small office space with tiled floors.  These balls arrived in a HUGE bag, no overwhelming "gas smell" that you may have heard in other reviews, and each ball was plenty squishy and provided ample bounciness.  They will be utilized to toss or be bounced into small cans and targets strategically placed throughout the office space.<br />So far, these balls have refracted off of monitors, TVs, bystander's heads and bodies, and have not caused any damage, other than to personal pride.<br />I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a ball that you can launch without repercussions.<br /><br />*Update:<br />The balls have been taken outside and now their main purpose is to land in my neighbor's flower pots, which are across the street, more than 100 feet away.  With proper trajectory, they can land mid-street, then have 1 sidewalk bounce, and then pound my neighbor's door.<br /><br />Pros- High quality (they've been run over by cars & survived)<br />  - More than ample bounciness<br />  - Wide variety of bouncy balls (some tie-dyed, some soccer balls, some pool balls etc)<br /><br />Cons- A very select few seem to be made of a different material (mostly white with random colors).  Those ones will become hard and brittle if left in the sun for a few days.  Will still bounce, but seem to lose a bit of elasticity.  Very few of these balls have been shipped to me.
