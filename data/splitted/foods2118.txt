review/text: When I opened the package, the salt did not look right. I compared it to some of the Himalayan salt I had from Whole foods and it was a lighter pink. Opened the bag and tasted it. It sure tasted like regular salt was added. Great price but you get what you pay for. Nice trick.

review/summary: Need to use more than usual.
review/text: I don't like dark-roasted coffee because it seems to bring out the bitterness.  I was thrilled to find a decaf light roast.  Was disappointed at first, not much taste.  My husband outright wouldn't drink it because it was weak.  I decided to put in an extra scoop and that made all the difference. I made a pot for after dinner/dessert one evening when my brother-in-law was with us.  Both my husband and brother-in-law wanted to know what coffee I used because it was really good. My husband couldn't believe it was the same coffee he had refused to drink previously.  I usually use 4 coffee scoops to a 10 cup drip pot but use 5 with this brand - that's still much less than what the coffee makers recommend so it's not a big increase in cost per cup.

review/text: Asian specialty foods are hard to find in this area so I was happy to see this available on Amazon as a subscription item. I hadn't tried this brand before and was glad to find it's so good. It's not as salty as some other brands and that will please some and not others, but it's easy to solve...just add more salt. It's fine the way it is sprinkled over rice but when I put it on popcorn I add a bit of salt. Nice seaweed flavor with the nuttiness of sesame seeds. Yum!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: This is what works.  It's all about placement
review/text: I have a large yard with several moles.  I called a mole/pest removal company.  I hired them and paid 200.00 to have about a dozen traps set (yes, they used these exact traps which is why I ordered some for myself).<br /><br />Anyway, they had 30 days to trap moles in my yard.  They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught.  They got 5 moles in that time.<br /><br />That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats.  They breed slowly and live alone.  They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions.  When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area).<br /><br />You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth.<br /><br />Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap.  Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel.  The idea (obviously) is to set the trap in an area the mole will try to use again.  When the mole tries to fix the tunnel, bam!<br /><br />I just trapped my first mole today.  I saw the spring of the trap was down, took the trap up, and the mole was dead underneath.<br /><br />This trap does work to kill the mole.  YOu just need to put it in the right place and set it correctly.<br /><br />The guy who worked for the pest control company told me most of this and it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I'm here to buy a few more traps.  I would suggest getting two traps for each distinct area you think there may be a mole.  I plan to just keep rotating 4-6 traps until all the moles are gone.

review/summary: Kills moles
review/text: In soft, loose, or sandy ground, the spikes might cause the entire trap to jump up out of the ground when the spring is sprung (every action has an oposite and equal reaction). I drilled two holes in the top of the arms of the trap, then used small string to stake the traps into the ground. Then be sure to spring the trap several times to be sure the spikes drop freely. With this minor retrofitting, the traps work great. I have killed three moles in a week. Be sure to follow the instructions from the other reviewers about finding active tunnels. That is important.

review/summary: Study How to Use It and It's Great
review/text: I tried everything to get my mole to leave peacefully. I sprayed castor oil, used mole repellent pellets, etc. He might leave for a week or two, but then he would be back.<br /><br />I purchased the Victor Mole Trap, read the instructions, studied a bit on the web, and rid my yard of moles in three days. GREAT product.<br /><br />The previous reviewers don't understand that you're not really trying to "trap" the mole with the spikes. In all likelihood you will maim the mole and he will go off to die. You won't really know whether you got him until you notice that no new tunnels are being built. And you do need to pay attention to your yard before setting the trap. Figure out where the mole likes to travel by flattening his tunnels and watching where they reappear. Try to think like the mole and you'll get him.

review/summary: Works very well
review/text: I've been using mole traps of this kind for over 50 years and have killed many hundreds of moles.  I have used Victor traps and cheaper traps.  They all kill moles but I prefer Victor because of the design.  The "legs" that hold the trap in the ground have barbs on them to keep the trap from jumping out of the ground when the trap is triggered.  The trap is made from heavy guage steel and the spikes are heavy guage and very sharp.  The spikes are sharpened diagonally on the tips so they cut like a knife.  The trap is easy to set.....takes just a couple minutes, just follow the simple directions.  If people are missing moles with this trap, it is probably because they are not setting the trap in deep enough or are not making sure the spikes can travel freely down into the ground when the trap is sprung.  A couple of tips:  After locating the run, step on a spot to flatten the run, then set the trap to straddle the flattened run.  Push the "legs" of the trap into the dirt as far as they will go until the trigger touches the flattened part of the run that you stepped on.  Then (important)before you set the tripping mechanism, push the spikes up and down through the dirt a few times until they travel freely.  I have caught several moles this week and will get another one this evening.  This mole trap is well-made (in USA), easy to use and will definitely kill moles if it is set correctly.  I have 9 traps and set them in clusters but you can kill many moles with just one trap...........it just takes longer.

review/summary: WOW. It does work
review/text: I thought I would be throwing more money down a hole, but this product works great. I have killed 4 moles the last 3 months. The key is to figure out the tunnels they use. Over a few days push down all the raised areas in the yard and see which ones the moles push back up. Now you found their highway. If you have hard soil or roots, before you set the trap. Push the spikes of the trap into ground several times where the trap is going to be. This way when the mole triggers the trap the spikes will travel down easy otherwise the spikes may hit something hard and force the trap out of the ground without hitting the target.

review/text: I am known in the neighborhood as "The Mole Man" as I will catch moles for my friends.  Recently some low-life stole my trusty old Victor mole traps right out of my neighbor's front yard. I have found the harpoon type to be the most effective trap made.<br /><br />I replaced them with what I thought would be identical traps.  Alas, they are of the same basic design, but are made lighter and cheaper.  I have doubts about them holding up like the old ones.  The steel parts are lighter, and the protective zinc coating (galvanizing) questionable.

I was able to get two moles with this trap.  I do think that the actuator spring needs too be a little stronger so that it has an easier time pushing the spikes through the soil.  But yes, the unit does work.  I was one step away from contracting an exterminator.

I had a few false starts with some less defined tunnels but as soon as I picked a tunnel where the route was very clear, I caught my mole within 24 hours.<br />A nice thing about this trap is that you don't have to dig down into the ground to place them.  Just stick them into the ground where you find a well used tunnel.  I bought two, but I actually think one would have been totally fine.  It seems pretty sturdy too, so if we get any more moles in the future I will be ready!<br />All in all, I would certainly recommend this product.

review/summary: Still have moles....
review/text: I tried several tricks to rid myself of my moles. I tried flooding them and using flares in their hole.. all with no success. I bought this trap last spring. It's now fall and I still have moles. As a matter of fact, it hasn't caught one mole yet!! I just got a couple kittens that I'm hoping will help me with the mole problem in the spring. I think my next trick will be to try those poisen worms or some people have suggested using wrigley chewing gum.... if none of those things work I may have to resort to dynamite!! If I do try another trap, it'll be one of those in-line traps....

review/summary: DO NOT BUY
review/text: This was the biggest waste of our money.  I don't know what the solution is, but this trap is not it.  The so called "spikes" are not sharp enough to even penetrate my hand when triggered, much less something as small as a mole. When you pull the trap up, you don't know if you got the mole, because, unless you plan on digging up your yard to see if the mole might be there, you don't know.  We emailed the moleman, and he said that we needed to stick a piece of wood under the trap so that when the "spikes" come down, they do not just trap the mole.  So the past 6 times this trap has gone off, we have caught the mole, only to pull the trap out and set him free.  No where on the box or in the directions does it state the detail that needs to be taken.  I say, either live with em, or hire a professional.  Or, MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: This gopher trap is designed poorly.  We have gophers and bought this trap online.  The only problem is that the part that should come down and trap/kill the gopher gets stuck with the dirt when you set the trap up.  I'm not sure if we didn't dig down far enough or what the problem was, but the gopher issue was not solved with this product.

review/summary: Do You Have One of These Gathering Dust in Your Attic or Basement?
review/text: Well, depending on your reason for setting it aside, you might be able to start using it again because Melitta has solved one of the major problems with the original model by offering a replacement "universal pod holder" for your Melitta One, absolutely free including free shipping, just for calling their customer service department toll free telephone line.<br /><br />The basic problem was that the original Melitta One utilized a 55mm Pod design while the majority of the single serve coffee machines on the market that utilize "pods", use a 62mm Pod Design.  The upshot was that any 62mm Pod machine could use Melitta One 55mm Pods, but a Melitta One could not use 62mm Pods.<br /><br />Worse, as I can attest to from personal experience, the fit was so tight that many genuine Melitta One 55mm Pods would not quite fit, which resulted in enough coffee going into the drip tray to require daily emptying.  Even a perfectly fitting Melitta One 55mm Pod was often accompanied by some water leakage into the drip tray from underneath the spout.<br /><br />But with my new universal pod holder, not only can I use, for example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007NOWMM">Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee 62mm Pods</a> with no problems whatsoever, but I've noticed that my few remaining old "a bit too large" Melitta 55mm Pods fit perfectly as well.  Best of all, all coffee and water leakage into the drip tray has been eliminated!  The elimination of the cutout in the handle of the universal pod holder forces the front of it to sit a good 2 cm. higher in the coffee maker.  At first I thought it was some kind of mistake, but after using it for a while I recognized it as a brilliant solution to the water leak problem.  Forcing the spout down with that 2 cm. of extra height turns out to be just enough pressure to eliminate all water leakage!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this doesn't eliminate its every shortcoming.  It is still the noisiest coffee maker I've ever heard that does NOT grind its own beans.  In a kitchen away from all sleeping areas, this doesn't matter; in an open office cubicle, it really might!  It also comes with a rather skimpy water tank (Ignore the Fill Line, fill it to the brim, and you can get three 8 oz cups out of it, otherwise only two and a partial.), and unlike with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K">Senseo</a> this cannot be remedied by purchasing an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS8C">Extra Large Water Tank</a>.  Still, the replacement "universal pod holder" got mine out of the basement, and it might just do the same for yours!  Of course any newly purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DXXF7Q">Melitta One: One Pod Brewing System Coffeemaker</a> should come with the universal pod holder, but if you acquire an older one, you might have to give Melitta a call.  I got mine in the mail in only a week... in December.

review/text: I have been using my Melitte one:one for years now.  I love it so much that I bought one for the lake, and now for my office where they are taking away our Keurig because it isn't "green".  The melitta uses coffee pods, which don't have all the packaging that other single coffee makers have.  You can also use the one:one without a pod to make hot chocolate for the kids (or yourself!).  I highly recommend it.  I bought a replacement maker that I keep in the basement, just in case my original pot dies - so far - it just keeps going and going - so it is durable as well!

review/summary: good coffee for the solofill
review/text: I bought this in the 2oz packets so I would have fresh coffee  for my solofill reuseable  kcup for keurig. I get 3 or 4 cups, at least, from a packet which makes it much cheaper than kcups. Of course, I must admit I got the 80 packets for less than $20 which comes to about $1.45 a pound. I figured for the price I couldn't go wrong. It is a decent coffee....not par with some other gourmet coffees but at the price I paid it was a smart buy. I also have blended it with other coffees I had on hand to make my own blend and it works out really well. With the packets I don't have to worry about storing a large bag of coffee and having it go bad. Hopefully when it returns, it will be the same price but I won't be needing coffee for quite awhile.

review/text: I often wonder if this ice cream is too good to be true!  It is so rich and yummy, and I love ALL of the flavors (though the Chocolate and Vanilla Maple are my favorites).  I do agree with other reviewers that it needs to be thawed and softened for it to really be done justice; I first tasted it fully frozen and didn't think the flavor or consistency were great.  About 20 seconds in the microwave, and it was rich and almost like a cold pudding--so wonderful!  At less than 150 calories per pint, it's perfect for those "Gotta have ice cream" attacks...not that I want to admit that I'd ever eat a whole pint, but seriously...

review/text: NO, its not "Ben and Jerry's" and its not "haagen daz", but its actualy a fairly healthy creamy frozen desert, like ice cream. This is non Genetically Modified, it uses a little organic cane sugar but mostly sweetend with fruit. So there are no chemical sweeteners here. It has fiber thats great, but if you arent use to fiber ( and you should be ), you may feel it a little, but that should be a sign to get fiber in your diet. I really love this stuff and you can eat it guilt free, which I do....amazing

review/text: This was pretty good, not great, but good. It tastes kind of like frozen pudding--I had some after dinner and after a few bites it just started tasting like "cold" instead of "vanilla maple". The flavor was enhanced by mixing some PB2 and walden farms calorie free chocolate syrup. Overall, this is a great product if you want a HUGE serving of ice cream with minimal calories--BUT, if you really enjoy the texture and sugar of regular ice cream, this isn't for you. Not sure I'll buy again, just for the cost alone--if it were a bit cheaper then I'd definitely be making this a go-to purchase.

review/text: This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....

review/text: My two cats are, I admit, rather spoiled as far as food goes. I usually feed them Indigo Moon, Weruva and Tiki Cat, and as a consequence they eat a better quality diet than most people do. It's worth it though, everyone who meets them comments on how glossy their fur is. I decided we would give BFF a try as the ingredients list meets my standards and the price seemed right, and I must confess I really liked the label (yes I am that shallow) but I was a little apprehensive about how my two four footed food critics would react. It's probably because I indulge them so much but they are very picky eaters and will turn their backs on any wet food that doesn't please them.<br /><br />But I needn't have worried, they loved it! The Tuna Too Cool is a rich-looking, reddish pate with lots of jelly on top and my twosome were wolfing their portions down and got into a bit of a scuffle over the last couple of mouthfuls. They have no higher praise.

review/text: I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.

review/summary: Please understand what it means to go grain free.....
review/text: This product is a good product and really good health wise for your cats. If you are looking at this product you are probably interested in feeding your cats something better. I just wanted to address some of the negative reviews of this food - many of them by people who don't understand that all cat food is not the same. I took the time to switch my 8 year old street rescue Louie to grain-free food (tried many brands before I arrived at BFF), and here are some of my observations.<br /><br />Cost<br />All grain free foods costs more for the same reason that grass-fed antibiotic free, free range chicken costs more per lb than a chicken nugget. It's better for your cat! Anyone who has a cat that's on a farm - ever see it eating some of the corn or wheat that spills off of the truck? Never! That is because cats don't eat grains. In cheap cat foods these grains are used as fillers to round out the portions and are not of any nutritional value to the cat. When I went grain free my cat ate much, much less - thereby negating the price difference. I even tested it a couple of times - my 13 lb cat can eat 2 - 3 ounce cans of Fancy Feast in one sitting - but cannot eat a 3.3 ounce can of BFF in one sitting.<br /><br />Another point on cost. If you are the type to take your cat to the vet and take care of it when it is sick, then you save so much money and trouble with foods like this it is crazy. When you hear people talk about diabetic cats, food allergies and all the other assorted sicknesses our animals are getting - most of them come from food. Diabetic cats - did they continuously raid the cookie jar? All the money you think you will save (but are not actually saving) will go to the health care of your pet in later years. Its the same way McDonalds and Denny's don't have to absorb the cost of all the diabetics they helped create - the taxpayers pay for it through Medicare and higher insurance costs 30 or so years down the line (and sooner with all the young diabetics we are creating).<br /><br />Smell<br />Most grain free cat foods smell. EVO stank up the house horribly and I had to move the cat bowl from the kitchen. Minus all the fillers and grains - you are getting an all natural product that is better for your cat because nutrition of the cat is put first.<br /><br />Taste<br />Cat's are notoriously finicky. Most cat foods that have grains and other filler ingredients have to add heavy syrupy mixes to get the cats to eat them. They take corn, wheat, soy, barley and gods know what else, add some vitamins and then add a extremely strong tasty syrupy mix to get the cat to swallow it all. So cats fed this for a period of time get used to it the same way babies get used to sugars in their formula. Then, when you want to give the baby vegetables with no sugar added guess what? Baby rejects them - they want the sugar! Same happens with cats fed with cheap filler foods.<br /><br />Poop<br />When switching to grain free a cats habits and consistency may change. Their digestive system is learning how to digest what it was actually made for. Same thing happens to humans - look up the "Whole 30" and see what I mean.<br /><br />Switching to Grain Free<br />Its a process more involved than opening the can and plopping it down. Took me months. Google can help you do it but don't expect to just give this to your cat and have her dive right in thanking you for it. That may happen, but more likely than not you have to mix old and new foods until they are used to it.<br /><br />BFF, EVO, Taste of the Wild.... they are all good brands that will improve the health of your cat. I settled on BFF as my wet food because he loves it. I used to give him EVO wet food and he would eat it but he hated it. I still feed him EVO dry food because he likes it. I tried many brands and did not give up on grain-free food because I cared about my cat. I understood as a street cat for years he was used to eating whatever he could and it all was the cheapest, unhealthiest stuff available given to him by well meaning people. He has improved in every way (coat, activity level, temperament, litter habits, etc..) and now is a healthy and happy cat.

review/summary: Great grain free, high fiber, high moisture food!
review/text: My slightly aging cat has had horrible colitis in the last two years, and was defecating on the floor and my bed. The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl. Great ingredients, and picky cat loves it!<br />Note: yes he saw the vet. The change in diet was the vets idea.

In fact, it smells like human food.<br />Also, my kitty doesn't leave a bit on his dish when I pour this can.<br />I check the ingredients whenever I buy something for my cat, and BFF generally offers pretty good ingredients with decent price. I highly recommend this cat food!

review/summary: Tuna, Taurine, My Cat Loves It
review/text: Thank You. I am very pleased. Quality cat food. Good for male cats, high water content.<br />Some other brands on Amazon are made abroad then distributed by US. company. The b.f.f product reads<br />made in Massachusetts. Glad there is Taurine in it. First ingredient tuna, then water for processing,also included: Potato Starch. The Potato Starch may not be for all cats. I am not vetrinarian. I have always fed my cat dry and wet from Premium companies. This was my first time finding a brand for him on amazon. For the price and convenience, I am ordering again... but mostly because my cat loves it. Thank You.

review/summary: BFF Top Grade Cat Food
review/text: Very good quality cat food.  Made at a human food factory with human grade ingredients.  The tuna used is the red meat from the skipjack tuna fish.  They get a variety so this is just part of their diet as I do not want to feed them tuna based foods as their primary source of protein.  Healthy and cats love this.  I try to use this brand, Tiki Cat, Weurva and then for dry food Orijen cat food.  My Himalayan cats are on a no grain, no gluten/filler diet.  This wet food in combination with the dry has led to great coats, no hair balls, good energy and solid not too stinky poo :)

Mini chunks of tender tuna punctuate the smooth tasty sauce.  Costing just over $10 per 12 pack, Best Feline Friend is a reasonable value.  At that price, this delectable entr&eacute;e is likely to become a staple of my diet.  I heart &lt;3 BFF!<br /><br />ttfn<br />Steve the cat

review/text: I initially thought this was a generic brand of food and of poor quality, due to the label design.  However, it's a Weruva product and is exactly the quality of food I normally purchase (Tiki Cat, Merrick, Natural Balance, Wellness).  There's no grains or byproducts.  My kitties love this and are incredibly picky eaters.  I'm going to try the other flavors now, especially at such a great price!!!

review/text: Our cats love this food. One of them is elderly  and doesn't normally eat enough---but she pays attention when we open one of these cans. She is doing very well on it. Our kitten, though, is now spoiled rotten and doesn't want anything else! They both like it better than canned tuna, which is saying a lot. They also really like the "tuna so cool" flavor. The one flavor they weren't crazy about was the tuna and vegetables, big surprise.

review/summary: Another Hit From BFF!
review/text: I just tried my two four footed food critics on BFF's Tuna & Veggies Valentine and it made a big hit with both of them. It's always a risk trying a new food on my two finicky cats, but I hoped they would like this one because they love parent company Weruva's Tuna & Vegetables <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70O2">Weruva Mediterranean Harvest Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)</a>. BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies. And both have an ingredient list that meets my standards - no by products. My twosome snarfed up every last bit of tuna and veggies valentine that I gave them and they asked me for more - but they will have to wait until tonight for that!

review/text: One of my kitties has ear allergies, so after much research I decided to put them on a grain free diet. I purchased a number of different types of can food from the pet store. They rejected a majority of it and refused to eat it. They went nuts over this canned food, so I am now a huge fan. My pet store does not keep much in stock, so I was thrilled to find it on amazon!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.) That being said, my ragdoll usually only eats dry food and my shorthair usually eats the wet food. Amazon delivered this to my doorstep today and I opened a can and fed it right away to see if they liked it. After taking a shower I came back out and it was ALL gone, and my ragdoll was finishing up what little was left. The cat food box says on the front that it was made in a human food facility, but I don't know much about cat food that isn't made in a human food facility. I still appreciate the fact that they are trying to say it is higher quality. I will probably be buying this brand from now on, I just wish Amazon Prime members got it in two days like usual, but it is shipped from pet food direct so :(.

review/summary: Energetic Cat!
review/text: I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.

Their seafood has the lowest mercury levels but still this isnt recomended for everyday use on your kitties, you're supposed to switch it around. I only give it to my babies 1 or 2-ice a week that's it. You should hear them begging when the can is popped open ha ha ha.

review/summary: Carrageenan ingredient NOT good !
review/text: If your cat has GI or stomach problems, be SURE to read the ingredients on the label as several of the BFF flavors contain Carrageenan which is not at all healthy for your cat (or people for that matter).  It causes GI problems and heartburn -- the very last thing a kitty needs.  It does NOT appear that Carrageenan is listed in the Amazon description, but if one checks the BFF website, you can find complete product ingredients.<br /><br />In particular, this BFF has the Carrageenan listed towards the top of the ingredient list, so more highly concentrated.<br /><br />My cat needs grain-free food for her IBD and I purchased a few cans of this BFF locally.  The "Carrageenan" on the label got me to sleuthing and discovered some food makers (pet and human) use this as a filler.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Just a heads up for folks ..!

review/summary: Absolute Life Saver!
review/text: My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth. She has not eaten a full helping of cat food in YEARS, but the very first can of this stuff I set out for her was GONE almost instantly. She is usually constantly screaming for treats, but after having a full 3 ounce can of this, she is happy and scream free. I have never seen her take to a wet food so instantly and so completely. Yes, it smells like tuna...because it's made from tuna? It's pungent but she frickin' LOVES it. How nice to see my poor old girl eat every last bit of something. I am just so grateful I found this food! Will be ordering it on a regular basis. Thanks, BFF!

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack
review/text: The BFF line is great; my cats adore it (to the point of occasionally going on food strike when I try to get them to eat other things), its fairly reasonably priced and aside from the mercury issues, it's a really healthy catfood lacking all the crud that's usually in commercially prepared foods (bad additives, grains, corn etc).<br /><br />This particular flavor (tuna and shrimp) is their favorite, but I also feed the tuna and pumpkin flavor which is a close second.  The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.  So I alternate this with a chicken product.<br /><br />Otherwise - this is top notch catfood.

review/text: My cat is used to eating Weruva and Tiki Cat, so I wasn't sure how he would take to this brand. This doesn't look at all like the previous two brands (which actually look like people food) whereas BFF brand looks like typical cat food. Lou isn't normally picky, but he doesn't eat this food quite as quickly as Tiki or Weruva. I bought two cases of 10 (Tuna & Bonito and Tuna & Shrimp) and while it's a good price, I think next time we'll stick to Weruva for big cans of food and Tiki for small cans (he gets one big can in the am and one small can in the pm!) I'd buy this stuff again in the future if I was in a pinch, as it's not a bad food...I just like my cats food to look more like real fish or chicken vs over processed "stuff". But good ingredients and grain free at a good price!

Even though this food is all fish, I was afraid they might snub it, too, and they normally don't like canned cat foods at all. But they love this. The food has a lot of tuna, but you can tell it has the chunks of tilapia in it. My cats didn't hesitate to eat all of it. I intend to try the other flavors to get some variety in their diet.<br /><br />And I liked that this canned food is very densely packed, not soupy. I just add a little water if the cats need it wetter.

review/summary: Extremely high quality cat food at affordable price
review/text: I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other "premium" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.

review/text: I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety. I will continue purchasing the standard Weruva in Paw Lickin' Chicken since my boys love it, but we are happy to mix it up with BFF. The inclusion of the skin on some fish pieces is certainly a confidence-booster that my cats are getting real food, not mystery meat. I also appreciate the 5.5 ounce can size, as we can share a can each feeding and both cats get their fill.

review/text: My cats love BFF and lick the bowl clean every time. The reason I don't by it more often is the pungent smell that seems to be much stronger than other cat foods.

review/text: After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.  I've tried several flavors, and they like them all.  They are excited again at meal time.  The best benefit is that the "tummy problems" are so much better.

review/summary: Best Feline Tuna Shrimp
review/text: Cat loves it, and she's on a high protein, grain-free diet healing from cancer. She'd been extremely picky about eating anything other than feed mice or shrimp(expensive taste). Was giving her canned innova evo, but she seemed to tire of it and this is good quality and cheaper and she LOVES it.

review/summary: My cat goes crazy over this stuff.
review/text: Out of all of the various types of cat food I've bought, the Tuna and Bonito is definitely the best for my cat.<br />He likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken</a> more, but given an equivalent amount of this BFF vs the Chicken, he tends to stay happier longer.  He tends to beg for food, and after eating this, he won't beg for almost the full 12 hours between feedings (vet's orders!), while with many other foods, he'll start begging way before that.

review/summary: BFF is better food than some and not as expensive as others
review/text: I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices.

review/summary: Excellent cat food
review/text: After reading the other review for this wonderful cat food,I wondered why the previous reviwer had decided to give it less than 5 stars? She mentioned that her cat didn't care for the salmon in it, however, the concept of the food is excellent. Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand. And they are very finicky too.<br />I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future.

review/summary: All four of my cats LOVE the BFF moist foods
review/text: My four kitty cats are in love with this food. I have been feeding it to them for about a week. You can tell they enjoy it way more than their old boring moist cat food (nine lives). You can actually see yummy chunks of chicken in the chicken recipes and smell the fish in the fishy recipes. So far my cats have tried the following recipes and they loved each and every one just as much as the other.<br /><br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br />Tuna and Tilapia Twosome<br />Tuna and Bonito Be Mine<br />Tuna and Salmon Soulmates<br />Tuna and Chicken Chuckles<br />Tuna and Chicken 4Eva<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any person that loves their cats.

review/summary: My Cats Refuse To Eat It
review/text: My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

review/summary: Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand
review/text: Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water. Every can is just low quality, dark gray, shredded tuna.  The company adds a trace of other ingredients so they can claim to have several flavors, but don't fall for their tricks! Rather, when you want to give your kitty some tuna for a treat, just feed him/her some regular tuna--the good kind humans eat.  Not only is it far superior quality, but it's cheaper, too!
