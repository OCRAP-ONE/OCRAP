review/summary: good training treats
review/text: Great treats! I tear each one into 10 small pieces for training my 4.5lb 8 week Puggle. The only problem with these treats is that they dry up quickly. Within an hour or so the outside is dry, hard to rip with my fingers, and I imagine not easy for a little puppy.

review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals  Dog Treats
review/text: These treats are tiny and GREAT for training--low calorie, yet so aromatic that my dog jumps for joy as he smells them. The customer service was great, except they back-ordered one package of the treats, assured me they should be here in a few weeks; I've been waiting a month for the item.

review/summary: Super Treats
review/text: These are by far the favorite treats of our two dogs and a treat of which they never tire. We keep them in a cannister by the dining room slider so there always handy for a good dog who came when called or allowed me to dry her wet feet.<br />We like that the treats are small and soft also. These make great training treats for one can easily carry a handful in your pocket.<br />As a dog enthusiast who's bought many kinds of treats, I highly recommend Zuke's treats, especially the salmon mini naturals.

review/summary: Wonderful lo calorie training treat
review/text: A pound of training treats at this price is a good deal. I like everything about the treats including the size. They are NOT too tiny for my Great Dane and I can use a lot of them without filling him up and expanding his waist.  He loves the flavor, the smell is strong enough to entice without being offensive. The peanut butter flavor has not upset his sensitive stomach. They arent messy on your hands or in your pockets. They will dry out if left outside the package for any length of time so I usually separate some into a small tupperware type container for home and into small ziploc bags for carrying to classes or on walks. I will sometimes put a handful in my pocket and these actually survive the washing machine (not sure if that is good or bad).

review/text: We've had our Jack Russell for 13 years. He has never willingly gotten out of the pool before he was darn good a ready. His first sniff of these amazing treats and his nose was glued to my fingers and he was out the pool, across the patio and in the house without a second's hesitation.  He has also always completely destroyed any stuffed squeaker toy he has ever touched in a matter of minutes.  Not with these babies around. One whiff and the toy is forgotten; no fighting, no biting, no stuffing to pick up.  These are magic!  I only wish I'd known about them a decade sooner. Thanks.  If you have a headstrong dog on your hands, buy these treats - all flavors. They'll change your life.

review/text: He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL. These are a just a little bigger than a pencil eraser. They are great for training. I like to cut them in half to yield even more. I tried cutting them in quarters but they seem a little too small for my dogs big mouth. They come in a resealable package so that helps to keep them nice and fresh and especially soft. I forgot to close the bag one day and the treats got pretty hard but the dog didn't mind.

review/summary: Great rewards for clicker training
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been clicker training Bella, a toy Yorkshire Terrier, for about 3 years.  Now that she has a baby sister (Bleu, a miniature Blue Heeler) I started to look for a new type of treat to help reinforce the training.  When Bella was little I used small pieces of hot dogs but I wanted to switch to something healthier.  Zuke's mini treats seem to work really well.  I use the chicken flavored ones and I am really impressed with both how much the dogs like them and how much they smell like real food.  I thought that I would make this quick video to show the treats (and my dogs) in action.

review/text: My dog loves these!  I've only tried the salmon and peanut butter, I held off on the chicken due to other reviews saying it smells bad.  I prefer the peanut butter by far, the salmon is a bit stinky.  I noticed that my hands as well as my dog smelled fishy after giving him treats and petting for a job well done.  Treat size is perfect although they do tend to dry out if you don't keep them in a well sealed container.

review/text: Let me start by saying my dog weighs 24 lbs but should be 17 lbs. I make this point because she is overweight and will eat anything.I purchased these treats because they are low calorie, all natural and had great reviews. I tried for 3 days but she wouldn't eat even 1 little morsel.Obviously I was disappointed and also shocked like I stated she's 7 years old and will eat anything. Maybe the bag I received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage.

review/summary: Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken
review/text: Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.<br /><br />While almost everything "tastes like chicken" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit.

review/summary: would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

review/summary: LOVE IT - and so do both my dogs, even the picky one!
review/text: Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a "variety."<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.  But it gets better later  :)  But whatever the dogs like and is safe to eat works for me!

review/summary: Sad to see it go, even the cat was sold!
review/text: When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.  My dog started having bowel issues - she'd get bloated and gassy, and have diarrhea at least once a day.  I seriously fought for this treat - I researched every dang ingredient in it to disprove of it being the cause and I'm here to tell you,  Zuke's is definitely giving us our money's worth.  But after 48 Zuke's free hours - her digestive disorders vanished completely.  It's not Zuke's fault and I am not at all bad mouthing their product, I still think it's the bomb.com!  I'm only sharing because I couldn't find one other person out there with the same unusual experience.  If it happens(ed) to anyone else, know that I'm jammin' some "Against All Odds" for both of us!

review/summary: My dog loves them
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I usually get him the chicken but I'm fairly certain he would like any of the flavors. It is true that they dry out easily. You have to be sure to close the ziplock. I usually separate them into several baggies to make them last longer. My dog still eats them even if they are a little hard though.

review/summary: My dog loves these peanut butter treats!
review/text: My dog is a picky eater and will ignore some kinds of treats. However, she consistently and readily works for these peanut butter minis. The treats are quite smelly and break pretty easily into two. However, they tend to crumble if they become even slightly dry. On the whole, I would highly recommend Zuke's minis because they're the right size and have the right flavors to get my dog's attention!

review/text: This is the best thing ever for popcorn.  Not exactly a caramel corn flavor, but it adds a richness and sweetness to make blah popcorn amazing. Other people that I've had try it agree they prefer it over caramel corn. The directions say to add the glaze to the inside of a popcorn popper, but I've always added it to the popcorn immediately of popping in the air popper with butter. I've tried it with microwave popcorn, and as long as you dump the popcorn into a big bowl and toss some glaze immediately after coming out of the microwave it works as well.

review/summary: One of the Best. Low/Medium heat - great blend. Readily available and Top Rated
review/text: "Hey, just because this is a highly recognized, readily available brand doesn't mean it doesn't deliver the goods" according to Scott Roberts. Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.<br /><br />On my own, I've been taste testing hot sauces, unaware of Roberts or an entire movement of "chili-heads". I've purchased about 30 hot sauces and began taste testing them - day after day - week after week - writing up notes. (Everyone needs a hobby)<br /><br />What I found is Cholula is one of the best and it is in my top three! BTW: make sure you DON'T purchase one of the Cholula variants that add lime or garlic to the mix - get the "Original".<br /><br />Taste: I'd call this sauce low to medium heat. You'll need a few heavy drops for a Bloody Mary and more for a family sized dish. But it is not so hot that a few extra drops will ruin a dish. It has a nice blend of tastes - as noted, low to medium heat - a bit of sweetness and overall this blend is just about perfect. However, unless you have taste tested a number of different hot sauces you may not appreciate how good this one is. It simply does its job nicely, adds some heat to a dish without adding any off-tastes. If you have taste tested a number of hot sauces you will detect just a hint of vinegar but no where near the overpowering presence of this stuff which ruins so many other hot sauces.<br /><br />There are a dizzying array of hot sauces available on the internet but most are difficult to find and expensive to purchase (given shipping costs). This sauce is readily available not just here on Amazon but also in your local grocery store too. That fact alone should encourage you to try it.<br /><br />My other two other favorites are: the often recommended Huy Dong -  Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (readily available on Amazon and in stores) and El Yucatan Jalapeno Hot Sauce.<br /><br />ADVISORY: This sauce does its job quite nicely which is to add some heat to any dish. Does it magically make a mediocre dish better. No! What it does do is add some heat without introducing off -tastes. Now, to many, that may seem to be "a given" but the truth is very few hot sauces actually do that.<br /><br />One last tip -  this sauce is sold in a 12 oz and a much larger size and these larger sizes are often the far better buy!<br /><br />And a final word of Warning: Watch out for sellers that get to the top of Amazon's sellers list by offering a low product cost and then make up for this with high shipping charges on a per bottle basis (regardless of how many bottles you order at one time). Check your shipping costs just prior to confirming your order. They may be much higher than you were lead to believe, even if the seller publishes a shipping chart.

review/summary: Excellent flavor
review/text: This hot sauce has an absolute perfect blend of spice and flavor. I've tried many types of hot sauces, and many are overly spicy with no flavor, or not enough - this is truly something you can use as an actual 'spice' - something you can cook with to actually ADD FLAVOR. Very enjoyable.<br /><br />*update* Jan 2012<br />This is still one of my favorite hot sauces on the market. I saw another review proclaiming "what flavor?", and to this I warn that though Cholula is full-bodied and flavorful, it can also be much more subtle than many of the other hot sauce brands. Beyond that, if you're accustomed to nothing other than the spiciest paint thinner there is, you have probably destroyed the tastebuds required to enjoy this wonderful hot sauce. By now Cholula has another flavor, "Chili lime", which tastes equally good (my wife likes this flavor better), and is also very much worth trying.<br />The only other two hot sauces I bother with are Tabasco - both their Green Jalepeno and their Chipotle Pepper sauces are superb. The other hot sauces I've tried I feel forgo taste in favor of sheer spicyness - not what I look for.

And my 8 year old son also agrees, so I make sure to keep some in stock for him too even if I'm using something much hotter.<br /><br />This is probably the best hot sauce that you can buy in a supermarket.

I use it on everything--but I especially like to spice up my spaghetti with it. My only complaint is that it is a little costly. I wish it were a dollar cheaper.

review/text: I ask myself what the hype is about this sauce, it comes in a cool bottle, it has a cool drawing on it, and it has the groundbreaking wooden bottle top, but what's inside. I have tried pouring a truly excessive amount of it onto my food, and I simply cannot taste the difference between food without Cholula and food with Cholula, and it's not about the heat or spiciness, I tend to be just fine with Tabasco or any other ordinary sauce. Finally I tried this on it's own, and all I can taste is vinegar. Then I thought, well, it must be organic or all great ingredients, but that's not the reason for the higher price either, there's plenty of artificial flavors and colors in here.  So the hype here is really about the bottle. Sorry but you can get nice little bottles at any furniture store, as for the sauce, I'll continue to try something else.

review/summary: Small capacity for sausage, but worked great
review/text: Bought this to stuff sausage (which I make only infrequently, making it hard to justify spending over $150 on a vertical stuffer). At $30, this was a great compromise, and worked a heck of a lot better than the sausage stuffing attachment on my KitchenAid grinder. I did a 6 pound batch of sausages in relatively short order. The capacity is a little small (I needed to reload 5 or 6 times to make it through the batch), but it worked great. Each load of the tube ended up filling 20-24" of hog casing. The only thing I needed to be careful of was to watch for air pockets in the tube as I filled it, but that wasn't difficult. Cleanup was pretty simple as well.

review/text: This product is great for what it is, it is better than the KitchenAid one and better than the hand crank devices which are also grinders. The problem with this which in my opinion isn't really a problem is you get a little air in the tube when you pack the meat in there. Also, it is sometimes difficult to get the casing on the nozzle but again considering what it is and how much it cost these are problems that plague almost every stuffer in my experience. The nice part about this stuffer is the amount of control you have, no machine is cranking it out faster or slower. You also know exactly how much meat will be forced out with each pull of the trigger. There are better stuffers out there but this is a perfect in between the ones that are $100+. Avoid the KitchenAid for stuffing, I used the KitchenAid for grinding but then use this stuffer. Great quality and easy to clean.

review/text: I have not done jerky in my life as I have a different recipe for my jerky which is pure slices of meat instead of minced as some recipes called for. I like the sausage attachment part of this implement as it is easier to operate singlehandedly, meaning I do not have to toil so hard and ask my husband's help at all. i can just make my sausage and serve it for dinner or something. You see, hubby bought me an attachment for my KitchenAid and I have to stand on a stool to operate it (I must be really short-legged to operate my sausage attachment...???) I was able to do a sausage link but it took me all day. Reading the reviews I came upon this Eastman Outdoors product (whoever mentioned this in his/her review, thank you...)and I am a happy camper.

review/summary: Great for the price
review/text: As others have said, there are issues with this stuffer, but considering its price vs. other sausage stuffers it's a great deal. I had a bit of trouble getting the casing on the nozzle, ripped one - fortunately had soaked 2 since I did not know how many I'd need for 2lbs of sausage.  The cylinder does not hold much sausage, so you have to stop and reload often.  I solved the issue of air being pushed into the casings as I'm stuffing by removing the nozzle end each time I had to fill the cylinder.  It's very easy to operate once you're all put together, and have a great amount of control of the speed of the sausage while you're filling the casing. The greatest difficulty was putting on the casing.  You have to put the nozzle in the adapter (the piece in the far left of the picture), but there's not a way to "lock" the nozzle in place so you have to work at it to get leverage to get the casing on. I lubed the nozzle with some lard, so it seemed to go a bit easier.

review/summary: Great Weekend Hobby
review/text: This product has received some less than stellar reviews.  For the hobbyist, I have found nothing better.  If you are making 2 to 5 pounds of sausage, this thing is great.  There are a few of things I would suggest.  First roll the sausage into oblong logs slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the tube.  This will allow for easy loading.  I use a wooden cocktail muddler to lightly tamp down the meat to eliminate trapped air.  Also have a 3/4" diameter wood dowel treated with butcher block oil to push the final 1/3 sausage link of meat out of the snout.  Finally, make note of how the plunger end is assembled.  It can go on two different ways.<br /><br />All in all, well worth the price.

review/summary: Great for small batches of sausage
review/text: Being an avid BBQ fan I wanted to branch out into sausage making but I didn't want to break the bank on equipment. This weekend I put the 38237 through its paces making about three pounds each of snack sticks, Polish sausage, and summer sausage.<br /><br />Pros: Very precise control of the speed and quantity of sausage exiting the gun. Casings were easy to fill and the three tube selections gave me the appropriate size for each product. The tool is sturdy, heavy gage metal and plastic, which by the way is the slightly flexible kind (think the heavy, old school Tupperware bowls) so it feels strong and durable, unlike the cheaper clear plastic models that look like they would crack from use or shatter if dropped. The pump trigger could be operated one handed, leaving the other hand free to control the casings. Unlike a grinder-powered stuffer, simply pressing and releasing the trigger allows you to adjust the speed and stop the flow of product with precision. The gun was easy to disassemble and clean. I always clean kitchen apparatus by hand, so I can't speak to it being dishwasher safe. Also, I don't make extruded jerky, but the performance with snack sticks makes me feel it would be fine for that as well.<br /><br />Cons: Instructions extremely sparse, practically non-existent. Difficult to load product without getting air pockets in the cylinder. I found a video online for a competitor's product that recommended pre-rolling the sausage into a tube shape slightly narrower than the gun's cylinder which helped quite a bit.<br /><br />Conclusions: I'm happy with the performance of the product and the price I paid. Eastman Outdoors includes accessories with this unit that others charge extra for, making it quite versatile. Although I would recommend a mechanical stuffer for very large batches, this unit is ideal for stuffing a few pounds at a time.

review/summary: Quality control fair
review/text: When I opened my Eastman 38237 Jerky and Sausage Gun kit, I noticed that the piston seal made of a nylon like material was damaged with a tear very evident. Perhaps it was damaged when the cylinder was placed over it(inserted) because the cylinder entrance on both sides is not chamfered at all and presents a sharp edge to the flexible lip seal. In any case it seemed like the damage wouldn't prevent me from trying to stuff my first batch of sausage. I only tried to stuff about 3.5 lbs of meat with this device and I would say, that is about the most I would try unaided. The control was excellent in terms of moving the meat mixture into the casing even if slow. My biggest disappointment was the tediousness of filling the narrow tube with fresh meat. It seems like the narrow tube holds a bit under 1 pound per loading. The small diameter of the tube made it difficult to refill with the sticky meat mixture without creating massive air pockets. I have to admit that the manufacturer responded to my damage complaint and sent me a new kit free of charge.<br />It is a completely different model (38239) which I haven't found too much information yet. The tube, piston and mechanism are completely different and the tube is now chamfered. Instead of screwing on and off the tube to refill, the tube slips out of the cage type holder. In addition, the new one's mechanism for advancing the piston is now completely open instead of closed which should allow for the ability to thoroughly clean it. I haven't tried it yet but I think it may be a better choice for small batches than the original one. However its tube diameter (1-7/8") is even smaller than the original (2")so it will hold even less meat and be more difficult to refill. These small, caulking gun types of stuffers are ideal for the small home sausage maker, but when I decide to stuff more than about 3-4 pounds at a time, I will have to invest in something more appropriate.<br />I would say that the value was very good for the price, but it's probably a better jerky maker than a sausage stuffer due to its size.

review/summary: the main ingrediant for the perfect meal
review/text: Ronzoni's Ziti pasta makes for an easy dish to cook when you want a hot meal without a lot of fuss. It can also be the main ingredient for a meal that has pasta with sauce as part of a main course dish. The pasta remains quite fresh until any expiration date that is printed on the box; and each box contains enough ziti for eight servings.<br /><br />The pasta is so easy to cook: just boil a pot of water; pour in the amount of the ziti that you need; and stir for about 10 minutes. If you like your pasta a bit firm then cook it for about 8 minutes--watch it and take a taste test of just one piece of pasta if you have any doubts. Some people add a little salt while the pasta cooks; I personally don't add salt. I never noticed any difference between salted and unsalted because the small amount of salt that you're supposed to add makes no big difference.<br /><br />The pasta is very low in fat; and it contains no trans-fats--thank goodness! This pasta contains no cholesterol and no sodium, either. That's very good health news. It does contain carbohydrates as you may have suspected; but a single serving still keeps those carbs low at only 14% of the daily allowance of carbs. Great!<br /><br />Ronzoni states on the front of the box that this macaroni pasta is enriched; I assume they are referring to the Iron, Niacin and Riboflavin in the pasta. The pasta has 7 grams of protein per serving as well. In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />There are some caveats, however: this product contains wheat and it is made in a facility that uses eggs. If this is a concern for you please consult your doctor or nutritional expert.<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem. Just call Ronzoni using their toll free number or visit their website.<br /><br />Overall, this ziti by Ronzoni is the best out there! It's affordable; easy to cook and serve; and it doesn't pose any major health risks to the vast majority of people. I highly recommend this fine pasta.

review/summary: Passing the buck (sauce)
review/text: *** I'm going to file an A to Z claim now since Vitacost has already stated they will not take any action for this error as they blame Amazon for misinformation. Per description and picture, a single order should be 6 bottles of Walden Farms Alfredo Pasta Sauce. I placed for orders and expected to receive 24 bottles. Instead, I received 4 bottles. I called Vitacost this morning and spoke to Tekatra who claimed that Vitacost shipped the order as placed by Amazon and Vitacost is not going to be held responsible for misinformation. I certainly feel cheated and would like a full refund or, more preferable, my order completed with the appropriate number of product with free shipping.

review/text: I think this product listing is clear-enough - Both the title and the product image read "6-pack." The delivery arrived at my door in a box large enough to fit a microwave oven. I open it and found layers and layers of wrapping - half of my box was filled with bubble wrap and plastic cushion bags. Inside several meters of bubble wrap was - ONE JAR of Alfredo sauce. Not only do I feel cheated from not receiving what I ordered and paid for, but I am absolutely astounded by the environmentally-unfriendly product packaging. There was no invoice with my order, simply an advertisement for another of VitaCost's products (you can be sure I will not buy it). Needless to say, I'm not feeling too happy with the product nor the company right now.

review/summary: Nice coffee from around the world
review/text: Just got this the other day.  Nice sampler, coffee from many different countries, no blends, just beans from the area.  All of them are good, ranging from mild to bold in flavor so there is something for everyone.  The Brazilian is an extra bold, gives you a bit more coffee in the cup.  There was even Peruvian, I didn't know they grew coffee, very nice stuff.  Looks like we are getting some more choices now to the Green Mountain and Tully's blends.  This is good for the consumer, more choices and lower prices from competition.

review/summary: Peruvian
review/text: I purchased the Peruvian coffee and it is only "okay." It has a smooth flavor but it is a bit weak and it definitely doesn't brew a `full-body' cup of coffee.  Also, the plastic cup and lid are a little stronger than all the other k-cups that I've tried and every time I put it in the coffeemaker I have to apply enough pressure that I worry that it might damage it.  So, I will still use the product that I have but I will certainly not be purchasing it again.

review/summary: Unpleasant experience
review/text: This is for Costa Rica blend. I do not like giving bad reviews but I rely on reviews myself , so I feel it important. Amazon sent me an email about their newest kcups and I was excited to try them. After looking at all choices and description, and reviews, although they were hard to find since most were for the variety pack; I chose the Costa Rica blend. I did not want too bold a coffee and this seemed to fit the bill. After trying two brews with different strengths, this coffee just tastes " off" and like an inexpensive coffee. It actually upset my stomach causing acid, with very little consumed. Specifically, though, the taste is weak, like old coffee;  not smooth or full flavor, and the smell which I noticed immediately-had an unpleasant aroma. Not the great coffee smell we all welcome with our morning coffee. Maybe I got a bad batch but the date was ok and these are new, so I think it's the way they are. I cannot recommend.

review/summary: Sugar-free ripoff
review/text: I have been eating healthy and using products with Splenda instead of sugar in them for many years. I have been using Aspen Mulling Spices even longer than that. As soon as there is the tiniest hint of cold in the air I start mixing this in to every drink I have. This year, for the first time, I decided to order the sugar-free version and I was extremely disappointed. First off.. while it isn't obvious anywhere in the Amazon ad, it is only 2oz compared to 5.65oz of the original. So nearly 1/3 the amount but for the same price (or even higher). I get if this was 10+ years ago and Splenda was still new and magical and a fad, but there are few other products out there anymore that charge more simply because they're made with Splenda. And to make it even worse, looking on the packaging where it gives you recommended amounts to use for different drinks, some of the amounts it suggests are now higher. For example: 1.5tbsp for Brandy on the original, but 2tbsp for sugar-free. So you'll also be going through this faster. And finally, to me, the taste just isn't the same. I'm not talking about Splenda vs sugar, I don't use real sugar in anything. But the actual product seems to be different. It is an extremely fine powder, closer to the consistency of powdered sugar, whereas the original is more like regular sugar or salt in consistency. Whatever they have done has completely changed the flavor profile to me. And again I'm talking about the taste of cinnamon, of cloves, etc, not how sweet it is. I have been shopping on Amazon for a long long time and this is the first product I have actually reviewed. If you want this healthy-nuts opinion... just order the original and use it in moderation. Just like anything else.

review/text: These fenugreek seeds were very fresh when they arrived! I do quite a bit of Indian cooking and fresh ingredients are a must! And although the other reviewer said how these had NO safety seal, this is true, however, the are also not manufactured in some factory where they then sit on your grocers shelves for weeks or even months! These are packaged once you order them for all over freshness when they arrive at your door. I have ordered many spices by Ajika and have been very satisfied with the quality! I have also ordered fresh curry leaves, and they too arrive in the same manner as these spices. If you are one of those people who are weary about something being factory sealed, by all means look further, however, if you are like me and prefer fresh quality ingredients, these are superb!

The hose end sprayer works great, but I would just warn any users that the fatty substance that comprises this product is an eye irritant, so use protection. Repeat sprayings are necessary, but this is far safer than using some dangerous chemical--it's basically strong soap.

I do not recommend this product and I will be trying the Scotts brand granules next as the reviews on that product are great and it is actually cheaper than this.

review/text: I ordered the Safer Brand Moss and Algea killer to kill Algea growing on part of the North facing roof of our home. First I washed the area with a pressure washer which washed away most of these algeas. I then used this product to kill any of the residual algeas close to the roof flashing. I did use the product on a day when the temperature was 65 degrees or higher. It did not show much of a difference. A few days later when I was looking at that section of the roof it still looked green.I will try it again in late spring next year to see if it produces any better result.One generous application should have done the job!Not very pleased.<br />I repeated the application again in June 2012 and am happy to say that the moss spray worked like a wonder. The moss growing on the roof facing north is now completely dead!<br />A vigorous shaking of the bottle is required and there is a little push button next to the spray gun which must be completely pushed out. I will give it a 5 star rating!

You're better off staying away altogether anyway, and you may want to do what I did and contact Nestle consumer service to complain about their deceptive practices.

review/summary: bad ingredients
review/text: If you are watching what you eat and don't want to eat trans fats, then you should avoid this product or any other product that has partially hydrogenated oils in them. It's pretty fricking brilliant that the FDA allows a product to be labelled with 0 trans fat per serving when its actually about a half gram per serving. If the FDA really cared about this they would demand that labelling shows EXACTLY what is in the product. If you drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day with this stuff in it, you are getting a nice big dose of trans fat and doing yourself harm. This is not a liver friendly food. Eat liver friendly and you will live a long life. Your liver is the filter for the body. Just like a pool filter, once it gets clogged, it doesn't work good. Fortunately, the liver is one organ that can repair itself if you let it. Remember, eat liver friendly foods.

review/text: I use Coffe-Mate Hazelnut, Sugar-Free coffee creamer in my coffee because it gives me "a warm feeling, like I am special and deserve pampering"!!!<br />I shop on Amazon to save money and time! I can buy the products I use most at much reduced prices and it saves me tons of time by shipping right to my door. By using the "super saver plan", I save even more! And Amazon notifies me when it is time for my "super saver plan" purchases to be shipped again. I love everything about shopping with Amazon. They make my life easier and financialy sound!

review/summary: Will Not Desolove Well
review/text: The creamer is excellent as far as flavor goes, but it takes a long time to desolve in any temperture of coffee. I do not know if it is because it is sugar free or not. Other then the fact that I wish they had larger sizes of it, it is just fine to use.

review/summary: Killer Creamer
review/text: Wow. This has been my favorite creamer for about three years now. I drink 5-6 cups of coffee a morning and may have a few during the day. A 'serving' of this is about two tablespoons for my coffee. I like it white and sweet!<br /><br />So what I've just learned it that I've basically been injesting a lethal dosage of trans fat every single day.<br />1 gram of transfat for every cup of coffee I drink. I had no idea.<br /><br />WAY TO GO FDA!! Wonder what they got paid to make this minor exclusion.<br />Thanks Nestle for expoiting the system. Should be attempted murder.

review/summary: Great chocolates
review/text: The second these got on my doorstep I brought them into the house I proceeded to open them and tasted all 3 of the flavors I started with the remy martin I bit into it and it oozed a goo (I was expecting liquid) I mostly tasted the chocolate nothing else I moved onto the orange vodka I bit into this and WOW it tasted strongly of oranges (well duh) finally moving onto the cointerui I bit into it and while it didnt have much flavor it burned (just like real vodka) which suprised me because its only 0.5% alcohol ... I should also note these DO have alcohol in them so dont go giving these away on haloween XDDD anyways kool chocolates these will be a hit on new years I will order again

review/summary: over priced and little if any Liquor in each chocolate
review/text: The price online was a little high and they had very little liquor inside the chocolates. I eventually found some Liquor filled Chocolates at a local liquor store. It was a 1/3 of the price and contained much more liquor then the ones I got on amazon. I will never order a product from JollyCandy again.

review/summary: Love New Orleans Gourmet Products
review/text: I use all of the New Orleans Gourmet products, especially the beans--love the seasonings--being a lazy senior citizen, after washing the beans I simply spray the crockpot with Pam, add the water, the beans (don't even soak them), the seasonings and turn the crockpot on high for four hours and then reduce the heat to low and cook until desired tenderness. If you are adding chicken or sausage, don't add it until the end of the cooking period.  Then just make some Southern Style Cornbread and enjoy.

review/text: I bought these and another brand and although the others are good, these are much better. The flavor is terrific, the cookies must contain real butter to taste this good. We will be buying more.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: If you're one that picks out the dark brown chips from the bag first, you'll love being able to have a whole handful at a time to munch on.  I found these in Michigan and have been having them shipped to Georgia for the last year from the manufacturer.  I even give them away to family and friends who love them.<br />K from Ga Richard's wife

review/text: I still mourn the loss of Cap Cod's Dark Russet.  These are similar.  Very nice carmelized taste.  It's a good thing I can't afford to buy them often.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This Halva is the best one we've tried.  The vanilla taste is not too strong and it's not too sweet--just perfectly delicious!  Makes for a great breakfast spread on toast with a steaming cup of green tea.  Be sure to store it in the fridge so it stays fresh.

review/summary: OK Coffee
review/text: I purchased the coffee maker based on being able to get Starbucks. I purchased boxes of Starbucks, Columbian and Breakfast Blend, but am now running low. I decided I would try some others. I hated Grevalia, the Maxwell House is OK coffee, but like drinking flavored water, when I saw the French Roast, which is supposed to be DARK and assumed stronger and fairly inexpensive, I thought I should at least try it. It is hard to replace Starbucks, but the French Roast is OK, not wonderful. I tried the Narob and several different others, but FOR ME this is going to have to be my Starbucks replacement.<br />I had heard that Tassimo was supposed to get a better choice by mid to end of summer and it appears they have fallen short. I had heard that Starbucks was to partner with Cruinart, but so far it's not showing up. I'm not sure these single cup guys are so great, when you are forced to a limited brand of coffees. We are back to Corporate America manipulating our morning cup of wake up.
