review/summary: Instant Hit!
review/text: This prodcut was a hit from the first try! We have tried a number of way to get our little ones to eat fruits and veggies.  Mashup's Beetbox Berry reminds them of fruit juice, so its a good way to get their daily servings.  I recommand this prodcut.  A must try!

review/text: I really like the Mash Ups. I have tried other flavors and they are all equally tasty. I love foods that I can feel good about my kids eating and these are one of them. I love the fact that I'm sneaking in veggies that my kids wouldn't normally eat (beets) but they don't taste them!

review/summary: Awesome healthy and fun snack
review/text: We got one of these in a birthday party bag-of-treats and ever since have been buying these in bulk via Amazon.  In the stores like BabiesRUs they cost over $1 per pouch but on Amazon you can order 24 at a time and get around 70 cents per pouch.  I wish they sold them in higher quantities because they only are 4 per box which is a waste of packing materials - but at any rate it is worth it for the quality and nutrition of the snack.  We even have a song: "I'm a little fruit drink, short and stout, here is my pouch and here is my spout, when you get real thirsty hear me shout, put me in your mouth and suck me out!" and our 2 year old guzzles them.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Amazing idea, daughter loves them!
review/text: My 19-month old daughter absolutely loves these and they are so convenient and an easy snack on the go or during a busy day. I would like to hug the person that first thought of these fruit/veggie pouches! It's a great way to get my toddler to eat vegetables (which she normally refuses, unless if they are peas!) and she loves fruit, so it is perfect!

review/summary: Healthy, no-mess snack for on the go
review/text: We were recently introduced to these snack bags and as a mom of 3 active toddlers on the move - I love them.  I went to Target and bought singles of all different flavors/brands and tried them all to see what everyone liked.  The kids told me which ones they liked, and then I picked these for the mix of fruit AND veggies (as opposed to the just straight up fruit).  They are quick and healthy options for the kids when we are on the go.  I keep some in the car and in my purse for when hunger strikes.  As I said, I especially like these because they are made with vegetable puree in addition to the fruit.  With 3 toddlers, it can be hard to get them to eat their veggies - so I like that they at least get a little veggies in their snack.<br /><br />I rated 4 instead of 5 stars because they are on the expensive side, though Amazon still has one of the best prices I could find. We use subscribe & save, and eat them only a couple times a week for snack.

review/text: I won't give my son anything I won't eat so I tried a bit of this.  You can definitely taste the beets and some fruit.  I thought my smarty son would turn up his nose, but he likes it.  So much so, he finishes a pack in about 8 seconds.  It's a great on-the-go snack for my little one.  I only wish they made more flavors with veggies.

review/summary: these are great!
review/text: I made my now 2.5 year old son's first baby foods, but quickly found that homemade purees weren't exactly easy to take out and about - they had to be kept refrigerated or frozen, then warmed to a comfortable temperature, then spooned into baby's mouth, or handed over to a toddler who enjoys tipping over bowls and banging messy spoons. Definitely more difficult than I wanted when trying to feed my little one on the go. I needed an easier option, and found it in these Mashups pouches. No utensils needed. No refrigeration needed (though they're great chilled, or even partly frozen, during the summer months). They even encourage independence in babies who can hold the pouches themselves for self-feeding. And of course, they're jam-packed with fruit and veggies and nothing else. Awesome! From a mom's point of view, how can you go wrong with a snack that's organic, natural, and so easy to bring on-the-go?<br /><br />I keep a stash of them in my diaper bag for when we're on-the-go, and I've been known to grab one for myself from time to time! But they're not just mom-approved. My son really enjoys these, too. He's been eating them since his baby days, and continues to love slurping them as snacks. I keep a bunch of them in a "snack basket" (along with cookies, crackers, and other goodies) - my little guy knows he can take something from there anytime he wants a snack. He brings me a pouch to open more often than he grabs cookies! His current favorite flavor is the Beetbox Berry "red ones!" but he enjoys all the Mashups flavors.<br /><br />Best of all, I get them here at Amazon with the Subscribe & Save discount - the price here can't be beat.

I always carry a box of these in my car and at least one in my purse for those moments when the children are hungry for a little snack.  They're absolutely delicious (I've tried them myself!), and they're so easy to carry around.

review/summary: verrrrry salty, but still good
review/text: At this point, my family and I have cycled through all the PopCorners flavors. The Butter flavor was the last we tried. For those unfamiliar, PopCorners are sort of a popped corn chip- they are an interesting combination of a Frito with a rice cake, but absolutely flat and crispy. However, the texture and the flavor makes them seem incredibly indulgent. They are really delicious, not your typical dry, crumbly, cut-the-roof-of-your-mouth with sharp corners healthy chips.<br /><br />The butter flavor is good. I don't personally think it tastes like popcorn, but my husband and daughter do. Maybe popcorn that was, like, roasted over a fire. But, wow are these salty! I'm all about saltiness but I have to admit, I wonder if these aren't a tad *too* salty. However, I would still choose them over the other snack we have in the pantry- Pirate's Booty, whole grain chips, cheddar rice cakes, pretzels, etc.<br /><br />I like the butter, and will happily munch my way through the pack of 40 snack bags we purchased throughout the next month, but my favorite PopCorner flavor is hands down SeaSalt.

review/summary: Yummy and "ALMOST" like buttered popcorn at the movies
review/text: I LOVE the very unhealthy buttered popcorn the theaters sell.  I rarely go to the movies but will go inside and order the large tub with extra butter --- yum. So when I saw this product and read the reviews, I thought I should at least give it a try.  Well it came today.  I opened the first little package and it smelled like buttered popcorn.  I tasted it and it had that flavor.  Of course it isnt dripping with the fake butter that theaters use, but these are very good.  I also like the crunchiness -------- hmmm break them up and use for a coating or topping on a casserole.  Anyway I have now ordered the white cheddar and the kettle.  I will make a review on the other two as soon as I get them.

review/summary: Yummy, but Salty and Lots of Whey !
review/text: I love the taste and the gentle crunch of Popcorners, but the Butter flavor has lots of whey, salt and other ingredients that over do the really lovely taste of the "chip."  I'm one of those people who don't do well with Whey and if you are too, consider the sea salt version which is my favorite.  They are less salty, and contain only corn, oil and sea salt, no extra additives.<br /><br />What I do love completely, is the size of this little bag. It's perfect for a snack, great for a car trip, and just the right amount. And the cost is just over $.40 per bag for a healthy yummy snack.<br /><br />If Whey's not an issue for you, you will probably enjoy the taste of the Buttered version as it is very close to the taste of movie theater buttered popcorn.

Although the product is actually produced in China, we would never had known had we not read the label. The ingredients include sesame seed, horse radish, shaved bonito (a relative of the tuna), Japanese mustard plant, sugar, chopped seaweed, soy sauce, salt, and cooking rice wine. Despite the horse radish and Japanese mustard plant ingredients, it is not spicy. It actually has a slightly sweet fish flavor that I recommend sprinkling on your rice and rice balls.

review/summary: One of the top two brands of Decaf K-Cups
review/text: If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!

It is now my most favorite k-cup coffee. I was never into "Decaf" before, and I feel that this coffee will make, both Decaf and Regular coffee drinkers alike, very happy. Don't hessitate to try this blend, you will not be sorry.

review/text: I am a very fussy coffee drinker and this is, without any doubt at all, the best of the decafs available.  You feel like you've had a 'real' cup of coffee.......not too weak, not too strong, but with a rich look and taste.  No one, on a dare, could ever tell that this isn't regular coffee or 'high-test' as I like to call it.  For the record, I've tried many different brands and Tully in general is always very good.

review/summary: A good cup of decaf
review/text: It is difficult to find a good tasting decaf coffee. Often it's due to lack of selection and or attempt to please too many tastes. I tend to go for a strong yet "un-smoky" cup of coffee. Not too many decafs fit that bill. While this could be even a bit stronger for me it has the most body and flavor balance I've found in decaf yet...in traditional or K-Cup varieties.

review/summary: Inferior K-cup product
review/text: Although the flavor of the coffee is good, the K-cup is not properly sealed.  The cover seal breaks when brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in the brewed coffee and coffee coffee grounds in the Keurig brewer.  This necessitates a thorough cleaning of the brewer each time a new K-cup is used.  I ordered and received two boxes of Tullys House Blend.  I have not opened the second box because of the inferior seal on the K-cup.

review/summary: K-Cup foil not sealed and hot coffee spurts out all over
review/text: We purchased two 24-count packages of Tully's House Decaf. Obviously something went wrong in manufacturing of these K-Cups.  After we began the brew cycle, very hot coffee came out over the top of the K-Cup and the compartment in many directions and only a portion of it went into our mug below.  Thinking it was only a problem with that one, we tried another.  When it happened again, we investigated more closely.  The foil seal over the top of the K-Cup is not complete.  Very hot water under pressure inside the K-Cup was forced up and out, along with coffee grounds, and sprayed quite a distance from the machine. Our Keurig is in the bedroom - what a mess!

I ordered a sample pack from another site and it contained one of the Tully's. It was sooo good, I can't begin to tell you how excited I was!<br /><br />I hopped online in search of the best price for the quantity on these kcups! I found it here.<br /><br />This coffee reminds me of a warm, nutty toasty regular cup of joe that I used to get at a local restaurant!

review/summary: Don't Buy this!
review/text: We buy a lot of K-cups for our Keurig, typically going through about 4-6 a day. We often buy various ones to satisfy different tastes.<br /><br />This is the only brand that we have purchased that has given us problems. Not only have the k-cups exploded, leaving grounds all over the machine both inside and out, but every single k-cup in the two 24-count packages has done this. At first, we thought we just received a bad batch in one of the two packages that was a part of the order, but when the k-cups in both of the packages did this for k-cup after k-cup (there wasn't a single one that did not explode and leave coffee ground in the coffee mug, machine, or outside of the machine), we knew it wasn't a fluke.<br /><br />Since there is no return on food...buyer beware.

review/summary: Good tasting coffee, poor quality k-cups
review/text: I just want to chime in with the other reviewers who noted the poor quality of these k-cups. Half of the k-cups I purchased explode in my coffee machine because the foil over the top of the cup is not sealed properly. Not only is it disappointing and a waste of money, it's a real pain to clean your machine after an explosion of coffee grounds. This is unfortunate because I think Tully's has the best quality coffee, particularly decaf, you can find out there in k-cups right now. I heard Starbucks is going to get in the k-cup business at some point. Hopefully sooner than later.

Some of the K-cup blends that I have tried are terrific, some are okay, and some don't have much taste. This product is closer to the good end of that continuum than to the bad end.<br /><br />It is labeled "extra bold." Perhaps not quite so. Still, it does have a rich taste and is a delightful way to begin the day.<br /><br />So, I am a satisfied customer and intend to keep drinking this particualr brand.

During the day I drink Newman's Own Organic Special Blend and in the evening I have a cup of Tully's.  While they don't taste exactly alike (Tully's is a little weaker, I'd say) it's still a great alternative.  It's so hard to find a good decaf and I'm thrilled that I finally found one!!  It's fairly strong and bold but not skunky or overpowering in it's flavor.  I highly recommend it!!

I usually don't care for house roasts, I was even really disappointed when I opened the Amazon box and realized my mistake.  I decided to try it instead of sending it back and I'm glad I did!  I like a darker and richer cup of coffee, and this one is nice and dark and very smooth.  It's not watery like many decaf coffees and it doesn't taste like the donut shoppe type coffees that I really dislike that decaf coffee always seems to taste like.  It also makes an excellent iced coffee on the smallest setting on the Keurig B70 Platinum.  I sometimes make iced coffee on the 5-1/4 cup setting and it still comes out pretty strong.  It's really the perfect decaf coffee.  Even better than at the coffee house!  You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Great taste but explodes
review/text: The coffee has a great flavor for decaf. I am disapointed in my most recent shipments. One in four of the k-cups explodes in the machine when prepared. The top comes undone and grounds and hot water go every where. We brew other offer coffee in our machine without any issues. I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases.

review/summary: Makes a good cup of decaf
review/text: Sometimes I want a coffee but not the caffeine.<br />Decided to try a box of these cups and was pleasantly rewarded.  Some reviews are too light, some are too string.  I find the "standard" Keurig poor is just right for me with about one tablespoon of regular Coffee Mate powder.  Enough body to be flavorful without overpowering.

Strong and dark, but smooth and flavorful. Tully's, you've got a winner!

review/text: Product sent was "extra bold" which we did not want. Thought it was my error, gave it away. When re-ordered, same result; Amazon sent yet another replacement- same thing. There is no "regular decaf", at least not on Amazon- a HUGE waste of time. Rep said they pulled the listing; I'd suggest only ordering where there are reviews.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: Of the decaf K-cups I have tried, this is my new favorite and the only decaf I stock in my house.  It is strong, but smooth without any bite.  I serve it to my husband sometimes, who hates decaf, and he likes it.  Emeril's was good, but I believe this is better.  For some guests in my house, it may be too strong.  I just make 16 oz. with it in an oversized mug, then split it and it still tastes fine that way.

review/summary: High cost, low yield
review/text: I was surprised (and disappointed) by how little Jimbu I received in my container, considering the cost. However, it is incredibly difficult to find a place selling Jimbu, so I went ahead and purchased it for the convenience of being able to make some Dal Bhat. Now that I've had my dal bhat fix, I think I'll wait until I can make a trip to a speciality spice store to see if I can find it there for a cheaper price. If not, maybe I'll just become a spice importer! :)<br /><br />For those in the Seattle area: you can supposedly find Jimbu at Market Spice in Pike Place Market. (206) 622-6340<br />I'm not sure their prices would be any better, but I'll definitely check it out.

review/summary: Caffe D Vita Cappuccino
review/text: This is a very tasty product... I usually mix it with real coffee, or just drink it alone in hot water.  I would totally recommend it for anyone that likes Cappuccino.  It says 99% caffine free, but I can "feel" what caffine there is in it! I do add splenda because it isn't real sweet.<br />  The only negative thing, is that the cannisters are only 1/2 full on opening.  So by buying 6 I combine and end up with only 3 cannisters.  Seems like "wasted space" to me.  But, I do love the product.

review/summary: Rich Cappuccino without the Calories
review/text: Caf&eacute; D'Vita began as a stand-in for theSugar-Free International Coffees that seem to have been scaled back as far as availability is concerned. It will most likely replace the International Coffee. It tastes more like coffee with the desert-like flavor of Cappuccino. I like to mix French Vanilla and Mocha flavors, and since Caf&eacute; D'Vita has both, I'm a happy camper...with one exception. Too expensive! However, the International Coffees are no bargain; so it'll be Caf&eacute; D'Vita from now on.

review/text: I love cappuccino and usually order Maxwell House but because I wanted to try a sugar free product I ordered Caffe D'Vita.<br />Cappuccino: light , fluffy, rich and tasty ? NOT D'Vita's just Dark, Flat and Bitter.<br />I added powdered creamer to try and lighten it, extra sweetener, more vanilla but nothing can get it to taste better. Just a waste of time and money.<br />I live in Africa and wait 2 months to receive my orders, now I have to wait another 2 months to receive the cappuccino I should have stuck with my Maxwell House Cappuccino.<br />Do yourself a favour and run from this product, I wish I had.

review/summary: Very Bitter Tasting Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free
review/text: I wish I had read all the reviews prior to ordering this stuff.  I wanted to switch to sugar free for lower calories, but wow did I get the bitter end of the taste doing that.  This stuff is terrible if you want a sweet tasting product.  No amount of sweetner can help and now I'm out the money for a product that I can't return....that isn't right.  If bought at a store they would take the unopened items back. Guess I'll have to donate it. If you want good tasting sugar free french vanilla cappuccino then order Victorian Inn.  At least theirs isn't bitter like this stuff by Caffe D'Vita.  Regular Caffe D'Vita is good, sugar free is bad very very bad.
