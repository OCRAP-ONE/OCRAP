review/summary: Dry, looks like cat food
review/text: I purchased the Turkey pouches because my 8 month old loved the Chick Chick.  This is nothing like the Chick Chick.  This looks like a dry paste and it smells bad too.  Currently I'm mixing them with a jar of the Earth's Best Organics 2oz veggie jar in order to give it some texture other than cat food.  This is absolutely nothing like the Chick Chick with is a hearty puree with actual pieces of chicken and pasta.  I would not recommend it.

review/summary: The best salmon out there
review/text: This is the only way I can get my daughter to eat fish.  I often add extra coconut oil and cinnamon to improve the taste though.  She didn't like it the first time, but after a few attempts she enjoys it.  She screams when I try to feed her any other brand of salmon, and so I think this one is worth a try.  If they don't like it, just mix it with something they do like. Great ingredients, great product.

review/text: Cons:<br />1. Neither of my children liked the taste. They loved Earth's Best, even the vegetables.<br />2. It is not as convenient as the Earth's Best when travelling since you have to carry a spare container to serve this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. BPA free packaging<br />2. Organic and preservative free.<br /><br />The lining of the lids in Earth's Best is reported to contain BPA. My search for quality baby food continues...

review/text: My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors.

review/text: So fishy that our cat is all over this the moment I cut the packaging open.  The smell is very strong.  My baby did not take to it.  It is our cat's food now.<br /><br />Their other products are much better, but this one is way too fishy.  It doesn't smell pleasant when you go out to a friend's house or restaurant.  If I just wipe the spoon and bowl without washing after feeding this and put it back in the backpack, after I get home the whole thing reeks.

review/summary: Happy Salmon Eating Baby
review/text: I was worried about it before I served it to my 12 month old... but after a tentative first session (there is a pretty strong salmon smell, and he seems opposed to strong scents), he's since eaten this package w/o problem, and finishes it every time!  We're pretty pleased with this meal - great texture and I feel good that he's getting some salmon in his diet.  We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch, but since it only happened once, I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package, but definitely I keep an eye for now.  It might have been one bad package in the stack... so it's still probably advisable to not serve this if you're going to be away from home :).

review/text: I really like the Happy Baby "Chick Chick" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different - much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood! It reminds me much too much of cat food.<br /><br />All is not lost - our little guy would eat it, provided I dunked each bite in some pureed sweet potato or squash first. But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: My 18 month old liked it, my 3 year old did not.
review/text: My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein, and try upping the fish. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien, and were salmon.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.

When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the "food".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close.

Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed.

review/summary: Healthy Alternative for Working Moms
review/text: I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food.  If that's you, hat's off.  You're my hero.  I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing.  Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there.  And these days, I think most of them are good.  The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits.  They're easy to find and inexpensive.  But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all.  The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go.  We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).  The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats.  So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel.  Baby will love them!

review/summary: Does NOT promote healthy growth and development
review/text: I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein/fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein/essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby.  Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he/she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories.<br /><br />That makes this a nutrient poor food.  And HappyBaby a pretty despicable company.

review/text: We just got a new shipment in, and it is not the same Chick Chick our son has come to know and love.  This new stuff resembles the texture of their "Gobble Gobble" food, which our son absolutely hates.  I'm sure this stuff is great, but if you aren't sure your kid will like it, don't spend money on 16 of them up front.<br /><br />Be aware that you can't return this item.

review/summary: Don't give up and give it more then one try!
review/text: I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it.

review/text: Our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other Happy Baby foods (she LOVES the Gobble-Gobble & Mango-Spinach-Pear).  However, this one makes her throw up EVERY time!  She is not allergic to anything in the ingredients - I can only guess that the high tomato content is just too acidic for her tummy.

review/text: While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating.

review/summary: Why mess with a good thing?
review/text: What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily - so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken broth and a blender!  I'll be cancelling my subscribe and save subscription to this product.

review/text: First of all, I'd say that this product tastes more like sweet potato than chicken. The white lumpy stuff in the package tastes like brown rice pasta than chicken. So I am not where the chicken is cuz you can't taste it. But my daughter absolutely loves it. She gobbles down the whole thing in minutes (except her teething time).<br /><br />Although I am skeptical about the chicken part, I have to trust the labeling that says heavy amount of protein is in there.<br /><br />I also tried the turkey and chicken training meal from Plum brand. It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum brand a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products.

review/summary: Baby HATES the new recipe!  (Loved the old formulation).
review/text: My 9-month-old absolutely adored the old recipe of this product, which was organic chicken, sweet potatoes, and brown rice pasta.  She would gobble up an entire pouch every time we offered it to her, and often ask for more.  Unfortunately, Happy Baby had to go and ruin a good thing by reformulating the product!  The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.  I definitely won't be buying this product again, unless Happy Baby goes back to the old formulation.  Grade: D-

review/text: My son loved the original recipe Chick Chick but Happy Baby has now changed the recipe.  My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to "improve" upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten.

review/summary: Too Thick
review/text: I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.

He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little "mmms" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato/acidic flavor of this meal.

I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched.

review/text: My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients.

review/summary: It taste sour more than anything...
review/text: My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes sour. The taste of tomato is too strong. Tomato has lycopene, a antioxidant for good health, but my son just won't eat. He like other happy baby productx like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.

review/summary: dont buy in bulk!
review/text: Its been a while since I tried this but I decided to write up a review anyway.  My little one LOVES his pouches, but this is one he would not have.  After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.  I'd suggest you try ONE pouch to see if you like it before you purchase several.

review/text: My son isn't a particularly picky eater but occasionally he gets fussy.  No matter what his mood is, this is a great meal option to fall back on because he'll always eat it.  Also the pouch sturdy and makes it a good travel-meal option.  A little expensive but worth every penny!

review/summary: very yummy my daughter loves it
review/text: It is a mixture of chicken, sweet potato and pasta. But you can't really see the chicken, and I guess it has been pureed really fine. My daughter loves it and can finish the whole pack under 5 minutes. I like it becuase it has a good combination of protein, fiber and carbs. Plus it is organic! This is the second case I bought, and will continue buying. And the shipping was fast and packing is very good.

review/text: Love the nutrition, but it was a little strong for my 7 month old who had just started solids at 6 months. (Exclusively BF) First couple of bits he gagged quite a bit, so we simply stuck it in our little $10 food processer from Wal-Mart and added 1/4 of a banana.  He wolfed it down like nothing.  Applesauce works well also.  Will definetly buy more!

review/text: I wish I had bought a single packet before committing to the case.  My baby made a horrible face when I gave this to him.  My husband and I both tried it and it has a very unpleasant and strong after taste.  We opened a few different packets to see if maybe only one was bad.  They are all the same.

review/text: Our son loved this.  Great to take with us when we are going out as compared to big bulky and heavy bottles (ie Earths Best baby food)  The only issue we had was that my wife, for some reason, could never open the top.  She would always screw it up somehow.  Easy fix however, just have daddy open it.  Also wish it was re sealable, but our son ate all of the Gobbe Gobble 95% of the time so wasn't an issue.  Overall, very pleased and wish we had tried these out earlier.

review/text: First, the other happy baby flavors have been a hit with my baby and me.  But this mama grain is indescribable.  I knew it as soon as I opened the pouch...The smell is awful...But I figured we would try it anyway.  I only wish I had the video camera out...Baby didn't like this one at all and I can't blame him.  Recommend buying one pack regardless of the price before getting the 16 pack.

Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,<br />and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this brand and they<br />were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all.

Since it comes 16 packages at a time, I have several packages leftover and now that he's almost 2, I still give it to my kid as a big appetizer while we order and wait for the food to come at restaurants.  He still loves it (despite being able to eat all sorts of "regular" food).  Much better than just loading up on tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants!

review/summary: My cats love this product
review/text: I really do like the Healthy Baby Baby foods.  I buy them with the Amazon Prime free shipping.  I also "subscribe and save".  I get 16 at a time.  The baby doesn't mine eating the same flavor each day for 16 days, but at the end of 16 days, he smells like cat food.  Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it- you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one- and constant- complaint.

review/summary: Blend your own baby food
review/text: I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75.

review/summary: Recipe changed with no warning - packaging pictured is out of date
review/text: My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.

review/text: Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with bread dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!

review/summary: Thumbs down for the new ingredient
review/text: I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!
