review/summary: This was my second order...
review/text: And I loved it even more than the first!<br /><br />The first time I ordered, I would say 80% was coffee (regular, flavored, decaf) with a couple of teas and I believe 1 hot chocolate thrown in the bunch. Most of the coffee was Green Valley. While I couldn't complain about the GV coffee, I had hoped for a little more variety. Overall, I had been pretty happy with that shipment, at least enough to try it out again.<br /><br />Well, the second order was awesome. Along with some fabulous coffees that I'd been wanting to try and a new brand I hadn't even heard of -- Brookyln -- I also got several apple cider, hot chocolate, teas, and even a couple of iced teas and iced coffees. There simply isn't a better way to try out all the varieties that you can use with your Keurig. Maybe I just got lucky, but there is only 1 or 2 Kcups that are repeats from the prior shipment.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering again!

review/summary: great variety
review/text: I have a new coffeemaker and wanted to try a variety pack of coffees to see which ones I liked the best.  The pods arrived in a brown paper bag that was stapled shut but the bag was inside a box with air pockets so the bag was intact.  All the pods were in good condition and none of them were beyond the expiration date.  There is a great variety...just what I wanted, of coffees, teas, and cocoas.  I received 35 different varieties and I can't wait to try every one of them.  This is a great way to try different varieties before you buy a whole box of something and then decide you don't like it. I will probably buy this again when these 35 are gone just so I can have a good variety for myself and guests.  Definitely a good buy!

review/text: I liked almost every one of the samples I received in this sampler box... It allowed me to try different types of coffee without having to buy full boxes of coffees I didn't like. I believe everyone should get a sampler box at some point to figure what different kinds are out there without wasting your money on coffees you don't like!

review/text: Not trilled maybe sad. There were 28 coffees and 7 teas nothing else. I thought I'd get a selection. I wanted to try cocoa and apple cider but as many here have said there is no variety. There were 35 different products both dark coffee and medium. There were 6 flavored coffees and 4 decaf coffees. But not the wide variety I had expected. Also although I have not used the product yet, as I have not been delivered the coffee maker, I'm wondering how they will taste as the cups are old. Several of them are puffed up. I don't think they will be poison, but old coffee is not flavorful. Don't buy this product or maybe you're just into Russian roulette.<br />Just went from 2 stars to 1. I ordered the Bed Bath and Beyond 60 samples for $39.00, and while their selection was just OK, a 3.5 star rating. Its .66c a k-cup while this is .75c, BB&B's selections where fresher and there was some variety. OK I ordered more so the price was better but let me tell you the whole presentation was better, the product was better, fresher and I think it has this beat by 2.5 stars.

review/summary: I suspect I know why there is variability here...
review/text: So you order this thing and what you get is this weird paper bag stapled closed filled with K-Cups.<br /><br />I had always assumed this was some sort of "from the manufacturer" type of thing, but I suspect we have a vendor that buys large quantities of these things and hires people to mix them up and bag them and send them out.<br /><br />Obviously, that's going to result in some people getting what they asked for and some folks not.<br /><br />I got quite a few duplicates, and I also got quite a few of the same vendor... so lots of Green Mountain, for example.  I also got some teas, which I have zero interest in, and a spiced cider which is fine, but certainly not what I was looking for.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think this is a "bad idea", but I would say be prepared... random is random, and random as selected by an even more random employee (high school kid?), is even more so.

review/summary: Correct number of K-Cups, all unique, good range
review/text: This review is to address the concerns over reviewers encountered, which I did not:<br /><br />* I did get the correct amount of K-Cups (at the time of writing this review, the description states you'll get 35).<br />* All 35 K-Cups were unique, as described.<br />* There was a good variety of teas, coffees, and some interesting ones like apple cider/Kaluha/etc. that made this 35 pack a good purchase.<br /><br />The 35 K-Cups were packed in a brown paper Duro bag , exactly like I get from the Italian sandwich shop down the road when I pick up an order.  This makes this item an ugly gift for someone unless you were expecting to repack the K-Cups yourself prior to handing them over.<br /><br />The bag also provides no protection to the K-Cups, and one of them was crushed - although not sufficiently as to be unusable.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a good purchase.

So far not all "suit my taste" but I am glad to see the variety of what is being produced and anyway who in their right mind would honestly say no coffee is better than weak coffee (not anyone I've met in the military for dang sure).  Many are great!  The darker blends (is that the right word?) are my favorites so far, as well as the cappuccino mixes (I like a "fru-fru" cup every once in awhile).<br /><br />Great sampler pack!

Because my mix is nowhere near as interesting as the other reviewer's, I have a vision of a bunch of people sitting in a room, smoking, watching t.v., and just tossing random K-Cups into brown bags. I still get to try a variety of coffees, teas, hot chocolate (2), and cider, but something about the brown bag just turns me off.

There are also a number of sweetened items, so it's not a great choice for people who stick to low-calorie sweeteners. If you are willing to gamble with staleness, give it a try. Personally, I won't be purchasing again.

review/text: I did not read the reviews before ordering these K-Cups.  This was my first time ordering K-cups through Amazon (I normally do it from BBB).  I did not even think to read the reviews because how could they screw it up.  Boy was I wrong.  The packaging was my first clue that something was off.  It was in a brown paper bag, not a manufactures box.  Then when I opened it it was all of these strange flavors and very little straight up coffee.  I am so confused, I would think that the FDA would regulate coffee (I might be wrong here) and that this would not meet their standards.  I agree with someone else who said that it appears to be all the coffee and flavors that someone else did not want.  I may try to return but again not sure if that is possible because it is edible.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!

review/text: I consider this assortment to be very helpful and honestly described. None of my samples were duplicates. Someone mentioned some were "overfilled" and all I can think of on that comment is that coffee does outgas when it is freshly roasted so that makes the top of some of the cups puff up a bit. Not a problem at all. Some folks complained about the paper bag. I don't see the problem. Nice assortment and fun to experiment.

review/text: I received my order today after ordering it a little under a week ago. I was in need of an assortment of Kcups, as I just bought my first Keurig. So here I am, the incoming college freshman who is all too excited to journey off to school with this sampler, eager to go on a tastebud adventure with a sip from every cup brewed. Very very pleased with what I received (35 Kcups, all different).

review/summary: Amazingly fast shipping
review/text: I received these babies so fast that I'm wondering if my neighbor is the distributor. Seriously, 12 hours from 'one click' to doorstep-AMAZING. I was COMPLETELY out so the surprise was wonderful! It's been a while since I had to start my day without coffee. As for the packaging, as others had mentioned they arrive in a brown paper bag, which is inside of a padded box. This didn't bother me, but it's definitely not something you'd want to send as a gift. All the cups arrived in good condition. The variety was, well, a variety. It always makes me smile when I read someone claim that the k cups were "mostly bad ones" since what I would consider a bad flavor might be another's favorite. Example, my set arrived with a hazelnut coffee and a hazelnut cappuccino. I HATE hazelnut, but my mom loves it, so those are earmarked for her. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. I could have been just as happy if they included less tea, but that's me. A quick breakdown:<br />3 Flavored Cappuccino<br />2 Hot Cocoa<br />8 Flavored Coffee<br />5 Mild Coffee<br />5 Bold/Extra Bold Coffee<br />2 Decaff Coffee<br />1 Half Caff<br />3 Flavored Tea<br />6 Green/Black/Breakfast Teas<br />For the price I paid, twenty, I would order again. Also, I like the idea that next time, I might get something totally different. These are "fun cups" for us as we usually drink only Caribou or Donut Shop in the morning. BTW- I did not get either one of these in my set. Great for me, because I buy huge boxes of each, but too bad that a newcomer wouldn't have them to try because they are pretty popular brands. Bottom line- I'd recommend this set for the adventurous, but not for those who are trying to identify that perfect 'traditional' or mild morning coffee.

Thank you guys for that.<br /><br />Great mix in here, but you really have to like tea and flavored coffee to get your money's worth.  Luckily for me, my wife likes the teas and flavored coffee.  I got it for the various roasts/blends of the plain stuff.  It's about a 50/50 split between the regular and "fancy" coffee, I've gone through most of my half so far, and from that list, I added a couple new coffees to my cart here.  Nice and cheap way to try out some of the other brands.<br />I won't give my personal opinions on the coffee included in this list, since my personal tastes wouldn't really mean much to others anyway.<br /><br />My bottom line on this is easy.  Buy it.  But I'd also recommend putting it in your cart and watch the price on it, it varied by a couple of $'s in the 2 weeks I had it in my cart.

I couldnt be happier. 35 different flavors as promised. One limited edition flavor, Coconut coffee or something. Hot cocoa ect ect. Didnt bother checking all the exp dates. the ones I did look at were fine. This is great for someone like me. Who is new to one of these and has no idea what coffee to buy. However Im so happy with it I may just keep buying these.

review/summary: Mmmm, these were great!
review/text: I'm really glad we got the big variety sampler because it gave us a chance to try many flavors. And they were delivered by Amazon, right to our house, so that made it really easy. Especially since you can't find that much interesting to choose from at the store. I wouldn't say I disliked any of them. Some I loved or liked better than others but they were all pretty good and it was fun to have the choice options. I would go with buying the sampler again, just because I have had so much fun sampling them so far. The blueberry...sounds weird, but it's not too bad. I love all the donought and cinnamon roll flavored ones. Mmmmm.

review/text: I saw mixed reviews on a variety of K-cup sampler packs.  I was attracted to this one because it guaranteed 35 different K-cups.  I got my order a day early and guess what - I did in fact receive 35 different K-cups - I even received a Apple Cider and a few Hot Chocolates.  I would order this again.

review/summary: K-cup Sampler
review/text: So I was hesitant to order this because of quite a few negative reviews, but I decided to anyway, and I'm glad I did!<br />I searched through quite a few sampler packs before deciding on this one. Anybody who owns a Keurig knows that there are so many varieties of flavors out there, a sampler is really the only way to find one you know you will love.<br />It came inside a brown paper bag inside the box, and inside the bag was 35 cups as promised. No duplicates at all which I was very happy about. 7 Decaf coffees, 3 Teas (Celestial Seasoning), 1 Hot Chocolate, and the rest were all flavors of coffee. Most were Green Mountain (which I have found makes damn good coffee) with a few Doughnut House, and a couple different brands (Gloria Jean, Black Tiger, and Jet Fuel) which I think will be interesting to try. Everything from Glazed Doughnut, to Extra Dark, to Mudslide in this assortment. Probably the best one I have seen yet, will def be getting it again since I love variety.

review/summary: Loving the selection that I have now!
review/text: I originally purchased a Keurig because of the all the varieties of coffee made for them...what I didn't realize was how few real "variety packs" there are out there. I found the Sampler Pack from The Coffee Mix and purchased it so that I would have a variety for the machine, especially for when I had company over. I am already on my second purchase of the 35 cup sampler and have thoroughly enjoyed trying new flavors. You get exactly what they say too...out of each 35 cup purchase I had absolutely no duplicates. Out of the 70...I probably still only had about 5-8 duplicates between the 2 orders. I will certainly be ordering again! I may get a larger pack though :)

Please, whatever you do, don't get this particular package, because you will be horribly disappointed, unless you want the K-cups no one else would want or drink!! Yes, they are all different, but out of the 35 there I will only be drinking maybe 10 of them, the rest I will try to give away although I doubt anyone will want them!! Alot are decaf, which I don't drink, or they are tea or hot chocolate. I was hoping for actual flavored coffee, now I know to only order my K-cups from Keurig or I will buy them at the store!! I am sadly disappointed in this assortment of K-cups, and the person that packed my bag really did a HORRIBLE job!! Oh, and 4 of them are either empty, or the coffee in them is hard and stale!!

review/summary: Good selection of coffee
review/text: This was a fun assortment of coffees. If you're looking for an assortment of all the different things you can have in a keurig you're going to be disappointed. There were two ciders, two hot cocoas and one tea. The rest were coffees, both flavored and not. I liked the ability to try all sorts of coffee and was suprised at what I ended up liking best. Now I can go out and spend money on one brand, knowing what I liked best. On the con side, there were only 34 k-cups and two of them were stale, so when you put them in barely anything came out and then it clogged the keuirg. But overall it was a good buy. It did come in a brown paper bag, but that didnt bother me either.

review/text: I received 34 sample k-cups (only 1 less than advertised), 3 of those received were solid lumps that would not brew (all of those were from Grove Square), none were duplicates (yippee! since I wanted a sampling).  That said, this accomplished what I was looking for which was an idea of what variety is available in K-cups, and what I want to order more of.  I will stick with my favorite which is Coffee People's "Jet Fuel" (of which I received 1 in this order) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XLH4Y">Coffee People Jet Fuel Dark Roast K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>. And I will never order anything from Grove Square which uses "instant coffee" and apparently inferior packaging.  I wouldn't order this again, but... I don't need to.  Not sure I'd recommend it to a friend either.

review/text: I just bought a K-cup brewer and wanted a variety of K-cups since my family doesn't just have coffee drinkers.  There were regular & decaf coffees, flavored coffees and plain, hot chocolate (milk & dark), teas and 2 ciders.<br />I wouldn't have tried the teas otherwise because I'm a sort of tea snob but I really enjoyed the quickness and flavor of the teas.  I drank the "for iced tea" one hot and it was mild and delicious--I can't wait to buy a full box to brew iced tea.  The coffee drinkers enjoyed the variety too.

review/text: I am new to single-cup brewing, and wanted to try a variety of coffee and tea flavors. I received a mix that had a lot of variety in it, and only a couple of duplicates. With so many choices, I found the non-coffee drinkers of the family crowded around the little carousel I stacked them on, planning their next "cuppa". My son said the sweet ice tea flavor brewed over ice was very good, and I have been having fun trying out the different coffees. I was surprised to figure out I'm not a "bold" coffee person. I thought I would be, because I love coffee-chain-store espresso, but indeed the medium and light roasts are making me a happy girl. Having this variety pack allowed me to explore my preferences. I will definately buy this variety pack again.

After about two days the old boy had some real pep in his step.  He does a good cat run around for no reason thing, again.  As a kitten he did that often but this seems to have invigorated him.  In addition his skin has cleared by the tail so if your cat will eat it, and mine eats almost anything then it is a great product. We give it too him with his food or sometimes he will eat it alone in a dish.

review/summary: my dog loves them, so do i
review/text: i've been getting these  throughout my dog's life, which now is 7 years.  He loves them.  I have used them as a treat-reward for good behavior, such as  coming when he's called, or stopping barking.  I keep tins of them around the house for easy access. I like that they are small, i sometimes break them in  half when using them as a treat. What i like is that  they smell good, my dog loves them and they don't pose a weight gain problem. I can use them often without making my dog fat and unhealthy.  I used to get them at local pet stores like Centinela Pet and Feed. and PetCo.  When they stopped carrying them in the larger quantities, i was disappointed and happy to find them on Amazon. I don't like buying them in the large cellophane bags, it doesn't keep them fresh. i like the small tins and buy them like this, 12 at a time, it lasts a long time, a few months.  The seller i got it from this time, A World of Pups, was very fast with shipping and delivery, 3 days.

review/summary: tastes better than Manischewitz brand to me
review/text: This is the brand that I can get at my local grocery store certain times of year. It is pretty light and fluffy and tastes better than the Manischewitz matzo ball mix. Also, this mix only requires one egg, while Manischewitz requires two but this mix makes the same amount of matzo balls. Sometimes a girl just doesn't have an egg to spare. Elaine knows what I mean.

Since the floral component of this Multi-Spice is quite small (floral powders easily overwhelming other flavours if overused), I ended up with quite a bit left over for use in my perfume-making hobby or in sachets, etc.<br /><br />I found this to be a high-grade powdered lavender, the floral 'nose' being greater than the (wholly expected and natural) bitterness of it.

review/summary: YUMMY but PRICEY
review/text: The BEST gluten free 4 inch sugar cookies on Earth but the $1.99 EACH cookie PLUS shipping is outrageous until the company lowers it for bulk orders.  I LOVE this brand/bakery food and this is the most delicious sugar cookie thats gluten free that our family has had in a LONG time as its so hard to find quality gluten free appetizing foods.  This is as soft as a slice of cake and so delicious it's impossible to bear that taste !<br /><br />Cookie is also very pretty with the pink frosting and rainbow sprinkles;  attractive 100 %.<br /><br />Nutritional facts are as follows :  Serving size 71 grams,  calories 300,  total fat 14 grams, saturated fat 14 grams, ZERO trans fats,  cholesterol 25 mg,  sodium 190 mg,  total carbs 43 grams, fiber 1 grams, sugars 23 grams and protein 3 grams.  ( There is 4 % calcium and 2 % iron per serving )  Serving is a huge 4 inch frosted sprinkled sugar cookie which is soft and tasty.  Carbs and sugars are so high its not for diabetics in the family but does help the gluten people here.  YUMMY.<br />I love these and cannot wait for the price to decrease to buy this again.  5 stars on the product and 1 star on the unjustly cost currently for both individual cookies and the shipping.

review/summary: Great tasting, satisfying but loaded w/calories
review/text: This is a amazing cookie. Eating Gluten Free has caused a evaluation of many favorite treats. Discovering this cookie has provided a great treat that is very satisfying and enjoyable. These cookies taste every bit as good as Grandmas or any of the other popular pink cookies. They are pretty large, very tasty and we love them. One cookie in the package weighs 5.7oz, they are pretty large.<br /><br />While they are Gluten Free, they are not fat and calorie free. Here are the notes from the info label:<br />Servings per container: 2; Calories: 300; Calories from Fat: 120<br />Total Fat: 14g; Saturated Fat 7g; Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol: 25mg<br />Sodium: 190mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 43g; Dietary Fiber 1g; Sugars 23g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />At 600 calories per cookie you can see why they taste so good, so we eat them only as occasional treats in moderation. We buy a box full, or at least several at a time since they are so popular with the family. Everyone loves them, this is a treat both Gluten Free and non Gluten Free eaters will enjoy. Trust me, these will get eaten quickly!<br /><br />These are available locally along the Wasatch Front in Utah. If you live there you can try any of the New Grains products much easier. We've seen them in Maceys and Harmons too now. We look forward to occasional trips to Utah where we stock up on New Grains products.<br /><br />5 stars for a wonderful Gluten Free cookie treat

The great thing is these are so much better for her digestion then pigs ears and lots of other treats we tried. The bad thing is she goes through one in about 30 seconds (and they aren't cheap). She gets on or maybe two a day but after 16 years of loyalty it's worth paying a little more for something she loves and something that is good for her.

review/text: My 9 1/2 month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was 7 months.  I have tasted it, and it's delicious.  It's convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack.  The ingredients are mangoes and &lt;1% Organic Lemon Juice.  The consistency is nice and thick (like that of apple butter) so it isn't dripping off the spoon.  Also if you feel confident enough, you or your child can squeeze it right in his/her mouth.  Ella's products are expensive, but I think their products are worth it, and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo.  Love all the fruits--pears, apples and these mangoes.  This also provides 40% of Vitamin C.

review/summary: BEST SUGAR COOKIES WE'VE EATEN!
review/text: I bought these and another brand and although the others are good, these are much better. The flavor is terrific, the cookies must contain real butter to taste this good. We will be buying more.

review/text: Best brownies I've ever eaten.  Seriously.  They have a grainy texture that I love, but are still extremely moist and chewy.  The mix requires you to add butter, two eggs and a little water, but you do not need an electric mixer and it is simple to stir everything together with a wooden spoon.  The directions say to melt the butter before adding it to the mix, and since you must also grease the pan, I follow this little trick to make life easier: I melt the butter in the microwave inside the glass pan that I am going to bake the brownies in.  After it is melted, I tip the pan from side to side to coat the bottom and sides, then I pour the melted butter into the bowl I am using to mix everything together.  After mixing I pour the batter back into the buttered glass pan.  This way I don't need to use cooking spray to coat the pan, nor do I need to dirty a separate bowl to melt the butter, plus the brownies taste better when the pan is buttered instead of coated with Pam.  A win-win!<br /><br />Another thing I have done is bake half the mix to make a smaller batch of brownies and save the rest for another time.  This is easy to do because of the amount of eggs and butter called for (two eggs means you can half it and use one egg; 1/2 cup butter goes to 1/4 cup).<br /><br />Note that the brownie mix has chunks of chocolate in it--and very good chocolate at that.  I wasn't sure if I would like this but it is fabulous.  Trust me--you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />PS - their pancake/waffle mix is great, too, and for that you only add water.  It is so easy and so much better than Bisquick, Krusteaz, etc.  Very wholesome tasting because of the wheat.

review/summary: expensive box of brownie mix.
review/text: $17.00 for one box of brownie mix seems a bit pricey. The grocery stores sell it for $6.00 Pity the poor fool who buys this box. It must be the tasty box of brownie mix ever.
