review/summary: Weak, as usual for this brand
review/text: I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand.  When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!<br /><br />Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: SOY??? WHY?
review/text: Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...

review/summary: Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!
review/text: First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)

But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as "Acai Tea" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product.

review/text: Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.

review/text: I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.  I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day. Lemon and ginger combination is perfect to satisfy the need for sweet with a little bite at the end with the ginger. It has also helped me stop drinking caffeine drinks which lets me now sleep at night.  I will continue to buy this and recommend it highly.

review/summary: Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea
review/text: Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.

review/summary: Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).

review/summary: Subtle, Mild Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/text: Stash is a very good quality, full-bodied tea and I am a big-time tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea since probably before Superman was born.  I like to keep a bunch of different flavoured teas around, especially some fruity flavours.  I call them dessert teas because I usually don't eat dessert, but I like to have a fruit tea after dinner.  Stash tea bags are usually, if not always, individually sealed in a foil-type packet, so the flavour stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />The acai berry flavor is delicious!  It has a nice natural sweetness and a very fruity taste.  It is very smooth and is a caffeine free herbal tea.  The 100% natural ingredients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, acai flavor, acai fruit powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.

My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better.

review/summary: My favorite Tea!!! No other Raspberry compares!!!!
review/text: My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping. At my local store I can get this tea for $0.15 per bag but on here it works out to $0.11 per bag, which would save me $9.60 on that amount of bags.

review/summary: Best unsung home remedy
review/text: I never liked the flavor of this tea initially, and had a box sitting in the back of my cupboard for over a year, until I discovered its use as a home remedy.  It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.  As such, I've found it to be a great reliever for coughs, cold or allergy symptoms such as congestion and sneezing, and even painful periods. Today I swear by this stuff and always have to have a box around for sickness. I've thrown away all my cold medicines and cough syrups, the natural herbs in this tea are better for you and almost as effective without the side effects of drowsiness or confusion. Not a doctor, just a happy customer.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Sweet and Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Yum for Yumberry!
review/text: I don't think I ever heard of "yumberry" flavor before, but it is yummy!  As I have said before, I am a big time tea drinker and Stash makes excellent teas.<br /><br />This one has a smooth, fruity, berry taste and is sweet and delicious.  It would be great served alone, after dinner, or with a piece of good quality cheesecake.  Although I am drinking it warm, it would likely taste great as an ice tea, too.<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, I suggest natural brown sugar, honey, or agave cactus juice (natural food isle in supermarket).  For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.  It is a 100 % natural, herbal, caffeine free product.

review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/summary: The best tasting hibiscus tea!
review/text: My local grocery store didn't carry it anymore and due to the large amounts of coffee I drink, I like to detox from time to time using this tea. The hibiscus is great for your kidneys.<br />The flavor is great hot or cold. If you are wondering what this tastes like, if you have tried Starbucks' "Berry Berry Hibiscus" drink and liked it then you will like this also as the flavor is quite similar. The price is very reasonable, it cost the same as the grocery store including shipping.<br /><br />Definitely will continue to purchase here @ Amazon!

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it.

I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

review/summary: Citrus flavor put me off.  Not thrilled about this product.
review/text: I really like Splenda and use it nearly every day.  So I was excited to try Spenda Essentials with Antioxidants.<br /><br />I tried the product in coffee, in cereal and straight out of the foil-lined packet.  This product has a pronounced citrus flavor that I am not exactly loving.  Don't get me wrong, I do like citrus.  But I'm not really looking for a citrus flavor in a product that I might use to sweeten things that don't necessarily benefit from a citrus taste.<br /><br />This product is certainly not objectionable.  I couldn't really taste the citrus in my coffee but I could taste it in my breakfast cereal.  I also noted more of a citrusy (is that a word?) aftertaste that seemed to linger.<br /><br />Spenda with Antioxidants doesn't seem as sweet to my tastebuds as "normal" Splenda.  Typically I use 3 Splendas in my morning coffee.  Today, I used 3 packets of Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants and the coffee didn't seem as sweet as usual.  I added a 4th packet and it still didn't seem as sweet.<br /><br />As of this writing, this product is a fair bit more expensive then regular Splenda.  I am not thrilled with the flavor, not crazy about the price, and I'd rather just take vitamins on my own.<br /><br />My gut feeling is that this won't be an especially successful product for Splenda.  Maybe I'm wrong.  By all means, feel free to try it, as maybe your opinion will differ from mine.  While I don't necessarily dislike Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants, I wouldn't personally buy it.  I don't hate it, but it's not recommended.

review/summary: It's good, but...
review/text: I picked up a pack of this at my local Kroger, as the store seemed to be removing it from their shelves for one reason or another. (From the pile of boxes, it looked as if it just wasn't selling all that well.) Since it was only slightly cheaper than the regular Splenda boxes, I figured why not? Let's give this a try.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I like this well enough that I might get another box if there are any left when I go back for refills. I was surprised to see that others complained of a citrus taste, as I didn't really get that in my drink. However, I generally only drink Splenda in my coffee or tea, so the taste might've been overwhelmed by how strong I generally like to brew my drinks.<br /><br />Now here comes my kicker: I didn't see a huge difference when it came to antioxidant benefits. I know that many times you can't see a huge difference or there won't be a visible difference for months and months, but I just didn't see anything. When you figure how expensive the original price for this was (the original price was about $1-2 more than the regular box of Splenda on the shelves of my Kroger), I just can't warrant other people paying this much for something where there's not a big difference in your daily life. My only other gripe was that the packets were a little bit of a pain to open. Nothing major, just that I had a harder time shaking the packets to where the product settled in one corner. (You know, so it won't spill out everywhere.) This wouldn't deter me from continuing to use what I bought or even lower the star rating, but it is slightly irritating.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you can get these on sale for cheaper than or around the same price as your regular sweetener, go for it. There's not really any taste difference that I can discern and I like it. However, it's just not good enough to where I'd say it's worth the extra dollars on the price tag. Considering that the only big draw to this product would be the antioxidants, save that extra money and buy a bottle of deluxe vitamins. If you're really worried about getting in the extra nutrients in a tasty format, it'd be easier (and yummier) to get some gummy vitamins or something.

review/summary: The paper is too thick
review/text: I use splenda a lot,but these packets have a thick, hard to tear paper. They make the product seem more substantial, but  when you rip it open Splenda spills everywhere.

review/summary: It's Splenda with vitamins E and C
review/text: It looks like Splenda and tastes like Splenda.  It sweetens just like the regular packets.  However, they have added a small does of vitamins C and E to each packet. Unlike the packets with the vitamin B added, this one doesn't have a distinctive oder.  I have been using it my coffee and honestly wonder what the heat of my beverage is doing to the vitamins.  Also, there are so many products out there that give you a daily does of vitamin C, do we really need it added to our artificial sweetener? I'm using what I have but won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: This product is like regular Splenda, but there is also an odd aftertaste that I couldn't quite place. I would much rather just purchase regular splenda and eat foods rich in antioxidants.

review/summary: Two different takes
review/text: My mother is a diabetic, so she uses Splenda all the time. I myself don't use Splenda that often by myself, but when Mom comes over and we make a batch of iced tea, I'll find myself drinking it. Between the two of us, we came up with two totally different opinions of this new Splenda with Antioxidants.<br /><br />I hardly noticed a difference from the regular Splenda. Except for it taking a little more stirring to desolve, I found it almost identical. That in and of itself is not a bad thing, but if you compare the prices - currently $17 for 320 packs of this and $19 for 700 packs of regular Splenda - I have a hard time justifying buying this rather than sticking to regular Splenda and using the money you saved to buy a supplement. I guess if you would forget to take the supplement, this could be a good compromise.<br /><br />Mom, however, hated the stuff. She could not get it to dissolve in her (cold) iced tea, and in fact most of the Splenda stayed on top of the ice rather than falling to the bottom. She also noticed a slight difference in taste. Finally, she had issues with the packages, which are actually foiled on the inside, which make them harder to open than the regular packs. Anyone with arthritic or particularly thick fingers may have issues here.<br /><br />All in all, while not a BAD product, I can't really recommend this to anyone. No matter how you slice it, there's a better option out there.

review/summary: Choose an all-natural sweetener like Stevia instead
review/text: The SPLENDA� ESSENTIALS(tm) No Calorie Sweetener Products have the same taste as the regular SPLENDA� No Calorie Sweetener, so if you're a big Splenda user, you'll find that these will work well in your coffee, and anywhere else you might substitute sugar. Although they state that when cooking, you should expect to see some losses in the potency of the vitamins in the product with the heat exposure involved in cooking and baking, which makes sense.<br /><br />I like the idea of adding antioxidants to a widely used product, but you would think most people are getting their Vitamins C and E from a multi-vitamin, so I do wonder if this product is really necessary.<br /><br />I've been reading a lot about No Calorie Sweeteners lately and I used to use Splenda by the boatload, but I've learned that artificial sweeteners may put us in even greater metabolic danger than sugar or High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you're looking for a natural alternative, Stevia offers a safe, all-natural, alternative to these artificial sweeteners and Stevia is much sweeter than sugar and has none of sugar's unhealthy drawbacks.

review/summary: Tastes like splenda
review/text: If you're familiar with Splenda and like the taste, you'll like the taste of this.  I don't notice a taste difference.  Why did Splenda feel the need to add vitamins to their sweetener?  Great question.  Do the vitamins actually survive being in my hot coffee?  Another question.<br /><br />My only gripe - and it's a very small one - is that the packets feel weird.  Instead of being a lot of paper and air with a little bit of sweetener, the packets are packed full to the brim.  Maybe the vitamins require a vacuum in there, or maybe it's just a way for them to fit more boxes into a smaller space... but it interferes with my ritual of flicking the packets to make sure all the sweetener is at the bottom before ripping the tops off.  (And, since I can't do that, there's almost always a small mess from powder on the counter after I make my coffee.)

review/summary: Good, Not Great
review/text: I usually use Sweet 'N Low but decided to try out this type of Splenda due to its nutritional benefit claims. I use sweetener in unsweet iced tea and had to use two packets in order to get the sweetness I desire.  I have a sweet tooth, but I generally use only one Sweet 'N Low packet.<br /><br />On the bright side, the packets are the nicest I've seen because of their foil lining.  They're a bit stiff, and offer a lot of reinforcement.<br /><br />Though I'm a bit curious over exactly how many antioxidants can be put in a packet, this Splenda has a good taste and does its job nicely.  A bit pricey and not quite as sweet for my liking, but if good packaging and potential health benefits are your thing, go for it.

review/summary: Just like regular Splenda, but more pricey
review/text: At over $4 for an 80 ct box, this artificial sweetener is excessively priced when compared to other brands.  Yes, it tastes perfectly fine in coffee and you can use it to add a bit of sweetness when cooking certain recipes without adding calories or leaving an aftertaste.  But I don't know if I really need to spend this sort of money to get additional antioxidants in my beverages.  And what are these antioxidants? Vitamin C and Vitamin E, at allegedly 20% the recommended dose per pack.  Two packs per cup equals 40% of your recommended vitamin C for the day.  Sounds great, huh?  Except I would have to consume 5 packs per day to get 100% the recommended dose of both vitamins, and a box of 80 packs would last 16 days.  Or, I can spend $8 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F1B4N0">Nature Made Multi-Complete with D3, Iron & Calcium, Liquid Softgels, 60-Count</a> and get 100% of all my vitamins for 60 days.  So there is no real value to the whole "essentials" ploy.  It won't hurt you to use this product (unless you are using 20 packs a day or more and you might be at risk of Vitamin C poisoning.)  But there is no point in paying more for the vitamins.
