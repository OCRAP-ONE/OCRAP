review/summary: So Thrilled this exists!
review/text: This is a great product. I already have a diet high in nuts and seeds (Almonds, walnuts, Brazil, Chia), but nothing beats the taste of Peanuts. I don't like adding the extra calories from peanuts, so this is perfect for me.  I add this to smoothies all the time and it tastes great. I also use it as a late night snack on apples or celery. My only gripe is that I wish they made a sugar-free version.

review/text: I purchased some powdered peanut butter in the grocery store and it was so expensive. I had read an article in a magazine recommending the PB2, so thought I would give it a try. It was so much cheaper to purchase the 16oz bag and it tastes great. It makes a great sandwich and I even put some of the peanut butter powder in my frosting to make a great peanut butter frosting. You don't miss all the fat from the regular peanut butter as it has a great taste still.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I have tried all the strange alternatives out there with a sincere, want to love this enthusiasm.  My addiction to peanut butter is finally fulfilled.  I can mix it, cook with it, put it in shakes, sprinkle it over ice cream - ANYTHING.  I absolutely love this product and will continue to be a faithful customer.<br /><br />The fat/calorie content is negligible compared to jar PB but the taste doesn't show.  Contrary to another post I think this actually does taste like the natural brand jar PB's although you do have to play with the water ratio but that's whats great, I can dilute just a bit more and then make a creamy peanut sauce.  I hands down recommend this if you are a true PB lover but hate the calories and high fat.

review/summary: Pretty darn close!
review/text: The taste and creaminess is slightly different from the real thing.. I mix it with about twice as much water as the jar calls for. I like it best on crackers, smoothies or other recipes so it certainly fits the bill in my opinion. My 2 yr old is none the wiser so for that reason alone I'd continue buying it. One of the negative reviews sited an 'aftertaste' as a reason it's bad, but all PB's have that. Drink some water if that bothers you.;) All in all bell plantation knocked it out of the park compared to other PB substitutes. LOVE the fact that I don't have to trade hours at the gym for getting my PB fix anymore!!

review/summary: Yumm. Who would give it one star is a (insert your own)
review/text: This is fantastic just as their chocolate powder. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon,a big one) with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. I am really glad I came across of it looking for a fat free calorie free, low calorie search. It tastes spot on like peanut butter. I used it first with Yonanas mixer (and chocolate one too) and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes) One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again. Actually I just had a thought, I think I will put it in recycled Yankee candle jar. That would work.

review/text: I've found that this product is fantastic in smoothies and in banana whip (frozen banana in food processor, add chocolate powder, etc)as long as you add about 2 tbsp. Any less and it doesn't have too much flavor. I think for the calorie/fat content, it's a great product to give foods a peanutty flavor when you don't want to weigh yourself down. I haven't tried it as a paste or peanut butter replacement, but I'm satisfied with my creations so far.

review/text: This product is NOT peanut butter.<br /><br />It's powdered peanut butter. And that's why it's so great!<br /><br />If you're looking for a lower fat, diet/calorie friendly option to spreadable, creamy, delightful peanut butter that's not chemically altered or filled with weird ingredients... you've arrived! Simply mix this stuff with water and you've got a spreadable substitute!<br />This product really shines in a myriad of ingredients-- frostings become fantastically peanut buttery without heaviness or an additional caloric load. Smoothies become creamy shakes. Make peanut butter cookies with this as your flour and your mind will be blown with peanut butter presence.<br />The aroma and the hint of peanut butter flavor are the stars in PB2. Eating them side by side is like drinking half and half, and then expecting 2% to taste the same. If this type of comparison is hard for you to notice, then you'll love PB2!<br /><br />But remember, it's NOT peanut butter. Don't go expecting it to have the mouth-feel of full fat, smooth ground peanuts. Just relish the fact that this product exists, and use it where it really shines.<br /><br />P.S. You're always a Google search away from a PB2 recipe.

review/text: I read about this product in the Nutrition Action newsletter. I became very curious and looked for it in several local stores.  When I couldn't find it, I was very pleased to see it available through Amazon Prime.  I love love love peanut butter.  But, I can't eat too much because of all the fat.  This product was a joy to find.  It tastes very good.  And, it was fun to discover that I could create exactly the texture that I preferred - just add a little more or little less water.  I can use the peanut butter exactly the "normal" way: on sandwiches, a dip for apples, in sauces and soups; it works great. Hurrah!  All the taste and healthy protein; less fat!

review/text: I got this PB2, from a recommendation of many friends.  I was very skeptical because after all, its a powder!  But when I put a spoonful of this in my protein shakes, or sprinkle some on a sunday, it is delish!  Plus when one serving of "regular" ice cream is only 1 tablespoon, you get FOUR servings of PB2 for the same calories!  It is yummy and my children love it.  And since I care what they put in their bodies, I don't mind as much when they snack on PB2 and crackers or PB2 and jelly sandwiches, etc, because this is so much healthier (85% less fat!) than regular fat-filled peanut butter.  I am never going back to the other stuff.

I don't think I could ever go back to regular PB again. This packaging is a little awkward, once I cut it open, I put it in a plastic container to stay fresh. There is no resealing the package.

I couldn't decide whether I liked it or hated it.  But over time, I have grown to love this stuff.  I am on a high protein/low carb diet and normally peanut butter would be out of the question due to its high fat and calorie content.  That's what makes this stuff so great.  Sure its not as good as peanut butter but when is a low calorie version ever better than the original?  It's a great snack and takes away my cravings instantly.  I can eat it anytime of the day without feeling guilty.  I try to keep it between 1 and 2 servings which is just 45-90 calories.  The additional protein it gives me is a bonus.  I just ordered 3 more.

review/text: I absolutely love PB2! Most of the time I just put some in a baggie and take it to work. During a break, I will pour a little water into the baggie and mix it by squeezing the bag a few times. That way I don't have to carry a spoon to work or wash a bowl when I get home. I dip a banana into the mixed up PB2 and have an awesome snack!<br /><br />  Another way that I like to eat it is mixed up in some plain Greek yogurt. I mix a spoonful of PB2 and a spoonful of sugar-free jelly into a 5.3 oz Oikos Greek yogurt container. It is delicious just like this or spread on some toasted thin buns. Mmmmm....mmmmmm!<br /><br />  The only downside is that I don't like it by itself. It has to be on a banana or an apple or be mixed with something.

When mixed with water to reconstitute the amount of peanut butter seemed okay. Product tasted very fresh. This is an excellent product if you like peanut butter but worry about fats and oils. Most are removed. I recommend the product. It has multiple uses. Can mix with honey, use as a topping and of course make peanut butter cookies. That last one is my favorite. PB cookies are my weakness.

review/summary: Amazing for peanut butter lovers who watch their calories
review/text: So, I am a peanut butter fiend - I admit it!  However, I am very health conscious, and I realize I can't eat peanut butter all day and stay thin. However, you really could eat PB2 all day and still successfully watch your weight.  This stuff is remarkably good, and I've tried just about everything out there in terms of lower calorie peanut butter substitutes.  I absolutely crave this stuff - So, if you love your PB&J but don't want to trade in for a larger pair of pants, then PB2 is the way to go.  It really does taste great.  When it comes in these 16 oz. bags like this, they're a bit messy. Powder seems to get everywhere.  I usually pour them into a large zip-lock bag (but a canister would be even better) to scoop out what I want, when I want it. Just a little tip there.

Second, If you simply like peanut butter cups but don't eat them because of the calories, the fat or the sugar ... welcome to a new way of enjoying your candy ... smoothies with PB2 and chocolate.  Try it. Just ... TRY IT! You will not be sorry.

review/text: I was skeptical going in- two tablespoons for 45 calories while regular peanut butter was 180? Yeah, right.<br /><br />So it may be a bit spendy and you DO have to mix it yourself. Small price to pay! Tastes even better than regular peanut butter and I can eat it daily, getting the nutrients of peanuts without the fat and extra calories!!<br /><br />A month later, and I'm almost done with the bag. I'll DEFINITELY be purchasing again.

Now I purchased it for myself. All the fattening stuff gone. My sister lost over 100 lbs. eating right. PB2 is one of the tools. Nuff said!

review/summary: Not bad...
review/text: I am a passionate peanut butter lover, but as peanut butter is so high in calories, PB2 appealed to me. I actually haven't tried mixing it with water as per the directions, but I don't think I would enjoy it on its own or on toast, just as it isn't sweet enough (sorry, I need that bit of added sugar!). HOWEVER, I'm big on adding peanut butter to cottage cheese, and 2 tbsp of this PB2 powder to 1/2 cup cottage cheese is lovely! It's also quite nice mixed in with vanilla frozen yogurt (1 tbsp to 1/2 cup). I'd probably purchase again just for those uses alone, saving me 150 calories!

Then I go to town with my stick blender (if you don't have a good one, you don't know what you are missing).

review/summary: Great Considering the Calories
review/text: This was my first experience with powdered peanut butter (didn't know such a thing existed until I found PB2 while browsing the best sellers in Grocery & Gourmet Food).  I think that while it is not quite the same as normal name brand peanut butter, but when you compare it to Skippy or Planter's brands - the two I had in my house to compare it to - this peanut butter has 75% fewer calories.  There is no way that I would rate this as being 75% less satisfying, so if your goal is to find a substitute for peanut butter that is better in terms of overall calories, this is the way to go.  It might take some experimenting to get it to a consistency you like.  The recommended 2 tbsp powder to 2 tbsp water was a bit thick for me.  Finally, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses peanut butter as an ingredient, as opposed to just eating something with peanut butter on it.  The powder dissolves much more easily than you can get actual peanut butter to mix into a sauce.  I particularly have enjoyed it in milk shakes.

I took a chance and bought the chocolate PB2 and regular PB2, best to buy both 1-1b bags. LOVE THIS STUFF. Its great in a smoothie, i dont like it by itself. You can mix it with water but i end up wanting to put something else in there to make it taste better. I have used it in cookie recipes for the peanut butter flavor and love it in smoothies. I will be planning to buy more this summer, since I will be having more smoothies.

The PB2 website has hundreds of recipes to use this with.

review/text: I don't mind eating regular peanut butter because if I eat peanuts I expect to get the natural oil that comes with it.  I can get organic PB that only has sugar added and the oil is the same.  However, I love this powder! I am supplementing snacks in my diet for protein shakes and I have vanilla protein powder (it can be mixed with a variety of other flavors). But when I drink plain vanilla protein it's kinda bleh, so I add the PB2 chocolate and it's a Vanilla PB Chocolate dessert!!  I think it is great for those who are really strict with their diet and uses protein powder or smoothies and such.

review/summary: Will never have to give up my PBJ Smoothies on HCG Diet!!! Yayz!!!
review/text: I started the HCG diet and realized that I had to give up my beloved PBJ smoothies until I stumbled across this amazing product. When you mix as directed, it's a bit different than traditional peanut butter. It tastes more like the natural pb without sugar, which I prefer anyway. I mix in with a little less water for a more dense texture. When I blended with fresh strawberries, ice, a touch of fat free milk and stevia I found that this made the most delish lowfat/sugar PBJ smoothie ever! The regular version is usually a whopping 600-800 calories! This version with PB2 is merely 120 calories! Can't beat that! Amazon has the best price on the stuff too! THANKS! :-)

review/text: This product arrived in good time and was as advertised.  I enjoy PB2.  It's a great alternative when on a low fat diet.  I like to spread it on celery for my afternoon snack.  Sometimes I mix it with fat free yogurt and use it as a dip for apples.  The chocolate PB2 is good too.  It has a little sweetness to it.

review/summary: UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter
review/text: Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the "Better-n-Peanut Butter" brand sold here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of "better n peanut butter" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( "Better n Peanut Butter" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this.

review/text: I had heard about this product in a class I had attended and found it at one local grocery store.  I checked Amazon and found the 1 lb bag at a much better price than the grocery store jar.  We use it when we travel and at home.  You honestly cannot tell the difference in it and a jar of processed peanut butter. You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.  I just ordered my second bag of PB2!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>

review/summary: Wow!  Glad I ordered the pound bag
review/text: As much as I love all things peanut, the grand goober is taboo while I'm counting calories.  Looking for peanut flavoring or extract, I was shocked to find PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, a product I'd never imagined.  Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.  Low calorie, low fat, scrumptious and versatile -- what a concept.

review/summary: Amazing Little Powder
review/text: I purchased PB2 after finding a recipe for a Butterfinger Smoothie.  I had heard about the smoothie from a friend who is a personal trainer.  I made the recipe immediately when I received the PB2 powder.  It was wonderful!  It really tasted like a Butterfinger.  For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

The taste and texture is just like peanut butter--I could kiss whoever came up with this, LOL.<br /><br />I don't like to waste food, so I have been mixing it with my Walden Farms' spread, which makes it that much less calorie, and it actually tastes good mixed together. Although I like the mixture of the two, PB2 is good enough and low cal enough on its own that I would recommend it to any peanut butter lover that wants to watch their caloric intake (like me!). I will definitely be purchasing it again.

review/text: I bought both the regular and chocolate versions.  I was expecting it to be barely tolerable and I would use it only in baking. Boy, was I wrong.  I mixed each with water and it tasted amazing.  I added a half a pack of Equal to the 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and it was even better.<br /><br />I had given up peanut butter because it was just too many Weight Watchers points and now I can have it again.  This is just about perfect and I was a total skeptic.<br /><br />Another surprise was that it wasn't as costly as I thought.  My $8 jar of Jif has 35 servings and this $10 bag of PB2 has 37 servings. For a mere 20% increase, I'm thrilled to buy this.

review/summary: Feeding my sweet-tooth AND shrinking my waistline!
review/text: I'm not worried about my fat intake at all, but I love peanut butter and would easily eat 400 peanut butter calories daily. I'll eat a spoonful by itself, put a couple in a smoothie... With the same amount of PB2, I'm eating 90 calories. That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.<br /><br />I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better). It actually tastes really good! I tried them separately and they were both good, but I prefer them mixed. My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).<br /><br />Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard. I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want.<br /><br />I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed. PB2 is well worth the money and I will be buying it regularly.

review/text: This product is a dream come true and I haven't even used it in recipes yet.  I love mixing up a small bowl to go, and eating it with sliced apples as a snack.  It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...  Again, LOVE this product.

review/summary: Yum! And less fat and calories!
review/text: Love it!<br />Is it the same as good ole fashioned peanut butter? Ok, probably not. But it's VERY CLOSE! If you can handle all the fat and calories from the real stuff, go ahead and stick with it. However, if you LOVE peanut butter, but find you are needing to cut back, PB2 is the way to go!<br />It's a little pricey. I think there are places to get it cheaper, but I went with Amazon since I was ordering other items and getting free shipping.<br />Mixing it with water and reconstituting it works fine, although a little grainy. And many have already commented that it doesn't amount to much, making it hard to SLATHER on stuff. Since I'm not making peanut butter sandwiches with this stuff, it's not a big deal to me.<br />It's not as sweet as many PB's, it's definitely more like a natural peanut butter in flavor. Personally, I love it for mixing it into my greek yogurt. YUM! A little extra protein and it tastes like a creamy peanut butter mousse. I love it!<br />I haven't tried mixing it in oatmeal yet, but that's next! I started mixing the regular stuff into my oatmeal every morning last summer, but realized I was taking in too many calories and fat along with my regular diet. Soooo, ready to try this option!<br />Great for smoothies or protein shakes too!

review/text: I first bought PB2 after reading it online, and paid 10 bucks for the 6.5 oz jar at a specialty food store.  I was hesitant, having had less than stellar luck with low-calorie peanut butter products (Walden farms, better n' peanut butter, etc).  I also am adverse to products whose ingredients I don't recognize.  But this one really, really delivers.  It has the same taste as regular peanut butter with a slightly fluffier texture. Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.

review/summary: Amazing product!
review/text: I bought a small container of this product (PB2) to try it.  Not only do I love it, but so does my family, including our teens.  Our family follows the Weight Watchers program and this is a wonderful way to have peanut butter without all the points.  Just ordered a one-pound package of both the PB2 and the PB2 with chocolate.  We make smoothies with the PB2 chocolate using frozen bananas, ice, skim milk and PB2 chocolate.  Delicious!!!  Tip for sandwiches - with the PB2 we mix 6 tablespoons of powder with 3 tablespoons of water (3 points).  When using it in the kids sandwiches, I add one teaspoon of regular peanut butter.  Makes 2-3 healthy, tasteful peanut butter sandwiches.

review/summary: It's not peanut butter but it's pretty good!
review/text: I bought this for my sister because she has been wanting to try it for so long so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas present.  She loves it.  Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the "peanut butter" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.  I will definitely repurchase after using it all up.

review/summary: Great low-cal alternative!
review/text: I was skeptical about powdered peanut butter, but it has a great taste! The texture is almost exactly like that of commercially produced peanut butter (not natural peanut butter). I eat it any way you eat "normal" peanut butter but haven't tried it in baking yet.

review/summary: I cannot believe how good this is!
review/text: I have always been very skeptical of low-carb/low-fat foods. I decided to try PB2, based upon the reviews and I'm so glad I did! It tastes soooo peanutty and yummy, I mix it and eat it straight from the spoon!<br /><br />I also make a peanut butter cream cheese filling:<br /><br />1 c. dry PB2 (add water to make a peanut butter consistency)<br />2 tbsp. reduced fat cream cheese<br />2 tsp. Stevia granuals<br />1 drop of vanilla extract<br /><br />Mix well and enjoy from the bowl! (at least I do. you don't need a pie crust)<br /><br />Seriously, this stuff is addicting AND it's so healthy! You won't eat regular, full-fat peanut butter again!
