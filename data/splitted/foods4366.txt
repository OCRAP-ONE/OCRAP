review/summary: The name says it all
review/text: My kitten loves this stuff, she can't get enough and she is a bit on the picky side.  So when they call it Fussie Cat they mean it. I can't get her dish set down fast enough for her, she tries to jump in my arms to eat it before I get a chance to set it down.  I also feed her dry kibble, but supplement with canned food for the added moisture in her diet. Fussie Cat makes for a Happy Cat, also compared to most canned foods (even other good brands) this one actually looks like real fish, whole pieces that you can tell is fish, not something that looks questionable.

review/text: I ordered this as extra & recieved it on time & at door. When I opened the cans my cats were READY! BUT, what came out was a mushy mess & the cats even knew something wasent right! Some gave it a shot , then quickly walked away! Others wont touch it ( & I dont blame them!) . I have this brand on sub & save & I have used it for a year or so, NEVER have I had this issue. Still a total waste & now I have to 1-2 day order More, a different flavor I think! Not happy !

review/summary: Haribo Alphabet Letters are the real deal
review/text: Haribo Alphabet Letters are among Haribo's best products.  They have all the flavor of their flagship Gold-Bears, but with a more satisfying size and texture.  If you have never had Haribo, these are a great place to start.  Five-pound bag is great for parties or the office, or makes a good 3-month personal supply.

review/summary: a tougher gummy
review/text: These letters are a nice simple gummy. They are very flavorful, and come in a variety of fruit flavors like lemon and fruit punch.<br /><br />Despite what the product description says they are not very soft. In fact, I would characterize their consistency as pretty tough, and requires that the consumer do some jaw exercises. Personally I like a little chewing, but this may not please all. The toughness also lets the gummies hold their alphabet shape well.

review/summary: Kind of big
review/text: Quality and taste were good, as expected from Haribo, but these letters are fairly large and as a result some of them end up getting quite bent in the bag.  It's sometimes difficult to get them to stay straight and look like the letters they're supposed to be.  Also, larger letters means fewer letters.  I prefer the smaller ones that come in the 5 oz bags.  It would be nice if they sold the mini letters in a larger size bag.

review/summary: Huge alphabet letters
review/text: Bought this for Sunday Easter because eating the alphabet could be more fun than plain gummy bears. But after receiving them I realized that the alphabet letters are huge in size compared to the gummy bears or skittle. A child can't put one in his/her mouth like a gummy bear or skittle. That's the only complaint I have. A letter can fit in (maybe) a circle that is 2 or 2.5 inches in diameter. They are probably as good as the gummy bears.

And they can only be Haribo!!!!  I have never seen this large one before.  As you may have noticed, I then ordered the "normal" size letters.

A packet slips easily into ones pocket when going out to eat and one needs a safe choice not available. The recepie is simple and does not have gluten,  wheat or other troublesome flours.

But I do know that it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.  It's used to treat scabies, digestive disorders, cataracts, arthritis and heart disease (among others).  I fill capsules and take them when I have a headache or if my joints are feeling achy.  It works far better than ibuprofen or Tylenol. It also helps when I've eaten too much salt and feel pressure in my head and sinuses.  It truly is amazing stuff.

review/summary: Superior grade, minimum 4% curcumin, the good stuff
review/text: It's the curcumin plant pigment which gives this spice its characteristic golden yellow/orange color. I've tried several different varieties of turmeric, and Frontier Organic comes out on top in terms of quality, appearance, and taste. What you're getting here is the Alleppey variety, which recorded maximum color in chemical analyses of turmeric rhizomes (not to get too science-y...basically, this is "the good stuff"). A simple google search will yield a wealth of info explaining the numerous health benefits of this powerful golden powder. For those not familiar or who have never tasted it before, turmeric has a deep, earthy flavor that is somewhat pungent/bitter. It's somewhat of an acquired taste, depending on who you ask--some say they can barely taste it, that it mostly just stains everything they eat (along with their tupperware!) with its trademark bright golden tinge. I feel good about cooking with it because of the anti-inflammatory effects. Also, on the beauty front, I often use it topically (as a homemade facial mask, mixed together with a bit of chickpea flour and almond oil) to maintain glowing skin. You are paying more for organic, yes, but if you use a lot of turmeric (i.e. in your everyday meals), then I happen to think it's worth it because you're consuming the spice at a much higher volume than if you were to only use it sparingly. I believe you can get 3 bags (so that's 3 lbs.) of the non-organic turmeric from Frontier for about $20, which is clearly a sizable price difference. It's a personal choice, obviously. I opt for organic with several spices, only because I do consume certain ones regularly. (Keep in mind that organic doesn't really mean "better" so much as it simply ensures that the food is grown without the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms, or ionizing radiation.)  I've repurchased the 1-lb. bag at least a half dozen times already--I'm replenishing my supply today in fact; just ordered a fresh bag--and I will continue buying Frontier Organic because I find the quality and flavor to be superior. I would absolutely recommend incorporating this spice into your life if you haven't done so already; try it!

review/summary: Has Everything EXCEPT Flavor and Value
review/text: This Snack time special was a gift from a relative, and so I feel pretty bad about giving it a one-star review. And yet, I feel compelled to warn others away from spending this amount of money, PLUS shipping, for snacks that are definitely lacking in TASTE, and are TINY. When I say "tiny", I mean this: the sausages are the size of a woman's index finger--IF she has a small index finger. The cheese bricks are 2 oz--a small man's index finger. The jar of jelly (grape)--1.5 oz is about a heaping tablespoon--enough to cover (maybe) both sides of a bagel (lightly), and you're done.<br /><br />Small size isn't all that important, I suppose, because these are supposed to be snacks. But here's the important part: TASTE. And folks, let me tell you, this assortment was sorely lacking in that department.<br /><br />Everything was either too sweet (do you care for sweet "mellow cheddar"?) or too bland ("brick cheese" had NO flavor) or too greasy ("summer sausage" left a distinct fatty taste in the mouth. Not to mention that one sausage (the index finger size) has 550 mg of sodium.<br /><br />A word about packaging: This arrived in a small box, which, when opened, revealed a MESSY JUMBLE of products. It did NOT in any way resemble the box you see pictured, when it arrived.<br /><br />I tried to post a review of this product on the Swiss Colony site, but wasn't sure they would publish it, so I thought I'd take the time to post here, so others can be aware that they might do much better in choosing a gift for themselves, or friends, than this selection.<br /><br />I hope my relatives don't read this review, because I KNOW they meant well, and I hope this review will help you to choose better for your family and friends. :>)

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Not a bad cup of coffee but sure not one of the best. I was disappointed not so much that it was a strong bold coffee, but that it was just average in taste. Seems that the Timothy's Columbian has been the best so far.

review/summary: Tasty but problematic
review/text: I also have had real problems with some of these cups. Most work fine, but occasionally (one time out of ten?) the machine cannot push water through the cup. It drip, drip, drips out and finally quits after maybe half a cup of coffee is in the cup.  I have two NEW keurigs, one at the office and both have this problem (they are different models, sorry I can't recall which)<br />This is a mess, since I really love the taste, but I think their quality control may need some work.  If you don't mind an occasional "dud" they make good coffee.

review/summary: My favorite brand in organic K-cups
review/text: I think I've tasted every organic coffee made in K-cups.  Newman's is my favorite since it seems to taste richer and more complete.  Ordering from this merchant, it came when promised, delivered as promised, so -- I'm happy.  I tried every organic pod available too, when I had a Senseo.  Yes, there was a crema, but so what when the coffee tasted bitter and awful.  If you like a crema, you can get it with K-cups, too, by first putting your sugar or Splenda or  Stevia into the cup, along with the milk or lightener or half and half, and then microwaving it 40 secs.  Put THAT under the coffee spout, when the coffee comes out, and you have your crema.

review/summary: Surprisingly my favorite!
review/text: I don't generally go for "bold" coffees but I have to say that the flavor of this Newman's Own Special Blend is perfect for my taste.  I often buy Kona coffee blends because they seem less bitter than some others; When I first got my Keurig, I even ordered the 80-count box of Tully's Kona coffee for it.  The machine itself also came with several sample boxes of other brands.  After trying most of them, I was surprised to find myself going back to Newman's  over and over.  In fact, it became such a chore to finish the 80 servings of the Kona that I just gave the rest of them to a neighbor.  Now I have an excuse to buy more of the Newman's Own!

review/text: Claxton fruitcake is so very good!  I love slices of it with coffee at Christmas.  The taste is perfect.  What I am going to say may seem a little strange, but I delight in the texture of it.  I like to chomp on the pecans, and I like the way the cherries feel when I dig my teeth into them.  It is fruitcake like no other.<br /><br />This fruitcake has been a well-received gift sent to my family for many years from beloved cousins.

review/text: I've been eating Claxton Fruitcake since I was a kid and trust me, I'm no longer a kid!  The fruitcake everyone jokes about is awful, it has some fruit and generally dried out cake holding it together. This fruitcake is amazing to behold.  It's a relatively small loaf and it's quite firm.  There is "cake" but you have to look for it.  The fruit and nuts are fresh and fantastic.<br />It wouldn't be Christmas without a Claxton Fruitcake!  By the way, I've found it in the past at my local Fry's (Phoenix, AZ). Fry's is owned by Kroger so look around before you pay for shipping.

review/text: I had the fortune of marrying a guy that loves fruitcake. After so many years of fruitcake jokes in my family, it was an adjustment to think someone actually wants one of these things. The Claxton fruitcake has been available in stores in years past and I would buy the smaller size for my husband. Then one year I tasted it. After just that one bite, I was hooked. I now look for the Claxton fruitcake and I'm so glad it's available at Amazon. No other fruitcake compares to the taste of Claxton's. It is the combination of the ingredients that makes this so special. It's worth every penny and we know every last crumb will be eaten.

review/text: Before Christmas I bought a bunch of these at Sam's Club for less than $9 for the 3-lb. box. I have loved them for decades. For the price, they are great. To get something better, you have to pay several times the price. I paid $21 for 36 ounce fruit cakes at a local top notch bakery. They are better, with more dried fruit, but honestly not worth three times the price of the Claxton fruit cakes.

review/summary: What a shock!
review/text: Claxton fruitcake has been a family tradition since I was a child ... so after several fruitcakeless years spent in South America I made a bee line to the nearest grocery and to my delight found stacks and stacks of Claxton. The mere number in the store should have been a clue, but I didn't see it that way. Noooo ... Lots and lots of that delicious fruitcake was my take. Well, the moment I bit into the first slice I was disappointed. The pecan stuffed fruitcakes of my youth had been replaced by a tasteless almond filled concotion.<br />I did find a suitable substitute at Costco that far out shined the Claxton of my rose colored memories.<br />In three words, "Don't buy it." At least not until they replace the pecans.

Seems "they" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don't use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card.  Fruitcake, I say!  Fruitcake!<br /><br />So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it.  Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Amazon.  Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it.  But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed "gourmet" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected.  In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad.  If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other "disposable income" on something else.  Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake.<br /><br />Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I've been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time.  Ever since I care to remember actually.  I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake.  I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake.  Well, soon the word spread, and I've been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages.  Not that I'm complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE!  There, I said it all.  But...this particular fruitcake brand?  Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful.<br /><br />Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this.  I really did.  An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking.  Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good.  And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I've ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product.  And please don't make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would've told me the story here.<br /><br />I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I'm just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn't even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future.  Heck, this isn't even "cake" at all.  It's like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet "fruits," and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable.  Heck, I don't even LIKE sweets generally.  I'd much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M's or Reese's peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing.  But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I've ever really loved, was/is fruitcake.  So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced?<br /><br />I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH.  Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I've always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials.  This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking.  And that, ain't good.  Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH.  And that's what this is really.  In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha!  Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that.<br /><br />Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I've found here on Amazon, I may never know if this is just me, or what.  This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Amazon delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would've felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound "cakes" away.  Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don't know.<br /><br />Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can.  If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away.  But I can't give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go.  And wouldn't ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I'm supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess.  And no real warranty!  Fruitcake lover/buyer beware...<br /><br />To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price.  To those of you who've tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain't that good.  A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO.  One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this...

review/summary: Great for those who want the health benefits of coconut oil without the taste.
review/text: I bought this product because I wanted to replace olive oil in my cooking. I have purchased scented virgin coconut oil but found that it gave a coconutty taste to my food. When I received this unscented processed coconut oil,  I was skeptical about whether  I was getting the same health benefits from this stuff. I called the hotline on the label and I spoke with a very helpful customer service representative, who relieved my doubts. She told me that if I was taking coconut oil to stave off Alzheimer's disease, I should look for a scented version. She said that something about the smell has been shown to alleviate that condition. However, if I am taking it because of the lauric acid or medium chain triglycerides, then it is identical to using scented virgin coconut oil. YES!! Who wouldn't want to replace their cooking oil with the only fat that eats other fat? She also assured me that they use steam instead of nasty chemicals in their expelling process. I'm not a scientist but these answers satisfied me. I will continue cooking with this product -- the largest and cheapest in the market as far as I've seen -- for as long as it's available.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: Exactly what I expected. I kept it in the fridge (stuck it in there overnight before I opened it), and used a butter knife to chunk off size I needed anytime I used. No mess this way. Does take up bit of space in fridge because of size- but I soon got accustomed to it always having its "spot". Worked great in EVERY recipe I replaced butter or vegetable oil in. Cookies, pancakes, bread, brownies, pasta sauces, etc, etc, etc. I also used it in place of butter on top of veggie sides w/dinner. As a HUGE butter fan my whole life, I expected being disappointed with it on potatoes and corn and broccoli. But was not! In fact, after about a month of no butter in the house, I decided to be bad- and bought some to spoil myself a little- and I actually found I Disliked the taste of the BUTTER on my veggies at this point! What a surprise! So to trade bad cholesterol for good, potentially prevent/postpone Alzheimer's for my kids, husband and I (as it runs in our familys)- it is hands down 5 stars. Was excellent product, well packaged, shipped fast, shipped free, was exactly what I wanted and then some. Im giving it 4 stars because I came back to order again, as I'm 3/4 of the way done- and the price has gone up from $36 when I ordered it, to $45 today. Huge price hike since I ordered on 7/9/12. I'll watch for price to go back down- or will order somewhere else.

review/summary: A healthy, somewhat expensive food.
review/text: These berries are thought to be one of the one of the healthiest natural foods. There are many "stories" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow:<br /><br />1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein. This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats.<br /><br />2) Decent fiber content (about 10%)<br /><br />3) 18 (!!) amino acids<br /><br />4) Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350-380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat.<br /><br />5) 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11+ minerals (more in trace amounts)<br /><br />6) Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids (this is a good thing), phytosterols (help lower cholesterol), and other healthy (or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched) phytochemicals.<br /><br />Enough with the technical jargon. These berries are great in cereal, smoothies (once hydrated), and tea. For tea, try this:<br /><br />Put water, a small number of berries (6-15ish) and a teabag in your cup, microwave for about a minute per teacup (time varies), drop a small amount in your favorite tea along with the teabag and let the berries and tea steep for about 3 minutes.<br /><br />This adds a subtle character to green tea (plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips). The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer.<br /><br />Of note:<br /><br />- If you let them soak for too long (more than about 5-10 minutes) they get mushy and lose their texture and flavor.<br /><br />- If you do not soak them long enough, they can feel a little bit gritty. I think this is due to the seeds. I don't mind it myself, but some might.<br /><br />I recommend that you try a bag, keeping in mind that you may need to soak the berries in water/tea/whatever in order to make them soft, and see what you think. I have found they make a great addition to my usual cereal-only breakfast because they give me a much-needed protein boost.<br /><br />If you like them quite a lot, you may want to take the time to look for a supply in a nearby Asian foods store. I have heard they can be purchased at a lower cost in bulk.<br /><br />The reviewer that reported these are "gross" may have received something from a bad batch. I think they have a nice cranberry/raisin-ish flavor and have almost no noticeable odor (and the odor isn't an unpleasant one to me).

review/summary: extremely hard, weird chemical taste
review/text: I *love* goji berries and planned to use these for smoothies. I've eaten goji berries frequently in oatmeal, muffins, etc, as I used to purchase them from a bulk bin at my local health food store in CA. I moved, though, and needed to find a new source. I thought these would be a good deal b/c of the awesome price, but they are TERRIBLE tasting--for one, they're so hard (they're sundried) that it hurt my teeth to try to chew them. Then, when I did eat a few, they had such a bizarre, chemical-ish  taste (they tasted kind of like the way melting plastic smells), that I became concerned and decided to throw them away rather than eat them. Amazon does not allow returns for this item (grocery). They were nice enough to give me a refund (unexpected!). Sadly, these are in the trash, and I will not be purchasing them again.<br /><br />Added on Jan 30, 2011: If you read the reviews on this product carefully, you'll notice that many of the 4 and 5 star reviews sound like they were written by people responding to a Mechanical Turk assignment asking them to review the product. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviews don't say that the reviewer has actually purchased the product--they just contain general, positive info about goji berries.

They are slightly sweet but not sticky. I'm sure they'd be great in pancackes, trailmix or ice cream too.<br /><br />They are low calorie and have good vitamins, plus some fiber and protein.<br /><br />It's like having the culuture of the Tibetan mountains shipped to you.<br /><br />Very good stuff.

review/text: Go to [...].  Search for the video entitled:  WHOLE FOODS MARKET "ORGANIC" FOOD MADE IN CHINA!!!!<br /><br />According to my research, China is the major supplier of Goji berries.  There's been an unresolved growing concern about food, any food produced in China, even though it is labeled "organic" with the USDA and AIC labels.<br /><br />If you want to know about specific products, you can go to the WJLA website for a "do not purchase" list.<br /><br />Because I learned that China produces the vast majority of the world's supply of goji berries, I sent an inquiry to a US distributor-retailer of "certified organic" goji berries to ask them how they knew for sure that their "certified organic" goji berries were truly organic.  I never got a response.<br /><br />I have learned that the Chinese government does not allow non-Chinese, independent individuals or agencies to inspect the organic farms in China.  I do not know whether the Chinese government has changed that policy or if any progress is being made as of this writing.<br /><br />Until I can be sure the higher prices for "organic" labeled foods are justified, I am going to avoid any food products that are "Made In China" from Whole Foods Market or from any other distributor.<br /><br />If you don't see the country of origin on the label, my feeling is....why?  And I don't buy it.<br /><br />Of course, even if the label says "Made In USA", that is no guarantee that some ingredients in the product do not originate in China.  E.G., Trader Joe's does not sell products "Made In China" but that does not mean that products put together and "Made In USA" do not use ingredients imported from China.  Which is worrisome.<br /><br />The consumer is king.  If you weigh in with your buying habits (your almighty wallet), the producers will listen.  Your health is the most important asset you own. Become a fierce creature and protect your health.

As for the positive reviews--I agree, most of the 4 and 5 star reviews just talk about the benefits of gogi berries in general.  I gave it 3 stars b/c of the supposed health benefits but for taste, I'd only give it one.

review/summary: Mold
review/text: I like goji berries and have purchased other products from Navitas Naturals of good quality, so when I received these I immediately opened them and tried them. They smelled and tasted off...slightly moldy...but I didn't see any mold. I opened the second package (8oz 2 pack) and they tasted the same. I put them away and disregarded the taste until I started to feel a little sick. I went back to the packages and cut some of the perfectly fine looking berries open...and about 1 in 10 was filled with mold.<br /><br />I will definitely not be purchasing this product again, no matter how packed with nutrients it is. It has made me temporarily paranoid about all of the dried stuff I eat...it all looks fine on the outside.<br />It is a shame there are no returns with this item as I am noticing from reviews that the mold problem is fairly common.

review/summary: Worst Goji berries i've ever bought
review/text: They are crunchy and dissolve when you bite them.  Of course, this also affects the taste.<br />In the past, I've bought many varieties while living in Europe, where Goji berries are wide-spread.  They should be slightly chewy.<br /><br />Will not be buying again.<br /><br />--<br />As an update, the first bag I bought was crunchy.  The second bag that came in the package was a bit more chewy, but still stale.  But because the quality doesn't seem to be consistent, I will be trying other brands<br /><br />--<br /><br />So I tried the Sunfoods goji berries on Amazon.  They are great and not stale at all.  The downside is that the Sunfoods currently cost twice the amount as the Navitas, but the bag lasts me 3 months and the extra taste and freshness is well worth it.  They even taste good out of the bag, which is not something I could claim with Navitas. I'll definitely not be going back to Navitas.

At first, the taste was unfamiliar, so it took a little getting used to.  They can also be a bit drier than other dried fruit. One of the best things about them is how they affect my energy level. I have a friend who uses a supplement made up mostly of ground up goji berries (also known as wolfberries) He lost a lot of weight, his skin got really healthy and started to glow and his energy was notably clearer. His improved health was so obvious, I noticed it before he even said that he was doing anything different and had to ask him what had changed.<br />These goji berries are well packaged and this is a better price than I was able to find elsewhere.

review/summary: Goji Berries
review/text: I ordered these because I don't like sulfur dioxide, which most of the commonly-available goji are heavily treated with. These were definitely priced right, and they are sulfer free, fresh-looking, with great color, and certified organic. I will definitely be ordering again.

review/summary: GOJI BERRIES- GOOD IN ANYTHING!
review/text: I've gotten two shipments of these Goji's already and I have to say that Navitas Naturals is a great company. Their products are very high quality, and they have trade agreements with locals overseas that grow their different products for them. Goji berries are very healthy for you, and I'm in the process of growing them in my house too. But until I have enough to make buckets full of them I'm going to continue to buy them here on Amazon.com , The best place to buy these.

review/summary: ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE
review/text: The Navitas Naturals Organic Goji Berries are an economic alternative to other brands of Goji Berries that I have tried---almost 50% cheaper. I eat a handful or more a day and it's a very tasty snack, although these are a tad drier than others I have tried; but the dryness seems to be just on the outside of the berry because the inner part has a moist chewiness. We really enjoy them.

review/summary: Good product.
review/text: I received my berries today and immediately gave them a taste. They're super delicious and have that nice crisp dried berry texture, so you know they were packaged properly. This product matches the description on amazon and is also in recyclable packaging (big plus). Next time I need a similar product I'll see if Navitas Naturals sells it.

review/summary: High in protein and versatile
review/text: This is my first time buying and using goji berries, so I don't have another brand to compare these to, but the price on these is fantastic and they are really tasty.  When they arrived, I was worried that they would taste/feel dry and gritty in the mouth, but the taste is subtle and blends into whatever food they're mixed into.<br /><br />My favorite ways to use them so far are mixing them into oatmeal, adding them to protein smoothies, and mixing them into a granola and Greek yogurt combination.<br /><br />I had read online that eating about 1-2 tablespoons a day allows for maximum benefit.  Since they are pretty expensive, I use about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon a day.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: great gojis!!
review/text: I've been eating Goji berries for 5 or so years, and trying different brands, if the price isn't too exorbitant. These are easily as good as the brand I settled on for the combination of freshness and price. Some goji berries can be like small pebbles in your moiuth. old and dry is what i'm thinking. Some brands think you'll pay twice as much as the others. NOT ME!!!! A very good value buying the 2-packs which are 1-LB. navitas goji berries has a returning customer. ME!!

review/summary: A Little disappointed
review/text: I've only tried Goji Berries from one other supplier so I'm not an expert on what the perfect died Goji Berry should be like.<br />I found these berries much drier than my usual brand. My usual brand is a little dryer than your standard raisin but not as hard and dry as this.<br />These berries were so dry eating them straight out the bag they were hard like a chewy rock candy.<br />They tasted like the Goji Berries I'm used to I was just put off by the hard as rock candy texture.<br />If you wanted to use these in a tea or soften them with a smootie or yogurt I guess they would be fine.<br />I do plan to finish them. They taste fine I just fear for my dental work :)<br />I tried to save a little with this brand but I'm going back to Swanson's. Natural Himalania Dried Goji Berries 8 oz (227 grams) Pkg

review/summary: Another healthy berry
review/text: Like many other berries, these are high in anti-oxidents.  They are a good natural food with a somewhat sweet flavor without being overly sweet.  They are another option to add to morning cereal, or to just use as a dried fruit snack.  The dried berries can be mixed with a dry cereal like Kashi GoLean (also available from Amazon) to make a dry, trail mix type snack.<br /><br />Like other food products, they may have some unverified nutritional value.  They are a component of some weight loss products.  I have just started with these berries, so we shall see.<br /><br />I have to agree with another reviewer that the word organic may be overused.

review/summary: Go goji berries.
review/text: I like these very much. I mix them in my cereal with some dried cranberries and cherries. They have a bit of a crispness and slight crunch that I prefer to others I have purchased elsewhere.

review/summary: So so eaten alone, great in a mix
review/text: They have a slight after taste I was not fond of, but they are great mixed with other berries or nuts. My 4 year son does like to eat them alone and thinks they are fruit snacks of some kind.
