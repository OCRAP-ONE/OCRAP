review/summary: Colorful and less common bean, Jacobs Cattle Beans, 1 lb.
review/text: My father is a strict vegetarian and has been all his life. He was born in 1935 and recently had a birthday. I sent him a couple kinds of beans because I know he eats them all of the time and likes them. Also, I had a spending limit that was pretty small. I have Amazon Prime so sending stuff has become more affordable. I actually thought about buying these beans for myself and will now that I have my father's feedback. He said that he had never seen this kind of bean before and that they are very beautiful. He called to thank me for them. They are, apparently, actually three colors:  black, white and red. I think that the point of these beans is that they are different and unusual. Anything that is produced in smaller numbers is going to cost more. I don't know if I can update this review but I will ask my dad how he liked them after cooking them. I cannot imagine that they would be bad or the Passamaquoddy Indians wouldn't have bothered with growing them! Usually colorful produce is good for you and tastes good if prepared correctly.

review/summary: Very good for women
review/text: I try to take this product on a regular basis, every day or every couple of days. It has helped me with an estrogen dominance problem (heavy bleeding) and other pms symptoms. I consider it to be a medicinal product. It is loaded with nutrients women need, like iron, potassium, etc... I love that it is organic.<br />The best way I have found to take it is like a tea. I started out putting about 1 tablespoon in a mug and filling it with hot water, then sipping it.<br />My favorite recipe now is to put 1 Tbsp in the mug and stir in about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Then I add the water, leaving some room at the top. Then I pour in about 2-3 Tbsp of coconut milk and stir. This "tea" is rich and creamy and tastes a lot like hot coco with a little zip from the cayenne.

review/summary: Not an easy road.
review/text: The Molasses itself is delicious.  Having said that, Amazon forgot to fill the original order or it got lost in delivery.  When I contacted them, Amazon being Amazon, took care of it right away and overnighted the molasses to me.  It showed up first thing the next day.  Problem was the the seals on the Molasses had leaked and I had a bit of a mess.  I again contacted amazon who again was very helpfull and overnighted me another package free of charge as well as allowing me to keep the leaky Molasses.  The second package came the next day and it had also leaked all over the box.  Oh well. Of the six bottles of Molasses Amazon sent three were intact and three had leaked.  Like I said the Molases is very good, rich and flavorful.  I do think the manufacture needs to improve both the seals on the bottles as well as how it ships them.  As always I am always pleased with Amazons customer service and how it handles problems.

review/text: This is some of the best organic, Black Strap Molasses that I have found and you can't beat the price. I searched the whole internet and local stores and this was by far the best deal. We bought four bottles just to keep on hand. It is such a great source of vitamins and minerals very high in iron. I'd recommend it if you like molasses.

review/summary: Great product, leaky packaging
review/text: This molasses has a wonderful flavor (if you like molasses), and it's nice to know it's organic and unsulphured.<br /><br />(For a nice caffeine-free hot beverage, try a teaspoon or two of this molasses in hot water with additional sweetener, a few drops of vanilla, and creamer of your choice. And you can make your own brown sugar by mixing a teaspoon into a half cup of white sugar.)<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this product five stars is because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the packaging doesn't hold up well in shipping. One of our orders had to be returned because it leaked out of the package and into the courier's truck. Another order leaked but at least stayed within the Amazon box.<br /><br />Since it's molasses, I'm going to guess that such leaks occur more often in hot summer months. It's still a great product, so winter might be a good time to stock up!

review/text: These 3 bottles came wrapped in a/1 plastic bag.  The bottles leaked at the lid into the plastic bag and into the box.  Luckily the only items messed up were the bottles of molasses.  I was not allowed to return them because they were food.  Just to let everyone know the packaging was poor.  They should have been wrapped separately in bubble wrap.<br />I know the product is good. That is why I can rate it.  I can't give it 5 stars because we didn't use this particular product. We have purchased it in the past at Whole Foods and will purchase it there in the future.  My husband uses it to make his barbeque sauce.

review/summary: Love the molasses but not the packaging
review/text: I received my first shipment of this molasses yesterday.  My UPS driver brought it to my door.  He had opened the bottom of the box and said he needed to set it down where it wouldn't leak on anything.  It had alaready leaked on some of his cargo!<br />We went to the sink and set it down there.  Molasses was all over the inside of the box and dripping out one corner!<br />He suggested I beg or PLEAD with Amazon to make sure tape or something of tht sort would be placed around the lid of the replacement shipment.<br />Sorry, that didn't happen.  The replacement came today and two of the lids were loose, with less leakage though, since today's shipment was overnight....less time to leak.  And also, the UPS driver had opened the box when he loaded his truck and had tightened the offending lids!<br />I truly love the molasses.<br />I have three loaves of molasses oatmeal bread rising in the kitchen right now.  They are smelling wonderful.<br />I am just hoping the leakage problem will be solved before my next shipment is due in six months.<br />I'd love to see this wonderful product keep coming!

review/text: The flavor of the molasses is exactly what you'd expect sweet with a hint bitter and an earthy aftertaste.  I've used it in several recipes with great success.  If I'd purchased this item at the grocery store it would get a 4-5 star rating; however the packaging is not designed to be shipped.  When I received the bottles one of them had opened in transit and leaked over everything.  If you order this through Amazon make sure you open the box over a sink to minimize the area you'll have to clean.

review/summary: Molasses...
review/text: One tbsp of Wholesome organic molasses offers me 20% iron, 18% calcium which is more in compare to milk for every calorie, 15% potassium, 11% magnesium, and 10% copper. With 50 calories and 11gr sugar, I only use one tbsp a day in my green tea daily as well as when I am in need of fast energy, without any additives, right exactly before any sports like weight lifting, mountain biking, surfing, etc. if I have no access to banana or grapefruit. Potassium stops cramps and this is my life saver.. This is a necessity just like I consume honey, Bragg's apple cider, organic flax-sesame seeds, etc. as super food. Once opened, I place some in a smaller tightly sealed container and keep it in refrigerator, refill as needed, but consume it within 6 months. I am into sports, diet and nutrition and blackstrap molasses' nutritional value varies depending on the quality of the sugar cane or beets from which it was extracted. For that reason organic and brand is extremely important to me. Honey looses its medicinal value when added to tea but since molasses is a by product which was heated during the production, further heat does not impact the nutritional value. With all that said, you will still need to get used to the taste since the taste is somewhere around bitter, beet juice and changes the taste of the tea. Bravo.

I wrote a bad review.<br /><br />I received a message from Jennie at the company who produces the Molasses -- she shipped out at no additional cost to us three new bottles -- they were plastic bottles this time, not glass.  Jennie from the family owned company followed up with me several times with very nice emails.<br /><br />The plastic bottles arrived in tact with no problems.  I really appreciated the quick and positive response from the company that produces the Molasses.<br /><br />I will order the molasses again from this company -- I would have deleted my original review, but could not access it and do so...so writing a new review.<br /><br />Dr. Donna Moss

review/text: I had never tried blackstrap molasses before and I was expecting not to like the taste after reading many online comments about how awful it tastes and how much it's an acquired taste.  I bought this from the grocery store since it was on sale, and I actually love the taste of it.  I read on another site that some people thought it tastes like licorice, but I don't think it does at all, which is good because I hate the taste of licorice.  The only thing I don't like about this is that it's really messy.  Maybe if it was in a squeeze bottle it would be easier to pour into a measuring spoon.

Guess I need to find other toys that are a challenge to get out of the toy box because I don't want to spend another eighteen dollars or more for another one. I am very disappointed because the original box and original balls were great fun for both of them.

review/text: I have used this tea now for about 3 months.  I enjoy 3 cups a day.  I have used various green tea bags and different brands of loose green tea.  This Sencha is mild and steeps to green not brown green tea.  I make it in a French coffee press.  I put 1 tablespoon of tea in the press and pour in 8 ounces of filtered water that I have heated in the microwave for 1 minute 20 seconds.  I stir the tea for about 2 seconds and press.  I pour the hot tea into a cup in which I have finely grated frozen ginger root.  I do not need a sweetener.  But it is good with honey, agave nectar or brown rice syrup.  I can make 3 cups of tea before needing to empty out the used tea and use fresh loose tea. The used tea produces a less green tea (more amber in color) but it is still good.

review/summary: Just like when I was a kid!
review/text: This candy is the best!  I remember going to the store as a kid and buying these and pretending it was a communion wafer with my friends.  I'm so glad to share this with my children.  It is an edible wafer with little nonpereil beads inside.  They are not too sweet.  Everyone who tries them seems to love them.  You cannot eat just one!

review/summary: They remind me of the neighborhood candy store
review/text: After eating a handful of these and remembering what it was like to be eight years old, I read the ingredients list on the box:<br /><br />- Yummy sugary things<br />- Weird styrofoamy stuff that melts in your mouth<br />- Memories of a simpler time<br /><br />Not only are they tasty and addictive and packed with nostalgia, but it's a lot of fun to feed satellite wafers to people who have never seen them before.  They start out completely unconvinced that the weird styrofoamy stuff is edible, and they want to rip it open to get to the stuff inside.  After a few rounds of convincing, the braver ones go for it.<br /><br />You can now easily tell the cool kids from the fuddy duddies-- the cool ones take another, and the boring ones scrunch up their faces in that way that your mother always warned you about.  Walk away from them, secretly hoping their faces will freeze that way.  The face-scrunchers mean more satellite wafers for you.  Yay!

review/summary: A Great Simple, Different Candy!
review/text: You might be worried that a candy says edible on the front, you might be thinking why they would need to put that there. But, this really is a great candy, not too sweet, they DO NOT taste like styrofoam, as the one review says. The best way to describe them is a communion wafer with tiny candy beads, called "sugar pearls", inside of them, they are not too hard or too soft. My dad would bring these home from work when my sister and I were kids, and we both loved them. Although I did not buy mine from Amazon, I would recommend doing so, these really are great! There's about a gram of sugar per wafer, and almost no fat so if you're diet conscience these are still for you.

review/text: My daughter first got a little bag of these at Dylan's candy store in NY.  She loved them and they are low in sugar compared to most candies.  I bought this big box of wafers and we packaged them up in gift bags for her 8 year old classmates.  They loved them too as they were unique and had never seen them before.  The wafer is nostalgic of a communion wafer and filled with little colored sprinkles.  If you've never tried them before, I would start with a much smaller package than this big box.

review/text: I received a Keurig B-70 for Christmas a couple years ago and with it got the Caribou Colombian k-cups.  I used to go to Caribou at least once or twice a week to get my coffee and then just have Folgers the rest of the time.  When I made my first cup of coffee with the Caribou Colombian I told my boyfriend and son that I would never have to go to caribou coffee house/shop again.  This is the best of all caribou coffee.  It's smooth and delicious.  If you like mocha or dont like coffee black it is also delicious with sugar and cream or milk.  I make mine with a dash of chocolate milk and 2 heaping tablespoons of Swiss miss hot cocoa for a 14 to 15 oz cup.  Very good!  I have not had any other kind of coffee since.  This is the perfect coffee!

Columbia is typically my favorite type of coffee and I was very pleased with this offering from Caribou Coffee. I've had their original "blend" on multiple occasions as its one of my favorites in k-cups. I'm not really sure how my coffee tastes stack up against other peoples but if you like a good middle of the road cup of coffee I highly recommend this.

Apparently not impossible to find in MA but difficult, particularly not owning a car (common in Cambridge) and using public transport or Zipcar.<br /><br />I really like these croutons on top of chili and in Tex-Mex salads. I think they work better than corn chips or cornbread. I only just discovered them so I am sure there are more uses. What I like about them is that they add crunch but are not aggressively seasoned like most croutons.<br /><br />Someone was pretty darn clever when they came up with this idea. I was tickled to find them on Amazon.

review/summary: Attractive alternative to Tassimo carousel
review/text: I originally purchased the 5-bin carousel directly from Tassimo, and I wanted another one because I routinely use about 10 different types of T-Discs.  For some reason, Tassimo stopped offering their carousel except to their "European cafe collection" customers.  The only other carousel I could find was this one, the Nifty Home Products carousel.  It is a little smaller, 4 bins instead of 5, and does not have the holder for the cleaning disc like the Tassimo holder.  I didn't think I would like it as well.  As it turns out, I like it just as well if not better.  It is an attractive carousel, and it spins better than the Tassimo carousel.  Although its capacity is slightly less, it is not bad.  It can hold full stacks of 4 different T-discs, or, if you don't mind taking T-discs out of both the bottom and the top of each bin, it can hold half-stacks of 8 different T-discs.  And the price on Amazon is great.  I definitely recommend this carousel.

review/summary: This is half the price it's selling for in a kitchen store; it's made very well
review/text: I debated getting one of these in a gourmet kitchen store but declined because I thought the price tag was too steep at fifty bucks. However, I just received one as an early birthday present to go with my new Tassimo coffee maker and, in doing my review, find it's far cheaper as of the time of my review here.<br /><br />This is made very well...heavy shiny metal but it flows very easily. So much so that you could spin it fast and keep it twirling. I only say that, not because you'd need to do that, but so you can visualize that there is no tipping or hard pushing when selecting your coffee, tea, or cocoa.<br /><br />We had the self-dispenser boxes on our conter but, let's face it, it's not so attractive to do that and I like to keep a clean and organized countertop.  This is ideal if you have guests or if you like switching up your drinking choices. While it has 4 slots for drinks, you can actually have 8 different selections because you can pull from both the bottom and the top of the dispenser so we fill the dispenser slots with 2 different choices so we have 8 choices total. If you entertain or have frequent guests as we do, you can have some lighter coffees and heavier ones, tea, cocoa, espresso, etc and each guest can pick their choice to make their brew. But we like this for our choice variations equally.  I love green tea for the health benefits and taste, I like Nabob Columbian coffee for a smaller cup that's smooth, and Starbucks for a large cup, we like to keep the Milka hot chocolate on hand for a low cal decadent treat, etc. With an easy turn you can make your choice and it takes up very little room on the counter while matching our stainless appliances so it seems to fit well without looking unsightly.<br /><br />I usually list negatives in my reviews to give a balanced picture but I really don't have any for this one. It's a good size and works well.  Happy I got it.<br /><br />Note: This is similar to the cream dispensers or jelly dispensers you might see at a breakfast restaurant if that helps visualize it. This is for the Tassimo brand coffees.

review/text: This thing is almost a necessity if you have a Tassimo machine. It will hold at least 40 (10 per column) of the small T-discs. If you have a specialty drink that takes 2 discs (1 small T-disc and 1 large T-disc), it can accomodate those too. I normally alternate the small and the large in the same column and that works out to 4 small and 4 large discs per column. I haven't tried a column with all large discs, but I suspect it would hold about 6-7 of those in one column. If you like a variety of drinks to be available at your house, I suggest picking up 2 of these. You'll be glad you did! Well worth the price!

review/summary: Should seem dumb -- Isn't!
review/text: Basically, this should seem dumb and unnecessary, but the t-disks are little buggers to keep organized. So, it's rather nice to have, and it makes me feel like I live in an Italian B&B. I refill every other day or so from coffee collection in freezer.

review/summary: Tassimo Roulette
review/text: Want to store more Tassimo T-Discs in less space? Get rid of those pesky boxes?<br />Than buy one (or a pair) of these carousels to keep your coffee corralled.<br /><br />The units (Yep, I bought two) are very stable, and each of the four columns of the unit easily holds 10 regular- or 6 jumbo-sized T-Discs (creamers, Gevalia "Starbucks clones"). We use one carousel for our coffees, the other for our espressos and cremas.<br /><br />Just ensure that you have sufficient "spinning room" so they don't catch each other or something else in your cabinet. This is MUCH more compact than stacking 8 boxes in the cabinet.<br /><br />Get one (or two) for your kitchen -- you'll be glad you did!

review/summary: Nifty, functional T disc storage that has held up well over 6 months.
review/text: I bought this as a gift for a co-worker who is kind enough to brew me cups of coffee in moments of desperation (or even 'just because').  I gave it to her about 6 months ago and she has it set up in her office and keeps it well stocked (I help with that part too...she really does help me out with keeping my blood-caffeine titers level).  This is definitely a well utilized product for her.<br /><br />I waited for the review to make sure that it has held up well, and it has.  High marks on functionality and usefulness--it is always stocked and keeps her from having to dig around looking for the 'right' t-disc, and it looks good.  Also, over 6 months, no concerns with durability, so both in terms of usefulness and product quality, this is a great item.<br /><br />Highly recommended--either for yourself, or as a gift if you have a person who gives you the Tassimo hook-up.<br /><br />JTG

It has a classic chrome look that will appeal to the aesthetic of most home kitchen barista environs.  You'll love filling it up, using them up, and filling it up again.  Guaranteed to increase your consumption of T-Discs (is that a good thing?  I think so).  The four sections mean there is room for four varieties of T-Discs.  The bottom of each section offers space for simple removal and dispatch of both smaller (espresso) and larger (creamers) T-Discs.

The material appears to be stainless steel, and is quite substantial in spite of the carousel's compact footprint. It rotates easily and is very stable. T-Discs are dispensed, as usual, from the bottom and slide right out.  The only thing I might want is more racks to place a greater variety, and so that I could add milk discs for latte products.<br /><br />All in all, a great value.

review/summary: Hold everything, cutely!
review/text: If you have the Tassimo system, you will not be complete without this carousel.  It will take up counter space just as the machine itself, but impact is minimal.  It is sturdy, although it may not be soid metal? I now the carousel is metal, the base may have a painted plastic surroungd over the turning mechanism.  The neat thing is that with the 4 stalls it can store 8 different varieties, because you can pull from both the bottom and the top.  So, the latte expresso and milk can fit in one stall.<br /><br />My friends love the experience of coming to my counter and conveniently grabbing a bup of something, anything.  If you buy a lot of varieties this is one way to keep the popular ones out and ready.  If you only buy 2 packages at a time, I think it is still worthwhile, because it only holds up to 40 discs which is about 2-3 packages.<br /><br />The price is cheap here, 14.99.  It is 19.99 in the stores (BBB).  the cost of the Tassimo went up in February'09 to 169.00 from 139.00, so if the savings is still here, it helps with the sting.

I use to mix Shakeology with banana and Peanut butter but I'm not sure if Amazing grass will mix as well. Shakeology included milk product which I think gave it a better mixing advantage. Overall, I will make it through this box! Who knows...maybe it will grow on me more!

review/summary: Amazing Shake That Lives up to its Name!
review/text: This shake is exactly what I was looking for and needed. I am sensitive to Gluten so it had to be Gluten Free, which it is. It also had to have protein from plants, which it does. It also had to taste good, which it does. This shake has it all! I am so happy with it, I get it each month on an auto-ship. It gives me energy and also helps to regulate my body in many ways (the most important way!). I got my 20 year old son hooked on it so I sent it out to college on a monthly shipment and he was so happy to have a consistent form of protein that kept him healthy while everyone else was getting the flu. I couldn't be happier with this product (unless it drops in price, but I do think it's fairly priced compared to the crap out there).

review/summary: Better than I thought!
review/text: I had very low expectations about this product because I rarely like the taste of these types of shakes.  But I purchased it because (a) it had no fake ingredients or Stevia (which I'm allergic to) and (b) I wanted to get into the habit of having a healthy breakfast shake or inbetween meals shake to get back on track.<br /><br />I tried the first one this morning for breakfast with some vanilla hemp milk and ice.  I was surprised because it was tasty!  Yes, it's a big grainy and if you're expecting a smooth chocolate milk type experience, you'll be disappointed.  But it actually reminded me of Tiger's Milk, a nutritional shake my dad used to make for me as a kid.  Kinda of malty tasting but in a good way.<br /><br />So not only was it more pleasant tasting than I expected, it's the first time I have been able to drink a shake for breakfast at 6:00 and not feel like I need a snack right when I get to work at 8:00.  In fact it's 10:00 and I'm just now starting to feel peckish.  Not too bad!
