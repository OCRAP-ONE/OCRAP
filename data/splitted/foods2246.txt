review/summary: This is  absolutely 1st rate Spelt. I am so grateful to find un-milled spelt that I can mill into flour my self at home.
review/text: This is wonderful Spelt, that I can mill into flour at home. There a a few other granaries  that offer Spelt that can be ground into flour at home. But they charge as much or more for the shipping and handling as they do the Spelt. This is not the case with Great River Organic Milling. The Spelt I received from Great River is wonderful, fresh, Grade AAA Spelt. I have been able to make wonderful bread, pie crusts and pasta with this Spelt. Thank you so very much Great River, for offering this product.

review/text: When I got this I thought it was a good deal.  I used some of the berries and the taste was very good.  However, a few days later there were worms coming out of the bag.  I have never had these worms in my house so I am sure they came from this bag of spelt berries.  I could not find a way to contact Amazon.com customer service about this.

review/summary: HUGE Jar of High-Quality McCormick Ground Cinnamon
review/text: This 18-oz. jar of McCormick ground cinnamon is for serious cinnamon lovers or  commercial bakers only!  It's huge, compared to the 1- or 2-ounce jars or cans of McCormick cinnamon that you'll find in the spice aisle of your local grocery store.  However, it's the same high-quality McCormick cinnamon that you find in the small-size containers.  I use a lot of cinnamon--mostly in cinnamon/sugar topping for buttered toast, but also in apple pies and baked things--so I find this super-economy-size jar to be both convenient and bargain-priced.

review/summary: A list of the flavors.
review/text: I bought this on a whim because 24 flavors for the price seemed to be a good deal.  However, I'm knocking off a star because there are some duplicates (though in some fairness, they're the most likely to be used).  Each of these is a one dram (3/4 teaspoon) bottle so you're likely to get only one batch of candy from each bottle, but it's a good way to experiment.<br /><br />The artificial flavors also contain colorants, which I suppose some people might appreciate since they don't have to use their own food coloring.  However, I prefer to add colorants separately so I can better control the final appearance. So I've also deducted a star for this reason.<br /><br />Natural oils:<br />Anise Oil<br />Orange Oil<br />Lemon Oil<br />Peppermint Oil (3 bottles)<br />Spearmint Oil<br />Clove Oil<br />Cinnamon Oil (4 bottles)<br /><br />Artificial Flavors:<br />Root Beer<br />Watermelon (2 bottles)<br />Raspberry<br />Cran-Raspberry<br />Strawberry<br />Bubble Gum<br />Orange Creme<br />Bavarian Creme<br />Butterscotch<br />Cherry<br />Grape

review/summary: Very concentrated, but good!
review/text: I'm not nearly as picky about the variety of flavors so I'm not unhappy about the duplications.<br /><br />When I first bought them, I started with Root Beer, Watermelon, orange oil and cotton candy.  I used too much and wasn't pleased with the flavor results.<br /><br />What I've learned since:  Use a dropper to measure the amount of flavoring!  Use orange oil with only SIX DROPS PER LITRE. It was my error in the beginning that made the products seem bad.  Root Beer in particular is very bitter if you use too much.<br /><br />I purchased these to use with my Soda Stream soda maker and Sweat Leaf Stevia sweetener.  The vials seem small, but they make quite a bit when you use them sparingly.  I now keep a dropper handy for measuring.<br /><br />I'm simply having a ball choosing what flavor of soda I am drinking for the day.

review/summary: List of received flavors
review/text: I'm glad I bought it, but you must know that half (12 of them) were oils. I didn't get any doubles of the non-oil drams, but I got 4 cinnamon, 3 peppermint, 1 spearmint, 1 clove, 1 anise, 1 lemon, and 1 orange in the oil dept. For non oils I got one of the following: Bavarian Creme, Butterscotch, Watermelon (2 actually), Orange Cream, Strawberry, Raspberry, Cran-Raspberry, Bubblegum, Cherry, Grape, and Root Beer.<br /><br />For vaping purposes, non-oils are preffered.  I have not used them yet, but it seems it is possible to use them.  I will probably make flavored toothpics with the oils.  It seems this list is more or less exactly the same as another review FYI.

Packaged in a LorAnn box made pop out for a retail display.<br /><br />Total cost is under $24 shipped - which means less than $1 per bottle.

The product is not sampling of the flavors but appears to be a box of all the flavors they couldn't sell individually. There are so many multiples of flavors I would never use (ie: 4 cinnamon, 3 peppermint, 2 watermelon), this is a complete waste of money.

review/summary: Very good but not earthshattering
review/text: I think a few reviewers have gotten carried away (or maybe they just never had anything but canned before). These beans are a good value and definitely taste better than canned, but they're not going to change your life. The light packaging, long shelf life, and simple preparation make this a good product for camping or emergency supplies.<br /><br />It's not easy to tell from the picture, but the bags are zip-lock type so you can make a portion of the package and reseal the rest. However, the instructions only cover the amount of water appropriate for the whole bag, so you're on your own to measure for a portion. Hint: start conservatively because it's easy enough to add more water later.<br /><br />Overall nutrional values are better than average. I like to mix both cheese and salsa into my beans, but the result is fairly high in total sodium. Sodium level of the bean mix itself isn't too bad, but I wish they added less salt because anybody can easily add salt if desired, but you can't take out what they've already added. Since many people like to add things to their beans anyway, it would be ideal for the beans to start out with as little sodium as possible.

review/text: When I lived in Arizona, I used to buy dehydrated Refried Beans from the bulk section in New Frontiers, and it was great!<br /><br />I'm living in Chicago for the moment, and so I needed to find a good substitute for my New Frontier's refried bean mix.<br /><br />I am writing this review to WARN you that I DID NOT find a good substitute with this product.<br /><br />The consistency is good, thus the 2 stars, but that's about all that's good about it.<br /><br />First of all, the prepared beans have no taste.<br /><br />But the worst part is that Amazon and the product listing don't tell you that one of the ingredients is TBHQ.<br /><br />I only discovered this because I started to have a reaction about a half hour after eating the beans.<br /><br />I got itchy joints, waves of nausea, weak muscles, sleepiness, voracious thirst, cotton mouth...<br /><br />I thought I would find MSG on the side of the package, because those are symptoms I get after eating MSG.<br /><br />But then I saw that the preservative was TBHQ, which I had not heard of before.  I did some research and found out that many people have MSG-similar reactions to TBHQ.<br /><br />This product also contains soybean oil, and I do my best to avoid anything with soy.<br /><br />You may not be sensitive to these ingredients, but I wish someone had written a review mentioning this because if they had, I wouldn't have ordered the product.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 7 more allergy-inducing packages of this stuff.

review/summary: Fantastic Alternative to Canned beans
review/text: Ever since Mexicali Rose went out of business, I've been searching for a similar style bean and this is it. Santa Fe tastes good, has an excellent texture, is low in fat. And it cooks quite quickly!<br /><br />Recommendation - Calls for 2.5 cups of water. Highly recommend going with less, say 1.5 cups to reduce cooking time, especially if you're like me and don't like your beans with a bit richer consistency.<br /><br />I give it four stars as nothing tops the real restaurant (though restaurants vary quite a bit in quality)/home made refried beans.<br /><br />The only other store bought alternative that tastes really good is Ducal refried black beans. It's fantastic, but there's a reason - lard - 17 grams of fat, so there's a sacrifice to make and Santa Fe is an excellent in-between choice and on Amazon, the price is great and it ships via prime to boot, so I can get it quickly when I run out.

They are too salty for my taste (and salt is so easy to add, why not reduce it?) and are not seasoned. The "Southwestern Style" seems to imply seasoning, but no problem, just add some! I saute fresh onion, garlic, a touch of cumin, and sometimes peppers, in a little EVOO, then make the beans in the same pan with sodium free bottled water. Easy and awesome!

review/text: I ordered these refrieds to go along and give variety to the Vegetarian refrieds made by the same company.  My wife and I both found them to  be very salty tasting, and this is explained by the 400 mg of sodium Per Serving (listed on back of the bag), as opposed to the 340mg that was given under the Nutritional Values shown on the web site.  The Santa Fe Fat Free, Vegetarian Refried Beans only have 210mg of sodium per serving and have a great taste....I highly recommend these instead of the Southwestern Style!!  Just add a little green chili or cheese if you want a southwest taste.

review/text: Compared to canned refried beans these are wonderful. Compared to homemade, well, not quite as good, but close. However, I would estimate a minimum of 5 hours to make refried beans from dry pintos when you include the soaking time. These take 5 minutes. 5 minutes vs. 5 hours means an easy 5-star rating. The packaging deserves a very high rating as well. The heavy-duty packages seem to be hermetically sealed. I suspect this gives them a very long shelf life. Once opened, they can be re-sealed. All around a great product.

review/summary: Instant refried beans are great!
review/text: I was dissapointed that my local store no longer sold this company's instant refried beans, but I was happy to find that Amazon.com had them available.<br />I do find it a bit of a challenge to cook the refried beans plain, but they are great as a soup thickener.<br />I make a tortilla soup recipe that calls for a can of refried beans dissolved with broth.  I just add a bit more water or broth and it is easier to dissolve these flakes into the broth than using the canned stuff.<br />Also, the dehydrated packages seem to last longer than the cans.  They also store easier.<br />I think this is a great product.

review/text: I was glad to find these available here online. I was introduced to "instant" refried beans while in New Mexico several years back and have never went back to canned refried beans since. Those original instant refried beans were by Mexicali Rose and they were/are expensive. I found the Santa Fe Bean Co. brand and tried them and they taste better and are cheaper. My wife is of Mexican descent and she makes homemade (now only once in awhile)refried beans and she is very impressed with the taste and quality of this instant variety along with the ease and speed of making them. You can make a little or a lot. I add chopped onion and shredded sharp cheddar cheeze and a dash of Chipotle Tabasco. Once you have tried these, you won't like the canned refrieds.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: We had previously tried the Santa Fe fat-free dehydrated refried beans, and liked them a lot.  So, we decided to give these a try too.  Despite the fact that these are labeled "southwestern style," which sounds like these might contain some spices, this product contains only beans, salt, and partially hydrogenated corn oil.  They are delicious!  The small amount of oil gives them a bit of a creamier texture than the fat-free beans. Of course, partially hydrogenated oil is not the best thing in the world for the old arteries, so the fat-free version is probably a better choice for many people. (see link below)<br /><br />These refried beans taste much better than the canned variety.  One could easily pass them off to unsuspecting guests as being home made.  Next time I make them, however, I will use a bit less water, as I prefer a slightly thicker consistency.<br /><br />One nice thing about this product is that it comes packed in a zip-lock type bag, so it is easy to fix a smaller amount if an entire package is just too much.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FICDO8">Santa Fe Bean Co., Instant Fat Free Vegetarian Refried Beans, 7.25-Ounce Pack (Pack of 8)</a>

review/text: The bags are all zip-lock style, so it is easy to just use what you need to use. Cooking is standard for dehydrated refried beans, and so is the taste. This makes for an excellent base to cook with, add jalapenos, salsa, cheese, whatever, it mixes well. I like to add some diced jalapenos sauteed in olive oil, then add to eggs and potatoes rolled in a burritio. My daughter makes a killer bean dip with this. Basically, this is a great starter for almost any refried bean dish, and you can use just the right amount, reseal the bag and move on.

review/text: Growing up in the southwest refried beans were a staple in our home and anytime we went to my grandmothers house we were always excited to eat a bean burrito on fresh made flour tortillas. Her refried beans were very special with a smooth texture and rich flavor. These beans in the Gold bag are almost just as good without the work. My family loves them and they are so easy to make. Since you cant come to my grandmas house I highly recommend these beans now if we could only get the same quality tortillas we would be set.

review/text: My wife and I have taco night quite often, so we go through a fair amount of canned re-fried beans.  I happened to be browsing through Amazon's food section and came across these so I thought I would give the a try.  I must say that they are just like the ones that you would get at a Mexican restaurant, which I think are great.  At the S&S price, they cost a little less than the ones at the grocery store too, so that's an added bonus.  Try them, you won't regret it.

review/text: These beans taste good and are pretty easy to prepare.  Salt content is too high. The real problem is that the vendor may have become a bit too greedy and raised the price significantly.  At around $16 bucks, they seemed to be an ok deal.  Now that they're nearly $20, I'm not so sure.  I could buy 25 cans of 79 cent refried beans for $20 that don't need reconstituting, have less salt, and work just as well.

review/text: I would never have purchased this product if I had realized that it contains interesterified oil.  From Dr. Weil's website:  "A study published in the January 15, 2007, issue of Nutrition Metabolism found that interesterified fats and trans fats had similar, negative effects. Both increased total cholesterol, raised "bad" LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol and lowered "good" HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. Another negative: the interesterified fat also raised fasting blood glucose by almost 20 percent."  There are plenty of other studies out there, as well.<br /><br />I eat things like refried beans because they are supposed to be healthful.  Interesterfied fats are a sneaky way for manufacturers to avoid saying that their product contains trans fats!  I am so completely disgusted by the fact that I foolishly bought this inedible product.  I would not give it away; it is going right into the trash.  I feel totally ripped off.

Add a little cheese and you won't believe how good they are.  No one will ever know you didn't cook them yourself unless you tell.

review/summary: Nice addition to air-popped popcorn
review/text: I bought this product to use over air-popped popcorn. It is very tasty but not overpoweringly so. The product description here says to lightly spritz the air-popped popcorn with an oil to make this product adhere better. I have not done this yet, but have found that a good deal of the product does not stick to the dry popcorn, so this is likely a good suggestion. This would probably taste good over steamed vegetables, but I have not tried using it for this yet.

I thought that butter topping was supposed to taste like butter but it doesn't. I sprinkled generously and it was salty tasting but not buttery. I think I will use spray butter until my shipment arrives but there are better products out there.

review/text: It doesn't have a butter flavor.<br /><br />It doesn't have much of a salt flavor either.<br /><br />So. It doesn't taste like butter and you need to add salt. The only thing it has going for it is that it is gluten free.<br /><br />The subscribe and save price is good. Better than you can get at the store by quite a bit. I bought my single bottle at the big box store for about 2.78 so if you can get it for less with S&S then it is a good deal price wise.<br /><br />Be sure you buy a single one at the store before you invest in a 6 pack.

review/summary: Not nearly as good as my old brand
review/text: I got this because the store didn't have the brand I normally love and buy (Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning for Popcorn). This had an odd flavor, almost bitter. I maybe tasted a slight hint of butter with it, but nothing like my other seasoning. After one batch I began using my "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Extra Virgin Olive Oil" spray first and sprinkling this powder very lightly on top of that and was more satisfied doing it that way.  I will probably finish up this seasoning, but won't be buying it again.

With this seasoning, I spray the popped corn with tasteless cooking spray OR Kernel Season's popcorn spray, then sprinkle this seasoning. Then I toss and repeat, to ensure all is covered. I love it. It's not overpowering, but I do HIGHLY suggest air popped corn be sprayed with SOME kind of oil spray, or this seasoning won't stick.

review/summary: I Can Believe It's Not Butter (flavored)
review/text: I believe it is generally safe to assume that "butter-flavored" refers to the flavor of butter churned from cow's milk. In Kernel Seasons' case, however, I'm not so sure. Kangaroo milk maybe? Or perhaps howler monkey? How about prairie dog? Whatever animal's butter this product's flavor is based on, you can bet it's not a member of the bovine family. I should know. I still have the unidentifiable taste of it in my mouth, having bought a jar and "flavored" some popcorn with it out of desperation because Safeway was out of my usual "Jolly Time buttery Seasoning," a 12-pack of which I am now about to order to ensure that this never happens again. Thank you.

Bottom line: it's not a bad product, adds a little butter flavor, but it's NOT sodium-free.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack
review/text: These are awesome!  I believe another reviewer made a mistake on the nutrition info.  A serving size is 1oz or 28g and measures out to 17 pieces (each piece is a 1 inch diameter disk).  I could barely hold them all in one hand.  There are 3 servings in a bag.  167 calories, 12g fat, 269mg sodium, 8 gram carbs.  21.7% protein, 11.4% omega-3 and 17.1% omega-6.  They are raw so the bag says to check for mold and bugs and maybe keep in fridge, but they guarentee them for ANY reason.  They are raw, vegan and organic, but I don't follow any of those diets and love them.  Flavor is not too much and you won't have orange fingers when you are done.  They contain sprouted seeds (easier to digest) including flax, sunflower, sesame, and tomato.

review/text: If you've never tried these Flax Snax then you have NO IDEA what you are missing!!!<br /><br />Oh my goodness, these are the absolutely tastiest snacks I have ever had, vegan or otherwise.<br /><br />Since going vegan I have truly missed that cheesy, pepperoni pizza flavor, but not anymore!  Go Raw's living foods selection is phenomenal and these Pizza Flax Snax are their best product. (In my humble opinion.)<br /><br />They have a cute, handy, round shape and taste very much like pepperoni, without the need for all sorts of chemical flavoring ingredients.<br /><br />The benefits of living foods -offered here in these dehydrated, crispy cracker snacks- are well known. There is just no comparing Flax Snax to all of those processed, colorized, irradiated, supermarket snack foods...Flax Snax are packed with natural flavor, great texture and the all important convenience of portability.<br /><br />What an easy, amazing, fresh and yummy addition to my camping/hiking food repertoire!<br /><br />Pizza Flax Snax -- I love them!

review/summary: Pepperoni Pizza Without the Guilt!
review/text: These taste like those mini pizza snacks but with the crunch. This is the best of the Go Raw Flax Snax to me. The spices make it taste like pepperoni and they are addictive. Yes, they are a little high in sodium but I don't think it's excessive compared to other flavored flax crackers out on the market. As far as the prices, flax in general tends to fun high. If you really want to save the bucks, you can try to make these at home with a food dehydrater. The difference is that many of us will not sprout our flax seed prior to making them. Personally, I think these are a good value when compared to something like kale chips which are ridiculously overpriced when it comes to sale price/cost manufacturing.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again and again!

review/text: My Pizza Flax Snax came in the mail today and, I could eat one entire bag by myself.  These are way better than I expected them to be.  If you are craving something salty, but trying to avoid the processed, preservative overkill, GMO-full snacks from your grocery store, then these are the perfect go to snack.  The sodium is a bit high, so one does have to exercise some restraint when eating these.  But they are high in fiber (5 g. per serving), gluten free, wheat free, nut free, organic, gmo free, and raw.

review/text: (Eating them now) The only reason I even thought about buying these is because I'm doing a raw foods detox. These things are rather expensive (to me) and what makes it worse, they're so good you'll easily finish the $6 bag in one sitting. So I had to force myself to save at least half for another day.<br /><br />These are the one of the healthiest tasty "snax" you can consume. So I guess the price is understandable. When my detox is finished, I plan on not eating dairy anymore. So these will definitely please the pizza cravings.<br /><br />I'm relieved to see that I can purchase these on here for only about $4 a bag. I will definitely being buying these regularly...

review/summary: Tasty Pizza Snack Which Can Do with Less Salt
review/text: The variety of raw and organic ingredients used is what prompted me to try this out: whole sprouted organic flax seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, as well as organic natural flavorings. This combination and in this particular form aren't common, even among gourmet health foods. What you'll more likely find are powder mix instead of whole foods where the kernels are nowhere to be seen. If given a choice, I'd rather have my foods in their original form, instead of having them in powder form.<br /><br />I'm also glad that sprouted seeds are used. Unsprouted seeds contain some levels of phytic acid which can interfere with the absorption of calcium, iron and other minerals when taken in sufficient quantity. Soaking and sprouting help to reduce the amount of phytic acid.<br /><br />Taste-wise, these small pizzas are surprising close to real peperoni pizzas. Some careful thought must have been given to the flavorings to make the product as close to the real thing as possible. Unfortunately, that also means that this otherwise healthy snack is also quite salty. So, depending on your salt preference, you either like them or hate them (I happen to like them).<br /><br />Here's a suggestion to the manufacturer: Experiment with reduced sodium level and/or substituting some of the salt used with other spices. Considering that this is supposedly a healthy snack (with a premium price tag), buyers would demand your product to be much more healthier than others.<br /><br />Texture-wise, these small discs are hard and very crunchy. But they aren't so hard that they'll crack your teeth like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MUK2Q0">Go Raw Organic Live Pumpkin Bar</a> and some nuts bars do.  And these tiny pizza discs can be quite addictive. Once you're hooked on it, it's difficult to stop eating. For my first packet, I went through one third of it in a single sitting. And that made me worried about my sodium level. ;)

review/text: I am not a picky snacker (I try to eat only healthy/organic/whole foods snacks). But these taste just awful.  The salt needs to be increased greatly!  I am a low-salt eater (by choice), but even with that, these are just way too low on salt.  The flavoring is very one-dimensional - some more effort needs to be put into making the pizza flavoring have more depth, and character.<br /><br />That said, twice I have "binged" on almost a whole bag (I am trying to finish them off!) and the following morning I have a 2 lb. weight loss.  Weird?  I normally do not eat late at night, but with these I did.  I don't understand it, but I like that there is some compensation for eating such an awful tasting (though somewhat healthy) snack.

review/summary: Flavorful, but difficult to store and use
review/text: I had been using this product to make homemade Nicaraguan chorizo. This product is indeed flavorable and authentic. However, I found that it dries out and hardens before I have the chance to use all of it, even if kept in the plastic bag it's packaged in and then sealed inside a Tupperware container. For this reason, I now order annatto (achiote) powder instead, and add additional flavorings to it, according to a recipe in one of my Nicaraguan cookbooks. I figure I can't get more authentic than to use a cookbook that was published in Nicaragua (not here in the States) and use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for. I can also control the ingredients to avoid unnecessary preservatives and such.
