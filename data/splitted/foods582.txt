review/summary: It's different!
review/text: My family likes Taco Bell and we like this Chipotle Sauce okay. We eat Mexican-ish style dishes quite a bit at home, so it's nice to have a bottled sauce for a little extra kick. I do like the chipotle flavor in this particular sauce, but of course, not everyone has the same tastes. I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening. That makes it convenient for adding just the amount you want. It can be used as a salad dressing, if you like thick dressings... or as a dipping sauce for tortilla chips, or on tacos, burritos, what-have-you.

review/summary: It Tastes Like Spicy Catalina Dressing
review/text: I guess if I had no other taco sauce to flavor up a taco, I'd be okay reaching for this bottle, but it wouldn't be my top choice at all.  As a taco sauce, it tastes too much like Catalina salad dressing, but spicier, which makes me think I might have liked this better, had it been presented to me as a salad dressing instead of a taco sauce.  I don't love it, I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it for my Tex-Mex dining pleasure.

review/summary: Not as spicy as I thought it would be but still very good
review/text: Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce isn't quite as spicy as I thought it would be but it is still creamy and tasty and a little goes a long way.<br /><br />The taste is almost like a barbeque sauce with a bit of spice to it. Weirdly, I liked it with my chicken salad. Instead of putting it on the salad like a dressing, I used it as a dip. It was really good.<br /><br />I also used it with a steak and egg burrito that I made with leftover steak. The creamy texture worked well against the bell pepper that was part of the burrito filling. I also liked it with the baked chicken for another dinner. Like the salad, I used it as a dip rather than drizzling the sauce on it.<br /><br />All in all, it is a simple sauce. Not quite the taste that I expected, but still very good in surprising ways. I will definitely be getting it as an alternative to salad dressing and dip. I wouldn't use it all the time but it is nice to have as an alternate to ketchup or salad dressing.

review/summary: Great flavor and consistency
review/text: Chipotle is one of my favorite flavors, and this Taco Bell Chipotle sauce does not disappoint.  The sauce is more the consistency of mayo rather than the runny hot sauce consistency of other chipotle sauces I've tried, which made it a tad milder, and also helped keep it on the food instead of running off.  Obviously, it goes great on tex-mex food, but I also put it on a whopper and loved it.  How about getting this sauce in the restaurants?

review/summary: Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce
review/text: This is a good, classic chipotle flavor sauce. It has the thickness of a creamy salad dressing and delivers the chipotle flavor. I used it on a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and cheddar cheese and this worked great. I could also see using on burgers, tacos, maybe even as a salad dressing. Taco Bell did a good job with this sauce.

review/text: I used this sauce on some chicken fajitas and quesadillas I made and they were DELICIOUS! I also used it as a dip for some other stuff...it is so yummy! It is a little spicy because of the chipotle but I like spice! It is a good substitute for ketchup too. It isn't too thick but it is very creamy, the consistency of a ranch dressing but the flavor is so much better. I really loved it!

review/text: Pretty versatile sauce, I have used it on tacos obviously, but it is also a good chip dipping sauce and mixed it with ranch dressing and put it on a salad.  It really gave it a BBQ Ranch dressing flavor that became pretty addictive.  It's pretty spicy but not overwhelming and left me with a tart after taste.  I believe it is that same sauce that taco bell uses on their quesadillas.

review/text: I know it's Taco Bell, so it's got to taste like the chain's sauce. But I keep dreaming of the Subway sandwiches' chipotle sauce, which I like better. Taco Bells' has a tangy ketchup hint, that makes it a bit more like Miracle Whip to a Mayo aficionado. Nothing offensive or odd about it and it tastes good.<br /><br />Taco Bells chipotle sauce is great on a sandwich.

review/text: The thing with Taco Bell products is that though they are not really "Mexican" they are always a tasty delight and this no exception.<br />I love the intense Chipotle taste, a hint of Garlic (not over done) just just hot enough to please, and it goes with just about anything.<br />In my opinion it tastes best at room temperature or even warmed up rather than cold "out-of-the fridge" which seems to inhibit the taste somewhat though in my opinion salsas always taste better warm or even hot!<br /><br />This won't disappoint at all and I just loved it!

review/text: I was really interested in trying this product one I saw it.  I usually like the taco bell products that come out at the store.  They make some decent products that are available in the grocery stores.  This one is a new chipolte sauce and Sounded great as a way to spice up your meals.  I added some of this to tacos and also to some hamburgers.  It added a good flavor and a nice change to the meals.  The sauce wasnt as spicy as i would like but overall it tasted good though.  I would recommend if you want a little something different to add to your meals though.

review/text: The additional spices, especially the hickory really add something special to this sauce. As with the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce we've  used this on burgers, sandwiches, and Mexican meals at home. As much as we like the Jalape&ntilde;o, this one tops it because of the awesome hickory note balancing the heat of the Chipotle. Two thumbs up and a big hit with our family.

review/summary: Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce
review/text: A nice change of taste for a Taco.  I put a little sauce in with some canned roast beef, warmed it up and put in  a corn tortilla  just like I would for a taco with ground beef.  It had a delicious taste reminiscent of something I tasted in Mexico years ago.  I love the  smoked pepper chipotle taste but not having to make the sauce.  Much easier to buy this tasty condiment instead.  I bet it would be good with chicken or fish tacos too.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: This flavor of this sauce is very reminiscent of the Taco Bell sauce packets, which I love.  These "creamy" versions take that familiar flavor and add a cream base, which is very similar to salad dressing.  I actually dressed some salad with it and it was pretty amazing!  Unfortunately, the bottle is too small to make that an economical choice, and this is intended instead as a "finishing sauce."  For example, adding it to tacos or burgers for a little extra kick.  If you like spicy food, this will not be enough, but it adds a little heat.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I would buy this over the translucent sauce, but it is very good.  If you like Taco Bell sauce and want something more substantive, I think you will enjoy these creamy sauces.  I've tried the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle, and the former has a more polished flavor, with the latter (this one) just a bit off.  They go best with greens, as they are too heavy when paired with just meat.

review/summary: A bit underwhelmed
review/text: There really wasn't a lot of heat in this one for me, although I do like things hotter than most folks. I don't have Mexican food (or chips) in the house or eat it on regular occasions so I haven't been able to sample try this product out on them. I did try it as a condiment to my ever-so-boring turkey and it was OK, but I prefer the spicy mustards instead. I did try some today in a salad and that was OK, but not one I'd recommend or use again. The product has an oily texture/taste to it, and if I was going to go for something so fatty I think I'd prefer it to be a sour cream base instead of oil base.<br /><br />If you aren't worried about fat and calories and eat a lot of Mexican food products this might suit, but otherwise I'd give it a pass. There's not enough flavor to make it worth the added calories for me.

review/summary: Lacks expected heat and ends up unexciting
review/text: Not a bad sauce but there does seem to be something I cannot quite pinpoint that seems to be missing in spice.  It is unexpectedly mild for a chipotle-based condiment giving the impression that it is a bit dull.  Spice is a matter of taste perhaps but I suspect this will be less than most would expect.  It may solve the problem of disguising leftovers once in a while but it is certainly nothing to get excited about.

review/summary: Processed Taste, Almost All Fat, Too Strong Smoke Taste
review/text: In my personal opinion, this is basically an overly processed fatty salad dressing made from a soybean oil base. I love Mexican food generally and salads, but was put off by the label showing such a high fat content (11 grams for just a couple tablespoons) and also the chemical preservatives listed on the label that I cannot pronounce.  I tasted a wee bit on my finger and was kind of shocked by that strong "natural smoke flavor" and the vinegary, salty and bitter taste on my tongue. I noticed a little chili heat, which I like.  Since I was making homemade tostadas with fresh chopped lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onions, guacamole, pico, sour cream and beans on a corn tortilla, I thought this would be the perfect compliment. All I can say is that for me it is not worth the dietary failings of the product as I don't like the strong smoke taste, even once tossed with alot of fresh ingredients, and it is high in fat and preserved.  I would much rather spice up my fresh guacamole with cayenne/chili and know that the fat I am getting is a more healthful type.  I will not be buying this product.

review/summary: Chipotle Sauce
review/text: I received this product through the Vine program.  As described, this is a creamy chipotle sauce that has a pronounced flavor without being hot.  While a bit high on fat at 11 grams for a serving (two tablespoons), the flavor is strong enough that you can reduce the amount used to control the fat content.<br /><br />This sauce works well for wraps where you do not need a lot of sauce to carry the flavor.  It does not work as well in salads in that the tendency is to use more than a serving portion and that really can drive up the fat content of your salad(although the flavor is good)!<br /><br />Over all, I would recommend this product and only suggest a little self control in the portion size.

review/summary: Makes Good Tuna Salad
review/text: My first thought was that the Taco Bell sauce would be good as a dip.  Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green.  They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.<br /><br />My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna.  This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce.  Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise.  The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce.  I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well.  That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring.  They lose a star on that account.

review/text: Yes, this sauce is not good for you, that's kinda to be expected when Taco Bell is on the label.<br /><br />That said, I've previously been disappointed with Taco Bells jars of taco sauce as they were not even close to being the taco sauce you got at the restaurants, so I wasn't sure if this Chipotle sauce would reflect any actual flavors I taste in the food I get from Taco Bell.<br /><br />I'm happy to report, however, that it does bring on the Taco Bell taste, it actually reminds me very much of the cheesey sauce they use in their Cheesey Bean and Rice burritos, only with a little more spiciness to it.  I was very happy about that, I love that sauce, and I love just a bit of bite to my food too.  Its gone good on the burritos and sandwich wraps I've tried it on, so thus far I'm a fan.<br /><br />Now if they'd only market a squeeze bottle of their fantastic Baja sauce, I'd gain back the 10 lbs I lost last year in about a month!

There is no question that if you like the flavor of Chipotle sauce you will enjoy this. But it is high in calories which I expected and did not mind for you do not need a lot too enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />Yet two tablespoons of this sauce contains 100 calories from fat and a total of 110 calories per serving size. The serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. It taste great just be aware of its high fat content and calories. When serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. And even so, I would get this product again.

review/summary: Adding some spice into my life!
review/text: What a surprise this was! I have a love affair with chipotle sauce, so I was really looking forward to trying out Taco Bell's Chipotle Sauce and I have to say how much I enjoyed it! I tried it on some tacos we made for dinner last night and it really spiced them up! Changed the flavor and really brought out the ground beef we were using, they were so good that hubby asked if we could try it as a sandwich spread for lunch today. So how was that sandwich? As a spread I have to warn you not to add too much for it does make the bread a little soggy if you make your lunch the night before, but it really adds a flavor boost to your food. The flavor is a spicy and very slightly smoked bold chipotle taste. If I was ranking it between Taco Bell sauce packets I would have to say this is ranked between Hot & Fire. If you're a Mild type person then I would personally stay away from this sauce for it was not mild at all.<br /><br />Can't wait to try it on many different things, up next is a chicken salad with corn salsa! Mmm we expect many great things out of our bottle!

review/text: I think the Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is worth getting as it will make your tacos taste completely different.  This sauce has a nice blend of both spicy and creamy tastes.  It wouldn't hurt to try more than one flavor too, as these sauces will make you re-think what a taco should taste like.  I also like how the bottle has a less messy squeeze-top cap.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy Chipotle Sauce is perfectly described in its name. This is a thick sauce with a strong smoky flavor and although it is quite spicy, there is little heat. I first used it to spice up black beans being served as a side dish for tacos. The beans are so bland, they always need something, and this sauce was the perfect addition.<br /><br />The sauce also worked beautifully with falafels - again, just the right amount of spice and it gave the pita bread sandwich stuffed with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and falafel balls a needed jolt. Finally, I used the sauce on a veggie burger and it also worked beautifully there, too. I was pleased with the results each time I used it, and found the sauce very versatile.<br /><br />The only negative is it not low on calories - two tablespoons have 110 calories and 100 of those are fat calories - so I use it sparingly. That said, it is sufficiently spiced so that a little goes a long way.

review/summary: Good for Spicy Sauce
review/text: My husband is a huge Mexican food fan, so I let him try this first. He liked it, said it was spicy, but not too much for him. He liked the flavor, and said it reminded him of the sauce they give with chicken fingers at Zaxby's. He said it would be great on a Taco salad, or even to eat with veggies on a snack tray for a party. So I tried it myself. I don't like spicy/hot foods, and this was not overpoweringly spicy. Just enough. I think it would be a good sauce to mix with a bit of sour cream and cheese for a dip, too. So Taco Bell, we love you. You did it again.

review/summary: My whole family liked this product.
review/text: My whole family liked this product.  It has a smoky chipotle flavor that (when tasted alone) leaves a slight burn on the back of your throat.  We used it on tacos and the sauce gave them a very distinct taste that we all enjoyed (no burn :) ).  My husband is incredibly picky and said he liked it and would eat it again. The Kid thought it would even taste good on a salad.  I'm thinking it might also be good as a marinade.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it the next time you want to add something a bit different to your meal.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: If you are a resident of the American Southwest, you probably would have eaten in a Taco Bell restaurant. It serves Americanized Mexican food - tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc. They are delicious, especially with their small packets of sauces.  I eat there occasionally, but frankly, I don't remember tasting this sauce in the restaurant.  It is thick and creamy, with a hint of chipotle chili pepper, but it is too sour for my taste.  It reminds me of a salad dressing but it doesn't go well with salad.  I don't like it with my tacos or burritos either.  The sauce overpowers the food by masking its favor, instead of enhancing it.  I doubt that I will buy this sauce again.

review/text: On a pure taste basis, this sauce gets 5 stars. (I am not going to address the nutritional aspect. Read the nutritional label and you can see that this is not "clean eating" or health food. But if you want healthy food, you're probably not reaching for something that says Taco Bell, anyway.)<br /><br />I love spicy food, and I found that this sauce has a nice zip to it. For sensitive tongues, it may even be too spicy if too much is used. It's nice and creamy with that smokey chipotle flavor coming through the spice.<br /><br />This sauce works well on tacos, sandwiches (although a bit runny), and nachos or layered taco dips.

review/text: Tasting a dab of this on a fingertip wasn't too pleasing: it felt too rich, too fake, and too underspiced (basically thousand island dressing with a slight aftertaste of chipotle).<br /><br />So I tried adding it to some food, and in most cases I couldn't even tell it was in there - with the exception that my burrito made orange drips on the plate.<br /><br />I'm sure I could get more of a taste profile (and more orange drips) if I added a LOT more of the sauce to my food...but that would boost the calorie count unacceptably. All in all, Taco Bell might do well to change the name from "Bold & Creamy" to "Bland & Fatty."

Naturally, I never did manage to make that particular sandwich, but I did enjoy the entire bottle of sauce on pulled pork sandwiches. The sauce wasn't spicy at all, which was a little disappointing, but had a nice creamy, smoky flavor.<br /><br />I liked this sauce, but I would probably try to find a different, spicier, Chipotle sauce before trying this one again. Though if offered this sauce, I wouldn't turn it down. If you like mild, then this is probably a good sauce for you.

review/summary: Not a Taco Bell fan--but this is good on all sorts of things!
review/text: First, let me say that I am "not" a Taco Bell fan.<br /><br />That said, my review sort of started off with a negative slant.  I wasn't thrilled about trying a product from a restaurant that I didn't care to eat at.<br /><br />The first thing I tried this on was eggs in a breakfast burrito.  Wow--it was good!  Enough spice to pep it up, but not enough to send you running for a glass of milk.  The chipotle flavor really made the burrito special.<br /><br />I tried it on grilled chicken--again, it was just enough to give it some flavor, but not overpowering.<br /><br />The flavors in this are robust, not-too-spicy, smokey...I have since tried it on beef, with the same result.<br /><br />It's been in the house now for 3 days, and has been used more than any other "sauce" in the 'fridge.  I can see it won't last long.  It'd be great on sandwiches, too.<br /><br />So, coming from a non-Taco-Bell person, this Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce is really good!  I will definitely purchase this again.

review/summary: Spicy Complement to  Salads, Eggs & Wraps
review/text: I tried Taco Bell's Chipotle Sauce on a traditional salad, scrambled eggs, and a turkey wrap.  On the salad, the sauce completely dominated because of its spicy flavor.  I wasn't able to distinguish clearly the other ingredients of the salad.  I like spice, but I prefer salads with a more gentle dressing.  I enjoy both creamy and oil/vinegar dressings.  The Taco Bell product is the creamy variety.<br /><br />I tried it on scrambled eggs which gave the eggs an Eggs Ranchero kick.  Not bad if you can take the spice that early in the morning.  I used a little and it went a long way on flavor (and spiciness).  Would I use the sauce on eggs again?  Maybe.<br /><br />The best results occurred when I used the sauce on a turkey wrap.  The wrap contained white meat turkey, iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  Since turkey is rather a bland meat, the Taco Bell dressing put some zing in the sandwich, making it far more enjoyable than a wrap with mayonnaise or mustard.<br /><br />I know many people have sensitive palates when it comes to spice.  For those folks, I would suggest steering clear of this product.  But for those who enjoy spice, I would heartily recommend it.

review/text: According to Wikipedia, chipotle comes from a word that means smoked chilli pepper. It is a smoke dried jalapeno that tends to be brown and shriveled.<br /><br />I enjoyed getting my sample of Taco Bell Bold and Creamy Chipotle sauce.<br /><br />I bring a sandwich to work on most days and the basic meats are generally mild. The sauce added to the sandwich is nice to spice it up.  I tried a small amount of this sauce to my chicken breast and then to my turkey sandwich and found it added a nice taste that was different.<br /><br />I also found this was a pleasant addition to my dinner salad.<br /><br />Where the sauce stood out was when added to a barbeque. I have added it to hamburgers and Italian sauggage patties. In a small amount the taste was delicious. I didn't need pickels or cheese because this taste was totally different and enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend this product.

review/summary: very strong with a powdery taste
review/text: Having tried all of the Taco Bell bottled sauces, I have to say this is my least favorite. The chipotle flavor is very powdery, almost chalky, and the overall taste is extremely strong. You don't have to use much of it, literally 1-2 drops on a taco is all you would need, but I found it unpleasant. The other flavors are smooth and well balanced, but the chipotle flavor just doesn't cut it. The consistency of the sauce is good and it lasts a good long time in the fridge, and the 8-oz bottle goes a lot farther than you think it will.

I asked her if the limeade was labor intensive & she said "not at all." So my question is: Why? ... A suggestion: Just charge the 30 cent difference ...or, even an extra 89 cents is fair if the ingredients cost more ... but the full price is an 'insult' to the customer.<br />The sales clerk apologized & said that "It didn't make sense to her, either!"

I love the creamy texture, and it has just a little "heat" from the chipolte flavoring to be interesting but not too hot.<br /><br />I used this on a home made taco salad, but I also used it as a sauce on a noodle dish I made that was like a south of the border spaghetti - grandchildren like noodles, so we made noodles and taco flavored meat and this sauce with a few veggies thrown in and had a Mexican style noodle dinner that they loved!<br /><br />So I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Great Topping for Chicken
review/text: Creamy and tasty with a nice chipotle flavor.  Not very spicy hot.  In fact, very mild.  Probably best described as tangy.  I wasn't sure how I was going to use this when I got it, but I found the perfect use for it.  It really jazzes up plain baked chicken.  I am not much of a fan of baked chicken, but my family eats it a lot and this sauce turns plain chicken into chipotle chicken.  I imagine that it would go good on tacos too to give them a little extra flavor, although have not tried it yet on tacos.  I know it would be great on chicken tacos; not sure if it would be as good on beef tacos.  I tried this sauce on fish too, but that would be a thumbs down for me.  Not a good compliment for fish.  This sauce is something different if you are tired of salsa all the time on your tacos.  If you like chipotle flavor, you'll no doubt like this.  Certainly not a "bold" flavor; just a nice, mild, tasty and very creamy sauce.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this sauce, but if you are looking for something really spicy, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Heavy on Smoke and Vinegar
review/text: The smokey flavor and vinegar come through strongly and really give it tang, but with no tomato it's kind of a hollow, thin flavor that hints at BBQ but doesn't really deliver or stay with you. It's not particulary hot either.<br /><br />I tried it on hard and soft shell tacos, as well as on pork and chicken cutlets. It works best on simply seasoned meat - just salt and pepper - where it's not competing with other strong flavors.<br /><br />The texture is like a thick salad dressing and it's marketed as a finishing sauce for tacos and Mexican salads. It doesn't spread or mix as well as a Thousand Island or Russian  dressing so I wouldn't use it for salads that are mostly lettuce.<br /><br />It would probably make an interesting Reuben sandwich.

Advertised as chipotle sauce, you would think it would be quite spicy. The flavor is strong enough to hold up when I used it for sauce on the boneless skinless chicken I was cooking. Really did make a good tasty sauce!  Also put on hamburgers after they were cooked..just not very good at all.  Maybe if you mixed it in yr ground beef before cooking, it would really enhance yr burgers w/that bacony smokiness..I will try that next, enjoy!

Their comments ranged from "Too smoky", "Tastes like French dressing that went bad" to "It leaves an aftertaste". I was quite surprised by their responses. In order to fairly evaluate the product, I added it to my own turkey and cheese sandwich wrap. (It is not a low-cal condiment.) I'm sorry to say...I agree wholeheartedly with the boys. Perhaps this product is better suited for just tacos and not sandwiches or salads. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this product.

review/text: Taco Bell isn't exactly the pinnacle of flavor, and I didn't have high hopes over the potential flavor this sauce was going to deliver, but WOW, it is actually delicious, adding another dimension to already good food!<br /><br />It has some heat to it, but not excessively, still in the "mild" range, but with subtle smoky overtones, completely appropriate for a chipotle sauce.  We sampled it on seasoned shredded meat (pork & beef) soft tacos with angel hair cabbage, sour cream, and cheese.  The tacos were well flavored with mild heat on their own...adding this sauce actually kicked them up a notch from good to WOW.<br /><br />On a lark, we tried a flour tortilla with raw shredded cabbage inside, about the blandest imaginable "wrap", and added a few drops of this sauce.  Even that tasted great!<br /><br />We've sampled several flavors of the bold & creamy line, and this one is by far the best flavor.  Whether its tacos, burritos, flautas, or even a plain jane burger...this sauce rises to the challenge.  I highly recommend it!

You people are just too embarrassed to admit it.  :)  Well, as a former college student, I have learned to love Taco Bell, mostly for their cheapy "Mexican" food.  But it turns out they can make some nummy sauces, too!  We had this on burritos (homemade!) the other night, and it really tastes good!  And looking at the nutrition info explains it all.  Two tablespoons has 11 grams of fat and 300 milligrams of sodium.  And somehow 4% of the daily value for vitamin A snuck in there.<br /><br />This has a little bit of a bite, but it's not spicy.  There is a good smoked chipotle flavor to it.  I really like it and would buy more.  But in the interest of my blood pressure, maybe not all the time.

review/summary: Creamy but not bold
review/text: I was sent one bottle of Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce to review for the Amazon Vine Program. Here's my take on it:<br /><br />Listed as a "Home Originals" bold and creamy chipotle sauce for use on tacos, Mexican salads, and sandwich wraps or as a dip, I first tried it out on Doritos, then on a taco. It's creamy, more a cross between mayonnaise and sour cream, but I'd hardly call it bold. Yes, there's a slight chipotle taste and a bit of bite, but otherwise, it's pretty bland. I'm, no doubt, prejudiced, because I regularly make my own chipotle crema sauce which is extraordinarily good and easy. So, I was expecting a sauce with a bit more chipotle taste. The inclusion of buttermilk in the sauce imparts a slight cheese taste, not a good thing, and it's not at all smoky as chipotle should be. Also, it has a very bright color that seems enhanced.<br /><br />If you're a reader of labels, know that each two tablespoon serving contains 110 calories, 11g total fat, 1.5g saturated fat, and 300mg sodium.<br /><br />I was happy to try this sauce but will probably stick with my home made version which is decidedly more flavorful and robust.

review/summary: Add a Smoky Zest to Your Food
review/text: I used this on tacos and quesadillas. Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce added a smoky, zesty flavor to both while not being too hot. It has a richer, more decadent flavor than salsa with more calories, but what the heck! I'm a firm believer in splurging every once in while.<br /><br />If you want to live a little bit, try this sauce and put a little zing in your life.

review/summary: A sauce that is easy to like.
review/text: The most distinctive qualities of this sauce are its rich orange color and creaminess. The sauce has a slight hot flavor, and a smokey flavor.  The hotness is provided by that most famous of spicey molecules, "capsaicin."  Capsaicin is what makes peppers naturally not.  At any rate, the good folks in Iowa who work tirelessly to put corn and pork on the table, might consider this sauce to be adventuresome or "out there."  However, folks from the San Francisco Bay area, where practically every block contains a Thai restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, or a Korean restaurant, will find this sauce to be bland or tame.  The most subtle feature of this sauce are the little red specks and green specks that are suspended in the orange creamy stuff.  I urge every person who (by habit, choice, or necessity) uses canned beans as a frequent component of their diet, to try the TACO BELL CHIPOTLE SAUCE on the beans.  Once you do this, you will likely view canned beans in a new light, and a more positive light.  To summarize, the CHIPOTLE SAUCE has a hot flavor and also a smokey flavor, which makes it a more interesting product than Taco Bell's JALAPENO SAUCE, which really only has a hot flavor, and not much of any other flavor.

review/summary: a Nice Change of Pace
review/text: The Taco Bell chipolte sauce provides a nice change of pace from the usual mayo and sandwich spreads.  It is pleasant on tacos and adds a little tang to otherwise undoctored mac and cheese.  There is the characteristic smokey chipolte warmth but I would not describe the flavor as either bold or creamy.  However there is some  flavor which distinguishes it from the usual dumbed down cuisine.  The sauce has a somewhat runny salad dressing consistency and care should be taken lest you douse your food with it.  It also has an odd light orange color. It tastes like weak ranch dressing with chipoltes added.<br /><br />This sauce adds a little verve to routine dishes.  It is unlikely to please a sophisticated palate or anyone who really enjoys the heat. If you are looking for something to add a little flair without upsetting the apple cart,you can't go wrongwith this sauce.

review/summary: Taco Bell at home!
review/text: The best reason to buy this is because you've had it at Taco Bell and loved it.  Obviously, since it's from a fast food restaurant, it's hard to take this product too seriously, or analyze it too much.<br /><br />Of course, all the chipotle sauce or chipotle-inflected salsa I've had tends to be BROWN, but this stuff is ORANGE. It might be more like outer-space chipotle paste!<br /><br />It's fatty, with a milky mild mayo-ish texture and mouthfeel, and with just a hint of signature chipotle spicyness.  This is not the extra kickin hot sauce and isn't meant to be.  It is, however, a quick alternative to add to your tacos, burritos, beans and rice or even a chicken sandwich, when you are weary of the same-ol' same ol'.  Just don't add too much, as 11g of fat in 2 tbsp is a lot for a topping.

review/text: If you a fan of sour cream like myself, This product puts a welcome spin on bold taste. It's likes sour cream with a chipotle kick! It goes great with tacos of course and even Burgers for a little south of the border flair. Feeling adventurous one day, I tried it out on a grilled chicken recipe, complete with spanish rice and bell peppers! Can you say YUUUUUUUUUUM! My pantry now has at least two bottles of this at all times. What are you waiting for?

review/summary: Hot Sauce Meets Salad Dressing
review/text: This creamy sauce is pretty good. Is it a culinary masterpiece? No, but as with most things at the grocery that come in a plastic bottle, it's good enough for the day-to-day meal. This chipotle sauce has a lot of flavor. It's got a decent amount of heat, but the creamy factor keeps it in check. It has a noticeable garlic taste, but the chipotle is more noticeable.<br /><br />I've tried this sauce on just about everything, and it has been a nice change of pace. Naturally, this sauce spices up Mexican dishes nicely, especially ones with lots of fresh tomatoes. However, I have also enjoyed it on hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and chicken. The best way I can describe this item is "spicy salad dressing." If you like to dump creamy salad dressing on random foods, which I do, then this sauce will add some fun to your dinners. And caloriewise, it's about what you'd expect from creamy dressing, 110 calories per 2 tablespoons.

review/summary: Didn't work for me
review/text: My husband's thoughts on this sauce: "Too strong without enough sweet, pungent with a fake aftertaste. Don't need to buy it for me again." He likes chipotle flavors more than I do so I wanted to share his opinion. I tried the sauce with some refried beans and didn't find it as unpalatable as he did. It tasted like bottled chipotle sauce, rather fast food like, a little bit of a fake taste to it, but not overwhelmingly so. And when used with other strong flavors it would be strong enough to be an accent. It is definitely not low in fat so be aware of that. It has a small kick but not much, fine for almost any but the wimpiest heat levels.

review/summary: Lava sauce on the go!
review/text: A rich, creamy sauce that goes well with near anything.<br /><br /> I've used it in avocado-chicken salads, tacos, burgers, just about everything. It might be just a tad too strong for some people, but it doesn't have very much heat otherwise, think Medium on the scale of flame.<br /><br />I personally always ask for a scoop of lava sauce at taco bell, and I usually order off of their Volcano menu, and to me, this is God's second gift to mankind. A great tasting, smooth sauce that is a great alternate condiment for the spicy lovers in the house. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Really good!  Much better than I expected
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by Taco Bell's Ranchero sauce, so decided on a whim to give this a shot.  Lo and behold, we all liked this sauce even better.  It works better as a dipping sauce than does the Ranchero, and was really good with some quesadillas we prepared.  It also has the smokiness which I would expect from some with "Chipotle" in the name, and enhances a chicken taco without overwhelming anything.<br /><br />If you are looking for raw heat, this isn't going to do the job for you.  Our heat-crazed teenager simply mixes in one of his pepper-extract sauces and that appears to make him happy.  I was actually expecting this to be a bit more hot than it was, but it would appear that Taco Bell is trying to keep the boldness, as it were, under some control.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  I liked the Ranchero sauce enough, but didn't see it becoming a staple in our house.  However, I can see myself replacing the increasingly empty bottle of the Chipotle sauce.  Well done.

review/summary: Well, they got half of it right ...
review/text: The makers of Taco Bell Home Originals Bold and Creamy Chiptole Sauce did get the "creamy" part right - though there is no cream anywhere to be found in this bottle, just copious amounts of soybean oil.  This is why this sauce has a whopping 110 calories per 2 tablespoon serving, on par with most regular salad dressings.<br /><br />Unfortunately (or more unfortunately) the "bold" part of the name is an extreme misrepresentation.  Oh, there is some chipotle puree way down on the ingredient list (listed under the label "contains less than 2% of"), but it only lends a hint of chipotle flavor to the sauce.  It's more akin to mayonnaise with a few dashes of pepper added than to a real chipotle sauce - nothing "bold" here at all.<br /><br />As it does have a somewhat pleasant (though overwhelmingly bland) taste, I'll give this Taco Bell sauce a bit of credit.  But I suspect that it would be much better and healthier with a bit less oil and a lot more kick.<br /><br />Note - since people have varying responses to spicy foods, I'll let you know that when I'm at a Taco Bell the "Fire" sauce is my usual choice, and I consider "Medium" and "Mild" to be about as spicy as ketchup.  Perhaps those more sensitive than I to spicy heat will have a better opinion of this sauce than I do.

review/summary: Creamy, not too spicy, versatile
review/text: I love anything chipotle, and this did not disappoint! The Taco Bell Chipotle sauce is a salad-dressing-creamy type sauce.<br /><br />With leftover taco meat, we made taco salads. This made a delicious dressing! Just the right amount of spicy without real heat. Even though it essentially has a salad-dressing base, it poured and tasted like a creamy sauce. Mixed with a little Ranch dressing it would make a nice Chipotle Ranch salad dressing.<br /><br />This would make a tasty dipper for chicken, on burgers, fried mushrooms, you name it! I sent it on a wrap sandwich for my husband's lunch as well.<br /><br />Nutrition info: It does have sugar and maltodextrin listed in the ingredients, and 2 T. is the serving size. If you are watching your fat, 2 T. will set you back 11 grams. It will also count as 3 carbs, 1 of which is from sugar.<br /><br />This is tasty enough that I would definitely buy it.

review/summary: Passable Utili-Sauce
review/text: I tried the sister product, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98">Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce</a> in August, and wrote a review for it.  Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.<br /><br />As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's "sauce," which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its "bold," the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as "bold."  Now, the taste of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN40">Cheez-It Hot & Spicy</a>; they got "bold" with that one.<br /><br />The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with "tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps."  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.<br /><br />The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.<br /><br />The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.<br /><br />The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.<br /><br />This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.<br /><br />Bottom line: "Creamy" this sauce is, but "bold" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American "bold" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Sriracha</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZHPFI">Crystal</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFRJSA">Cholula</a>, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

review/summary: Decent flavor for a quick fix
review/text: I am typically a huge fan of all things chipotle - the smoky heat, the warm, earthy flavor - I use the spice in a lot of my cooking.  I thought Taco Bell's Bold and Creamy Chipotle would be an easy, ready-made way to enjoy that flavor.<br />I've tried the sauce on salad and in burritos thus far.  The heat is there, and you do get the chipotle flavor, but along with it is a distinctly fake/preservative-ridden taste that I found unappealing.  In the salad especially, without many other strong flavors to mask it, that artificial taste was particularly offputting.  In the burrito, it blended in better with the beans and rice and left more of the heat/smokiness.<br />Two tablespoons leaves you with 110 calories and a whopping 11 grams of fat.<br />For a quick chipotle fix, this is just OK. I'll be sticking with my own spices.

review/summary: Great flavor - not the healthiest option
review/text: This Taco Bell Chipotle sauce is quite tasty. I tried it in homemade burritos, and it was a great-tasting addition. It's a creamy sauce with just the right amount of spicy kick. It also works well just as a dip for tortilla chips.<br /><br />The downside - as with most creamy dressing-type condiments - is the amount of fat content. Two tablespoons of this sauce contain 110 calories, 100 of which are from fat. There are eleven grams of fat in each serving. A shot or two of this sauce once in awhile is fine. But the way some folks like to liberally douse their salads with dressing, this isn't the best choice for that kind of thing.<br /><br />But in moderation, this sauce is a great way to dress up your Mexican-style cooking. The flavor is distinct without being overpowering.

review/summary: Not JUST LIKE Taco Bell but Still Really Good
review/text: Let me be upfront and say, the products marketed by Brand Name restaurants (ie Taco Bell, O'Charley's) never taste exactly the same as they do when dining in.  I don't know if that's just me or maybe it's because the food prepared isn't identical to theirs or whatever.<br /><br />That said - the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRKEH4">Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce</a> may not taste exactly as it does on Taco Bell's food items but it's still very, very good.<br /><br />Whether it's a splash on a taco or globbed onto a turkey sandwich in place of mayonnaise or drizzled atop a salad, this Chipotle sauce offers a real kick and livens up an otherwise boring dish.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, it's fattening.  But does anything that taste good not have lots of calories?<br /><br />There are so many uses for Chipotle sauce and Taco Bell's is definitely one of the top tasting brands on the market.  It may not be JUST LIKE Taco Bell's in-store sauce, but it's good nonetheless so if you like Chipotle, this one you want to give a try.

review/summary: Best taco sauce I ever had.
review/text: 5 stars out of 5!<br /><br />To me this is the king of kings in Taco Sauce land. So grab your royal scepter, place thyn crown upon thou cranium, sit in thyn gold plated and jewel encrusted throne, for tonight my friends, you dine with the best.<br /><br />I love this taco sauce, and have been addicted to it for about a year now. Though it isn't for everyone, of my family I am the only one who really likes this stuff, everyone else is like "meh" or "it was ok".<br /><br />It gives a slightly smokey bbq like flavor to the taco, with a little spicy hit. Not terribly spicy, though I am the kind of guy who is very used to hot sauces, I go through a LOT of Tabasco sauce each year. I can literally drink a whole bottle of tabasco if I wanted *though I don't because I know the next morning I will be extremely sorry I did*. Though I don't buy this sauce to make my taco "hotter" rather I buy it because I love the flavor. The only con I can find, is I wish it were a little cheaper, and in a much larger bottle. I would be extremely happy if it was in ketchup sized bottles for say 5 bucks each. I go through a lot of this stuff.<br /><br />I should also note here that the other 2 flavors in this line of sauce *Spicy ranch and Jalapeno" are not nearly as good. Jalapeno I can enjoy on hotdogs, but the ranch flavor isn't good on anything in my opinion.<br /><br />I prefer this chipotle sauce in soft shell tacos, and until I find something I like better, I'll keep buying this stuff. I will say that Eric Cartman has the right idea, could use some Choptle-away from Billy Mays. Overdoing it with this sauce can cause some painful bathroom visits, usually in the morning functioning as your own natural alarm clock. And I should also note that the smell coming out is horrendous pending on how much you had. The smell is soo bad even from your flatulence I could see it ending marriages, so guys always check your wife or girl friend agro meters before daring to partake of this forbidden but illustrious and decadent delicacy!<br /><br />Why would anyone eat something that does this to them, Kyle might ask..... but in the words of Cartman who said it best..<br /><br />"Dude. Have you had chipotle? It's really good."

review/summary: You've definitely had bolder chipotle sauce, but this will do in a pinch and makes a decent substitute for ketchup, mayo, etc.
review/text: Bit late to the party with this review, but I wanted to wait until I'd finished the bottle to offer a little praise. This is all-around decent sauce with just the right amount of bite to it. Were I given this in a restaurant, I'd likely complain that it was far too mild for my tastes, but for home use, where people of varying palettes are likely to use it, I prefer these kinds of squeeze sauces dialed down just a touch, so I can use them in a variety of dishes and they won't overpower. I used this in chicken wraps, on hard-shell tacos (of course!), as a substitute for ketchup in and on just about everything (including cheeseburgers AND french fries!) and even as a salad dressing on a basic garden salad, and it added just the right kick to all of them. Not the hard kick you'd get from something more legitimate or hand-crafted, but a nice kick nonetheless. It's pretty thick to use as salad dressing, actually, but you'll figure it out. I'm guessing it would also sub nicely for mayo on sandwiches and the like. The bottle resided in my fridge for a few months at least, and never went off. Not sure if that's a good sign--I've had dressings and sauces go bad in a much shorter period--but as I don't sauce things up on a regular basis, it was good to meet a bottle that actually kept for a while.

I think you could safely give this to a five year old without fear of burning anything.<br /><br />it's not bad, makes a decent dipping sauce for chicken nuggets but don't expect any real "zing" to your cooking with this<br /><br />I'll admit my wife took one sniff and declined but she hates *anything* even vaguely hot and while this is not very hot at all, you do get a hint of spice in it.<br /><br />With green peppers a "1" and Habaneros a "10", this is about a "1.1" on the heat sscale.  It's not bad but it's not great and if you expect real spice and heat, try elsewhere on Amazon.<br /><br />(May I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EPZO">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce 5oz.</a> for a real Chipotle experience?)<br /><br />Or if you want to go full gonzo: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M0ETJ6">HOT SAUCE FROM HELL, DEVIL'S REVENGE, HABANERO, from Ass Kickin'</a>

review/text: This is a great sauce to use on sandwiches to give them a little extra kick.  Love it with grilled chicken, lettuce, and tomato.  I would thin it a bit to use on a salad, but it's just right with a sandwich.  Could get creative with it.  Meatloaf, maybe?

review/text: I admit I don't often visit Taco Bell. However, I have enjoyed their bean burritos in the past, as I am a vegetarian and I appreciate that they offer several items on the value menu that I can eat. I like this sauce, and it's good on a veggie burger. I think it might work well with roasted vegetables, as a vegetable dip, but I haven't tried that just yet. Tasty!

review/summary: A little too sweet, but still comestible
review/text: These Taco Bell condiments are pretty good, considering what they are: more-or-less standard, corn syrup-sweetened and preservative-laden sauces that go down easy - not too spicy for most folks, and a tad on the sweet side. Not nearly spicy enough and a bit too sweet for me, though. (However, I will admit to dipping cold grilled chicken in this stuff, and eating it rather gleefully...)

review/summary: This is actually quite good.
review/text: First off let me say that I lovvvvvveeee Taco Bell.  To find there sauce now on the grocery counter is a major plus in my book and a smart move on their part.  Bottled comfort food is always a plus.<br /><br />This has a nice smokey chipotle flavor without being over done.  It's not too hot which is wonderful but gives you that right amount of zest to whatever Mexican dish you decide to use it with.  Personally I found it wonderful as a salad dressing.  I have also used this with some pulled chicken for sandwiches and OMG it is awesome.  Better than barbecue sauce.<br /><br />Taco Bell has given us a rich creamy sauce with delicious smokey flavor that's not too much and not too little.  Got a hankering for Taco Bell then just pull up some of this sauce and whatever you have in leftover in the frig.

review/text: I love chipotle flavoring...normally. I've had some Chipotle Ranch sauce that was good and so I thought this might be worth a try. My family did not care for it. It didn't taste like real chipotle but I guess I shouldn't be surprised because Taco Bell isn't real mexican food (to me). I wouldn't recommend this if you are at true chipotle lover

review/summary: Good to add to chicken quesadillas
review/text: I've never had chipotle sauce before, so I don't have much to compare it to.  I got this sauce so that I could add it to my homemade chicken quesadillas and add a unique flavor.  Before I close up the tortilla while on the stove, I add a little of this chipotle sauce to add some spicy flavor to the dish.  It's not my favorite flavor and it doesn't really come close to whatever sauce Taco Bell puts in their own chicken quesadillas, but it's good to add now and then to add some variety to my meals.<br /><br />I'd say if you're a fan of Taco Bell's other chipotle-flavored items, you will probably like this.

A nice ranch substitute if you like spicier food.

review/text: So my husband enjoyed this sauce and added it to things that he wanted a little kick to.  It is tasty but not spicy.  The sauce has a little kick and was something hubby would use when he just wanted to add a little flavor but not too much spice.  He actually liked it as a salad dressing to change up the usual rotation.  All in all the ingredients are not too bad but not what we typically eat.  If you want a creamy sause to add some flavor to a bland dish, this would certainly do the job.

review/summary: OK, but Not Exceptional
review/text: I was expecting this to be a bit spicier than it is.  I won't go as far as saying it's bland, but it tastes a bit like a spicy ranch dressing.  The bottle describes it as being bold and creamy; creamy yes, but bold... not so much.  Nonetheless, it's a refreshingly unique taste and I found myself using it on a variety of foods.  And not necessarily only Mexican.  In addition to the traditional uses on Mexican dishes, I used it in lieu of mustard on meatloaf sandwiches as well as ham sandwiches.  The Chipotle Sauce added a different and pleasing taste to each.

review/summary: Not Just For Tacos
review/text: I decided to try this product, not because of the Taco Bell brand, but because I like chipotle flavor. Quite honestly, I'm not a real fan of these type of branded product.<br /><br />The sauce has a little bit of bite, what I consider mild. But it may be a little too strong for children. Different from many chipotle sauces, Taco Bell's has a stronger tomato flavor. It is very true to the chipotle sauce used in their products.<br /><br />I didn't really care to have this sauce on my tacos or burritos. It does make an interesting seasoning for tamale and enchilada casseroles. I also added a little mayonnaise and made salad dressing. Others may like the sauce on a salad undiluted.<br /><br />While this isn't going to a standard in my kitchen, I will purchase it for special meals.

review/text: OK, so I'm no connoisseur of Chipotle sauces, but this tasted OK to me.  Creamy and fairly spicy for a commercial sauce.  I actually liked it, to my surprise.  Better than I expected.  Terribly unhealthy ingredients, though, if that matters to you.  A small serving has 110 calories of which 100 come from fat.  Yikes!  Still this is just a sauce, so I don't consider that too big deal, but mention it for those who might.<br /><br />Bottom line, yes, this is good on chicken and adds a nice smoky, spicy flavor which is what you want.

review/summary: Yummy - Expires too Soon
review/text: The sauce was great. I enjoyed it with some tacos and later with some frozen taquitos.  Both were improved by adding this sauce -- pretty generously, since it was so good.<br /><br />I didn't think it was spicy -- so if you're looking for a kick, look elsewhere.  It was a great taste, just no kick.<br /><br />My disappointment -- the drop in a star -- is that the product expired within just a few weeks of getting it.  Maybe it sat on the shelf for a while, I don't know, but I was a little bummed to throw out half of the bottle because it expired.<br /><br />So, I would be concerned if I were purchasing 6 of these (as a pack).  Do they ship with only a few weeks left?  I hope my situation was an anomaly, and others can comment on what their expiration dates were.

review/summary: Easily my favorite of the bunch
review/text: Of all the new Taco Bell sauces currently available, this one is easily the best and stands head and shoulders above the rest of the pack in terms of flavor.<br /><br />For those not familiar with these new sauces, they are significantly different than the standard packet hot sauces served in the actual Taco Bell restaurant, going for a creamy and smooth flavor rather than adding heat. In comparison to the other varieties available, the Chipotle version isn't as mild as the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce and doesn't have the overly tangy, almost bitter flavor of the Spicy Ranchero.<br /><br />It works great for things like home made tacos or even for dipping fries, but can also shine in more adventurous dishes.  I used it with surf and turf burritos made with steak and cilantro-lime shrimp, and it definitely added a fantastic finishing flavor.

We eat a fair amount of "Tex-Mex" at our house, and the fridge is typically full of sauces of various types.  This one was spicy -- but not overpowering, and had a really nice flavor.<br /><br />This one will be a repeat purchase.

review/text: When I saw the name Taco Bell on this product, I wasn't expecting much. I don't dislike their food, but I find their seasonings rather bland and ordinary. One taste of this sauce changed my mind completely. Why don't they serve stuff like this in the Taco Bell restaurants? This snappy, creamy sauce is so good I found myself putting it on and in all sorts of things. I even started mixing it with mayo in my chicken and tuna salad. It goes great on all meats, especially chicken and hamburger. I've also added it to the lettuce and tomato I've put in sandwiches just to see how it tastes, and it was a hit. Hats off to Taco Bell for coming out with such a tasty product. Chipotle has really gained in popularity over the past few years, and this is a welcome addition to the product mix.

review/summary: Could taste the chipotle
review/text: I received this right before I left town for a week.  While I was away, my kids decided this looked great, so they had it with tacos one night.  They all (ages 10-14) reported that it was great... a different flavor than the salsa they are used to.  But that was about all they could tell me.<br /><br />This evening, I made up something fajita-ish for dinner for most of the family.  There was still some of the bottle left, so most of the kids used a little with that.  Since I was home, I was able to pull out a bit more information from them.  My non-spicy food kid said that this was maybe a little too spicy, but it was a different spicy.  My "can't get it hot enough" kids said that this isn't very spicy, but they like the flavor.<br /><br />I had a mexi-salad, and used this as salad dressing.  It was really quite good that way.  I loved it with the garden-fresh tomatoes especially.  It is thicker than a traditional dressing, but I just made an effort to toss it all together a bit.<br /><br />I could taste the chipotle in the sauce.  I think it would be excellent in scrambled eggs when I'm throwing in mexican-type veggies (peppers, tomatoes).  This is something I will purchase again.

review/summary: Smokin' Sauce
review/text: I'm not a big fan of Taco Bell since their food all taste the same but I was pleasantly surprised by these new sauces.  The Chipotle sauce has a very bold smoky flavor and it goes well with any kind of meat and I would imagine it would top chili quite well, too.  It adds a nice zing to a dip.  I find these sauces quite versatile.  I've even put them on salads.  It's less hot than the Jalapeno sauce but has deeper undertones of flavor, more Mexican.  It must be the cumin.  So ditch those wimpy taco sauces and try the new sauces from Taco Bell.
