review/summary: Perfect Tea (even for those who don't like tea)
review/text: I love the blend of spices & cinnamon and the fact it's organic makes it perfect! I never liked tea before I got this stuff! In my larger than a cup stainless steel mug I add one tablespoon organic honey and then 2-3 tablespoons organic agave nectar (low glycemic index and tastes just like sugar!) and just a splash of organic whole milk. There is obviously caffeine in this stuff so I wouldn't have it after 2pm..it's great in the morning!

review/summary: Good tea, but high priced for small amount
review/text: This tea has a very good taste, however the cost seems very high for the small amount in the container. I purchased this after a Mexico vacation where I had Twining's 'Voage' Indian Chia from teabags. I could not find thr Twining's product so I tried this, hoping it would be even more flavorful. It is about equal to the Twining's, in my opinion, and the cost was significantly more. I don't feel this product is worth the money, however you may disagree especially if you have never had the Twining's 'Voyage' product as it does not seem to be available in the US.

I had to add loose black tea from my stock to balance the flavor, which I've never had to do before.  Ah well, maybe the next tin will be better.

review/summary: A true Chai Experience
review/text: I'm a fan of many teas, and I drink most straight.  I was a big fan of Two Leaves and a Bud's Chai, but their quality seemed to take an unfortunate turn as of late (their customer service was excellent however and sent me a replacement box of their Tamayokucha).  For anyone looking for the full array of traditional spices that chai has to offer, this blend has them all.  The cardamom pods, whole clove, cinnamon and ginger are all very fresh and aromatic make for a fragrant and spicy brew, but it is not too overpowering to enjoy plain and balances well with the tea component.  I have not tried repeated steepings so I cannot comment on them, but this is my new go to chai, and is definitely something I drink once a day at the least.  The Rishi silver needle white tea was also a good bargain for fans of white teas<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1W8">Rishi Tea Organic Silver Needle Loose Tea, 1.4-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/text: Great product! It has ruined coffee shop chai for me (too much sweet and not enough spice), this is the real deal. I like a lot of cardamom and cloves, so I sometimes supplement the mix a bit, but it's good as it is when prepared according to the directions.<br /><br />I admit that when I ordered this item I wasn't aware that it required stove-top cooking rather than just a simple brew plus milk, but the result is well worth the effort! I now make it in a big batch and it keeps well for a few days (in the fridge).

review/text: The reviews sounded so promising that I really looked forward to enjoying this.  The package arrived, I tore it open and immediately brewed up a small pot.  Not much aroma, but still, what with that pretty package and all those colorful spices in the blend, it must be good, right?  I picked up the cup, looking forward to a pleasant cup of real chai and to the joy of a new discovery and WOW! It was FLAVORLESS - I mean below tea-bag quality, below sweepings - no flavor to speak of at all!  Thinking/hoping there must be something wrong, I opened the second can - just as flavorless.  I won't bother opening the third.  What a disappointment.<br /><br />My rating:  If I could, I'd give the package five stars - it really is special - but it was the tea I was buying and the batch I got is not drinkable.  I wish I knew how to return it.

review/summary: Chaiwala
review/text: This tea (chai) does not taste anything close to real Indian masala cha. It is more like milky, weak tea with some funny flavor. This is very different from the aromatic tea you can make from loose Indian tea and fresh ginger. It is a mixer of little weak tea powder thrown in with whole black pepper, whole cardamom and other whole things.<br />After boiling, you end up throwing all these good-looking whole masalas without getting much out of them. The proper thing would have been to make a "masala" powder out of these whole things to get some aroma in your chai.<br />If you have ever tried an authentic masala chai, not the hyped type you get in some fancy stores, you know what I mean. I won't buy it again. It is all packing and no substance.

review/text: I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :). 1000-count and 2000-count boxes are available.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time.

I would not buy it again at this price because it is not worth it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FWXLQC">Earthy Delights Crema Di Balsamico,Balsamic Cream, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: night and day difference
review/text: I breastfed my daughter for her first month of life, but she had severe problems with gas, bloating, and constipation.  We switched to a milk based formula, but the problem continued.  We then tried lactose free formula.  The problem lessened, but did not cease.  By her second bottle of Alimentum, she was using the bathroom without stimulation, her stomach was no longer hard and bloated, and she actually lays around smiling (without needing to be constantly held).  This was important as I have 3 other children.  My only regret is that she was 2 months old before we figured out how to keep her little tummy from hurting.

review/summary: Sanity saver!
review/text: My daughter has severe reflux.  We tried 4 different formulas, in combination with zantac and cereal in the bottle.  Nothing seemed to help the situation.  This specific formula is basically used as a last resort by doctors. This product labeling states that within 24 hours, you will normally see an improvement in the child.  Well let me tell you, within 2 feedings, which in my daughter's case is 6 hours, it was like I had a whole new baby.  My daughter went from miserable to happy in the blink of an eye.  I, like the other reviewer, just wish we could have figured this out before she was 2 months old.

review/summary: Good Product Can Be Better...
review/text: This product (South Beach Whole Wheat Wraps) is a good & healthy alternative to lot of other snack/food options.<br /><br />Having used this product for more than 1 year, it can safely be asserted that product is delivered as stated in the advertisement. However, it receives only 4 stars because sometimes the product quality is not consistent. Commonly every batch (60 wraps) of the product contains a few wraps with either all or one of the following defects (1) Excessive Salt (2) Damaged/Torn Wraps (3) Undercooked wraps. However, none of these issues are critical enough to stop using the product since you can throw away the defective ones and use the rest.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/text: South Beach Diet Whole Wheat Wraps. Ever since I found these Tortilla Wraps, I can't stop eating them. They are 100% Whole Wheat Product and they taste pretty good! They have all the right things to eat in them, 8g of Fiber, Enriched with Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) No Cholesterol, Zero Trans and Saturated Fats. They are even 10 Calories (110) less than other Brands, 120 Calories the one I was eating before.<br /><br />Two or three times per week is what I have for lunch, a warm Tortilla, 4 Tablespoons of Fantastic World Foods Vegan Taco Filling, other times I use Chicken or even Mushrooms, some shredded Cheddar or Mozzarella cheese, two hands full of chopped Romaine Lettuce, remove center stems, half sliced Avocado and a tablespoon of Honey Mustard Dressing, I make my own (no mayo), and eat it like a Big Taco,...so Good, I feel like making one right now!<br /><br />South Beach Living Whole Wheat Wraps are a little on the dry side, that's why sometimes they break and are very tender, other than that, they are a Great alternative to other tortilla products, most of them are full of Hydrogenated Soybean Oil and/or Palm Oil, like the one I was eating before. South Beach Whole Wheat Tortilla Wraps use Non-Hydrogenated Soybean Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Amazon.com is the only place I find them and I'm so glad I did! Thank You

Other products with similar size and weight was in the $20 range.<br /><br />Our Labrador pup likes these bones and definitely keeps her occupied. Give it as a treat or hide it, either way it keeps them busy.<br /><br />The knotz are about 2 - 3 inches in length and about half an inch wide. The size varies, but that's the rough size of the bones.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. If my dog could, she would say so too.

review/text: I normally buy the Rishi Jasmine Pearl Green Tea, I purchased this on accident. It is quite a bit cheaper than the pearls and tastes REALLY close to the same. I usually use an electric tea maker so this is actually better for me, the pearls never had time to brew in the maker. This tea is very "clean" tasting and light, I find it emotionally uplifting it is certainly the best green tea I have ever had and I have tried MANY (over 30 at least).

review/text: I had high expectation of this tea after reading the review and was willing to pay a bit more for it.  It has almost no jasmine flavor to it and lacks the aroma I was hoping for. I'm drinking it because I paid so much for it, but Numi's Jasmine Monkey King is way better and I can get it much cheaper at a grocery store, so I'll be trying their pearls instead of ever buying this weak tea again.

review/text: This is really nice tea.  I'm not a tea expert by any means, but it seems like good quality to me.  More importantly (at least to me) is how it tastes.  And this is very nice.  It's smooth, offers a really nice aroma with a wonderful jasmine scent and tastes good both hot or chilled.<br /><br />As far as brewing, I was able to brew the same leaves 3 times before I really noticed a decline in taste.  I'm sure this could vary person to person, and those with a better palate than mine would probably notice a difference sooner, but being able to reuse them 3 times makes the tea go much further!<br /><br />Anyway, it is nice tasting and nice smelling.  It's smooth and not bitter at all, I would recommend this to friends and family (and of course to anyone looking at this)!

review/text: This tea has a perfect balance of jasmine and green tea, in my opinion. I do not enjoy the jasmine tea that is too perfumed, I can maybe drink a cup, but not two or three like I can with this one. Love the flavor, it comes close to their "pearl" version, which is significantly more expensive. I also buy this version, but more for the beauty of the opening of the pearls in my glass teapot than the difference in taste. This regular loose jasmine tea is my daily go-to tea, together with the Citron Oolong, also by Rishi.

review/summary: Pretty good in a pinch
review/text: First off, there is no way this could be mistaken for real, fresh-from-the-machine espresso.  It does smell a bit on the strange side when you open the jar, but it does get better once you make it, and it even manages to make a bit of crema.  I originally bought it for baking, but I suspect I will be buying another jar for that purpose and keeping this one at work. I never intended to drink this, but after a few desperate mornings without enough caffeine, I caved and snatched it out of my cupboard on the way out the door.<br /><br />I'll admit, it's a pretty decent backup when I'm caught at the office with no cash for the coffee cart. It's extremely convenient to have on hand come 3 o'clock or so.<br /><br />If you can manage to think ahead in the morning and brew a few shots of espresso at home to bring with you, you're probably better off doing that.  However, if (like me) you're lucky to get out with matching socks on, this is a great option.

I had tried previously by buying a bag at my local Albertsons and they are good. Good chip for dipping sicne they're a little thicker than Lays. The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.<br /><br />NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand.

review/summary: Better than the other chips I purchased
review/text: These have an added kick that made them better than the other rippled chips I bought on Amazon, and they're kettle-cooked to boot, so they had a heartier taste and more satisfying crunch. Great for any kind of dip and they hold up well to any dip.

review/summary: Ranch isn't only good with tortilla chips....
review/text: I have been a longtime fan of Kettle Potato Chips, since I was a small child. The terrific texture and "crunch" of their product never leaves me disappointed - what's more, the high quality ingredients that go into the top-of-the-line flavors they have are first rate. Zesty Ranch does not fail to disappoint me. The Ranch flavor has a terrific, zippy quality (like the flavor name would suggest). It livens up your taste buds, and I am pleased to say that it isn't too salty, nor too greasy. Each chip is packed to it peak with flavor, and it is far from skimped upon. You almost don't need any dip or sauce of any kind on this snack. It speaks for itself. Highly recommended. Makes me want to go crunch on some right now!

review/summary: Most of the Bags were open
review/text: I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years.  I was very excited to find them on Amazon.  I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).<br /><br />When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale.  I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.  Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service.

review/summary: Yummy chips!
review/text: My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!

review/text: I found these in Salt & Pepper flavor in huge 20 oz. bags for $2.80 at BigLots recently. They are very tasty and they have no artificial aftertaste whatsoever.  We were in the middle of one bag when we pulled out chips that seemed wet.  Turns out it was just the oil on the chips.<br />They are mighty flavorful and crunchy, but, yes, they can be greasy. Definitely a guilty pleasure to be eaten in moderation!

review/text: I love these chips...for overall flavor, texture, freshness, and most of all CRUNCH...they can't be beat. My only criticism would be that they are a bit greasy, but they're potato chips...so what do you expect? Besides, they are not greasy to the point of being unpleasant...and their durability when facing even the most daunting dip...7 layer, chunky salsa, and even heavy cream cheese dips...is well worth the trade off.

review/text: I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good. The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ ! They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Krinkle makes very thick chips, what's even better is that the krinkle cut chips feel even thicker because they are krinkled or have ridges in them.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing. I like the peppery flavor of these.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/text: These Kettle potato chips are great. I love the krinkle cut because it gives the chip great texture when eating it. Those thick ridges also allows more of the seasoning to stay on the chip. The pepper in this really stands out so if you're not a fan of fresh ground pepper flavor then don't buy this. These chips are rich, bold and delicious. The quality of the potatoes used are excellent. I can't wait to try the other flavors.
