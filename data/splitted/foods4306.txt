review/text: So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame.

review/summary: Smart move for Sweet Tooths
review/text: Sugar free bites are a great way to satisfy the sweet desire in all of us...but without unnecessary and unhealthy sugars and fats. The 80-calorie packs are perfect to throw in the snack drawer at work. Now, if Murray would only put some of its other non-chocolate choices into these packs, it would be great! (Sigh...yes, I love chocolate, but I'm a migraineur and chocolate is only a rare treat for me since it is a key migraine headache trigger...)

review/summary: Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :)
review/text: It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.

review/text: Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.

review/text: I don't normally work with fondant because it tastes terrible. This is no exception.. it's not as awful as Wiltons, you can actually eat it without gagging, but that's probably because it has tons of artificial flavor and huge amounts of sugar. BUT.. the color is amazing and it rolls out nicely. I used this with the red for a Cat in the Hat cake and it came out wonderfully. It's perfect to add fun pops of color to kids cakes, etc.

They make a great treat. They check in at 160 calories for four cookies and 19 grams of carbs - I eat three as a "hundred calorie snack," and really enjoy them. Cadbury, you've done it again!

It reminds me of some of the premium brands in its color, texture, and....this is a bit gross, but the compactness & darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it...!<br /><br />I like it, the dogs are eating it and doing well on it. I will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on. The price is probably better than the other store premium brands because there is no advertising.<br /><br />I recommend it.

One of our dogs has wire hair, so I was suprised after awhile when I noticed his coat was getting shiney and he feels soo soft. The other dog we have is part poodle and she even softer. Which she likes because she likes to be hugged and cuddled. We have had alot of people comment on their nice soft and shiney coats.

review/text: I read the other reviews on this item before I ordered it. Based on those, this coffee sounded wonderful! I ordered it along with a French press so that I could enjoy a cup of coffee before class. When I received both items, I immediately tried to make a cup of this "amazing" coffee. What I found was a coffee that had a repulsive after taste. I cannot describe it, but it tastes like chemicals. Not willing to write off the reviews I had read that easily, I thoroughly cleaned the French press -again- and tried the coffee. Same taste. Finally, I used a different coffee in the press and found that it tasted wonderful. My conclusion? Either this coffee is GROSSLY overrated, or I got a bad batch. Either way, I will not be buying again.

review/summary: The Tantilizing Aroma of Maple Syrup...
review/text: When I opened the shipping box containing the Almond French Toast Coffee, I was greeted by the tantilizing aroma of maple syrup.  I had high hopes that the brewed coffee would have the taste that was promised by the fragrant aroma.  Instead, I found the coffee had a slight almond taste, but not even a hint of maple syrup.  Thinking that perhaps adding cream and sweetening the coffee would bring out the maple, I tried that.  There was still no taste or aftertaste of the promised maple essence.<br /><br />I am finding that as I reach the end of the bag of coffee, a slight maple taste is coming into the mix.  It may be that the coffee I received was not thoroughly blended before bagging or that the bag was not tightly sealed during the manufacturing process.  This would account for the aroma that greeted me when I opened the shipping box.<br /><br />Nevertheless, like other coffees from Magnum Coffee Roastery, this coffee is a good medium brew - smooth and having no bitter aftertaste.  It is for that reason that I have rated this as a four-star product.

review/summary: Too weak!
review/text: While brewing, this coffee smells wonderful.  But it is the weakest coffee I've ever tasted that was made by me.  I prefer a medium to strong cup of coffee and so put in the same amount of this coffee that I do for other coffee.  First pot was like drinking water.  For the second pot, I doubled the amount of coffee I had put in for the first pot and it was still too weak.<br /><br />I'll try mixing it with a stronger coffee, but I fear I'll just have to throw this coffee away.<br />Stay away from this brand if you like your coffee to taste like coffee.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I once again read all the reviews about this coffee, the good, the bad, the ugly, and bought  the coffee any way. I keep in mind all of our taste buds are different, mine must be one of the good ones. I really liked this coffee, I liked everything about it.The coffee, was not too strong, bitter or acidic, it was smooth and mellow, with a good aftertaste.  Long after I finished drinking the coffee, I would affirm, I still tasted, french toast coffee, a good thing, the aftertaste was not bad.My thoughts are, this would make a nice iced coffee, or be served during a brunch, or as an after dinner coffee. If you want something stronger, then, this is not for you.I like it and I am sticking to my words on this one.

review/text: I read quite a bit of reviews before buying this coffee.  I am not an avid coffee drinker, but do enjoy it.  This coffee is good, but not my favorite.  I wish there were a little more almond taste.  This coffee is very sweet and heavy.  It is a good, but in moderation.  Definetly a dessert coffee, I drink it at night.  It does make the whole room smell good though!  I might buy it again, but only to drink once in a blue moon.

review/summary: If you like Snickers and peanut butter, you gotta try these!!
review/text: I came across these Snickers Peanut Butter bars earlier this year when I went to buy a regular Snickers bar in an airport between flights.  My first thought was 'Wow, snickers and peanut butter.... yummy".  And that's exactly what this is, Yummy.  I'm a big Snickers lover, and didn't think anything could compare.  Wrong.  When you take a bite you get the usual Snickers taste then the peanut butter hits your taste buds and like the other reviewer said, this is a hit for the makers of Snickers.  I live overseas where only regular Snickers are available.  I brought back two bags of these snack size bars two weeks ago from the U.S. and then ordered another batch from Amazon for my husband to bring back from a business trip to the U.S. this week.  We put these in the freezer along with our regular Snickers bars and both are great frozen.

review/summary: Makes wonderful oatmeal
review/text: I bought this to substitute for the cereal I loved because I wanted to lower my chlorestrol - and found it makes such good soft creamy oatmeal that it's my new favorite breakfast.  I sprinkle cinnamon in the bowl before adding the dry oatmeal, then add a handful of raisins or dried cranberries along with the oatmeal before pour water in and microwaving the whole thing (a little longer than recommended for a full serving - I find 2.22 minutes works best in my microwave).  Sprinkle on some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WKJW5Y">Ideal Brown No Calorie Sweetener</a> (xylitol-based and also gluten-free) or add a couple of squirts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8WIAS">Sweet Leaf Vanilla Creme Flavored Liquid Stevia, 2-Ounce Bottle</a> to the water you cook it in, and it makes a very healthy tasty breakfast.<br /><br />The oatmeal's great for cooking too - meatloaf, oatmeal cookies, etc.  This is the really good quick-cooking gluten-free oatmeal I've been looking for for a long time.  Nothing else I've tried comes close.<br /><br />P.S.  A year later, my chloresterol was down 35 points, too.

review/text: We love these oats just as much as the whole grain, rolled version! This quick cooking oat works wonderfully in cookies. The quality is so fresh, much better than the oats I used to purchase before my Celiac diagnosis twelve years ago! These oats appear to me like they just came out of the field a week before they arrived on my doorstep!<br /><br />Thank you Bob's Red Mill for taking the drastic steps needed to create a gluten free oat! I understand how you have to create an entire seperate part of the mill, with machinery dedicated to the oat only, have a clean field to grow in and clean transport as well! Your perseverance has allowed my two celiac children and I are happily eating oatmeal cookies again!

review/summary: love the creamy texture
review/text: When I took my gluten-free habits to my boyfriend's house (now fiance!) for an extended visit, I provided him with an advanced shopping list.<br /><br />One of the items I included was Bob's Red Mill GF Oatmeal. I didn't realize that there are apparently four different kinds. BF randomly bought one. This one.<br /><br />I love the texture of this oatmeal! At home, I was using a different one of the four kinds, and the directions were more complicated. (Microwave 2 minutes. Stir. 30 more seconds. Cover. Wait 2 minutes.) This type has easier directions. (Microwave 2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes.) You can put it in the microwave and walk away and do something else for four or five minutes instead of monitoring your oatmeal. But the real reason that I am switching to this product is that I was downright shocked at how much better it tasted. You wouldn't think so, right? But oatmeal is all about texture.<br /><br />I actually brought the bag of oatmeal my BF bought back home with me, but now I'm running low. Time for Subscribe and Save! It's a few dollars more than the other kind, but worth every penny.

review/summary: Bella Gluten-Free Pizza Dough, Rolls & Focaccia
review/text: This mix is incredible.  It make two large REAL TASTING pizza crust, or two focaccia.  It also makes hamburger buns that double as an awesome sandwich rolls.  Whatever way you bake it, this mix is a winner with its Italian flavor and real breadlike texture. A must to have in the pantry.

review/summary: Best Pizza Crust Ever!
review/text: I cannot believe this is gluten-free! The pizza dough you can make with this mix is even more delicious than any regular pizza, and I don't even need to eat gluten-free. The crust is dense, yet flaky, full of flavor and has amazing texture. The other day I popped this crust in the oven with only olive oil, salt and oregano and it was incredible. Thanks Bella for bringing such joy to my pallet!

review/summary: good snack
review/text: I bought a bag at the local supermarket.  They were surprisingly good. They were crunchy and a little bit thicker than regular potato chips. I liked that they  tasted "naturally" sweet. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's not baked and slightly oily. I would buy it again.

review/text: My local health food store started to carry these and they sell like hot cakes. Right now they are out and so I came here again to reorder.<br />These chips are nice and fresh tasting, they are not super thin like potato<br />chips. What I also love is that there is not added sugar. Most other Sweet plantain chips have added sugar and I prefer that.

review/summary: Excellent for your coffee without all of the bad things for your diet!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for adding to coffee to get the taste of Kahlua without the added calories, sugar or alcohol. This product adds no calories, no sugar, no carbohydrates and no cholesterol to your coffee.<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/summary: Really Good Flavor - Highly Recommended
review/text: This DaVinci sugar free Kahlua syrup is a great way to add a bit of flavor to otherwise boring "dietetic" drinks and snacks. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I have to watch my sugar intake and have found that these types of flavorings can significantly improve my enjoyment of healthy foods like plain yogurt and yet also satisfy my sweet-tooth.<br /><br />The Kahlua flavor is very realistic tasting and the Splenda does not leave an "aftertaste" like other artificial sweeteners (at least to me).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I love this DaVinci sugar free Kahlua flavored syrup.  It's great when added to diet cola and vodka for a Black Russian and I even add a bit of half and half for a White Russian if I feel decadent.  I have also poured some on "No Sugar Added" Chocolate ice cream and wow, it's really good that way as well. It would be good to sweeten coffee as well but I like mine black and unsweet. Sure, it's thinner than the original Kahlua, but for sugar free, the taste is wonderful. And the value of this three pack is exceptional. Two individual bottles would cost way more at the store than this three pack bundle. Thanks Amazon!

review/text: This stuff is great for white russians (I can justify having SEVERAL with this calorie count!), and for mixing into coffee or plain yogurt.  For the person who said it is weak -yes, of course it is not as thick as actual Kahlua.  But it is a great substitute and I can barely tell the difference when mixed with Vodka and milk.

I'd be lying if I said it reminded me of salt water taffy.  However, my sons think it's pretty good and since they are the ones eating it, I'll give it their rating which is 4 stars.  For me, it's more of a 2.5 stars.

review/text: I will be honest and say that I was skeptical of gluten free pancakes.  I have to tell you that I was wrong!!  I eat gluten free, but my husband and stepson do not.  As we sat there, me with my gluten free pancake, and them with their regular ones, I was the one commenting on how good my pancake was.  It cooked up perfectly.  It had a very slight crispness on the outside and was cakey on the inside.  Just like they tell you on tv how a perfect pancake should be.  Also, it tasted like a pancake.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Even people who don't have a gluten issue, but would like to cut down on white wheat flour, will like these.

review/summary: Whole Wheat Noodles that are smooth and wonderful!
review/text: I purchased these noodles just out of curiosity and because I'm trying to move away from the heavily refined flour noodles.  I didn't really know what to expect because I've often purchased whole wheat noodles made here in the states and they weren't what I'd call yummy.  Well, these Roland noodles (I bought both the Udon and the Lo Mein) are really REALLY tasty.  They cook up in a snap and they really have a wonderful tooth feel.  I used them as the background for a stir fry instead of using white rice or even brown rice.  The combination is really too good for words.  My next attempt will be to use them mixed in with a stir fry, more like the way they'd be served if I bought Lo Mein at a restaurant.  I think no matter how you use these, you'll really like them...bon appetite!

review/summary: Excellent quality
review/text: These are wrapped neatly in bundles with ties around each bundle so you can select the amount you need after opening each package.  Using boiling water with a small amount of oil these cook up rapidly.  It is necessary to cool these down with cold water after they've been drained to avoid sticking like most other noodles.  The noodles themselves are very tasty and make an authentic lo mein.  I recommend these and will order more when these are gone.  That may not be for a while, though as these are packed in a case of 30 packages.  Just be sure you don't overcook them.  It only takes about 2 minutes to boil them soft.

review/text: I was given this olive oil for Christmas and assumed that it was a flavored or infused olive oil.  It isn't.  The lemons are actually pressed with the olives and what a difference that makes!  I generally make my salad dressing the way my Italian father did....EVOO and lemon, as the acidic, with Italian herbs and garlic.  This oil is so tasty that I'm happy just drizzling it over my salad.  I used it in a recipe for my book club members the other day, and everyone mentioned the fantastic lemon taste.  It didn't overwhelm, it just made it perfect.

review/summary: Excellent product, not-so-great shipping
review/text: I'm absolutely addicted to this product.  I first purchased a package of them at Whole Foods Market, where they're sold for $4.99/package.  Since we don't make trips to Whole Foods on a very regular basis, I knew I'd either have to buy them in bulk from there (which would be outrageously expensive) or try to find them elsewhere, so I looked on Amazon.  It was an excellent deal with both Subscribe & Save and our Amazon Prime Student membership.  When I received the box of six packages, however, I noticed that the first had slightly broken/crumbled fig bars in it... and then the second and third and fourth.  So basically, it just looks like someone or some people handled the box very poorly.  I will purchase this again though, and hopefully all of my fig bars will be perfectly intact next time!

When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxes<br />in April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.<br /><br />Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goey<br />and is not a firm cookie past the expiration date.  I really wanted this<br />product, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem.  Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,<br />but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds....
