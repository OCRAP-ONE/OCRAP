review/summary: Incredible taste
review/text: You haven't really tasted how good a gin and tonic can be until you've tasted your favorite gin (I like Hendricks)with this tonic water. No aftertaste. This is truly a clean and refreshing taste. I love this stuff.

review/summary: Great Alternative
review/text: Having been an ex-Hendricks man (now drink Plymouth exclusively - no back sass) - this is a great alternative to regular or diet tonic.  Don't expect the taste to floor you, in fact, some of the "posts" comment that it's flat & boring.  It's much more subtle.  O.K. - - if your taste buds must be loaded with sugar or you do not care for a clean gin and are heavy on the "Botanicals," then this might not be the tonic for you.<br /><br />But if you are tired of the sugar in regular tonic water or the crap in diet tonic water, than this is a nice choice.  With a little bit of lime and a little heavier on the gin, this makes for a heavenly drink where you can savor the gin & tonic mixture.  Cuts out a lot of calories, too!<br /><br />One word of caution - - it can lose it's carbonation, quick.  Best to buy the small bottles (I've purchased both) and put a bottle type pressure sealer on the top if you want to save the little residue of the small bottle (if you're only having one drink.)

review/summary: stick with Fever Tree
review/text: I was disappointed with this tonic water, especially after shelling out the big bucks. It tastes flat and boring. I found it did not hold up to gin so tried it with vodka and was still disappointed with the results. My usual tonic water is Fever Tree and I find it to be a far superior mixer--bolder, crisper and cleaner. For gin and tonics, I prefer gins that are heavy on the juniper (Tanquery 10 is my favorite). If your taste runs toward milder gins, the Q Tonic may suit you better than it did me. Also, if you're looking to cut calories, Q Tonic is definitely a better option than the chemical-packed-diet tonic waters. However, if you're a true gin aficionado, stick with Fever Tree.

review/summary: In hopes for high quality tonic and just got high dollar tonic
review/text: Let me start out by saying cheap booze makes a cheap drink!!!<br />I was excited to try this tonic water and wanted to like it, but I don't!!!<br />I'm a hendrick's gin guy and LOVE my gin and tonics.(if you think you like tang.10 try Hendrick's)<br />This tonic reminds me of club soda, fizzy, not enough sweetner and overall flat on flavor.<br />I can spare the calories in lue of flavor. I think Q Tonic should bring out a "high calorie" version and I'd try it again. If you try it buy only one bottle at $2.25 a bottle. (very small)(around 7oz.) Q Tonic won't get you to bad.<br />Good luck.

review/text: It's sweetened with Organic Agave and made with HAND PICKED quinine.....big deal, so what?  It's still not as fine a tonic water as Fever-Tree, which is much more reasonably priced.<br />Fever-Tree is rather pricey but Q-Tonic is just plain overpriced and not as good, IMO.

review/summary: Great Afternoon Pick-Me-Up
review/text: I love Rockstar energy drink.  Even though it has hardly any calories, it does not taste like it is artificially sweetened.  It gives me a nice afternoon pick-me-up and I love the fruity taste.  The drink is augmented with ginseng, guarana, B vitamins, and other good stuff.  While it's probably not the healthiest drink on the market, I love the taste.  I'm one of those people who can't drink water and need to find other sources for hydration especially since I live in Florida where it's very hot.  Rockstar and Blackberry Ice are my drinks of choice.

review/summary: Zero Carb = BEST
review/text: As I work nights, I've tried almost EVERY energy drink out there. They usually taste like vitamin-y candy.<br />This is the best (besides Juiced Guava... Less calories. When you drink 2 a night, that adds up).<br />As I sit here, sipping the lovely purple liquid, I contemplate how to describe the flavor. Sweet, hint of fruity? I dunno, but it's VERY enjoyable. I visit 7-11 nightly, was all bummed out because they were out. Got Monster instead and whined at my 7-11 guy. He told me to put the Moster back and went and grabbed me some from his stash in the back. What a winner!! :-)<br />I like RockStar Zero Carb (blue can) WAY more than Redbull or Bawls. Though I do enjoy Monster's HitMan energy shots, though too much caffiene too fast. Prefer to slowly consume throughout my shift....<br />Hope this helps someone.

review/text: They say this is an energy drink. It has a lot of minerals in it but I just drink it for the taste. Somehow it really refreshes my thirst. It's hard to find and not cheap but it's a 16 oz. can so you get a lot for the money. Ilove the taste. I have no more energy than with any sugar drink and I've heard a lot of tall tales about these drinks. Just drink it if you like a well flavored drink. It's good.

review/summary: The king of energy drinks!
review/text: I started drinking Monsters in high school, usually one or more a day. I tried Red Bull, Nos, Amp, Rockstar, and tons of other varieties, but it wasn't until I found Rockstar Zero Carb that I discovered one I really liked. I normally hate things that are ambiguously flavoured "wild berry" or something similar, and I don't usually enjoy diet beverages. Rockstar Zero Carb is the exception to this rule. I'm in my 20s now, and I don't drink energy drinks every day, but when I do drink them, this is the kind I prefer.<br /><br />As a side note - this packs in a lot more "energy" ingredients than most energy drinks, and I've always felt that I absorb them better without the carbs. And if for some reason you have no sense of self-preservation and drink four or even five of these beasts in a single night, you don't have to worry about all the awful sugar you'd get in the non-sugarfree version.

review/text: These are awesome and I love buying in bulk. MY boyfriend has one before work everyday because he works third shift but has classes during the day. I found it cheaper to do this so I bought a couple 24 packs. These did not last long between the two of us. They taste wonderful but are a lot of caffeine. If you don't drink it normally Id NOT suggest these! My friend tried one and could not finish it. She felt sick the entire rest of the day because she never drinks caffeine. I routinely drink it and have since I was young. These cans are wonderful for me to take in my lunch to college classes and help me keep up between class, clinical, working and homework! Plus 20 calories for a whole can? Who can beat that?

review/text: (This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal. I can't really describe it. It tastes sort of... pineapple-y? With a hint of dirty socks and metal...?<br /><br />But it has a lot of good stuff in it and really wakes me up. But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper.

review/summary: For those of us that don't like coffee
review/text: I am the type of person who needs a caffeine rush in the morning in order to make it through the day. Unfortunately, I can't stand the taste of coffee.<br /><br />When energy drinks entered the market, I tried them out but couldn't stand the taste of all the sugar. Once Rockstar released a sugar free energy drink, I was hooked from the start. It doesn't have a flat taste like all other sugar free drinks do, this one will give you a pop when you take your first swig.<br /><br />Price is pretty completive, though you can find them cheaper if you hunt around. Some convenience stores will sell them  2 for $3, making them a better deal. But you have to drive around and find a place that has them on sale, so I think paying the extra 20 cents or so on here is worth it.

review/summary: Diet version had awful taste.......
review/text: I picked up a can of the sugar free Rock Star today. I was dying of thirst so when I opened it, I took a big chug of it. About halfway through swallowing it, the taste hit me, and I wanted to spit it all back out right away!<br /><br />WHAT! THE! What *is* that disgusting taste? It was like chewing a big wad of Hubba Bubba, then drinking some nasty strawberry soda mixed with Code Red Mountain Dew and a baby aspirin all at once. After the first drink, I was still thirsty so I braved another swallow and I ended up just opening the car door and dumping the whole can out right then and there. It made me GAG trying to choke this hideous concoction down! What a waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of energy drinks to begin with, but I've never !!IN MY LIFE!! tasted one this gross. It even smelled like CAT PEE.

Also, it is cheaper per volume then other energy drinks.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like toothpaste or cough syrup. All right.
review/text: By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have. Since that's really all that matters, I highly recommend it. It never seems to get old.

If you like chewable flintstones grape vitamins and a chalky aftertaste, you'll love Rockstar Zero Carb Energy Drink.<br /><br />Not to my taste.

review/summary: Good, and Bad
review/text: Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.  I kind of miss drinking energy drinks, but 30 cents/pill vs. $2+ per drink was worth it for me... and I'll still splurge on a Lo-Carb Monster occasionally.

review/text: Caffeine isn't an upper for me, but it's a nice calmative beverage.  I can't have sugar.  So I enjoy sugar free energy drinks.  Rockstar Zero-Carb has a nice berry tea flavor too it.  It's a flavor I can live with, unlike a lot of other drinks.  I can't tell you about the buzz level, since I don't get a buzz, but a can of this will completely knock out any caffeine headache...LOL.  It's got more caff than the Sugar Free.<br /><br />Individual cans are not cost effective.  I was having trouble finding a lot of sugar free energy drinks in my area, and when I did, the prices were high.  I was thrilled to find Amazon had them at good prices... WITH FREE SHIPPING!?!?  Holy cow!  I can get a heavy case of soda shipped to my door for nada?  Now that REALLY rocks!  I don't know how they do it.  The first one came FedEx..LOL.  For free.  And fast, too!<br /><br />I've been an Amazon customer since... yikes, I don't remember the year.  Pretty much since they first opened.  Back when they used to send all their customers Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Rock on!

review/text: At times I wish this weren't an energy drink because I love the way it tastes and I'd like to drink it without the energy effects such as at night. I'm also sure it would be less expensive if it weren't marketed as an energy drink. In any case, I love the taste and it gets me going in the morning sometimes when I'm dragging. It's certainly the best tasting energy drink I've had. If you've tried the non-juiced Rockstar drinks, don't judge this by those. They taste nasty by comparison.

review/summary: Bait and switch!
review/text: Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.

review/text: I'm very skeptical about energy drinks, mostly because of a possible caffeine addiction. I haven't tried too many (never tried Red Bull, so really...not that many :p), but this one is great. Granted, there is a lot of sugar in it (40ish grams) PLUS artificial sweetner to make a really sweet drink. But I like the taste, and I too find it refreshing. I drink Juiced Guava maybe once a week to enjoy and it perks me up but not as much as coffee does to the point I get jittery.

review/summary: New formula is absurd!
review/text: When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.

review/text: We drank the new reduced juice unknowingly and thought yuk what's up with this did we get a bad batch? I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day. Now this case is going back and we are done with Rockstar until they bring back the higher real juice formula. I even had a stomach reaction to this one and I tend to have a goat gut. Bad taste bad product change and pissed that they reduce the juice keeping the price the same 2-3.00 per can, another misguided by greed rogue corporation. Now I cannot help but wonder if that blogger that rants that Rockstar is owned by Nazi's has some credibility. My wife really resented the fact that the new packaging was predominently identical to the old decieving her into purchasing a product she did not want or like.Back it all goes.

review/summary: Quite possibly the greatest drink ever!
review/text: I bought this back a while ago, and I'm still reaping the benefits of drinking this miraculous beverage.  I feel more alert, my social life has improved, and my urine has a wonderful neon yellow hue.<br /><br />Even though it is sealed quite nicely in it's case, after you are able to remove the can, you may want to cool down your energy drink.  My preference was to put the cans in my refrigerator, but you could get a similar effect by setting the cans in a snow bank, or by using ice cubes in a glass to cool the drink down.  My first problem came when I was ready to drink the Diet Rockstar(tm).  I looked at the can and was perplexed as to how to open it up, until I noticed this clever "tab" at the top that would pop open a perfect sized drinking hole to use.<br /><br />Once I opened it up, I quickly poured the entire contents of the Diet Rockstar(tm) into my mouth and then swallowed it.  I had heard of people not caring for the last few drops of a warmed can, so I figured that it would be best to drink it before it had the opportunity to warm up.  What a great decision that was!  Shortly afterwards I felt a burst of energy surge through my body and I was more productive then I have ever been in my life.  Normally I would take a 8:30am nap at work, but not today.  Was was ready to work and to get everything completed in a orderly fashion.  However, a problem soon surfaced as there was no more work to do for a few hours and I had all this energy to burn off.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and would suggest that everyone purchase as much as you can.  This drink will change your life and make you complete all of your activities with ease.

review/summary: Grow herbs, flowers & fruit in the worst environment
review/text: This device waters your plants and turns the lights on and off based on the setting.  Add the nutrient plan and you have some of the fastest growing plants out there.  It comes with a seed kit, but I couldn't tell which one is included.  Probably Salad (the fastest growing, 3-4 weeks!) or Gormet Herbs (the most popular).  Here are some of the specs:<br /><br />It takes a standard plug, instead of a 3 prong, so it can plug in anywhere instead of just the kitchen.  The bowl holds 14 cups of water.  That's one pint shy of a gallon.  The light goes on for 15 1/2 hours to 17 hours depending on the plant, and the water goes over the roots & sponge for the lights on time or longer for thirsty plants.  You have to hand polinate (a rapid 10 second wave in each plant) the tomatoes & peppers every other day when flowering, and the Peppers & International basil require you wash out the bowls every 4 weeks, but otherwise there is very little maintenance.  The light comes on when the water is low and another light comes on when the 2 weeks are up and the plants need more nutrients, but other than that you can pretty much forget it.  The lights also work to help my potted plants grow when near it.  The plants like human comfortable temperatures (61-80 F) but the peppers & tomatoes will produce more fruit if safely over 70.<br /><br />The nutrients are different for each plant (I have a breakdown on my dinubabear site) and come in 2 to 4 sets in a kit (Starting, sprouting, normal & fruiting).  You give 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.<br /><br />Aerogrow guarentees their kits to sprout as described, or you can call them & they will replace their kits.<br /><br />New kits will be available in September, such as French, Italian & Japanese herbs.

I work a day time job so I have the light come on about the time I get home and stay on all night - that way it is almost like a second lamp and I can look and admire my plants as much as I want.  It is fun watching them grow and I can't wait to harvest them.  The salad green kit said that you can start harvesting in about 2.5 weeks, and at the rate these plants are growing  I believe that to be true.  I have tried growing fruits and vegatables indoors before but I never had much luck.  The thought of being able to eat freshly picked food is enough to make me buy another garden.  I can't wait for them to come out with the Strawberry seed pods (I will probably need a 3rd garden then).<br /><br />I now had my first salad with the salad greens; it was so good I made a 2nd larger salad.  I am very happy with this garden.

review/summary: Loved it for a while....
review/text: I got the AeroGarden back in November, and had great luck with the Salad Greens kit. I ordered another Salad Greens kit, and as soon as I planted it, the pump got REALLY loud. So loud you can't be in the same room with the thing and hope to get anything done that requires concentration (I'm a grad student and the AeroGarden has become my personal study albatross). Sooooo...thinking I needed to clean out the roots a bit better, I took it apart and went through the whole sanitation process, preparing the garden for my third planting. As soon as I plugged it back in, the pump roared to life and once again my living room was filled with a lovely, deep buzzing/humming sound. Other posters are spot-on about customer service - you simply cannot get through to these people. I've been on hold for 20 minutes and more before giving up each time - I'm hoping they'll send me a new pump, but I need to actually HEAR from a real person. It's great that they're nice and all - hey, we'd all be nice if we rarely actually talked to anyone!<br /><br />UPDATE: I sent one email and they responded within hours with an offer to send out a new pump, so my opinion of customer service has changed considerably - I'll update this review when I get the pump to let everyone know if that fixed the noise problem<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE: Yes, the new pump fixed the noise problem *and* customer service has gotten a LOT better. I've phoned a couple of times and got a live person, quickly, who was extremely helpful. Looks like the kinks are worked out from the original problems and I now wouldn't hesitate to pick another one of these gardens up.

review/text: The Aerogarden was going great until today when the pump stopped working.  I did some searching on the net and found others have the same problem.  The pump needs to be replaced, I wrote Amazon to see if they are going to replace or refund my money for the Aerogarden.  I am not very happy, especially when many other have the same problem with defective units.  Buyer beware, you may want to wait a year or two until they perfect this system.  Who want to watch their plants die because of a bad pump, then after they die you have to put in a new pump and start all over again.<br /><br />I don't think they even tested many of these units before they sold them to the public.  How could a problem like this happen to so many people if they did proper testing?  And if they did test them out good, they must not care about selling a quality product.<br /><br />My final thought is it works well at first, but does not last long.

review/summary: UNRELIABLE
review/text: Well, Aerogrow is sending me another unit.  They have already taken the trouble to send me a replacement bowl which fixed the first problem and later, they sent a replacement pump which shut down the entire system.  I don't like contacting them and then getting replacements.  My aerogrow setup does not look like the flourishing results at the local kitchenwares store.  My consumer experience thus far has stank despite customer service's efforts to fix the problems.  Customer service has remained courteous and attentive.  They have mailed out parts promptly but does that buy them my silence?  Well, I can see how the positive reviews are true on this site so make up your mind after reading all of them.  Mine is just one experience. I lost money and I lost time and will start all over again once I receive the new unit.  If I had ordered through amazon, I would have just returned it for a money refund.  So if you want to try hydroponic growing as I did, then go ahead and buy this but I urge you to buy from amazon.  Good luck.<br /><br />Here were my issues that were all responded to by aerogrow's customer service:<br /><br />(1) I was misled that by ordering directly from aerogrow instead of Amazon at the cost of Amazon's free shipping, I would become a special customer and receive discounts on future purchases on seeds and more machines. But when I wrote to aerogrow about not receiving any membership packet, I was told that the additional purchases should be made at the time of the initial purchase (when I have no experience with the worthiness of the aerogrow product)<br /><br />(2) aerogrow had to send me a new bowl because when I received the product the red indicator light for low water level was already on and NEVER shut off.  Following the suggestions from the phone rep did not solve the problem at all. The new bowl fixed the problem.<br /><br />(3)  Then I realized that deep in the growing period a number of herbs were not growing at all and was told that I had received a bad pump and would have to install a new one that Aerogrow would be sending me and that I would have to start all over again from the beginning with another packet of herbs that would be included in the package.<br /><br />(4) I unplugged the aerogrow and installed the pump according to the BLURRY pictures on the instruction sheet and now the entire machine will not turn on.  Changing the pump is messy and not recommended. Don't throw away the attaching screw for the old pump because Aerogrow doesn't give you anything but the pump and the blurry instructions.<br /><br />The remaining survivors are going to die but that's okay because I have a brand new packet of seeds and in two months, I MIGHT have herbs, right?<br /><br />(5) I put the new plug in today and now the machine won't turn on at all.  HELP!<br /><br />This product just isn't reliable and it is priced too high to be this risky.<br /><br />(6) Aerogrow reps always maintained a friendly tone and polite demeanor in dealing with me. However, I still felt wronged. When the replacement never showed up after weeks, I emailed requesting a full refund, offering to ship the machine back to them so they could investigate the problem. They said that I could chuck the old machine, the new one was at the post office because of a wrong address and that they would credit my credit card. I have to check to see if they did. I don't want another aerogrow anyway.

I followed the directions to the letter and did everything exactly as I was supposed to ... to no avail.  Only 3 of the 8 plants even grew and were available to eat and after 3 months they ALL died.

review/text: The AeroGarden was easy to put together, the directions were clear and so far it is performing as expected.  It seems like it does grow pretty fast and you don't have to do much but watch it grow and explain it to your friends (people are very interested in this thing).  I had to reset the light timer because at first it was on all night and off in the day, but that was easy and now it comes on in the morning and goes off around bedtime.  I already have little yellow flowers on my tomatoes and I don't think it's been growing even a month!

The firts time I seen it my sister was at my sisters house. She had the herb garden growing. The plants were healty and Tasty. There is nothing like having fresh herbs for cooking. After that I just had to have one. It's has taken all the guess work out of gardening. It's easy to maintain and it's nearly self suffecient. There is a light that come on about every two weeks as a reminder to add the fertilizer and water and the rest is taken care of for you. You can get any better than that.<br /><br />LK

review/summary: Hard Core Gardeners Winter Delight
review/text: We purchased two of these for gifts and both recipients are absolutely delighted.  One is my elderly father-in-law and he mentions it every time we talk to him on the pnone.  He is an avid gardener and the Aerogarden has given him a lovely winter crop of lettuce for the last 2 months and is still going strong.  He said it is easy to set up and is a subject of conversation when people come to visit.  The second purchase was at the request of my father-in-law for my niece.  She is also in a cold climate and the Aerogarden is a bright spot of green in her kitchen with a fine crop of herbs growing that she enjoys using in cooking.  She also has 2 small children who are getting an education in aero-hydroponic gardening.  I am hoping that my husband buys me one for my birthday.

review/text: The Aerogarden is so much better than what I ever expected! The herbs that I started with continued to grow for 5 months. I had enough herbs to share with friends and still have some to dry.  This unit worked so well, that I now have a second unit. All the growing pods have the listed days it takes for the seeds to germinate.  Those days have been exact in each pod I have used.  I have also harvested the herbs, greens, etc. at the approximate time they have listed as beginning harvesting times. I have salad greens and the salsa garden growing at the same time--great fresh salads etc.!  I have recommended this product to many of my friends and continue to do so.

review/summary: Gardening For Dummies
review/text: Its the real thing. If you can't grow a crop with this product, seek medical help...Really though, its too simple and straight forward to screw up. I am on my second crop of peppers and it looks like the first crop wasn't a fluke. The only drawback is the fact that the veggie leafs get too tall so fast, even with the recommended pruning, that the light hood needs to be removed and you have to allow mother nature light to finish it off. I understand Aero has a new unit that is a bit larger and addresses this problem. Growing veggies this way is a reward you wouldnt believe. The peppers I have are so flipin' hot that your skin burns if you dont wash your hands after cutting them up. Not kidding. The unit takes up only a minimal amount of room and tending. Indicator lights go off when its time to add water and nutrients. True Gardening for Dummies. There have been other counter-top gardening kits offered in the past but most are clunky and messy to use, producing sickly looking plants. Not this one. Give it a try. Its kind of fun and you'll enjoy the results.

review/summary: Awesome little garden! It's so much fun to watch it grow :-)
review/text: I got my Aerogarden back in December, 2006. I have been seeing it sprout very well from when I first started using it December 18th to be exact. I'm almost to the point of clipping back the branches to let it grow even further. I'm so excited as I got the cherry tomato kit...<br /><br />My only cons are that the light it needs to grow under is extremely bright as another poster mentioned here. I wish they would have perfected it so it wouldn't bother us being so bright. If you have a place where you can keep it out of your sight it will help. If I had a larger place I'd have gotten 2 Aerogardens for sure!<br /><br />IT is a bit expensive I think as well... But on the upside you could order it at Aerogarden's website with 3 installments of $49.99 which I am currently under here. So in that way that helps make it affordable.<br /><br />Also they need to make it even a possibly cuter design... Maybe they are working on this? LOL...<br /><br />Also wondering if they'll make it so we can grow more then one "kit" at a time too? That would be great as well.<br /><br />I hope you'll get this! Like I said if I had a bigger place I'd get 2. You'll love to watch it grow quick!

review/summary: Lovin it!
review/text: I have 2 7-pod gardens. One is growing herbs; the other the Chef Salad package. Both gardens grew quickly as promised, and required 'pruning' on schedule. The herbs that are doing well are mint, parsley, basil, Italian basil and thyme (I am already drying some and they have only been growing since Jan.). However, the chives are sad, very sad and I'm disappointed in that pod. The Chef Salad mix: I'm growing 2 Salad Greens, 2 Arugula, 1 ea Mesclun Mix, Baby Greens and Romaine. Everything is huge, healthy and we've enjoyed many salads already with the exception of the Arugula and Romaine. They are disappointingly skimpy, slow growing with very little substance. However, based on the success of all else in both gardens, and the ease of caring for them, I would not hesitate to have more if I had room to put them. I would try the cherry tomatoes, the peppers and maybe edible flowers. Mine are the Classics with 7 pods and one came with the herb pods included. I wish you the same success I have had and know you will enjoy these. Oh, the lights are bright, very bright esp. after needing to raise them higher as plants grow toward them and with 2 in one room, not a good idea for a 'sleeping' or TV room. Just a teanse of 'noise' when they first begin: after that, nothing.

review/summary: AeroGarden: Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread!
review/text: I'd been eyeing the AeroGarden for quite some time - during the dark months of winter.  I was totally missing my "fresh-picked" tomatoes, but I just couldn't see spending $150 on myself!  So I put it on my Amazon Wish List :-)<br /><br />DH bought it for me for Christmas!  I won't repeat earlier posts describing what-all is involved with planting/maintenance.  I'll just say that on 12/24/07, I "planted" cherry tomato seeds and, by 2/24/08, tomatoes were already starting to appear!!!  Grant you, they aren't edible yet - but I am soooo excited!<br /><br />The plants require minimal tending: Just some cutting back, here-and-there; hand-pollinating (basically "shaking" the top of the plants w/your hand); the addition of Nutrients, and a fair amt of "topping off" of the water.  Still, I abso-freaking-lutely LOVE it!  This totally satisfies my "Gardening Itch" thru the winter months! (I'm a bit of an avid gardener, if you couldn't tell!).<br /><br />Downside:  The unit, and the seed-pods *are* rather expensive.  But it's about as fool-proof as you can get!  So, all things considered, I'd say it's worth every penny!  Even a complete gardening neophyte will experience "success" with this - if they just follow the (very simple) instructions.  I honestly think that the only way you could truly mess this up would be to forget to check the water (the plants get *very* thirsty as they get bigger).<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to sample the fruits of my "labor" yet, but I'll bet they'll be a LOT tastier than store-bought produce.  Probably not as good as the summertime tomatoes from my garden, but time will tell...<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Would I recommend this product?  ABSOLUTELY!!!

It does not make any irritating noises, and in fact sounds a bit like a quiet fish tank.<br /><br />The light is very bright, and very clean and crisp. This is wonderful.<br /><br />We got the white one, which is bright and refreshing. I think silver and black would be good colors as well, but black was a little too dark for my tastes. The white is just very appropriate. I was afraid at first that it would look a bit like some giant ipod, but it does not.<br /><br />So far this product is a 5 star item.

review/text: I purchased the 7-pod AeroGarden approx. five weeks ago. I immediately set it up which was very simple to do. I inserted the pods and added the water and nutrients tablets as instructed. I saw sprouts take place within a week as expected. I check everything daily anticipating growth....well this is where we are very disappointed. After five weeks the plants grew to heights of only 1 1/2 inches at best. They seem dormant, stopped growing weeks ago, and basically just quit on me. I followed the instructions and can't understand why they quit growing other than maybe the seeds were of poor quality. We have city water which we use on all of our house plants which flurish. So.. needless to say that we are very disappointed. I will go on line and purchase seven more seed pods and hopefully things will turn out differently. By the way...I do have a green thumb, you should see my garden outside every year...wow !

review/text: I bought my Aerogrow garden last February (2007) and have had three long lasting crops since then:  Italian herbs, French herbs and International Basil.  The whole family has enjoyed the process and it has been great to be able to just snip herbs when neeeded.  I've had one major problem -- my pump stopped working after I put in my latest crop (Salsa Garden).  I called Aerogrow Customer Service and they took me through the steps to try to correct the problem and when none of them worked, they sent me a brand new pump free of charge and a replacement Salsa Garden Kit free of charge. MARCH 1, 20009 -- My Aerogarden is still one of my favorite purchases and the Customer Service is still wonderful.  A couple of seed pods from my latest kit did not germinate; one call to Aerogrow and they are sending me a brand new kit, free of charge.

review/summary: Kitchen herbs sprouting right on schedule
review/text: The seed packages state the likely time for contents to sprout and, after three weeks of hydroponic effort, everything is precisely on schedule. Another two weeks pass before the harvest begins. Then, we'll be enjoying fresh, organic herbs, grown under our own supervision. So far, the Aerogarden is working exactly as advertised. The water tank had to be refilled after the first two weeks and new nutrients were needed at the same time. Separate warning lights indicated the need for those things to be done. Now, we just watch the grass grow. Not the most exciting activity, but the herbs are plentiful.

review/summary: Too soon to tell
review/text: Even though I bought this (as a Christmas gift to myself) about a month ago, it has only been planted for one week now so it is a bit early to tell how successful it will be.  (Hence only a three-star rating) The one thing I noticed right away is how brilliant the grow light is - so much so that I am having to drape dish towels over it when the lights are on otherwise it is blinding.  I have a small house and even with the dish towels covering it, I have to close my bedroom door at night because it would otherwise be too light in my bedroom to sleep.<br /><br />Four of the pods have already sprouted, the other three will likely poke their heads out in another day or two.  I have my fingers crossed that I will garner a good herb harvest for winter cooking.  I will update once I have had some experience to share.

review/summary: Gave as a gift
review/text: I gave this gift to my son-in-law for Christmas.  Being that he loves to cook and use all sorts of herbs, he was thrilled with the gift.  He liked the idea that he could purchase more variety kits for his garden.  He will set it up in a few weeks.

review/summary: Enthusiastic At First
review/text: When I first tried these, I loved them, but I started to get tired of them. They're very simple--basically just sesame seeds and date syrup, which is what I liked about them at first. I love sesame seeds, but I think I decided that they're just a little to sweet for my taste. I'd definitely give them a try--it's a nice snack occasionally.

review/text: These are some of the most delectable cookies I've ever eaten!  I received a package of them in a gift box this christmas. I had never heard of them before but i love iced gingerbread so I was excited to try them.  WOW!  What a taste sensation!  These cookies literally MELT in your mouth.  I ate 1/2 the bag before I realized it!!  Now I'm on a mission to find a store near me that carries them so i can get them whenever I want.  They are incredible!

Wicklein Nuremberg Pfeffernusse are absolutely the best that I've had, and believe me when I say I've tried them all! These delightful Holiday Treats are spiced perfectly, and are a lighter more delicate version of their less expensive counterparts. Truly genuine.

review/summary: Good rendition of tea for an instant machine
review/text: Let's not fool ourselves, tea from a Keurig is not the same as brewing tea in a teapot and letting it steep.  If you typically make tea by dunking a tea-bag in a cup of hot water then you will like this tea.  Overall it tastes pretty good, better than I expected.  In fact you can make two cups of tea or one very large mug from one pod.  One cup is a little strong tasting (and I actually like strong tea).  I will buy this product again as it was a good value and for those times I don't feel like waiting to boil water and let the tea steep these Twinning K-cups are an acceptable alternative.

I am back  to Amazon to buy more of this brand right now. Even english breakfast  tea is different by the company who packs it. I like twinings the most.<br /><br />Try it and you won't regret it.

Twinings English Breakfast Tea, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)<br />I am English, and love a strong cup, Keurig has perfected the product. If you haven't tried Twinings English Breakfast teas, you should. I can't imagine having to make a pot, and have to look forward to luke warm tea.<br />Both Twining's and Keurig are now a staple for our house.

review/summary: Grounds in my tea
review/text: I like English Breakfast tea and there was nothing wrong with the flavor of this tea when brewed.  However, when used in the keurig machine, my tea consistently had grounds in the bottom.  It's not a big deal to have a few grounds in my tea, but there were a lot more than a few, more than could be ignored.  I ended up not drinking the entire cup because of it.<br /><br />At first I thought it was because most people in the office use coffee k-cups and I was getting coffee grounds in my tea.  But after switching to Timothy's brand of tea I no longer had a problem with grounds.  Usually I had no grounds in my tea or one.<br /><br />After brewing a cup of each, I cut off the foil top.  Both of them have filters built in and the Twinings filter didn't seem to be pierced.  But I had the same grounds in the tea that I hadn't had in my cups of brewed Timothy's tea.<br /><br />To sum up, if you want to avoid grounds in your tea and still have great taste go with the Timothy's k-cups (Timothy's World Coffee English Breakfast Tea, Decaffeinated, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)) instead.

review/summary: Weak Tea, Worse Company
review/text: I bought some of their tea and it so weak I thought it was a bad batch.  Then I made the mistake of trying to contact customer service.<br /><br />The first clue should have been that they're located in New Jersey.  I got all the respect and consideration you'd expect from the cast of "Jersey Shore".  Aside from the fact their phones are deliberately off, their email response was, "What's your problem?  What do you want us to do about it?"<br /><br />Buy this horse piss at your own peril.  If there's something sub-standard you're on your own.

review/summary: Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups - Bad Seals & Grounds
review/text: ** Update 11/05/2011 **<br /><br />I sent an email to Twining to also point out the problem to them. They replied to thank me for taking the time to bring the problem to their attention. They indicated they had addressed the issue and said they wanted to make things right for us, which they did.<br /><br />They sent a package with a selection of teas in a beautiful wooden box and also some boxes of the k-cup English Breakfast tea and a personalized letter from Monica, Twining's Customer Relations Representative (was not a canned letter response) again thanking me for taking the time to make them aware of the issue.<br /><br />I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised by Twining's gester. I just didn't think--or expect--a corporation would respond in such a personalized way to acknowledge an issue and to want to make things right the way they did. Bravo to Twining for understanding their customer-base is made up of individuals just like me that warrants a personal touch when things aren't quite right with a product.<br /><br />I can report I have not had the same problem with the new k-cups Twining send us and so it appears the problem has been resolved. As such, I have raised my rating from a 1 star to a 4 star, still withholding 1 star for the original issue. I will now return to purchasing the new red top English Breakfast tea k-cups.<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />Recently poor seals between the plastic part of the k-cup and the foil seal on top of the Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups have plagued us with tea leaves in the tea and overflowing tea leaves into the top of the holder requiring clean up just about every time.<br /><br />At first we thought it was our Keurig coffeemaker having a faulty seal and replaced it even though we'd only had the previous one for less than a year. However, upon purchasing a new Keurig we experienced the exact same thing right from the start. Of course, we then wondered if we'd bought a second faulty coffeemaker. That's when the light bulb went on and we realized the problem didn't happen with other k-cups--a different brand of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc--just the Twining brand English Breakfast Tea regular k-cups.<br /><br />It's a shame because we've been ordering and drinking Twining's English Breakfast Tea K-Cups at least a year or two now and it's only been the last two bulk batches we've ordered that have done the exact same thing. And, it's not just from one of the boxes. We've opened and tried k-cups from some of the other boxes and the same thing happens.<br /><br />The fact that it has done the same thing with two separate Keurig coffeemakers, it doesn't happen with any other brand or flavor of k-cup beverages, and it only happens with Twining English Tea K-Cups from different boxes from two different bulk orders pretty much narrows it down to the Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups themselves.<br /><br />I hope someone at Twining--we'll also leave the same feedback on their web site--will see this review and resolve this apparent and repeatable problem. Until then we're going to switch brands. Too bad because we've still got 6 boxes of the offending tea k-cups but having to strain tea leaves out through our teeth and having to keep cleaning tea leaves from the top of the coffeemaker holder isn't an option.

review/text: I drink English Breakfast Tea every morning.  Last Christmas I bought my husband a Kurig Coffee machine.  I was glad to see this tea reccommended in one of my food magazines so I ordered it.  It tastes exactly like brewed tea to me.  There is no leftover coffee taste from the machine.  Only water goes through the machine, then the water touches the tea in the K-cup.  So you have a great cup of tea in one minute!
