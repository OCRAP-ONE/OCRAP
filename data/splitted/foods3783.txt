review/text: The listing of the box describes as twice as many bars as there are servings.  Each foil pouch contains two very small bars, which together make one serving.  The 10 count is really a 5 count.

review/summary: Best store-bought cake mix
review/text: Before making my boyfriend's birthday cake, I heavily researched which was the best store-bought cake mix. This came out perfect--it is still really moist after storing it in the fridge for a few days. You do have to add a stick of butter so it's not good for the health-conscious, but if you want a really moist, sweet cake in a basic yellow cake recipe, this is definitely it! Will definitely use it again!

NOW thanks to the Interwebs and Amazon I can just click buy now and get cake mix delivered to my house in 5-9 days for the low price of $24.61.  No more wasting valuable time away from my afternoon stories at the store like some looser, now ups delivers my cake mix to my door.  This is A.W.E.S.O.M.E!  Now if only I could find a way to get milk this way, maybe milk from a remote Italian region.

In the ad, the boxes are over flowing with goodies...in reality, the snacks come in a hard plastic bag...not even as big as a single bag of animal crackers.  Even the popcorn boxes that are supposed to be the big treat boxes have a cheap single serving of popcorn in them.  Good thing I bought this on a lightening deal!  If I had paid full price, I would have been very upset!<br /><br />The best thing about this tower is that after the boxes are all empty, little kids can use them for stacking blocks!

review/summary: Dissapointing
review/text: I was very dissapointed in this item. It was much smaller than I expected. The picture makes it look like it contains big chocolate covered pretzels, but what you get is a bag of slightly crushed, tiny chocolate covered pretzels. There are mostly "fillers" in the boxes. I would say about 2/3 garbage fills each box. I could have made this same thing, better, for $10. This is not what I spent my money for. As this is supposed to be a gift for my in-laws, I decided to remove all of the garbage and move the food up, leaving the bottom box empty and got some gift cards to put at the bottom. Which I think is a cute idea, but I could have saved my money and just got the gift cards. I don't know how good the treats are, but they better be amazing considering the cost and the tiny amount you get. I swear I have seen this stuff in vending machines for 50 cents. I guess the only good thing about this gift is it is cute. The boxes are sturdy and it is just a cool setup. You decide if that is worth the price.

review/text: When I bought this (11/1/10), this product was called Broadway Basketeers Sympathy Gift Tower of Sweets (Large). I see it's  now called "...Hanukkah Gift Tower...." In any case, we had a death in the family, so this seemed an appropriate gift. The recipient said it was exciting to open each individually wrapped box and they enjoyed the contents. Unfortunately, the gift message I wrote with my order wasn't anywhere in or on the product or package. So, during this stressful time, the recipient and their family had to make many phone calls to various family members to try to identify who had sent it. I felt terrible. I definitely didn't want to put any more stress on them.

review/summary: REAL Ginger makes this excellent Ginger Ale
review/text: Hello.  I am reviewing this because I just tried this Ginger Ale for the first time.  I bought it because I have gluten intolerance, dairy intolerance, and have to limit certain grains.  So, I have all sorts of digestive issues.  Ginger Ale seems to really help, but if you buy Canada Dry or Seagram's, you're getting ginger flavor and high-fructose corn syrup.  Corn growers associations want you to know that the brain can't tell the difference between HFCS and sugar, but my colon can tell the difference.  So, I have been changing all items that I ingest into my mouth (toothpaste, mouthwash, food, drinks, etc) to ensure they're gluten free and not containing any definite triggers of problems.  I bought this based on the reviews and the ingredients, and I noticed an immediate result.  I could taste the ginger much better than regular Canada Dry.  Also, I tasted more ginger than carbonation which was very nice.  Within the first two sips I could feel it going down my esophagus and starting to help the digestion process.  I drank the whole can so fast because I fell in love with the flavor and the effect.<br /><br />This $24.00 is for 24 cans which is a decent price, especially if a Prime member; but, I can get a 6-pack for $3.99 at EarthFare which would make it about $17.50 for 4 6-packs (including tax here in TN), which is about $6.50 cheaper.  If you do not have local availability, I would recommend getting this.  And, if you have to order frequently, then I would recommend getting a Prime membership so you get the free 2-day shipping!

review/summary: First time trying an organic GingerAle
review/text: First I need to qualify this review by saying this is the first organic Ginger Ale I've tried.<br /><br />I do enjoy natural sodas, specifically Rootbeers made with cane sugar, so the taste of REAL sugar is something I love.  I hate HFCS.<br /><br />This is an acquired taste. The first one I disliked.  After a couple, it's actually pretty good.  The ginger is strong.  The soda is very crisp, even when I initially disliked it, I enjoyed the crispness.<br /><br />My 4 y/o loves it, my 6 y/o does not.  My wife could take it or leave.<br /><br />This is probably my least informative review ever, sorry, I just don't know what else to say and with no other reviews, I feel it needs... something to help describe it.<br /><br />Will I buy again?  Maybe, I'm going to try some other varieties and brands first.  In any event, I'll enjoy the ones I have left.  Remember, this is my first go around at organic gingerale, so take it with a grain of sea salt ;)

I tried about 3 or 4 cans and had to toss the rest because I just couldn't take it.

Evidently, it's an exceptionally good treat!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Agave Organic Nectar
review/text: I use Agave Organic Nectar in all of my recipes.  With a husband who is diabetic, this product does not spike his blood sugar.  When a recipe calls for one cup of sugar, I just substitue 2/3 cup of Agave Nectar.  Works great for a sweetner on fresh fruit such as strawberries as well.  Multiple uses...and no after taste as with some sugar substitutes.  I've recommended it to others and they use it in tea and give rave reviews.

review/summary: Amazing customer service
review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/text: This product seems to have replaced a similar previous product (Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt). The previous prodcut was a deeper pink color and the texture was better than what I was finding elsewhere. This new product (Himalayan Organic Natural Unprocessed Cooking Salt) is much more like what the competitors are selling. I've enjoyed all my products from The Spice Lab, but was disappointed with the replacent for this product.

review/summary: Great salt
review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/summary: For more than salting foods.
review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/text: Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.  Also, it's mined in Pakistan if that really matters.

review/summary: super fast shipping, free samples
review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/text: When I received the package, all pops were intacked (no broken ones). They were just what I grew up with and remember as a kid. The box had an adequate amount of each flavor except for the blue rasberry, but those were always a rare find as a kid. There were only two of that kind. That is one thing I would like to see change. Another upside, I have plenty of candy for Halloween.

In this last order, I ordered 3 boxes. About 1/3 of the suckers in each box were broken and most of the suckers were the blue & white ones...not a good variety.

review/summary: GREAT_just like when i was a kid- still good quality
review/text: I used to eat these suckers 30 years ago- i was glad to find them here- and also discover that they're still large, flat, round and full of flavor. some were cracked, but that's expected with size and shape of these- they're hard and bounce against each other in the box- so even if the outside of the box is wrapped well (which it always has been so far- bubble wrapped), you're gonna get some breakage. you can still eat the pieces and they are contained in the wrapper. out of the 48 suckers maybe 6-8 were broken but still edible and delicious. there were red and blue and green and yellow colors and<br />there was a good variety of flavors and a good price when $10 to $12. Have bought many times and still buying.

review/text: This Fries Seasoning is really good!! It's not overly salty. You can taste the sour cream and onion powder. They blend really well together. I have sprinkled it on food other than french fries. It's really good on popcorn too!  I have sprinkled some on cooked rice. It gave it really good flavor. I also fried some flour tortillas and sprinkled some of this on the tortilla before putting anything else on it. It's really good on meat as well. This is a very versatile seasoning. I am definitely going to be ordering more of it. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. It's definitely worth the price. The 9 ounce bottle is bigger than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Thank you Fries Seasoning for such a great, versatile seasoning.

review/summary: Not as hyped up to be
review/text: I had enjoyed this beverage at Ragland Road in Downtown Disney Orlando Florida; at which time it was superb.  So I wanted to buy some for home.  It was not as I had experienced at the restaurant which may because they combined it with something else without stating so.  Although the tea was good, it was not as I enjoyed in Orlando and certainly NO WAY worth the money...I think the bulk of the price was to pay for the 'sachet' composition and the jar.  Supermarket quality is how I would rate it.

review/text: I first had this tea at a spa in Dallas.  I liked it so much I asked where it was from.  They told me the company that makes it and about 5 canisters later, I'm still in love with it.  It is whole leaf tea - not the ground up dregs you get at the grocery store.  It is absolutely beautiful and very aromatic.  I swear I could use it for potpourri.  It comes in pretty little sachets, and it makes the perfect gift.  I took about 5 sachets and tied them up in a little plastic gift bag for Christmas for a lot of my friends.  Love love love this tea.  Everyone I've given it to loves it, too.  It's organic.  I add sugar - or honey drops also sold by White Lion.  Try the Cranberry Hibiscus, too.  I just ordered my thrid canister of that today.  Yum.  As a side note, I don't usually even like green tea.  Most of the stuff I've ever had tastes like a swamp.  This is delightful.  I hope you like it!

It truly feels like I am having a cocktail but I don't drink alcohol so this is a lovely substitute!<br /><br />I would love to be able to tell you some flavoring notes I pick up but its quite simple - its AMARETTO! lol I don't know how else to describe this. While I appreciate teas that give off a complex nature, many ways to describe the flavors within, this one is what it says it is no questions asked. A straight forward in your face AMARETTO and you can't ask for anything better than that!!

review/text: It does work! Two pieces wake me right up in slow-paced briefings. The Jolt spearmint tastes better than the military "Stay Alert" gum, but it's not quite as effective. It's also cheaper. Don't plan on chewing either for more than a few minutes. That's all it takes to absorb the caffiene, and  after that these gums get bitter.

review/text: I like to chew this gum before workouts and runs.  Caffeine takes 30-40 minutes to get into your system, so be sure to take that into account.  Two pieces is equivalent to one cup of coffee.  The taste is good, but it does fade after half an hour or so.  My wife said the gum made her feel ill, but I haven't ever had any side effects.

With Jolt Gum, you have a compact, easy-to-chew, easy-to-hide form of extreme caffeination.

review/text: This is a great company and I love the product! I have ordered the jolt hyper-caffeinated spearmint gum from this company for several months now, and have never once been let down. The product does give me more energy. ( sometimes it takes more than just a couple at a time to do the trick) But it has been a real lifesaver to me. I take them when I need more energy for driving, or any other time I need a boost. The flavor doesn't taste bad at all, so it is easy to take. Also this company is amazing in how fast they ship my order. I give it 5 stars! Great Company and a Great Product!
