review/summary: Zukes Mini Naturals - Healthy Treats
review/text: Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for "pee" rewards and larger ones of another brand for "poo" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces
review/text: My dog loves Zukes Mini Natural Treats! treats.  He expects them before he goes to sleep for the evening, and often looks for them when we just tell him he is as good boy.  When we run out of them he actually pouts because now he expects them every day.  What I like about these treats for our dog is that they are natural, no chemicals, and just the right size for our dog to chew (he is 28 lbs.).  Also, some of the proceeds go toward Cancer Research for animals, which I am all for since we lost a Jack Russell to cancer at the age of 5 (Lymphoma).  Very sad to see an animal suffer with Cancer, as with a human, and also to lose them, which is especially emotionally stressful.  We will purchase Zukes as long as our dog loves them - and we know this will be for his life.

review/text: My 10 week old learned out to sit, rollover, shake, and open a beer in 20 minutes with these.  Kidding on that part but he actually was attentive to his owner knowing that he would get this treat.  Definitely well for training, especially being all natural and only 2 cals each!  We have the lamb jerky as well, that he may enjoy even more (if possible) however it's not a treat for training due to the size and texture but I recommend those as well.  We start obedience class next week so hopefully they don't lost their magic :)

review/text: These look and smell pretty tasty, no wonder my dog loves them. These are perfect for obedience training because you can hold a lot in your hand. One thing though is that they dry up pretty quickly--but my dog doesn't seem to mind! She's had both the salmon and the chicken, but she seems to prefer the salmon.

review/summary: Perfect training treats
review/text: My beagle-daschund Pixel needed a lot of re-training when I got her, as her previous "owner" had neglected her for several months. The Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats were perfect for use in training, because they're small, low-calorie, and healthy, so I didn't feel like I was over-feeding her by using them throughout the day.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Pixel had a very sensitive stomach when I first got her, these treats never made her sick (her previous "owner" had not fed her regularly, she was underweight, and the food she had gotten was of poor quality, so for several weeks after I got her, most foods made her sick).<br /><br />I still use these treats, as they're made from good, simple ingredients, they're free of wheat/corn/soy, and they're low-calorie. Plus, Pixel loves them!<br /><br />A tip for using these tiny treats: I fill a plastic medicine bottle with these treats (they're small, and about 15 will fit in the container), and keep it in my jacket pocket to use while on walks.<br /><br />I also filled a medicine bottle with these and I keep it in the car, which has been useful in two ways. First, it's nice to have a treat for Pixel when she goes in the car. Second, while driving I have encountered my neighbor's escaped dog twice in the past few months, and having treats with me makes it much easier to catch her and return her to her home!

review/text: I used to give my 7 month Lab mix puppy Blue Buffalo Bits but I stopped because of the price and this resulted to be a great substitute! These are a whole lot cheaper - I paid about $7 for a 1lb bag of treats and my puppy enjoys them. They are a little "greasy" but that's expected since they are 'moist'. I usually train my puppy with a mix of kibble, biscuits and cut up greenies and this is a great addition to the mix.

review/summary: Perfect for puppy training class!! She loves it!!
review/text: My 8 month old golden retriever is surprisingly very picky about food. Our training class uses positive reinforcement with treats and lots of them. The last class, I ran out of hot dogs, and my puppy decided she didn't like bologna, or cheese anymore (which was all I had left) and was over it! She lost interest in training for the day after that.<br />I got home and decided to look for a really enticing treat that she will love and I found these on Amazon and for a great price too! She LOVES it and it's small enough and plentiful enough that a bag should last me at least a few weeks or longer of training.

review/summary: They smell soooo yummy!
review/text: My dogs love these and they smell so good I have been tempted to try them!!!  I bought the chicken variety.  They are way small so great for training purposes so that you don't overfeed your dog in the process of teaching him good behaviors.  Plus, they are natural so must be good for the doggies.  I will definitely order them again when we run out.  Shipping wasn't the speediest on this item which I found strange because I have the Amazon prime 2 day shipping.  Not super slow, but it was longer than a week before I got them so I had to buy some others to use in the meantime.  Maybe it got lost in the mail, not sure.  One of my dogs will not stop begging for these when he sees I have the treat pouch!

review/summary: Brody Loves These!
review/text: I am all about providing my puppy (6mo. shihpoo) all natural treats in moderation.  After signing up for a puppy class and him learning some things, I am making sure to reward him when he listens and obeys commands.  After a while you realize that your choice of treats becomes very important to keep him happy and healty.  I saw this had high reviews here so I decided to give them a show.  He really likes them!  They are nice and small so he can easily chew and swallow them, and the bag is huge!  I am used to buying the Blue Buffalo treats so this seems to be a bit more bang for the buck :)  The only "con" is that they really are smelly (chicken flavor).  Not sure about the other flavors but they smell like a bottle of vitamins.

There are the perfect size and I don't feel too bad for giving her a couple at a time.  We haven't really started training her but giving them to her every time she goes potty outside rather than inside is working out great.

review/summary: Terrific treats
review/text: Izzy, our rescue Mini Schnauzer, has tummy issues. We've had to go to a sensitive stomach dog food, and be very careful with what we feed her for snacks and treats. We've been looking for treats she'll like, with ingredients she can have, and made in the United States. With Zuke's we get it all.<br /><br /> We also have to limit how much treat she can get in a day, but with the small size of these treats, about the size of pencil eraser tips, so we can give her 3 or 4 and use them as rewards when training.<br /><br />She loves the salmon flavor, and while I can smell they are salmon, they don't stink and my hands aren't gross after giving Izzy her treats. So far we have hadn't any bad reactions and she enjoys getting a yummy treat, she doesn't have to know it's good for her too!

review/text: Small and soft enough for a quick reward when training my puppy. It doesn't hurt that she also loves them. They do smell strong but nothing worse than typical dog food, plus the odor keeps her attention. The only downside (if you would call it that) is that they are a little on the "oily" side. Just a tad but enough to keep a lingering smell if you don't wash your hands right away, which I would do any way so really is no big deal.

review/text: I bought these over a year ago on the recommendation of a dog trainer. I had tried several others, all of which were OK.  These are the most strong-smelling and apparently tasting treats I have ever seen, and our Lab really responded to them.  You do have to keep them in a sealed container or they will dry out.  They are a bit expensive compared to some others, but  I found that I could cut them in half and get the same effect when using for training (and save a few bucks).

review/summary: Little doggie attention magnets!
review/text: I am a trainer at a local no-kill shelter.  I work with all different types and temperaments of dog, and the only common denominator is that I need their undivided attention and a reward they'll do almost anything for.  Plus, being a wide population, I needed something with a simple ingredient list (so as to avoid digestive issues).  THIS IS THE TREAT!  I am a huge fan of Zuke's already, but was dubious as to whether or not one type of treat would suit the tastes of so many different dogs.  The chicken flavor has yet to fail me.<br /><br />Low-calorie, a universally appealing flavor and the perfect training size.  Bonus for trainers: they don't smell half bad!  However, their scent is still strong enough to work as a puzzle toy filler, a Kong filling, for tracking or scent games or to just grab focus from an enticing squirrel. ;)<br /><br />Even previously feral and non-treat-motivated dogs seem quite happy that I bring these.  Highly recommend.

review/text: I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market.

review/summary: Salmon Dog Treats
review/text: Mini Naturals - 1 pound - Salmon Flavored<br />Great product for training dogs!  I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching).  They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward.  Unlike dog kibble or other treats, these are quickly digested so that your dog will not be gagging on them as he/she works on the next behavior.  To keep fresh, keep bag tightly closed and put a portion of the cut treats in a resealable sandwich bag.  If they do get exposed to air and dry out, a small portion of a moistened paper towel in the bag will restore them to original texture.

review/summary: Dog likes them!
review/text: My dog likes these treats, but definitely prefers the peanut butter ones better.  One strange thing I've noticed with these treats is that they tend to harden very quickly -- so you're best off buying the small bag (seen here), not the bigger bag.  It's strange -- the salmon flavor does harden faster than the peanut butter flavor.  But, all in all, they're a good treat to feed your dog because they're so small.  They're perfect for training, and Zuke's is always full of good things, not some crappy ingredients like some other dog treats out there.

review/summary: Great for training!
review/text: Surprised of the bad reviews because of the smell, . . .come on seriously?  Dog lick their privates and smell each others butts.  I mean the smell is hardly that of a baked apple pie but I love that these treats are made of natural ingredients.  I also love the perfect pea sized shape.  Not to much and not to little.  My puppy loves the stuff and I've gotten him to do all sorts of things.  Catch a frisbee, sit, down, shake, sit pretty, play dead, roll over, fetch, touch a target, say his prayers, stay, and come and he's only 4 months old.  I make sure that I adjust his feeding when I treat so that he does not over eat for the day.  These are great.  I buy the peanut butter flavor.

review/summary: Great in Every Way Except they STINK!!
review/text: I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the "natural" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the "natural" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs.

review/summary: Good treats!
review/text: Our puppy loves these little treats! They are small enough to give him a few at a time, but I like to cut them up even smaller and use them for training. They are tiny as is (about the size of a pencil eraser), but can easily be cut into quarters for reward-based training. I will always keep these in stock for him!

review/summary: My dogs like them, but they STINK!
review/text: We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside. They worked great for that, and our dogs finally got the message! But they really don't smell appetizing, and even one of the salmon ones will make their breath smell terrible for a whole day!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. If your dogs like them as much as ours do, I think it's well worth the stinky breath.

review/text: I read that chicken jerky from China is dangerous for dogs so I was looking for another treat they would eat.  This was not one of them.  It didn't matter how hungry they got, they wouldn't eat these.  They sat on the floor two days.  I picked them up, threw them away and then tried again a few days later with fresh treats.  I left them in their treat spots.  They sat there for days.  They would not eat them.  It doesn't help if they were made in America but my dogs find them unpalatable.

review/text: I think the title explains it. We cut it into quarters and use it for rewarding our puppy while we train it. Took us 24 hours to teach a 8 week puppy to use the outdoor for relieving itself. The dog will do anything for a reward.<br />Do be careful in how you store it as it will dry out if exposed to too much air.

review/summary: Chicken-Flavored Treats
review/text: This review is for Zuke's Chicken-Flavored treats.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is their overwhelming smell. It's not pleasant at all, almost like they're on the verge of spoiling. I've left the bag open accidentally and returned to the whole lower level of my house reeking. Even after putting them in a sandwich baggy for training during our walking session, the smell clung to my coat. Basically, anything these things touch, they'll share their smell with.<br /><br />Stench aside, these are fabulous treats. My dog responds more readily to them during our training sessions than any others I've tried so far (guess what disgusts me smells like heaven to him). They're also already the perfect size, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I'll definitely try out some different flavors next time.

I appreciate the quality of the ingredients.  It's not easy to find good treats which don't require refrigeration.  These are small and soft and perfect for class.  They have enough smell/taste appeal to compete with other normal training class environment. I've purchased these in a number of flavors for use in classes and with my own dogs. I recommend them to my students because of the quality and convenience.

Fits *anywhere* and seals tightly so no smells and they stay fresh. Easy to refill. Only holds a little but but a small portion is all we need.

review/text: My miniature schnauzer has a sensitive stomach.  She has tolerated these without a stomach upset for several years now.  The treats are so tiny that she can have several a day for all the good dog behaviors she has.  They smell good but I have never tasted them.  By saying "Zuke" she will stop barking or come to me in an instant and I will give her a Zuke.  And she still feels she is the boss. Additionally, I add these to her prescription diet dog food for dogs with sensitive stomachs and she eats her meal. She is a very high maintenance but adorable and loving.

Of course, if you keep them in the package or a ziplock, they don't dry out, but when I'm training with them and have them in my pocket, they do start to get dry.<br /><br />Training has been great with these treats.

I keep them with all his other treats and if I've forgotten to seal the bag, the whole cabinet starts smelling! They do harden up if you've left the bag open. My dog is a typical lab and very very food motivated. I try and keep mixing his treats to keep him motivated and these are definitely treats he'll do anything for!

When I forget and leave a few in my pockets they do turn into little pebbles. Small price to pay for no preservatives!!

review/summary: Good product, but packaging problem
review/text: My Wheaten puppy likes these treats and I like that they're made from good ingredients. But I gave this product three stars, because there was a problem with its packaging. The interlocking seal doesn't line up, so the bag is impossible to close. I guess I'll just repackage the treats myself. It's not a huge problem, but I'm just a little disappointed.

review/summary: Leo would walk through fire for salmon, through rain for peanut butter
review/text: I bought Zuke's mini treats in Salmon (and then in peanut butter) to re-enforce good walking behavior for my Australian Cattle Dog, Leo.  I liked the fact that they had no added chemicals and were only 2 calories each. They are similar in texture to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D2578G">Pup-Peroni Original Beef Recipe, 5.6-Ounces (Pack of 4)</a>, but they do not contain by-products, corn syrup, onion powder (onions are toxic to dogs), or nitrates like Pup-Peroni does.  They are cut to a good size--like a pencil's eraser-- a dog does not need to eat a whole stick for a treat-- 2 seconds of flavor is 2 seconds whether its a mini treat or a stick swallowed whole.  They do dry a little over time, but that's because they keep the preservatives to a minimum.  Leo definitely does not seem to mind the texture change, and they retain the very strong salmon smell Leo loves.<br /><br />I do, however, have one caveat for dog parents who plan to give these as training treats. For Leo, the salmon minis are what the trainers on TV call "high value" treats. It took 2 weeks for me to use them on walks at all because they made Leo too excited to walk!  When I opened our first bag, the scent hit his nostrils in the next room and he came running to me in the kitchen, as if I were cooking fish or s roast. I made the mistake of saying, "I think the mail man brought a present for Leo," and he immediately started running through his entire repertoire--small though it is. He tried to sit, lie down, sit, shake with the normal paw, shake with the other paw, lie down again, sit again--you get the picture.  I actually had to spend 2 weeks training him how to calm down enough to receive this treat! I still cannot let him use his teeth to take the treat because he is too excited and will inadvertently nip my fingers or the skin of my palm--I trained him to take it with his tongue.  He thinks the peanut butter are wonderful, but he does not become apoplectic for them.  I use the peanut butter for walking treats--he loves them enough to walk properly, even when it's raining.  I save the salmon for dessert and to motivate him to stay calm in difficult situations, like bath day.

review/text: My Sheltie loves these treats! They are great for training, just cut them in half to make them last longer. I also love that they are 2 calories each, another reason they are perfect for training. Just make sure you keep the bag closed, or they will dry out! The salmon flavor doesn't smell too strong or make your hands smell. My dog also loves the peanut butter flavor, which actually smell delicious! These treats are moist, which my dog seems to prefer. We haven't bought the chicken flavor yet but I'm sure they are excellent as well. I will never be without these treats!

review/text: I tried this for my dogs for the first time a few months back. They are the pickest dogs about treats that i have ever seen and the only things i could get them to eat was another known brand of the chicken nuggets. I decided to try these and they we're smaller then i expected but i gave them a try anyways and i could not believe it. They all ate it right up and now after 2 more orders of them they are still begging for them every night. If i don't give them one or forget to they all sit and stare at me or bark untill i do. I do use them as treats rather then for training. I hope they never quit selling this product and the shipping was really fast not to mention the good price and the large bag size. Thanks for everything. I will keep buying this for as long as i can.

review/summary: My cockapoo puppy loves these!
review/text: My pup, Miltie, is 7.5 months old and so far he's not tired of the Zuke's treats at all, and he's had them since the first month I brought him home. He sometimes eats too fast, but I've had no problem with him throwing up. Other treats have given him "poopy" messes, but he doesn't have that with Zuke's, which are worth the money.  He's had PB & Chicken mini treats, Filet Mignon chews...he adores them all, and the 16-oz. bag of mini treats can last him a long time. The trainer is his puppy kindergarten class recommended these, and I'm glad she did.<br />I'd like to get the "Dental Fresh Breath" treats, but Amazon.com doesn't ship them and the shipping is almost as much as the product...that's not cool.

review/text: I had some trouble finding kibble sized dog treats, I had been breaking up smaller ones. I needed a smaller size to work with my dog's food puzzle since he won't use it if it only has plain kibble in it. These are great! About the size of a pencil eraser or a green pea. My bag says that each treat is 3 calories, not 2 as it says in the description, just an FYI. The salmon ones stink pretty bad, but dogs love stinky treats. They are kinda moist and squashy so I wouldn't put them in my pocket. They also turn the feces black. Kinda gross. But poodle really likes these so I bought him 2 bags. For the price and usefulness, they can't be beat!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Treat
review/text: Right now, "Mini Naturals" are the only treat that I give to my dog.  I prefer them for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Ingredients:  When you buy any food or treat for your dog, it is always important to look at the ingredients and the first ingredient especially.  The first ingredient in the chicken flavored mini naturals is chicken.  In a lot of other treats it is something less nutritious like sugar or corn meal.<br /><br />2) Calories: I have a dog that gains weight easily.  Each mini natural has only 3 calories.  Many other treats have 15.  My dog has lost a little weight since I switched from the other treats I was using to mini naturals.  Although the treats are small in size, they are large and tasty enough to get my dog to do what I want him to do (most of the time).<br /><br />3) Flavor: My dog seems to like the chicken flavor the most.  He will eat the others but definitely seems to notice the difference and have a preference for chicken.  They all look the same to us but maybe not to our dogs.<br /><br />4) Buying on Amazon: I have been buying mine at a health pet food store.  But I was pleased to notice that it is actually a better deal to buy them on Amazon.  I will be doing this in the future.

We usually get the salmon because the smell is irresistible to our dog. When I have them around, a whiff and a look from me and our dog is sitting & staying for a treat. We also stuff a kong with it sometimes. We have 2 more bags around just so that we don't run out. We tried the peanut butter, it was great too but we keep coming back to salmon.

review/summary: GREAT TREATS!!
review/text: I purchased Zuke's mini naturals in the Chicken flavor based on all the amazing reviews I had read on Amzon.com. Not only I was so pleased with thisproduct, so was my lil 4 months old lab pup! My husband and I used these mini treats for training and rewarding. The product was a great value as well. Just because each individual treat was so tiny and there were so many of them in one bag...it would've lasted a lot longer...if my mischeivious pupppy didn't get into the bag when my husband and I were gone...Yes, he loved these treats SO much, maybe too much that he ATE the ENTIRE BAG!!!! I was really concerned at first when we found out he had eaten almost a full bag (I bought the 1 lb bag about 2 weeks ago, so it wasn't completed full but there were still A TON of left in the bag). But, I was a little bit relieved knowing at least this product was made out of all natural and high quality ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start was although the treats were made out of all natural and high quality ingredients, the smell was AWEFUL! My husband wouldn't even reach into the bag to get the treats...and after I gave these treats to my puppy, I had to wash my hands to get the smell off. That was my only complain about this product, otherwise, AWESOME product! I didn't plan on purchasing another 1 pound bag that soon but since my pup ate em all, I'll have to buy it AGAIN!
