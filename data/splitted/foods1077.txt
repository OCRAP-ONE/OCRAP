review/summary: Great, All-Natural Taste With Zero Calories or Carbs
review/text: If you want something to help mix up the daily bottles of water that you bring with you to work - this is what you need.<br /><br />No more chalk-flavored, gritty mixes - Stevita is your answer. It dissolves completely in a bottle of water without having to blend anything - just a few shakes back and forth and you're set.<br /><br />The packaging says that it will mix well with up to 16oz of water but I will tell you, I have used a single packet for an entire gallon of water and you can still taste it.  If you're wanting a stronger, more noticeable flavor, then I would stick with around 16-20oz of water and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />In fact, I liked this so much, I just ordered two more boxes.

review/summary: HOORAY!
review/text: I recently cut back on sugar, and have been using Stevia instead. I've been SEARCHING for flavored drink options that use Stevia instead of chemical sweeteners, because glycemic index is one of the things I'm focusing on. A friend told me about Stevita packs. I ordered one box of each flavor, and I love all of them! Lime is my absolute favorite. I gave up carbonation & cola 2 months ago, and I'm pretty picky about taste. A lot of "healthy" things I eat aren't my favorite, but these are awesome. If you're looking for a great flavor option for your water without chemical sweeteners...this is it!!!

review/text: I sent Stevita an e-mail asking for free samples and they sent me a packet of this along with two Stevita packets. I really enjoy making my own lemonade with the Stevita, and this lime was excellent! There is a little bit of the "fake sweetener" taste at the end, but it's nowhere near as bad as nutrasweet/aspartame. I added a little bit of real lime juice to give it an extra kick. It's very satisfying and enjoyable, yummy! I think I will buy some :)

review/summary: I really LOVE this stuff!
review/text: When I realized I was allergic to artificial sweetener I thought my days of drinking calorie and sugar free drinks were over. I was so excited to find this stiff. I've been happy with all the flavors I've tried so far. There is a trick to preparing it though. I recommend shaking the water to mix it in better. After you shake it the first time, let it sit for a minute to let the powder dissolve, then shake again.<br />The lime is my favorite and it's the subtlest flavor. It's not too sweet and leaves no bitter taste. The cherry is ok if you like those types of fruit flavors, and the strawberry is good, but really sweet. They all take a little extra shaking to dissolve completely though. This is a great product and I can't wait till it hits supermarket shelves. I highly recommend trying it.

Pear's has a rich taste and like any other coffee can be brewed for a strong or a mild flavor, depending on the number of scoops used. No hard bits have hit my grinder blades yet; for my money, this is a great buy! It's not Kona, but it's pretty darn good.

review/summary: Cheap price for cheaper coffee
review/text: I purchased this coffee for my office when our usual stuff was unavailable, thinking that it seemed like a really good price for decent coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was wrong. This coffee is horrible. The beans aren't processed very well before roasting, so there's all kinds of chaff left behind. When you grind the beans, you get all this stuff that looks like pencil shavings. Plus, you'll occasionally find some random shells in there - something that looked like half a pecan shell but was significantly harder broke one of the blades in our bean grinder. Awesome.<br /><br />The roast is somewhere between medium-light and medium. The flavor is bitterly bland. It takes a lot of cream and sugar to make this drinkable.<br /><br />I'm never buying this again.

review/summary: Really wished that I liked it!
review/text: I was so happy to see that Betty Crocker had a gluten free line out and that I could get it on sale at my local Target! I bought the brownies and the devils food cake mixes first and LOVED LOVED LOVED both of them. I eat gluten but my 3 year old does not and I couldn't even tell that they were gluten free. Being as excited as I was about the brownies and chocolate cake I decided to give the yellow cake a try as well. I really wished I liked it but I didn't. The cake looked great but had a funny taste to it and a strange smell. First I thought I did something wrong so I went over my steps but I did what the box said and even used real butter and a good vanilla extract. I really think that this can be great because the texture is amazing. Hoping Betty Crocker changes the recipe because this has potential.

review/summary: Finally an inexpensive, good-tasting GF mix!
review/text: I admit, I was very skeptical of this mix, since it has most a rice flour base. Most of the products we enjoy have a blend of flours, including bean and sorghum. However, I heard good things from other at our Celiac group, and tried it in a fruit cobbler recipe in one of Bette Hagaman's books. It was SO good! Everyone enjoyed it, and couldn't tell it was GF.<br /><br />Now, making it as a cobbler may have meant that it had plenty of moisture to avoid the dry taste some others have mentioned, so if I make it as a plain cake or cupcakes, I will try the suggestion for the pudding mix and increase the liquids slightly. However, you can't beat the price. In our local supermarket, it is far cheaper than other GF products, and only a tad bit more than non-GF cake mix. Amazon's subscription-price isn't much lower than our supermarket, so I'll still buy it there. We've had well-meaning people ask over the years what they can buy to make for my son, and I haven't wanted to burden them with the typical expense of GF mixes. This product is available everywhere and is very reasonably priced, so kudos to Betty Crocker!!!

review/text: I just made this cake and I had to spend forever mixing! (perhaps that was because I didn't soften the butter). When it came out of the oven it was a nice golden brown color and smelled good. However, it's not really a cake in my opinion. Perhaps the rice flour made it taste like cornbread, but it definitely is not sweet or fluffy enough to be a cake. I like Bob's red mill cake mix much better. However I am still on the hunt for the perfect cake mix!

review/summary: NOT BAD.... NEW TO GLUTEN FREE RECIPES!!!!  STILL LEARNING....
review/text: I gave this product a 4 star rating for several reasons.  I have never tried any other mixes nor have I made my own yet.  My daughter has a problem with wheat and I am attempting new things first for myself to see what I could feed her without her becoming discourage about certain types of food.  My daughter is only 19 months.<br /><br />First you should know I made this in a counter top oven/ toaster oven (black and decker x-large oven) in a 9x9 square analon (dark pan) so I used the 325 degree setting.  I kept a very close eye on this cake, because I didn't want to dry it out knowing it was going to be a totally different texture cake then I am normally used to with wheat.  It turned out good when I only left it in for around 21-25 minutes and then took it out and tested it with a toothpick in the middle (it came clean). Remember my heating elements are close to the food in this oven and it is a small cooking area.  I did exactly as the recipe called with the butter, vanilla, water and 3 eggs(egglands best x-tra large).<br /><br />The texture and aroma reminded me a little of corn muffin.  It isn't a complete texture like that but if I would have kept it in any longer it would have dried out and possibly tasted moreso like corn muffin.  I didn't mind it... I was really expecting something really different and possibly something I would totally snub.  But Hope is there.  It really wasn't bad.  I like vanilla cake over chocolate, so I would definatlely do it again.  It may be really good with a fruit, like cherry pie filling and COOL WHIP (NOT SURE IF EITHER IS GF).  I used the betty crocker "fluffy white" frosting which is also gluten free.<br /><br />GIVE THIS A CHANCE.  YOU MIGHT REALLY LIKE IT.  IF IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THE FIRST TIME AND YOU WANT TO PUT FORTH THE EFFORT AND TRY IT AGAIN KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE WHILE IN THE OVEN AND PULL IT OUT SOONER CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO DRY IT OUT.  I ALSO REMOVED IT FROM THE PAN WITHIN 5 MINUTES OUT OF THE OVEN, SO IT WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO COOK IN THE PAN.  I HOPE THIS HELPS.  BEST WISHES AND GOOD LUCK.<br /><br />IF ANYONE TRIES OR HAS TRIED THIS USING OIL INSTEAD OF BUTTER, LET ME KNOW HOW IT CAME OUT.  I'M SURE THERE IS A GOOD REASON WHY BETTY CROCKER WANTS US TO USE THE BUTTER.  I WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF THEY ARE PRODUCING THIS PRODUCT IN A GLUTEN FREE FACILITY.  MAYBE THEIR WEBSITE WILL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I'LL HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT SOON.

review/summary: Betty Broke My Heart
review/text: Oh Betty, you vixen, you flirt, you tart! I longed for you all summer long, but Betty, you are all show and no go.  You promised me the moon and the stars and great taste but you gave me a ghost town in the dessert. You are pretty, Miss Betty, but you are dry and spongy.  I had the feeling that I could bounce you across the floor, and then wash the dishes with your silken sponginess. I tried making this cake twice Ms. Crocker, and both times, I was less than enchanted. I did not live happily ever after. My gluten-eating husband ate the first cake, and he loved the taste and texture too, and the fact that it wasn't crumbly and annoying.  I gave Betty high marks for that too; most gluten free products leave you feeling like Hansel and Gretel in the forest, with a trail of crumbs.  I used this mix for cupcakes the first time. The second time I baked a cake and frosted it, thinking that if I under-baked it for a shorter time, at a lower temperature, that I would finally feel the love. Sadly, I did not. I still found the texture too spongy, and the cake too dry.  I ended up tossing the cake out.  I do however recommend the chocolate cake highly.  It compared favorably to my favorite homemade gluten-free cake.  The brownies were also pretty good, and I have bought both the brownie and chocolate cake mixes more than once.  I am hoping that Miss Betty gets it together and improves this formula.  The price point is excellent for this line, but I just am not loving yellow Betty. In general, the line is superior to most of the commercially available mixes.  I would recommend using yellow Betty for cupcakes, because you can freeze them and frost and eat them one at a time, or toss them one at a time.  The texture is definitely better the second and third day, but the first day left me annoyed, both times.  When Marie Antoinette was sent to the guillotine for saying "Let them eat cake," it was probably a cake very similar to this one.  She deserved death for that, I say.  I would not have been the first or last citizen to scream, "Keel zee beetch, Crockaire!"

review/summary: New to Celiac
review/text: My 2-year old daughter was just diagnosed with celiac and I have been doing a lot of research on products. We haven't tried the new Pillsbury mixes, but I for one am very glad to see a major manufacturer realize that there is a huge market for gluten free products, especially ones that taste good. We will definitely be trying these products.

review/text: The cake mix is really good, my friend likes it.<br />I was hoping to be able to eat it but I can not have any foods with phosphate ingredients and almost all baking mixes do (with the exeption of a few canadian ones for cornbread).<br />Guess I'll have to stick to making my own cakes with phosphate free baking powder.<br /><br />Don't know why companies insist on putting phosphates ingredients in everything when they are so bad for everyones health....cheapness I guess as the aluminium phopshate baking powder costs $4 for 250 grams....

review/summary: A great mainstream gluten-free option
review/text: People, PLEASE don't review a product before you've tried it. It gives the impression that the product is not good, which is not the case here.  I understand your concerns about the ingredient list.  Call Betty Crocker or go to their website.<br /><br />I think we need to do all we can to SUPPORT mainstream companies coming out with gluten-free products.  The more we do this, the more products will hit the market.  This will make products easier to find (local grocery stores), cheaper, and tastier!<br /><br />That being said, this product is actually good.  The Betty Crocker website has a lot of recipes to use with the gluten-free mixes.  I tried the carrot cake recipe with the yellow cake mix and it was GREAT.  The only downside is that it only makes one layer, so if you are making a two-layer cake, buy two.  Yes, that gets expensive.  It's part of gluten-free living,is it not?

review/summary: OMG... These are so good.
review/text: I just recieved my Betty Crocker Gluten Free yellow cake mix today and couldn't wait to make up a batch of cup cakes. They just came out of the oven and with the execption of adding a box of sugar free Jell-o instant pudding to the mix and halving the butter with coconut oil I followed the directions exactly. There was enough batter to make 12 standard size cup cakes. These are a big hit with my kids and husband(who is not a big fan of most GF baked goods) so we will definatly buy this product again and again. I also noticed that these have about 100 less calories per serving than the standard yellow cake mix which is really nice, thus making each cupcake really close to 100 calories each. Mmmm, I'm gonna grab a second before they disapear.

review/summary: Best GF cake mix on the market!
review/text: This cake mix is wonderful! It is moist and has a great taste and texture, plus, it is not overly salty- a problem with MANY GF things. I don't know why people are complaining because I am gluten free as well as vegan, so I have to highly modify the mix, and it still turns out great! If you want to make a lower fat version, just use 1/3 cup applesauce instead of 1/2 cup butter(or earth balance in my case). Overall, it is a great value, one of the best and most inexpensive mixes on the market. Nobody can tell it is gluten free. I love it!

review/summary: Good Job, Betty Crocker
review/text: They had all four mixes at my local grocery, in the regular baking aisle. And the boxes say the mixes are prepared in a gluten-free facility. Gluten-free going mainstream, Yeah!<br /><br />I decided to try the yellow cake as that's the hardest one to get right.<br /><br />I looked carefully at the mix under a magnifying glass and felt it with my fingers. The rice flour in the mix looked and felt very smooth - the only large particles I saw were sugar crystals. So it looks like they are using an extra-fine milled rice to reduce any grittiness.<br /><br />I baked up a batch as cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly. It took me about 5 minutes to mix up the batter, piece of cake :-)  I tested them with a toothpick after baking for the minimal time to make sure I didn't over-bake them. I actually needed to add 3 minutes.<br /><br />My gluten-eating wife and I tried one without frosting so we could get a real feel for them. We both thought they had very good flavor and texture. There are a lot of different styles of yellow cake and these are close to the slightly spongy style, which is the one I prefer. The main difference we noticed between these and flour-based cakes is that the crust was crispier than in regular cupcakes. This was unnoticeable after they had sat a while and particularly after I put some commercial canned chocolate frosting on them. They basically tasted like the mix cupcakes I use to get as a kid, although with a slightly stronger butter and vanilla flavor than I remember - both which I think are a plus.<br /><br />Thew next day they were still in good shape but not as tasty as the day I made them.<br /><br />I think these products are an excellent introduction to gluten-free baking. Very easy directions, something anybody who has ever baked anything can follow.<br /><br />The only complexity for someone baking a gluten-free product for the first time is that the recipe calls for gluten-free vanilla. In my opinion, all the commercial vanilla extracts I've looked at are gluten-free. Some people are worried that the alcohol used in the extracts might have been made from a gluten-containing grain. But the one study I've read on this didn't found any gluten in the extracts analyzed. You wouldn't expect protein to make it into a pure distilled alcohol. But if you are preparing this for a gluten-free friend, you should ask.<br /><br />Like all mixes, the prices is somewhat high - I paid over $4 for the box. And I think I can do a little better from scratch. But for someone who doesn't want to purchase a bunch of gluten-free flours and xanthan gum, these are a great place to start.

review/summary: It really tastes like CAKE!
review/text: I have several motivations for writing this review:<br />First:  To counter the folks who dissed it in this forum without trying it. Amazon has now provided the full ingredient list.<br /><br />Second:  To extol praise and thanksgiving that a mainstream, nationally recognized company has heard and answered the plight of the wheat-free and gluten-free community by providing us with easily accessible gluten free products, having made the substantial investment in a gluten-free factility.  I believe such a commitment on our behalf deserves our appreciation.<br /><br />Third, and most important: To tell whoever wants to know that Betty Crocker GF Yellow Cake Mix is really easy, and REALLY GOOD!<br /><br />I found and purchased the Betty Crocker GF Yellow Cake mix in my local Kroger store, right in the "normal" baking mixes aisle.  I was so excited that I nearly took a picture of it sitting on the shelf along side the products the rest of the baking world purchases!<br /><br />The mix requires 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter (or equivalent), 3 eggs, and 2 tsp of vanilla.  I used 2 whole eggs, and the equivalent of a third egg using liquid egg substitute.  The cake baked up beautiful, golden, and delicious.  I suggest testing the cake for doneness 5 minutes before the minimum baking time, as the edges were a little bit browner than the rest of the cake, but that certainly did not detract from the taste in the least.  The texture (except for those edges) was perfect.  Really just like a yellow cake should be.<br /><br />Please know that the mix makes a one-layer cake, just like the picture illustrates.  Bake it in an 8 or 9-inch square or round cake pan, or make cupcakes.  But don't plan on a two-layer cake or a 13x9 from just one box.<br /><br />I took the cake (with dark chocolate frosting) to a covered dish dinner, where it was the most popular cake on the dessert table, even though I was the only person eating gluten-free.  AND it is just as good the second day!<br /><br />Honestly, Betty Crocker has succeeded in making a "real" yellow cake with GF ingredients, in a dedicated GF facility.  And Amazon's price is better than my local store.<br /><br />What's not to love?  Thank you, Betty Crocker.

They made an excellent base for shortcakes, and also for scary big ice cream sandwiches.  Oh my.<br /><br />Yes, the ingredients are not listed here on Amazon, and they aren't on the Betty Crocker site either (last I checked), but they do clearly state that the facility is dedicated gluten-free.  Giving a one star review for this lack of info is just tacky, and ultimately very unhelpful to the rest of us.

review/text: I purchased this mix as well as the Betty Crocker GF Chocoloate Cake Mix from one of our local supermarkets in anticipation of a visit from a nephew with multiple food allergies (gluten, yeast, milk, soy).  Not only did he love the cakes, but also did not experience any sort of reaction, in spite of the package warning that the mix may contain soy ingredients.  It must not, because his soy allergy is probably the worst of his long list.  His mother now keeps these mixes on hand.

review/summary: Could Be Better...
review/text: First of all, I do want to thank Betty Crocker for creating cake mixes for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  That said, I was a little disappointed with the yellow cake mix.  The cake was dry and had a slightly spongy texture.  I also did not find that the flavor was as rich as it might have been.  I was also put off by the use of a stick of butter and I checked the Betty Crocker website to see if they had options for a lower fat version.  Nope!  In fact, they warned that the mix should not be altered.  Another disappointment is that the mix only makes one 9X9 layer, so, making a layer cake becomes very expensive.  I did make a half-way decent bundt cake (though not very high) by adding an extra egg, milk instead of water, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and a package of lemon pudding.  It was fairly moist and very tasty, especially with the addition of a vanilla glaze.  I will continue to experiment with the mix just for the sake of convenience, but, I will not make the basic cake again.

I added a packet of vanilla pudding mix to make up for the poor flavor on another try, but it didn't work either. The chocolate version is much better. The flavor is not good enough to buy again and it doesn't even make a whole 2 layer cake.

review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in April 2011, it's December and i've lost 80 pounds...Celiacs out there know how expensive some of the imported gluten-free baking mixes can be, and they all taste like they're gluten free...I used to LOVE cakes and cookies, and I thought my favorite foods were a thing of the past until I stumbled upon this little gem.<br /><br />This cake mix has a great fluffy texture, tastes FANTASTIC, and in my opinion, is the closest thing to a normal cake you can get.  There is very little discernable difference between this cake mix and my previous pre-celiac favorites.  My wife, who is a sweet food connoisseur of sorts, eats this cake too...she tries to support me by voluntarily being gluten free.  We have even tricked some of our relatives into eating this thinking it was a normal cake..they never knew it until we told them.<br /><br />As others have stated, please don't listen to the negative reviews on this product.  It is truly amazing. The cost may seem steep, but to buy all the gluten free baking flours (i.e rice, potato, tapioca, etc.), you'll be paying alot more to make a lesser quality cake.<br /><br />I stock my pantry with all of the Betty Crocker GF products, and I really do appreciate their efforts to make GF products more affordable and accessible.  These can be found in a NORMAL supermarket, not a high dollar specialty food store.<br /><br />Those who live GF for fad dieting or other reasons...please don't negatively review this product, to a true Celiac, who CANNOT eat most cakes and cookies, this stuff is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTY CROCKER!  If you're listening, I hope you continue to make this product for years to come.

review/text: Going gluten-free wasn't too hard, but when the holidays rolled around I started to miss all the treats. Luckily I had purchased a box of the Betty Crocker gluten free yellow cake mix. It is made from rice flour which gives a taste very much like regular wheat cake mix. My kids didn't know any different. I slightly undercooked the cake so it had a small underdone area on the top which I just scraped off. I made butter cream frosting from scratch, and it was so good.<br /><br />On a side note, I was considering trying the chocolate cake mix too, but when I saw the first ingredient on the label was sugar, I figured I'd be better off using this mix and adding melted chocolate to it. That'll be my next cake. This cake was moist, firm yet light and had good texture. Make your own frosting, it's worth it!

He ate half a cupcake and didn't want anymore.  I taste tested myself and it was gritty, bland,dry and became even more dry and gritty the next day.  I made this mix a year ago before I found out my son also has an intolerance to soy.  I now purchase pamelas chocolate cake mix which he loves and it doesn't have any soy.  Pamelas also has frosting which you can make into buttercream which is also soy free.

review/summary: Not fantastic, but so quick and easy
review/text: This is the first of Betty Crocker's new GF line that I've tried. The reason I chose this one was because my household isn't big on chocolate, and even though brownies get eaten, I've heard it's super easy to make GF brownies, so I figured I'd try the cake. I made cupcakes. Box says it makes 18, I made 12 good sized cupcakes. I baked it for exactly 18 minutes and the toothpick just had a couple of crumbs on it, so I took them out. I immediately removed them from the cupcake pan and placed them on a wire rack to cool. They seem to have baked well. Now I haven't made yellow cake in... who knows how long. It's just not something I ever made pre-GF. I've definitely eaten my fair share though. I bought the mix with plans of doctoring it up with The Cake Mix Doctor (Paperback) to make a more interesting cake. The texture is okay. Overall the cupcakes remind me more of a soft cornbread. That's fine. I love cornbread. Maybe with frosting they'd be more like cupcakes. I added some lemon curd to two of them. Yum. I think this is a great start from Betty Crocker, but the yellow cake is boring by itself, and seems more muffin-like than cupcake. Perhaps I overbaked? But the doneness seems pretty perfect. I would buy this again, to make a Doctored up cake or cupcakes, or for another Friday night quick and easy craving.<br /><br />Also, I was delightfully surprised when I checked the ingredients list and saw so few ingredients! Rice flour, sugar, potato starch, levening (details on box), xanthan gum, salt. The end! No trans fats.

review/text: At last, a REAL yellow cake!  This mix bakes like yellow cake, tastes like yellow cake, can be used interchangeably with your favorite yellow cake mix!  It is moist, a bit dense, good enough to eat without being frosted.  YUM!!!

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: Let me first start by saying we are not gluten free because we have to be. We are gluten free by choice. I made this cake to try at accommodating some family members that are gluten free.<br /><br />As a cake baker, this cake is mediocre. The texture of the batter is gritty (what do you expect when it uses only rice flour?!), but may be because I didn't throw it all in as the instructions said. I was worried that throwing in a stick of butter and eggs with the water and mix would yield a weird texture itself. However, it baked well. I found that it cracked on top though and it is so dense and heavy. This is not a light cake by any means, and if you're trying to make a layered cake, you have to be careful as it will crack easily and really feels like it will just crumble in your hands if you're handling it. The taste is just ok. It has an ok texture and decent moistness, but the moistness borderlines an undercooked taste, in my opinion. When you cut it, it falls apart and pulls if you aren't just cutting straight down. Mine definitely doesn't look like the picture on the box!<br /><br />I would say that if you have to be gluten free and have no other option, this might be a good quick cake for you. I think there are other choices that may taste and act more like a 'real' cake if you find the recipe. There are multiple gluten free blogs that have yummy looking and sounding cake recipes (which I intend to test). Why not a coconut flour cake? Or a combination flour cake? Rice flour alone is not my first choice.

review/summary: By far the BEST GF cake mix I've found!
review/text: My little girl is allergic to wheat and I love baking for her. We've tried multiple brands and haven't been satisfied. I decided to give this gf cake mix a try and it makes PERFECT cupcakes and cakes! So fluffy, the texture is identical to its wheat counterpart! My only complaint is that it's made with rice flour. I wish there were other Betty Crocker GF cake mixes that use potato or tapioca flours. My daughter also happens to be allergic to rice but she gets a cake made with rice flour for special occasions.

review/summary: Great for Banana Bread
review/text: This cake mix makes a fantastic gluten free banana bread. I got the recipe from the Betty Crocker website in their gluten free recipe section. If I'm making cupcakes, I usually prefer the chocolate mix, since it has a better texture. But when the vanilla bread is baked into the banana bread, or any of the other recipes on the website (cookies, etc), it's very good. Much less expensive than other brands. If yuo're having texture problems, try looking at their website for solutions rather than just posting that it's no good.

review/summary: I tried it, but....I won't again.
review/text: I too, am very grateful to Betty Crocker for making better-priced gluten-free products, and I have tried their brownie mix, a "cake-type" brownie, but still good. Though I am partial to chocolate, I tried the yellow cake mix.  I made cupcakes. In Betty Crocker's defense I didn't frost them, which may have made a difference, but I wanted to taste the cake itself. I really wanted to like them, and I had high hopes, but......sweet sawdust.  I'm sorry, but that's honestly what it tasted like to me. I ate one after cooling them a little, and the next morning I couldn't bring myself to try again.  I threw out the other 11. Sad but true.

review/summary: The worst GF cake mix I've ever tried
review/text: Hands-down, this is the worst tasting and most expensive GF cake mix I've ever had. It's VERY DRY and GRITTY. I was so excited to see that Betty Crocker came out with a mix but it's SOOOO disappointing. This would never pass a taste test with a non gluten crowd. Whole Foods sells a GF chocolate cake mix under their 365 brand and it's far superior to this. But I'm sticking with my homemade recipe.

review/summary: Works great with the Cake Doctor book
review/text: These cake mixes are pretty good for gluten free when they are made according to directions. But combine them with a recipe from Ann Byrne's book "The Cake Doctor Bakes Gluten Free" and they are really great. My wheat-eating husband who is extremely picky about what GF products he will eat even likes them. Cakes where you add a pudding mix or pureed fruit turn out particularly well, and we like to make a Boston Cream Pie with pudding between the two layers. It also helps to make sure you don't overcook the mix and don't use too big of a pan. I make most of my GF baked goods from scratch, but it's so nice to have these mixes. I make one almost every weekend -- I actually kind of like that they make a smaller cake -- there's enough for dessert without too much leftover.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761160981">The Cake Mix Doctor Bakes Gluten-Free</a>

review/summary: This mix is a great find!
review/text: This mix is extremely easy - you only need to add water, butter, vanilla and eggs.  What's great is that the consistency after mixing all of the ingredients is very similar to the regular Betty Crocker cake mixes, not thick and lumpy like some gluten free mixes.  One box makes 12 normal sized cup cakes, a bit less than a normal mix but that is understandable.  The taste and texture of the finished product isn't too much different from normal cupcakes and they are fantastic for gluten free!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a gluten free alternative!

review/summary: Great Cake Mix Esp. as a base
review/text: This is a great cake mix.  Really reduces the cooking time of baking gluten-free from scratch.<br /><br />I highly recommend going to the bettycrocker.com site and looking at their recipes using their gluten-free mixes.  Our 2 favorites so far using this mix is the Carrot Cake recipe and the Pineapple Upside Down cake.  Please, if you like pineapple, do yourself a favor and go to their site and make the upside down cake.  I did it using pineapple chunks, subbing the butter for 1/4 cup applesauce, using the pineapple juice from the fruit can for the water & cooking about 10 min. longer (higher elevation).  We were raving...three of us ate the whole thing in one sitting.  We just couldn't believe how good it was.<br /><br />I can't imagine not adding some kind of flavor to this mix - either real gluten free vanilla, apple pie spice, lemon flavoring, something.  Yellow cake mix just isn't that - whoopdee doo - if you know what I mean.  But this is a GREAT cake for a base to springboard from to make something really special without having to scoop & mix a bunch of flours.<br /><br />The only reason a person with gluten intolerance might react to this mix is that they have secondary food sensitivities while healing that may cause symptoms like being glutened.  There are a great number of people who are recently diagnosed that, besides gluten, must avoid dairy & soy (both are ingredients in this mix).<br /><br />Betty Crocker's GF mixes are totally gluten free and made in a gluten free facility.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I had high hopes for this cake-- I really wanted to love it, but I was disappointed. I followed the instructions exactly and the cake came out of the oven with good color, texture, and moistness. However, the flavor of the cake was a little off. My husband said it tasted like formaldehyde-- and while I can't imagine how he knows what formaldehyde tastes like-- the cake did have a strange chemical-taste and odor. Even a good thick layer of Betty Crocker's chocolate frosting couldn't cover that taste. I ended up throwing the cake out.

review/text: This cake does not taste like cake, it tastes like bread. Having just been diagnosed as being allergic to wheat, I am used to easting wheat cake and this is no substitute. The only reason I give it two stars is because I have tasted worst cake before and at times you can taste a bit of what this should taste like. I am going to try the Devil's Food cake flavor, but this is not a good flavor at all. I will not buy it again and would not recommend it.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I bought this mix at my local grocery store today. I live in a tiny rural town with expensive groceries, so I paid about a dollar more than the Amazon price. I wanted to try one box before buying bulk. Because usually? I don't like gluten-free baked stuff. I usually find it off-tasting, gritty, or with a beany aftertaste (yuck.) This was just--plain, simple, Betty Crocker yellow cake. It had a nice spongey texture and a nice crunch to the outside. I loved it! I've only been gluten-free for nine months, but this was by far the best mix I've had. And it's easy to see that it's a base for more creative treats. The eggs and butter are an awful lot of added fat and calories, but I noticed that I needed far less of this cake to be satisfied than I did of regular cake when I was eating gluten. I've substituted applesauce for fat in regular cake mix, but gluten holds things together. I'd be afraid to substitute too much with this expensive mix for fear that it wouldn't work. The eggs bind the cake.

review/text: I've only made this cake once. I was not impressed. I wanted to make a 2 layer cake but there was not enough in the box to do that.....but I was not aware of that at the time. I put half of the batter into each cake pan and baked as directed. It came out crumbly and dry.<br /><br />I WILL SAY THAT ALLLL THE OTHER PRODUCTS IN THIS LINE ARE SUPERB!! So, I am wondering if I should have just made a single layer, etc. I bought more and am gonna give it one more shot.

review/summary: Good but need a little help
review/text: Ok so this is pretty good, if you follow the dirctions exactly and mix for the right amount of time it turns out nice...yes maybe a little spongey but not dry.  Don't know what other reviewers are doing to make it dry.<br /><br /> However, while the texture is not perfect it makes a great base for my pistachio cake and other flavored pudding cakes.  I put a box of pudding in the cake and then I make another box of pudding with half the milk it calls for and mix it with my cream cheese/coolwhip frosting. I guess you could have any flavor cake you want...only limited by your imagination.  If it is to dry put some pudding in it, if you want vanilla put a box of vanilla, it helps with the mosture. I have only found one recipe better, unfortanly after baking it once for a birthday party I lost the recipe so I thank betty crocker for making something that even my picky gluten eating husband will scarf down.<br /><br /> I do wish it made a double layer cake...but the other mixes don't make a double layer either so it is still cheaper than buying two of them.  And for all those looking for ingredents they are listed above.<br /><br /> I also like that there is no milk in this and none called for for people who have milk alergies as well.

review/summary: Even works when made with vegan ingredients!
review/text: We've been gluten free for years now, and I can make just about anything.  Except for yellow cake.  I had totally given up on ever again tasting that yellow cake mix/chocolate canned frosting combination I love so much.  Until now!!!  I was hesitant to try this mix because it calls for butter and eggs and because of multiple allergies I can't use any dairy or egg products in my baking.  I decided to attempt a substitution when I found the mixes available at my local grocery store.  I used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks and Ogran egg replacer and crossed my fingers.  Cooking time was the same.  The cupcakes came out perfect!!!  They taste like a slightly denser version of what I remember from "regular" Betty Crocker mixes and with some homemade vegan chocolate frosting were amazing.  We have since made several batches of cupcakes and a few cakes.  You do need two mixes to make a two layer cake.  The main difference I have noticed is that you pretty much need to make this cake the same day you're planning on eating it, as it does dry out in a day or two (perhaps because of my substitutions).  It is edible the next day, but not really party quality.  Frosted cupcakes freeze and defrost well, a lifesaver for school parties.  Thank you Betty Crocker!!!

review/summary: Great Gluten Free baking mix
review/text: This cake mix worked out really well.  I made cupcakes for my sister's birthday, she's GF.  What she really really wanted was a yellow butter cake with chocolate icing.  We've had not great success with other GF baking mixes, but I thought with Betty Crocker's reputation I would definitely give this a try.  The texture was really close - I'm not sure that anyone who didn't know up front that it was gluten free would have noticed anything off.<br /><br />I will say that the taste of the cake by itself wasn't quite up to par with the "gluten-full" yellow cake mix of theirs.  But it was definitely a success.<br /><br />I may add butter extract to try to replicate the taste of the regular cake mix.

review/summary: Wish it was better, but my wheat eatting husband likes it
review/text: My husband and I have eaten three of these cakes, so i feel that I can honestly rate Betty Crocker's gluten free cake mix.<br /><br />I have Celiac disease and must eat a gluten free diet or I get very ill.  This cake NEVER made me sick so it is completely 100% gluten free and safe for those on gluten free diets.<br /><br />My husband can freely eat wheat, but he cannot have artificial colors or flavors, so he really enjoyed this cake.  He says it is better than a number of the gluten free cakes we have tried.<br /><br />Personally though, I found that the cake was too dry if you cooked it as long as the directions listed, yet if you tried to take it out earlier it was uncooked in the middle. Plus the cake alone did not taste very good, you had to put icing on it to make it tasty and though my husband loves icing, I am not a fan of icing. I like cake plain.  The cake was also very dense and not fluffy and I love fluffy cakes.<br /><br />So though this is a decent gluten free cake mix, it is not great. I will continue trying new options until I find the best cake mix out there.

review/summary: It's ok.
review/text: Because it's easily available, this is my go-to mix when I need to make something. Because it only makes one layer, I use it to make cupcakes, muffins or a layer I can split and fill (such as Boston cream pie).<br /><br />The mix is rather lackluster by itself; it needs help. Because it has plenty of xanthan gum in it, it's easy to doctor this mix. Recommended additions are blueberries + lemon peel, or peanut butter, or a mashed banana and a dash of cinnamon. Vanilla always helps too.<br /><br />By itself the texture is rather dry and coarse. I coax the most out of this mix by using buttermilk, vanilla, and the two-stage mixing method.

review/summary: Not the Best, Not the Worst
review/text: I tried this cake mix and it came out lacking.  I've tried several brands of gluten free cake mixes and this one was second from the worst.  It was dry and the texture was not great.<br /><br />I used it to make a gluten-free pineapple upside down cake and we also had a non gluten-free one and not only could you tell the difference, no one wanted the gluten free version.  If you have to dabble with the cake mix so much, then its not a successful cake mix IMHO.  Otherwise, why not just get a good gluten free baking book and make one from scratch?<br /><br />Much better luck with Pamela's mixes and Kinnikinnick.  I don't think Kinnikinnick has a yellow cake mix, but they do have white and chocolate...and you can't tell they are gluten-free in the least.<br /><br />Am not planning on buying this mix again, unless they improve it.

review/summary: Good cake mix, but expensive
review/text: I used this mix in a castle-shaped bundt pan as well as cupcakes for a birthday party.  It came out of the castle pan easily and held the decorative shape well.  Everyone at the party (mostly folks who don't usually eat gluten-free) enjoyed it.<br /><br />I didn't realize at first that I would need two mixes, so I actually wound up baking the cake with the bottom half chocolate cake and top half yellow, which turned out to be perfect!<br /><br />The only drawback is that it's quite expensive since you need two of these mixes to get the same amount of batter as a regular cake mix.  One box will only make 12 cupcakes or one 8- or 9-inch pan.

review/summary: Addicted
review/text: I've been eating gluten-free for about 10 years now.  Betty Crocker's Yellow Cake is honestly the best GF cake you'll ever taste.  I have an addiction to this stuff and am not allowed to keep it in my house anymore.  I have no self control once this comes out of the oven... ;-)

review/summary: Craving right now!
review/text: I just had my son's birthday party. Two of the guests were gluten free, so I made two BC yellow cakes; one regular and one gluten free. Boy were we delighted! 4 or the 5 people that tried both cakes preferred the gluten free! And let me tell you, we are big time cake fans around here. There at the end, the gluten free people had to fight for their right to have cake. It was like a vegetarians at a pizza party and only one cheese pizza. No one ever wants to order just cheese, but when the pizza comes, they all take one cheese and a meaty slice, leaving the vegetarians with scraps and too hungry to fight off the hordes. Really, meat eaters, eat you pizza and leave the cheese alone. Remember you didn't want it in the first place. But, I digress. The cake is very good!

review/summary: Use with Cake Mix Doctor Bakes Gluten Free Cookbook
review/text: I bought the Cake Mix Doctor Bakes Gluten Free book because I liked her others. Use the Betty Crocker mixes as a base for her recipes. The cakes taste so good that my friends have all been surprised at the results. I've even have had requests from non-GF friends for a couple of the cakes. The chocolate is good, too.

review/text: Try the recipes on BettyCrocker.com to make this cake mix more versatile. Experiment with your own twists to the recipes. My husband thought he would never get baked goods that had the same flavor and texture of non-Gluten Free baked goods.<br /><br />He is happy to report that the baked goods I am now making are as good as the gluten filled counterparts - Thanks to Betty Crocker's GF mixes, recipes, and my own experimentation.

review/summary: SO Grateful to have this!
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and Gastroparesis (a disease wherein the stomach does not empty properly, and does so only very little at a time, which causes pain, nausea, and worse). Before the Gastroparesis was diagnosed last month, I had used this cake mix MANY times, changing the flavor with extracts, increasing moisture with plain yogurt or sourcream and applesauce. And frosting it with all kinds of frostings and toppings. With the added dairy and applesauce, I have been able to reduce the eggs when I have wanted to do that. I haven't quite adjusted it for high altitude (I live in Denver), but if I am ever able to eat this wonderful cake again, I will add 2 tablesoons gluten-free all-purpose flour, which will probably make it bake more evenly.  This mix can no doubt be adapted into cookies (just search online for cookies made with cake mix). NO ONE in my family or friends has ever been able to tell this is a boxed mix cake or that it is gluten-free. No one. Betty Crocker, I've known you for at least 50 years! You are a brand I can trust.

review/summary: excellent
review/text: This is an excellent mix.  I'll admit I haven't tried many because I was afraid they just wouldn't be any good. Finally I was craving cake so much I just broke down and bought this mix.  I am so glad I did.  My 13-year-old made cupcakes with it and they were so yummy I ate two.  No more missing out on birthday cakes for me.  My whole family will be getting these cakes from now on.  Thank you Betty Crocker for making the lives of Gluten-sensitive people a little brighter.

review/summary: I LOVE this!
review/text: It is very difficult (and expensive) to find a good GF cake mix.  This is amazing.  The non-celiac members of my family don't even notice they are eating a GF cake (and believe me, I usually hear about it if I try to sneak something by them.)  As with all GF baking, I've found that it helps to follow the instructions EXACTLY as they are printed on the box.  That means, mix in the order it says and stir the way it tells you - GF baking is a tricky science.  Thank you Betty Crocker for your new GF products.  It makes my celiac disease a little bit easier to deal with.

review/summary: OK taste, but very dry
review/text: I have tried the GF yellow cake, 2 different times, and both times it was very dry from the beginning.  Has a good flavor would make a good shortcake or maybe pinapple or other juicy fruit might help but not a good cupcake/birthday cake.  I like the conveince, but to dry!  Their GF Brownies are great though!!

review/summary: Makes a good pineapple upside down cake with minor adjustments
review/text: Thank you Betty Crocker!  This is a very good cake mix for those who aren't comfortable cooking from scratch. Those whose reviews include concerns over texture have a point. Any mix almost entirely from rice flours will feel a little different on the tongue. This one does as well. Accept that and you will enjoy this product. As a change of pace, use pineapple juice instead of water and line the bottom of your plan with pineapple and brown sugar mixed with a little of the butter you would use in the cake (add back an equivalent amount oil to keep the texture of the cake).

review/summary: Something is missing...
review/text: I can't put my finger on it but something is missing when it comes to this cake.  I am really glad that there is a major brand making gluten free baking stuff but I wish this particular mix was better.  It just isn't as flavorful as it could be.  Like the chocolate cake it also suffers from the heavy denseness of the rice flour.  More flavor and different flours from an airy-er texture would be an improvement.

review/summary: tasty cake
review/text: I found this to be a very tasty gluten free cake. I baked it as per directions in  a round pan. The second time I tried one of these, I added a cup of apple sauce to the mix. It produced a moister and tastier cake. I have tried other gluten free cake mixes and I would rate this cake mix to be one of my favorites.  You do have to mix it well and cook it the right amount of time. If you don't mix it well , it wont be as smooth.  I rate this cake at least a 9 out of 10. If you order it on a subscription basis you will pay about $3.00 a box at that price - it's a very good bargain.

review/summary: Fabulous gluten-free cake mix
review/text: Betty Crocker has done a fine job with this cake mix. I was nervous about the outcome since the batter tasted a bit gritty, but it cooked up wonderfully. Although it is considerably more dense than regular cake mixes, the taste and texture is fantastic. The cake tastes like it was made from scratch (cornbready), which I think is more enjoyable than fluffy cake. Overall, this product did not dissappoint. I cooked it in an eight inch round cake pan for about 35 minutes, split it in half using a piece of thread, used a buttercream frosting and sliced strawberries for the filling, and then iced it with the remaining homemade buttercream frosting. It was fabulous! The dry texture of the cake makes it an excellent choice for strawberry shortcake type recipes. Great product, Betty Crocker. I can't wait to try the other gluten-free mixes.

review/summary: Much too sweet
review/text: I would encourage people to try one box of this cake mix before ordering the package of six, to make sure you like it.  It was far too sweet for my taste.  Now I have to find a way to use up the other five boxes in a way that will be more palatable.  I think I'll add some unsweetened cocoa powder and turn them into chocolate cakes. Or I may try adding some lemon juice.  Those of you who like a really sweet dessert should enjoy them.

review/summary: This gluten free cake mix is awesome!
review/text: I made this for my daughter's birthday because her brother cannot eat gluten. She had her party at her grandma's house. Grandma suggested that she make her own separate cake because "no offense, but there was one year that no one finished the cake".Most of the gluten free cakes I have tried were more like pound cake and tasted it too. I refused to let grandma make a separate cake, so I came across this Betty Crocker mix and it had a great texture and flavor! Everyone loved it and kept complimenting me on the cake! I'm not sure why the negative reviews on this product. Maybe they didn't do something right...I did notice a lot of people attempting to alter the recipe. Maybe they just have very high standards. I don't know, but this cake is great. My only complaint is that you have to purchase two boxes to make a full size cake (hence 4 star review), and I prefer non-processed sugar. But the sugar complaint is due to my own personal preferences based on our natural diet. I can look past that.

review/summary: Worth the 15 year wait
review/text: Gluten free has come a long way since I first was diagnosed fifteen years ago. I have not had a decent piece of cake in all that time until I tried the Betty Crocker Gluten free yellow cake mix.  It was light - fluffy - moist - yummy.  Every thing else that I have tried has been heavy or grainy or dry or all of the above. My only complaint is - why don't all the stores carry it?  So many people are on gluten free diets now!  In all of Saint Louis - I haven't been able to find it except on Amazon.  ?!?

review/summary: This is excellent!
review/text: Keep in mind that I've only tried this mix as cupcakes, I've never tried baking a cake with it.  For the people that didn't like it, I suspect that it was cooked too long.  I've done that and it was BAD.  This is one of the reasons I make cupcakes instead of a whole cake.  You have to watch them like a hawk and as soon as you put in a toothpick and it comes out dry, take it out immediately.  One minute too long and they're done.  But when cooked properly these are excellent!  My kids love them.  They taste a lot like regular yellow cake, and with some good icing on there I bet nobody would be able to tell the difference.  These cupcakes saved my son's birthday when we first found out he couldn't eat gluten.

review/summary: This cake is FANTASTIC! Just like the real thing!
review/text: I was expecting for this cake to turn out as dense and as hard as a rock, but boy, when I opened that oven door, it smelled AWESOME! The cake was moist, fluffy and excellent, I loved it! I even recommended this cake mix to a professional wheat-free bakery that makes rock cakes. I swear, I have cheated a few times before, and this stuff is just as good as a wedding cake. Speaking of wedding cake, if I ever get married, this is going to be what it's made of. I know all you skeptics out there think I'm just probably not a very picky person, but I swear, try this cake. If you cook it correctly, you will NOT regret it! I had my brother try some without telling him it was gluten free, and he just woofed it up and said it was terrific. He was amazed to learn that it was actually gluten free. This will be the best gluten free cake mix you can get your hands on. When I took a bite of this cake, I almost cried, for two reasons; 1. This cake was everything I wanted and more, and 2. The cake was burning my tastebuds off because it was so hot, I couldn't wait for it to cool off! It looked sooo good. BUY THIS CAKE! IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT GLUTEN FREE BAKING!

review/summary: A Decent Cake For Busy Gluten Free Cooks
review/text: Kudos to Betty Crocker for jumping into the growing gluten free marketplace with a reasonable price, good-tasting product.  For those who don't usually like mixes, especially from large food corporations, let me say that this mix has nothing artificial in it and just brings together the gluten free ingredients would buy yourself.  You even add your own vanilla ~ nothing artificial.  I have served these as cupcakes to people who *can* eat gluten and those people either said they were indistinguishable or preferable to regular cupcakes.<br /><br />The cakes do easily over-bake, and do dry out within one day (as do many gluten free baked goods), so I give them a 4 star rating.
