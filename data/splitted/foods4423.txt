review/summary: Yummy.  Maybe Too Yummy Given the Calories
review/text: If you like sesame sticks, these taste great.  They're crispy but not hard, a little salty, a little sweet, and entirely addicting.  Therein lies the problem.  Although the ingredients sound good, I'm not sure it's really all that healthy.  I can (and have) eaten a whole bag in one day, and that was 750 calories.  Each bag supposedly has 5 servings, but I've never gotten that many out of it.  I really like the taste, but I'm not sure I'll repurchase, due to the calorie content.

review/summary: Really good canned tuna
review/text: This is a very good canned tuna in olive oil, in a usable 5 oz size. I know it's "Chicken of the Sea", but perhaps this stuff is from a different part of the chicken than their regular canned tuna! Additionally, being packed in olive oil adds a fuller dimension of flavor to the tuna. Most tuna today is water packed, and I believe that takes away some flavor.<br /><br />After the excess olive oil is drained, we use it for casseroles, sandwiches, or just eating on a salad. The flavor is better than other canned tuna we have tried and we keep a stock of it on hand. This 24 can size case sounds like a lot, but if you eat tuna regularly as we do, it will go pretty fast.

review/summary: This is what tuna used to taste like
review/text: If you're tired of tuna that tastes like wet cardboard, try this. I'm not young, and this is the tuna we used to have when I was a kid.<br /><br />Sure it's packed in oil, but it's healthy, monounsaturated olive oil, and you can always squeeze most of it out, because the flavor remains in the tuna and not in the oil.<br /><br />This tuna doesn't require much seasoning, but I put in dill, thyme, black pepper and sometimes chopped celery and sweet pepper. Rice vinegar (milder than the regular stuff) or lemon juice round it off. Great in a salad, or add a little mayonnaise for a fantastic sandwich.<br /><br />This is the REAL tuna.

review/summary: Good flavor and very tasty
review/text: We consume a lot of tuna cans in our household, so I decided to purchase bulk from Amazon.  The one I always get is in water, so I am excited to try the one in oil.  I am certainly not disappointed.  It tastes great and saves me trips to the store to constantly purchase more.  I usually just mix the oil in and we use it for sandwich.  With the one in water, I have to squeeze it hard to get the water out then add a lot of mayo, so I'm not sure it's healthier than the one in oil.  Overall, we love this product and will definitely purchase more in the future!

review/summary: Freakin' Amazing - Where did it go?
review/text: This is some amazing tuna - hard to describe why it's so much better than regular tuna.  Has a rich and bold tuna flavor without the smelly and overly fishy flavor and is complemented by the not too olivey olive oil.  People say to drain the oil...WRONG.  If you do this, you are missing out.  Both the fat of the fish and the fat of the oil are good for you.  The fish provides Omega 3s EPA and DHA, while the olive oil delivers monounsaturated fat that actually helps you to burn fat.  Don't waste good olive oil.<br /><br />Also, why is this item unavailable??  I need it now!

review/summary: Tuna to die for...
review/text: Simply put: this is the best tuna in olive oil available to us peasants. First time I tried it was on a whim. I thought, I loathe tuna in water,(except when it's swimming, I'm all for that) somehow it is not right with my world. So I looked on amazon, and there was the answer to my tuna conundrum. I got it home lightening-quick with amazon prime, and cracked a can open. Eureka! This sheiss is the bomb! I even eat the oil with it, without draining it. I recommend red wine vinegar (the pomegranate flavored one is good) a sprinkling of coarse salt, some freshly-cracked pepper and you have a satisfying lunch. You get 24 cans for $42 if you subscribe, which is a little more costly than when I buy it at the store for $1.44 a can. It's up to you if the extra cost of (approximately) $7.44 is worth it. I usually buy it at the store 2 cans at a time for one reason; tuna contains mercury and if I have a small case of the best tuna I have ever eaten just lying around eye-balling me, I'm gonna gorge myself (eating 1 or 2 cans in a day) and end up with a fist full of yummy-tasting mercury from hell-heaven in my body. Yes?<br />So, my conclusion?<br />If you are a hermit who never leaves the house or someone who lives in bum-fight, Idaho, and all they have is Chicken of the Please Shoot Me Now, then buy it here. If you are a consummate city-dweller with access to 1.5 million brands of tuna, then buy it a few cans at a time and preserve a little lettuce in the process. Either way, you will think it's worth it for such sublime, insurmountably awesome flavor, like an angel just had an orgasm in your mouth.

review/text: Everyone in my household loves this juice, from toddlers to adults, but I have to say that it tastes more like apple juice than it does grape juice.  I am guessing it's a mixture of white grape with apple, and the apple taste comes through strongest.  Better than apple juice alone, but if you hadn't told me I was drinking grape juice, I'd have never guessed I was.  Knowing that it's grape, I can taste the grape very slightly, and I don't mean the concord variety!

review/text: Tega's Rooibos Blackcurrant is a dream come true. I've been looking for this tea for quite a while; it's a VERY rare combination in the United States. Tega ships it in packs of 6 with 20 sachets in each pack. The sachets themselves are paired together in the box and must be ripped apart (they are perforated, which is easy). This is common with organic teas because when you're done you can compost the entire thing.<br /><br />The tea is mild and calming; it's definitely not a spicy or awakening tea. The blackcurrant brings a fruity flavor and aroma to the tea, but it isn't overpowering. Every person that I have shared this tea with has fallen in love with the fact that it isn't powerful. Many of them have preferred to drink it without any sweetening agents, others have said that a little honey makes it just perfect.<br /><br />You can steep the tea for as little as 2-3 minutes to get a full, robust flavor--or you can steep the tea for the entire time you drink it; it doesn't become bitter like green teas.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it's caffeine-free and therefore non-addiction inducing, nary a winter day goes by when I'm not compelled to heat up a mug of this tea.

review/text: I bought a jar of Bonnie's Country Classic Mustard BBQ sauce after sampling it at a local food fair called Pride of Dakota. Later that week, I used it on ribs in the slow cooker and it was absolutely delicious. I love mustard flavored things, so naturally, I love this BBQ sauce, although the mustard taste is very subtle. Even my husband loves it and he isn't usually a mustard fan. It's just the right mix of tangy, smokey, and sweet. We love it.

review/summary: Willy the Hillbilly is Back!
review/text: I'm a fan of Mountain Dew from way back. It and Mello Yello were the only sodas I liked as a kid. I've stopped drinking it regularly for health reasons, but anyone who decides to drink the golden elixir doesn't do it because it's healthy. That's a given.<br /><br />Dietary concerns aside, Mountain Dew (and other sodas) have gotten too sweet for me as I age. I finally found the Throwback at a local drug store and decided to do a side by side comparison between the Throwback formula and the current Mtn Dew. Comparing the ingredients, it seems the primary difference is that the Throwback formula replaces the HFCS with real cane sugar. Also, there are fewer calories and sugar carbs in the Throwback version. The big beverage companies claim there is no taste difference between HFCS and sugar. But when I tasted them side-by-side, the Throwback has a mellower, less sickly-sweet aftertaste. To my taste buds, it's just better.<br /><br />I don't indulge in soda often. But when I do, I'd want it to be the Throwback version. Let's hope Pepsi Co keeps it around for a while.

review/summary: Almost as good as Pappy's still
review/text: PRE-PRE-REVIEW WARNING:<br /><br />This is a serious review, unlike some of my recent spoof efforts.<br /><br />PRE-REVIEW WARNING:<br /><br />Don't order this here. While it has apparently been a regional release, many large retailers (including Target) have carried it on and off since 2009. And from recent accounts, Pepsi is going to leave it on the shelves even longer now (see article in Comments section below.) So check locally first. My Super Target carries exactly this 12-pack for three to four dollars. Compare with the thirty-five bucks (including exorbitant shipping) some Amazon merchants are trying to get!<br /><br />On to the review. I will keep it short, because the important thing is that old fashioned Mountain Dew (labeled "Throwback" just like "Heritage" for Dr. Pepper) tastes much better with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Less harsh and more enjoyable. If you drank Mountain Dew prior to the sugar switch back in the mid 1980s, you will almost surely prefer this. For younger drinkers only accustomed to fake sugar, who knows? Their taste buds may have been irreparably harmed. LOL<br /><br />It doesn't come in moonshine jugs, but at least you get Willy the Hillbilly on the cans. One recent tweak is that orange juice concentrate is back in the formula. I didn't catch the initial 2009 Throwback release but evidently it was missing the OJ. I would be curious to try this retro brew in glass bottles, but since I don't recall doing so even when I was younger, it's not a dealbreaker like it might have been for Coke (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GIZRY">Coca Cola, 11.5 oz.</a>).

review/summary: Sugar!
review/text: I did catch the initial summer 2009 release of Throwback and bought 48 cans worth of it, expecting to relive childhood nirvana! After the first taste I immediately realized something was missing. I compared the ingredients to the HFCS - ORANGE JUICE! I am not the only one to notice this... [...]<br /><br />Spotted the new package on the shelves and was not really sure if it was PepsiCo Mountain Dew, so I inspected the box. Delighted to find that this was indeed genuine Dew and even better... ORANGE JUICE is back in the list of ingredients! This is much closer to the Dew of yore.<br /><br />While it is closer to the original, the formula still seems tweaked. The HFCS version has 46g of carbs, the new Throwback still has 44g. IIRC the original either had 42g of carbs or 46g to match the HFCS version. Also, the "new" Throwback seems to lack some of the yellow die from the original (I can remember it staining the can - this almost looks clear). While this has nothing to do with taste, it does make me wonder how far away this is from the original recipe...<br /><br />Either way, the new Throwback is worth trying while you have a chance to get a taste of history.

I am allergic to lactose, gluten and soy and there is none in this!<br />I use it in my (incresingly famous) chocolate sauces, cookies, cakes, smoothies, etc. and it is such a distinct and tasty coconut flavor that one almost swoons.  I have to credit it with the popularity of my recipes.  It is absolutely LOVELY & I HIGHLY recommend this! Also, it is a generously-sized bottle for a gourmet flavoring.  Try it in pancake batter!<br /><br />I am currently waiting until I need more, and then I will be back here at AMZ to purchase this.  This is THE best price I have seen too!  It is a bit oily so when I use it, I keep a paper towel handy to wipe off the opening so there is no "leakage" after closing it. (like one sometimes get after pouring oil from the bottle).  Storage - - I keep it in my cupboard.  For Real "punch," I add it to my coconut oil when I am using it in a recipe and let it sit until it's time to add it to the recipe I am preparing; not sure why, but doing this seems to increase the flavor even more.  TOTAL YUMMM!<br /><br />Like I said, try adding a tsp. of this to your pancake batter, along with 1/4-1/3 C. orange juice and 2 T. coconut oil!

review/text: This is a great tasting coffee. I'm three quarters through my first bag and love it. Even better, shade grown coffee helps our migratory birds and also provides richer resources for farmers. How? Shade trees often produces secondary fruit or nut crops as well as firewood from falling branches. The trees provide homes for birds and other wildlife that eat insects allowing for fewer if any pesticide use. (This particular coffee is organic, so that's no pesticides, of course.) Likewise, the leaf litter helps fertilize the coffee plants. The shade also allows the coffee to mature naturally in a slow manner providing for better flavor. It also means you usually need to use less coffee than the regular can coffees bringing the cost closer to what many people are used to paying.

review/text: Being British by birth, I have drank tea for as long as I can remember.  While as a child in England we used the traditional loose teas, but I never drained the cup because I didn't like the tea leaves that stayed till the bottom. When I became an adult in the US, I tried many teabags, Lipton, Red Rose, Tetleys, so on.....and found Tetleys was the best.  Tetleys divided the bags into various types, two being the Classic Blend (square bags) and British Blend (Round Bags).  I have found that the British Blend has much more flavor, more than needed for a single cup. The British Blend bags are great when making a pot full, but for a single cup the Classic is the best.  Tetleys is by far the best English tasting teas (im my opionion anyway), they still sell the loose tea too, but I am not traditional enough for that!!

They were smashed up, though I believe the plastic covering was intact. This didn't seem to affect the taste of the tea, however. I'm satisfied with the tea.

review/text: Love this product, flavor/taste is one of the bests.  I refuse to pay +$7 per carton at our local grocery story and I don't mind buying it in bulk to save extra.  So thank you for offering this product with a decent price and even better if you buy in bulk!  Will do business again provided you keep your prices as low as possible!

review/summary: Better than Lipton but not as good as their British Blend
review/text: When Amazon stopped supplying British Blend Premium through Subscribe & Save at $4.25 a box, I decided to try the Classic Blend even though you can still get British Blend from Amazon via one of their outside suppliers but the shipping charges end up twice as much as buying it at the local supermarket. Amazon still does sell it as a Prime eligible product but that is also double what it costs locally.<br />Big mistake. The difference between British Blend and Classic Blend is night and day. You see, when I make my tea I brew enough for two cups at a time. So the remainder sits for several hours before I reheat it. While the first cup is tolerable the second one is almost as bad as Lipton's, which I drank for many years.<br />I have managed to make it drinkable by purchasing several boxes of British Blend and I brew my tea with one British Blend bag and one Classic Blend bag. This improves the taste quite a bit. But doesn't help at all for the second cup. By the time I get to the last half of the second cup I end up throwing it away most of the time.<br />The reason I switched from Lipton's is because the first cup of Lipton's was bitter and any reheated tea tasted like the dregs of a coffee pot when the coffee has been warming for 6-8 hours.<br />With British Blend the first cup is the ultimate and the second reheated cup taste better than freshly brewed Lipton's or Tetley Classic Blend.<br />Unfortunately I am stuck with at least 400 more bags of Classic Blend before I can go back to using two British Blend bags for my tea. The only good thing is that Tetley British Blend does go on sale at the supermarket every couple of months but if you don't get there the morning the sale starts, they are sold out because people who like fine tasting tea rush to the store and buy it all up immediately.<br />Perhaps I should start brewing only one cup at a time and use 3 or 4 bags of Classic Blend and then treat myself with British Blend. That would rid me of the Classic Blend without having to dump so much of the Classic Blend.<br />No matter what, I won't be buying any more Classic Blend and will stick with British Blend no matter what the price since it is the best tasting tea around, particularly if you reheat your tea like I do.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: Coffee smells delicious from the one-way valve in the bag. Actually made me hungry because it smelled so good. According to the label it was roasted only a few days before I received it by expedited shipping. Beans are not greasy and have a rich light brown color (hence the company name).<br /><br />I have found this coffee tastes best when brewed with pour overs like the Hario v60 or the Chemex, but also tastes great when brewed with a Bialetti MocaPot or even a standard drip machine (issue there is the brew methods, not the coffee). I am going to try it in a Siphon next.

The Pennsylvania Dutch Co. sells other types of pasta in our local supermarkets but not this particular item. I haven't been able to find noodles that compare to these in taste and size as these particular noodles. They complement the chicken pot pie.  Ironically the company that makes Pennsylvania Dutch products is actually AIPC( American Italian Pasta Company).

Unless you want your mouth to burn for an hour after eating, or if you want your butt hole to burn for an hour after pooping the next day, then don't buy this sauce.  I would recommend the Frank's Red Hot - "Buffalo."  Stay away from the "Hot Buffalo," unless you love the pain of fire hole.

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: Since I came to US I was trying different brands to find the perfect traditional Earl Grey blend, like in Europe. "Stash" brand was garbage, didn't even taste like Earl Grey. "Twinnings" was somewhat drinkable, but very weak. I've also tried others which I don't even remember their names. This one was great, exactly what I was looking for! I've started with regular Earl Grey, not decaffeinated tea, and only later dared to try decaffeinated version, and to my surprise didn't feel big difference. From now on I only drink this tea. It's very strong, even for big 16 oz. cup, aromatic and flavorful. The price is affordable too, especially when buying 6 packs and overall cheaper than at my local grocery store. Someone mentioned that he is bothered to throw away so many wrappers, but I think that having separate foil packages is a big plus. I used to drink tea that had paper packages, and those didn't stay fresh for a long time. As soon as you open the box and over time they will loose their aroma. With this tea individual foil packages the tea stays fresh almost indefinitely. Don't get over obsessed with the environmental hysteria, think rationally. We have many tree farms that were planted for this purpose, so using individual wrapped tea few times a day won't kill your wild forests. Things are not as bad as the media presents it. There are many ways we can be more careful about our waste and consumption, but this is not one of them.

I also purchased Choice Organic (Decaf) at the same time.<br /><br />I compared the two, and it seems that Bigelow is weaker.  I don't think I'll buy Bigelow again.  Not very impressed with the strongness (or lack thereof).  I could barely taste it even after steeping for a long time.

review/text: Bigelow teas are consistantly good - rich flavor and aroma kept fresh in foil-lined wrappers.  Pass up the Twinnings Earl Grey (weak) and go with this one.  From an environmental standpoint, though, it bothers me to throw away so many wrappers.  Earl Grey is great iced as well, which takes four bags in my iced tea maker. If Bigelow makes larger bags, to make a full pot of tea for two or a pitcher of iced, I'll get those instead next time.
