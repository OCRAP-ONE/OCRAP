review/summary: Simply The Best for your Favorite Dog
review/text: We found the Blue Dog PB 'cookies' over 5 years ago at Trader Joe's in the Indianapolis area.  They have since stopped carrying them east of the Miss. River (sadly) but other stores picked the product up.  Given a choice of every treat imaginable our dog will always pick the Blue Dog treats....smart dog!  They are all natural, low in fat, and the aroma when you open the bag caused our grandson to ask if the cookies were for him!  Finding this bargain on Amazon is a treasure and a great opportunity for newcomers to try a great product for their companion puppy.

review/summary: Blue Dog Bakery Premium Peanut Butter and Molasses Dog Treats
review/text: I'm surprised at how many people have given these cookies a high rating.  They are huge.  One I just pulled out of the box is 3 inches long by 2 inches wide.  I use treats to train my puppy and reward good behavior.  The StarMark Clicker literature suggests using a treat the size of a navy bean!  Dogs don't really seem to have any concept of size, and treats are for training not supplementing food.  If I try to break these down in size, a good part of the cookie turns into unusable crumbs.  Also IMPORTANT:  The first two ingredients in these cookies are wheat, and I goofed as I NEVER buy any food products for my puppy containing corn nor wheat.  I have tasted them, too, and at least for a human they aren't cloyingly sweet.  Of all the treats I've tried, both my puppy and I much prefer Paul Newman's organic cheese dog treats which contain things like barley, chicken, carrots, apples and rolled oats.  More expensive for sure, but they break easily and are great for training rewards.

review/text: Bought this popcorn salt looking for an alternative to pouring/dripping butter over freshly popped corn...nothing worse than soggy popcorn.  I have always loved the salty/buttery taste of the movie theater popcorn, but couldn't find anything similar until now.  This stuff is really delicious!  The only complaint I have is that the container cap/lid has the double opening, so that you can choose to just pour it on or choose to sprinkle it over the popcorn.  Unfortunately, the sprinkle holes in this cap are huge, so there's no sprinkling the salt around evenly, it just pours out anyways.  To remedy this situation, we've purchased an extra salt shaker and just refill it when needed.  That way, we can get the popcorn salt sprinkled on evenly without overdoing it.

review/summary: Finally! Theatre-tasting popcorn at home!
review/text: After years of trying every popcorn maker in the world, I had just about given up on getting theater-tasting popcorn at home.  This year I invested in a home version of the big popcorn machine you see at the multiplex.  That got me halfway there, but I was still dissatisfied with the final popcorn result because I could never get the butter/salt combination to work without ruining the texture of the popcorn, and salt alone wouldn't stick to the kernels.<br /><br />This item is the real deal!  Tastes exactly like the theater version and doesn't make a soggy mess of the popcorn like the 'popcorn toppings' you can buy at the grocery store.  The ONLY thing wrong with this item is the size of the jug and the holes for the product to shake out.  Solve the issue easily by transferring a manageable amount into an extra salt shaker, spice bottle, or whatever! I may not be able to finish the whole container before it reaches the expiration, but for $15 (I have prime so no shipping cost) it was well worth it!

review/text: I purchased this today, and promptly fired off a batch of popcorn with 1/4 tsp. of this stuff added to the popping oil.  The flavor is movie theater-ish, but I still feel like I'm missing the full effect because I'm not popping in coconut oil.  Still, this stuff delivered some of the flavor I was looking for, and adhered to the popcorn just fine because I didn't use it as a sprinkling salt after the popping process was finished.  Honestly though...the price here on Amazon is outrageous.  I went to my local warehouse store that starts with an "S" and ends with an "am's Club", and purchased the same sized jug for under 3 bucks plus tax.

review/summary: Great Buttery Taste
review/text: I love popcorn and typically enjoy stovetop popcorn several times a week for supper. I have tried many types of popcorn salt, but have found the ACT II to be the best. Several points that make this a superior popcorn salt. First, the salt is ground down to a very fine texture. Because of this, it sticks very well to the popcorn. It sticks better than regular salt and better than other popcorn salts I have tried. The salt ends up on the popcorn, and not in the bottom of the bowl. Second, this seasoning has the perfect blend of salt/butter flavor. The salt enhances the flavor of the popcorn perfectly, creating that wonderful movie popcorn flavor.<br /><br />The key with this salt is to learn the proper proportion to shake on. Play around with it, and you will fine tune the proportion to your taste, and will then be enjoying movie popcorn at a small fraction of the price at the theater.

review/summary: ACT II Buttery Popcorn Salt
review/text: Just what I needed. Perfect toasty buttery tasting popcorn. Popping your own gives a flavor that is missing in the microwave type popcorn. The only problem was the directions call for 1 1/2 Tsp per batch in the oil I found it too salty and went to just 1 Tsp per batch of popcorn and  did not need to add any more after it was popped. Next I need to try making it using the Snappy brand coconut oil.

review/summary: Beware - Contains Milk
review/text: My son is allergic to milk products.  Act II Butter Flavor Microwave popcorn is one of the only microwave popcorns he can eat.  Sadly, the same buttery flavor in the form of this salt contains milk even though their microwave product doesn't.<br /><br />I was going to combine this 50/50 with Flavorcol for the PERFECT popcorn salt.  Reason being is Flavorcol is pretty mild and this stuff is pretty strong/artificial tasting.  If you really like the stench/flavor of the buttery topping at the theater, you'll love this stuff.  If you want to get that movie theater taste but not go to overboard, try mixing this with Flavorcol.  Note flavorcol is very salty so you use less than you would normal salt.

I use the actual popcorn machine, not a microwaved bag, and after experimenting with butters and salt levels, I can honestly say that movie theaters don't have anything on me! If you like the salt they use at movie theaters, this is spot on! I will warn you though, it comes out FAST and it's flavor is very strong, so sprinkle with caution!

review/summary: WOW!  How did I not have this before??
review/text: WOW!  This is the best popcorn topping I have bought to date, and I am a popcorn junkie!  It contains coconut oil just like they use in the theaters.  Label also lists milk and soy.  I tried this two different ways when it arrived last night.<br /><br />First I tried it on the stove.  Heated up just a little oil and put the kernels and about 2tsp of salt in a measuring cup.  Once the oil was added I threw the kernels and salt in, covered it, and it produced movie theater style/quality popcorn.  I put some of the topping in a salt shaker to top.<br /><br />Second, I air popped some kernels, sprayed them with canola oil and shook some of the topping on with a salt shaker.  Not as good by any standard, but much healthier and among the best "buttery" air popcorn I've had without pouring a ton of butter on.<br />The jug will last me well beyond its expiration date, it's a LOT of topping.  For the price with the Amazon Prime shipping I couldn't be happier with this.  If any of my friends make popcorn I'm going to give them some of this to use, IT'S AWESOME BUTTERY SALTY GOODNESS.<br /><br />Also not too bad on veggies if you like that salty buttery flavor.

review/summary: Hard to Not Get Too Much On
review/text: My wife and I like the Act II Microwave popcorn that you used to be able to buy in the microwaveable bags at [...].  Recently we saw this and decided to try it.  There are some problems.  First it is almost impossible to not get too much on.  The dispenser is made to use with a huge machine, not a family size microwave popper.  I finally had to put it on with my fingers.  Even then I had to be very careful because it was very easy to get too much on.  I probably used a 1/4 teaspoon total and that seemed to be a little much.  We had to sift our popcorn too to get it to work right at all.  This container will easily last us 100 years or more and that brings us to the second problem.  They need to sell this in a smaller size (and with a much better dispenser that allows you to control how much comes out).  It is gaggingly salty if you aren't extremely careful.

review/summary: Great salt
review/text: This is just to give everyone an idea of how long this will last.  My wife and I pop corn every other Friday for our kids elementary school.  On average, we pop 320 8" bags every other Friday.  640 bags a month X +-10 months of school=6400 8" bags.  We are just about to start our second bottle since the start of school mid-August.  Figure in a few spills and a few bad pops now and then.  This could last a lifetime for some people.  I'm thinking that the price here may be a mistake/typo.  We buy this at the local mega-mart for $3.75.<br /><br />I brought some of this home for a test.  I was unable to make the popcorn we use at home to taste like the stuff we use a school.  The school has a real theater popper, not a toy, coconut oil and we buy an expensive hybrid white popcorn.  I tried some store bought name brand on the stove-top with the salt and coconut oil.  Just not the same.  I'm convinced it's the heating element in the theater popper.  I can pop a cup of corn in moments at school but at home it's definitely slower.  I don't have the thick walled steel "container" to hold the heat, nor the giant heating element.  When popping at home, the popped corn just sits inside the popper until all is finished popping.  When popping at school, the popped corn gets pushed out as it's being popped so it doesn't sit inside the container getting steamed, heated or over-cooked, burned etc.<br /><br />Tastes just fine.  Nice, fine crystals for an even spread on the popcorn.

review/summary: Good french roast bean with lots of flavor
review/text: I am a Starbucks coffee drinker for the most part. I enjoy Espressro Roast, Sumatra, French Roast and even Pike's.<br /><br />I needed a bag of coffee and decided to try something else to see if another brand of coffee would please me as much as the Starbucks coffees that I've been enjoyng.  So I picked up a pound of Green Mountain French Roast Whole Bean coffee to be ground and used in my Keurig. I was pleasantly surprised. The coffee was good and fairly strong and did not have quite as much as the "burnt" type taste that I sense (and like) in the Starbucks French Roast. I definitely liked the flavor and would buy again. It's different than my usual but enjoyable.<br /><br />The beans are quite oily, which is typical for French Roast coffee beans. They tend to sitck a little bit going through my burr grinder and I ocassionally have to give my grinder a tap or two to get the beans feeding again. Not a reason to not try this coffee, just an observation.

review/text: I read the reviews posted on this site and figured I'd give Shed Stop a try. My wife and I have a black pug that sheds like crazy. So far we have been using the product for three months or so and have seen absolutely no change in the amount of shedding. We have hardwood and tile floors so we can easily see the hair our beloved pet leaves behind. Before using Shed Stop we would vacuum three times a week, now, after several bottles of this product my wife and I vacuum....three times a week.<br /><br />We recently found out that my wife's parents use Shed Stop on their very fluffy cat. They have decided to stop buying the product because they too have noticed no change in the shedding. Personally, I think they should just get rid of the cat (I'm a dog guy myself).<br /><br />Maybe this product works for some of you out there or maybe there are a bunch of people who work for the company planting fake reviews on the internet. I don't know, but I do know this; the stuff didn't work at all for us. I have to go now. It's time to vacuum...and then, I think I'm going to wax my dog.

review/text: The English Bulldog is probably the best pet man can have, but the hair loss due to shedding causes him to be less than perfect.  If you have been around an English Bulldog you certainly know the meaning of Shedding dog hair.  You don't play with the dog before going out for the evening that's for certain.  Theo, the bulldog, was given "Shed Solution's"  Skin & Coat Supplement and what a difference in just a couple of weeks.  Now after a month he sheds very little.  He has become a delight to have around.  Daily vacuuming is no longer needed. My English Bulldog is now the perfect pet and man's best friend. No doubts.  Thank you Shed Solution

review/summary: Amazing Product to diminish shedding
review/text: I have a Norweigan Elkhound and he generally sheds an incredible amount especially in the Spring.  I started him on the Shed Stop 4 weeks ago and it is just amazing how much of a difference I'm seeing.  His shedding has really diminished and his coat looks great.

review/summary: Change isn't always good!
review/text: There used to be a product called, "Mrs Allen's Stop Shed." There were separate products for dogs and cats. In March of 2006 Farnam Pet Products announced that it had acquired Mrs. Allen's Shed-Stop from Stabar Enterprises, Inc. Once acquired, Farnam changed the "Stop Shed" name to "Shed Solutions" and then discontinued the one specifically for cats. This is a case where a company acquires a product/brand (in this case, Mrs. Allen's) and messes a good thing up. I used the original products on dogs and cats for years and they were terrific. I emailed the Farnam in December of 2010 and explained my frustration that they no longer produced and sold the product made specifically for cats, and was politely told to go elsewhere for my cat shedding problem. So, now I use the "Shed Solutions for Dogs" for our family dog and cat. They both seem to like the favor, and it does help. Is it as good as the old product? I don't think so, but it definitely helps. We are stuck with this product until Farnam dusts off the original formula and offers one for dogs and cats, or Mrs. Allen comes out of retirement!

review/text: This product seems to be working as advertised.  My dog (who shed his weight in hair every day I swear) still sheds - but not nearly as much.  I only wish that it 100% could cure shedding, but I am sure that is not possible.  It does work as advertised.  I do not like the smell - but no matter - Duffy likes it!

review/text: I use this stuff because it has a really high content of vitamins. I have an older dog who eats everything, so my vet recommended some type of shedding stuff because of the vitamin content.  I don't know if it helps stop shedding, I haven't really noticed a change.  It must taste good too, because my little pup, inhales her food with this stuff on it.  Do not buy this in the store, one bottle is the same price as all 3 of these!!!! We go through it so fast, I love purchasing online!

review/text: As an animal caregiver, it was a pleasure to come across the Shed stop for dogs product.<br />Currently we have 3 german shepherds on the farm.... all of whom come into the house on a regular basis. The hair they were shedding continually just about drove us crazy...It was impossible to keep the house looking fit for company...<br />Within just a few days of starting the dogs on shed stop... .the amount of hair left behind became noticably less. Within two weeks, we were able to claim the house back for human use... The dogs' coats look beautiful, and the constant shedding has all but stopped... What a great product...

review/summary: The absolute BEST!!
review/text: Ahmad English Afternoon Tea is the best. I love to sample delicious teas from all over the world. I orginally bought a tin of Ahmad tea as a gift, for a discount at Marshall's around Christmas time in 2001. I had so many selections for the gift basket I was making that I ended up keeping the Ahmad for myself. Boy, was I ever glad I did. I haven't found Ahmad teas in any store since then. I've been ordering it online ever since, and re-filling the authentic tin it originally came in. During my breast cancer treatment (chemo, radiation & all that good stuff) in early 2005, I was able to enjoy Ahmad English Afternoon Tea, even when I couldn't keep anything else down.

review/summary: An Amazingly Tasty Tea Despite Being a Teabag Variety.
review/text: This tea will not fail to please you.  It's a beautiful orange colored tea when cupped, fragrant, medium bodied, never bitter, and the bergamot is used in a classic European way.  Despite the pleasantly strong aroma of bergamot when the tea is dry, it plays more of a subtle nuance flavor in this tea once brewed, giving the tea a more layered flavor profile.  Not a highly aromatic earl grey tea in the American/Canadian tradition for those looking for something strong.  I can drink cup after cup of this pleasant tea all afternoon/evening long and I've not tired of it yet.  A very good value given the quality.  I usually stick to loose leaf teas but this is my one exception.  Thank you Ahmad for this gem.

For the past year, they have had bad allergies, and we catch them constantly chewing on their paws. A pet store employee recommend this brand to us, and we found it on Amazon for much cheaper. My dogs have also lost weight on this product, and I've increased the amount I feed them by 25%. Their weight is ideal now, allergies are gone, and their coats appearances are much improved. I highly recommend that if you love your dog, you buy this. :  ~ Cheers!

review/summary: Love this food...
review/text: I was looking for a higher quality food for my 2 small dogs.  This food has alleviated 2 HUGE issues for me.  My pomeranian has a history of stomach problems and finding something for him to eat that would not upset his stomach was a challenge.  Immediately I could tell a difference with this food.  He has not had one instance of loose stool or any throwing up since he has switched over. (1 year and counting)  My mixed breed always had overactive anal glands.  Within 2 months the carpet scooting ceased and he now only goes to the groomer every 3 months instead of monthly.

review/summary: Blue Buffalo dry food for small breed dogs, natural fish & rice
review/text: I have noticed a big difference in both of my dogs since they started eating this dog food. My pug-terrier mix had thinning wiry fur & her skin was inflamed. Her fur has really thickened & her skin is better. Both dogs don't eat as much either. They use to eat in the morning & evening but now eat only late afternoon. The food does seem a little expensive but since they have cut down eating so much it probably balances out to what I was spending with store bought food.

However, our two little dogs actually lick the bowls clean.  I don't have to try to "make gravy", just put it in their bowls, and they eat.  I also feel  good I am giving them a good quality dog food which will keep them healthy.  Excellent product!

review/summary: Intense sour flavor!
review/text: This product is for people who are SERIOUS about sour candy--those who find Sour Patch Kids to be very sour will find this to be unbearably so.  I enjoy eating lemons and limes straight and drinking lemon juice by itself, and I love this product!  The actual "fruit" flavors (watermelon, blue raspberry, green apple) are fake and a little funny tasting but really those are in the background, the main flavor you get is pure, delicious sour.  If you have eaten a Warheads hard candy, this is about the intensity of the very outside coating--again, those who like milder sour flavors will probably find this too much--those who are often disappointed by "sour" candy that can never seem to be sour enough will love it.  It does burn your tongue if you use too much though, which is all right because it is a little pricey and I would go through far too many if I physically could!  If you are looking for intense sour flavor, I highly recommend this.  If you aren't as hard-core about your sour candy or you are looking for the fruit flavor, look elsewhere.

review/text: I bought these to throw in the counter and sell at our store to make some change.  I sold the whole box almost immediately and continue to subscribe to these.  At a quarter for two we are making money and keeping the drawer stocked with quarters, exactly what we wanted.<br /><br />The only thing I will point out is that these are not a super sized version of the ones you buy in the 1 oz. pouches, imagine one of those squashed to he less thick and more spread out.  It's not a big deal, but I was expecting them to look as they do on the box and they do not.  Plus, the pink and green colors are swirled and do not look like a little watermelon except in shape.<br /><br />Just picky things, so I am still giving five stars because they are a great seller and a great value.

review/summary: Best Baby Food by Far and the Best Flavor!!!
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Apples 4oz Size<br />This is a great product and flavor. It's basic, almost every baby I know loves apples and the size is so much better because it's just big enough. On the rare occasion that my son or daughter can't/couldn't finish in one sitting I could put it in the fridge until the next time they sat down to eat. The price is great too, especially if you sign up for a subscription. I like it because if I need another set sooner than it would normally ship I can alter that in my subscription listing. It makes this a great value and a great product.

I heartily recommend this brand to anyone who needs a gluten-free product.  Their brownie mix is to die for!  It compares favorably with the best of wheat-based brownies.

There are quite a few servings in each bottle and it's perfect for Italian Soda.  Also from a practical standpoint they are using plastic bottles for the shipped product which makes it much less likely to break in transit.

review/text: When it comes to BBQ sauce I am never without it during cookout season.  I use it on everything from pork chops to chicken and am usually not all that fussy about what I use.  Oh I know that some sauces are probably much better than others, especially the higher priced brands.  But when it comes to grilling I love to generously season my meat anyway, and the sauce is never the all that ends all.  Recently I picked up this Baby Rays sauce at a local Aldis market at a price that was cheaper than here on Amazon and am enjoying it very much.  It is very rich, tangy, and has a an all around great spicy taste.  It's definitely a step up from the cheaper generic and store brands available for a little cheaper.  If you have an Aldi's around your area I highly recommend it.  If not, you can try it here on Amazon where the price is still a decent bargain when bundled for free shipping... Darn good sauce...: )

review/summary: Sushi Chef White Miso Soup tastes good but is far too salty.
review/text: I've been a fan of instant miso for quite a while, but this is the first time I've tried Sushi Chef's.  It, as with all other brands is simple and quick to prepare.  The photo I've posted of the back of the package with its contents in a bowl really doesn't do justice to how much the freeze dried ingredients expand and come back to life in water.  I like it more then the Kikkoman soup which is locally available (and contains MSG) but not as much as the San-J.  The only problem I have with this soup is it is far too salty.  At 910mg (38%DV) it just tastes too salty, I normally make it with a 1.5 cups of water which helps but afterwords I still need to drink a large glass of water to keep from feeling like I have hypertension.  That said, none of the packaged soups can compare with making it from paste like in a restaurant, if it did then no one would bother making it the hard way.  The packets are lower quailty higher convenience.

If, however, you want a delicious and surprisingly filling cup of unbelievably flavorful soup, this is what you want. It doesn't smell like much, but when it hits your tongue it becomes amazing, and filling. Perfect for a meal after shoveling snow.

review/text: The taste of this soup is REALLY great! To me, it tastes just as good as those at Japanese restaurants. The price here on Amazon is high, though. I thought for a bulk pack of 24, I'd find it cheaper here, but it's less expensive at my grocery store, Big Y. Single pack = $1.29. Worth it on a cold winter day - add extra mushrooms for the best taste.

They are very sweet and just dont need to be. Yes,they are organic and not used very often which is good cause we wouldnt have any teeth left after all the sweetners.  The front of the box says "No Added Glucose" like it would matter. Very slick marketing. I'm so busy watching for GMO's,gluten and allergins that I forgot to look at sugar content. I was thinking honey would be the main sweetner but I will check ingredients better from now on! Nice that they are individualy wrapped though.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:40 Mins<br /><br /></span>Here's my dog enjoying Blue's Stew Hearty Beef Stew in real time. Don't blink cause ya might miss it ;  By the way, I know my 130# dog makes it look like there isn't much in a serving, but it's a 12 1/2 oz can similar in size to what you'd find in the grocery store for humans.<br />I've never bought wet dog food before, as it's never looked or SMELLED like something I'd want to have in my house, let alone feed my dog. I've been buying various flavors of Blue Buffalo brand kibble for my aging dog for the past couple of years. I think it's really helped him stay as active and fit as he is. He always had a rather sensitive system, and Blue Buffalo foods do not seem to cause him any digestive issues. This is our first try of their wet food, and based on his reaction, we'll be back to sample the other flavors!<br /><br />The Dogfoodadvisor site gives it 5 stars. Here's the ingredient list:<br /><br />Beef, Beef Broth, Water, Peas, Egg, Potato Starch, Carrots, Guar Gum, Whole Potatoes, Natural Flavor, Salt, Sodium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Vitamin A Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Niacin (Vitamin B3), d-Calcium Pantothenate (Vitamin B5), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Biotin (Vitamin B7), Folic Acid (Vitamin B9), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Iron Amino Acid Chelate, Zinc Amino Acid Chelate, Copper Amino Acid Chelate, Manganese Amino Acid Chelate, Sodium Selenite, Calcium Iodate, Choline Chloride.<br /><br />Hope this helps : )

review/text: I have a 9 year old Pomeranian.  I have always fed her the best food I could find and most of her life she had venison... fresh.... and vitamins to make sure she got all the vitamins and minerals she needs.  I dont get alot of venison these days so  my lucky little buddy gets canned dog food now and seeing how I think it is my responsibility to feed my little dog the most nutritious food I can find... she gets Blue Buffalo.  She absolutely LOVES this food!  She has NEVER been so excited about dinner!  She practically opens the cans!  It was almost immediately that I noticed her "spunk" return.  She now runs and plays again like when she was younger.  I love seeing her so "lively" again.  She has been eating the "duck" but today we are getting a second flavor so she can have a selection.  I wish they came in a "MIXED" case!  That way she could enjoy all the different flavors and get to have something different each day ... like I do!  Like other reviewers... I noticed after starting on the Blue Buffalo... that she has less waste and her waste does not smell as bad as it used to.  I am happy to feed her something that is obviously good for her that she clearly loves.  I hope she is around many more years enjoying her Blue Buffalo!

review/summary: Blue Buffalo Beef Stew canned dog food
review/text: Our dog absolutely loves this brand Blue Buffalo Beef Stew canned food. It has generous vegetables and beef chunks in it.It does not have an odor like cheap dog foods when you open the can...Since putting our cats and dog on Blue Buffalo foods, they are much leaner, satisfied and do not have a "dog smell" or stinky cat litter....They are soooo much healthier..The cats are also on Blue Buffalo canned and dry food, and our dog eats the dry food for puppies as well. It seems a little pricey to some, but like I have explained in the 9 months our animals have been on it the cats lost a lot of the extra weight they were carrying, one is 13,12, 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 years old. The older ones have much more energy and play more with the younger ones. The dog is lean and fast.He is almost 1 year old, shepherd & husky mix and american bulldog, and he weighs about 50 1bs. They all don't eat as much food, and it is really cheaper in the long run. As we were buying more of the cheap canned & dry food, altogether, than we buy now.

review/summary: If you LOVE Chicken wing meat...
review/text: UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.

review/text: These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones. I agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as I bet these would taste even better warmed up!  I bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when I get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs.  These would be great for someone doing a low-carb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body.  One bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar.  Bottom line is this... if you love hot wings and can't get enough give these a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Tasty, Lean, and Insanely Addictive
review/text: Little morsels of moist, pure beef that taste like high quality roast.  I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.<br /><br />Lean, good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises.  My only criticism is they must cook these in crack cocaine, because I'm absolutely addicted to them.

review/summary: Jack Link's is always great
review/text: I love the steak nuggets (and tenders) even better than their regular jerky.  I swear by all three of the Original, Peppered and Teriyaki Beef flavors.

review/summary: Wouldn't buy it again
review/text: I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.

review/summary: Might make okay dog treats....
review/text: I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.
