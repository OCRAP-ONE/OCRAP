review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: This is a great product that is very easy to make. It never clumps, which is a great plus when it comes to dry sauce mixes.<br />I personally favor the Knorr white sauces (e.g. the Alfredo or Garlic Herb), which is the only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars.<br />Overall, it's very enjoyable, nice to have around when you don't want to make sauce from scratch, and I would definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Delicious, beautiful, and more economic than it sounds.
review/text: I tried this tea in a Teavana store where samples were available.  Not only is the blossom beautiful and exotic, but the tea is delicious.  It's smooth, uniform, and though delicate the peach flavor was definitely at the forefront.  I don't know if the pot I tried had been sweetened or not, but I was floored.  It's easily the best tasting tea I've ever tried (though admittedly that isn't saying much; I'm not a frequent tea drinker).<br /><br />The economic part comes in with the multiple infusions.  This isn't a makes-one-pot product; you can refill the pot and brew again with the same blossom and get multiple pots out of each 'ball.'

review/summary: Beautiful and tasty
review/text: I originally tried this tea in the Teavana store, and was surprised at the wonderful scent. I'm not usually one for peach teas, but this was so mellow and fragrant, I couldn't pass it up. I didn't even realize it was a blooming tea until the gal at Teavana explained it to me.<br /><br />Not only does this tea taste good and is good for you, but it's beautiful, and more affordable than you'd think. The blossom it creates when you brew it is very pretty, it's half of why I drink it. And, each blossom is good for 5-6 brews, which means the 2 ounces in a pack (about 8 blossoms) is about 50 cups of tea. I use 1 blossom in Teavana's Perfect Tea Maker (the 16 ounce size) and I can fill the tea maker full 5-7 times before I consider the flavor and scent to be pretty diminished. For an artisan tea, that's an excellent value.

review/summary: An amazing tea
review/text: This was my first experience with blooming tea, and it made me into an enthusiastic believer!  My boyfriend had wanted me to look for chrysanthemum tea, without caffeine, at the new Teavana store at one of the local malls, and this was the tea I was told had the most chrysanthemum in it.  It looks absolutely beautiful when it blooms underwater, it smells wonderful, and it has a wonderful peach and jasmine flavor.  Unlike traditional teabags, teaballs can be used for at least three brewings, and one ball is even enough to brew an entire pot of tea.  This particular blooming tea might be on the pricy side for just two ounces, but in the long run it saves more money than getting a lot of teabags that might be cheaper but which can only be used for one cup of tea and still retain much flavor.  This tea still packs its full flavor after the first use and after the first day!  This was also my first time experiencing white tea, which, as it turns out, is lowest in caffeine of any of the other types of tea and is the highest in antioxidants.  And the fancy teaballs just make one want to brew this tea, since the presentation is so much prettier and more elegant-looking than a regular teabag, which one just throws in a cup of hot water.  It also helps that in Chinese culture, the chrysanthemum is believed to have the power to help a drinker to live to one hundred!

review/summary: Pretty tea
review/text: As stated, this tea is lovely.  Watching it bloom in it's pot (I have a clear glass teapot just for these blooming teas) is a a lot of fun.  How did it taste?  Not bad, flavor did not match looks, but I could taste a hint of peach and it was fun to chomp on the little candy bits.  I don't know that I would repurchase.  It wasn't tasty enough for me to be more than a novelty, your mileage may differ.  Shipping was rapid and the item was well packaged.

review/summary: A delicate, delicious and beautiful cup of tea
review/text: This tea is so delicious. Very smooth with a light hint of peach (not "fake" or fruity). We also love the Strawberry Misaki blooming tea. I actually like the Misaki a tiny bit more.<br /><br />And it is lovely to watch the teas "bloom." We don't have a glass tea kettle, but they had some blooming teas in one at a Teavana store, we visited and it is pretty! The other poster is correct about multiple uses too. We use each ball about 6 times (in a cup of tea, not a whole pot). I've found all of the Teavana tea yield multiple uses (generally at least 5 or 6).<br /><br />These teas are so yummy. We don't add any sweetener. They are just perfect as they are!

review/summary: Scones are great....seller price is way too high
review/text: Our family loves the Sticky Fingers English scones.  I decided to stock up on Amazon.  I ordered three differenct flavors which all shipped from different vendors.  For approximately $12, I was able to get 3 packs of scone mix.  I assumed that, given the price of nearly $12, I was getting a multipack from this vendor as well.  When it arrived, it was just a single package which I could have purchased at my local Cost Plus for $5.95.  Next time I'll read the quantity line more carefully.<br /><br />The scones themself are so quick to make and yummy.  We've tried almost all the flavors and they are all delicious.

review/text: I just discovered these at Marshalls and after trying them went back and bought all they had. But they don't always have them so I came to Amazon. WOW! These scones are a delight! Lightly crusty on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Lightly sweet and absolutely scrumptious. Had them fresh out of the oven with some homemade yogurt. I found mine one day rummaging through a shelf at Marshalls. They don't always have them so I came here. Even at a dollar higher it's worth it! I will NEVER buy a hard $2.00 scone at Starbucks again!

review/summary: make sure your dog chews
review/text: My puppy loves the treats, they're a great alternative to soft treats (especially the one I was using before, which was loaded with sugar).  However, he sometimes doesn't chew it completely and will cough up the treats if I give too many in succession (which happens when I'm teaching him a new trick).  A drink of water solves the issue, but you might want to keep soft treats on hand if you treat your dog during walks/exercise.

Cool doesn't mean house temperature unless yours is 62 degrees. Otherwise, if somewhat warmer the bars become extremely sticky and are hard to remove from the celephane wrappers. Expect sticky licking-good fingers as well. Were it not for that I'd give it a 4+-star.

review/text: Kamut pasta is my favorite and I love the plain ones. These vegetable spirals just don't taste right though. They have a very odd flavor.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.  Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.<br /><br />The Chanterelles are a mild, less earthy tasting fungus.  They go very well with eggs, chicken and fish.  They are also great in a stir fry.<br /><br />The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.

It is very good black, which is how I like it.  Daybreak Morning is going to be my regular coffee on the days that I don't go to Wawa.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

review/summary: Caribou K-cups
review/text: I received 108 Caribou Daybreak Morning Blend K-cups as ordered. I have used 2 1/2 boxes (approx 45) and 90% of the K-cups tear across the top when the pin of the Kureg brewer pierces it. Coffee grinds get into the cup or water spills out of the plastic insert and flows out of the machine. I contacted Caribou and they said they supply the coffee to Kureg and I should call them. Why should I have to go through this hassle when I've spent so much money on a product. If there is a defect in the manufacture of these K-cups, THEY SHOULD BE PULLED FROM THE MARKET! I hope Amazon reads this review since they put THEIR GOOD NAME on the product. I have never had any problem with Green Mountain or Timothy's K-cups and continue to use what I have in stock. I hope buyers learn from my experience. $60 plus dollars wasted!!

review/summary: Another Red Bull knockoff
review/text: With a name like Sexergy you would think they would also go for a unique taste. Instead this energy drink aims to taste very similar to Red Bull. In my opinion Sexergy has a more sour and worse after taste than it however. The taste is as generic as the cans design. I do not recommend this energy drink. The only positive there is about it is it's only 5 calories a can, but if your looking for a healthier energy drink I recommend finding a flavor of Celsius energy drink or FRS that you like.

Call me naive but when I looked at the product page I assumed these would be 16 oz cans. They are 8.4 oz cans, which is not bad, but was not broadcast on the product page as I would expect. These tasted fine, kind of like what I remember red bull cola tasting like when I tried it back in the day. I would definitely buy again, but I am hoping for some type of free shipping offer because shipping really kills my savings when I buy these instead of national brand drinks at the gas station.

It is good on eggs, meat, fish, veggies, table legs, mystery meat, breakfast, brunch, lunch, drunch, dinner, supper, snacks, old leather shoes, pieces of table cloth, tofu, sushi, Thanksgiving turkey, Christmas turkey, random middle of April Turkey, tacos, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, and of course french fries.  In summary, it is good on anything you can shove into your mouth.  If you accidentally drip some on your hand, you may end up nibbling off a few fingers!<br /><br />of course there's a lot of sodium in it, but that just means you can leave off the extra salt in the recipes.<br /><br />Buy one bottle for yourself, and another bottle for yourself.

A word of warning however, do not use much of it because it is very strong and your food can be left quite salty if you go over board! Additionally, for those of you who are wondering, NO, I am not related in anyway to the makers of this sauce.<br /><br />Good cooking and happy taste buds! jl

review/text: What makes Salsa Lizano so good?  It's the fact that they managed to bottle the flavor of Costa Rica.  If there is one definite thing that differentiates Costa Rican gallo pinto from Nicaraguan gallo pinto, it's the Salsa Lizano.  If you eat gallo pinto in Costa Rica, expect it has Salsa Lizano in it.  It's also good to pour some over the top of a plate of gallo pinto for a robust flavor addition.<br /><br />It's made in Costa Rica, pretty much only available in Costa Rica (aside from a few shopping avenues such as Amazon.com) and embodies a special flavor that can only be understood, not described well by anyone.  I can say it is not spicy.  It is flavorful.  It contains no yucky artificial anything.  If you ever get the chance to experience this sauce on a real or even semi-authentic Costa Rican gallo pinto recipe, you will surely be pleased.

review/text: Flavor is fantastic.<br />I agree with the other reviewer that this needs to be available in smaller bottles.<br />I contacted the mfg to make sure about storage and they said it needs to be refrigerated after opening, which is a bit of a pain because it's a tall bottle.

review/summary: Great for barbeque!!
review/text: This sauce will give you a great and original taste to your barbeque. My suggestion is to serve the sauce on the side (instead of on top of the meat) to enjoy your barbeque with the possibility of a variety of flavors. Enjoy!

review/summary: The best salsa in the world...
review/text: This salsa is the best in the world!  I am from Costa Rica and grew up on it.  But even my boyfriend (from Lebanon) loves, loves, loves this stuff.<br />The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price.  I live in Boston and you can get this sauce in Spanish markets for a third of price listed here (hint, hint, check out the Spanish markets in your neighborhood).  So the Lizano guys get four stars from me for trying to rip us off!!!

review/summary: Those in the know, know Lizano!
review/text: My colleagues begged me to bring back lizano sauce when they found out I was selected for a business trip to Costa Rica, stuffing money into my hand. I work for a U.S. based travel company, so these are people well versed in foreign specialties. Beyond discovering the country as a perfect vacation destination, and their local coffee company which has completely thrown me off of you-know-who's carmel whatziata (Ticos say they save the best beans for themselves), I discovered this spicy vinagry concotion. We made a special trip to a store just to hoard as many bottles as we could for our luggage (thankfully in plastic so they survived being checked-on). We even mixed up pico gallo (rice and beans with lizano) to spice up our presention when we got back! But those in my office addicted to the stuff always run out before the next group goes....But now that I found someone who stocks it, I won't, heehee....

review/summary: Incredible taste booster - take it from a native!
review/text: I grew up on this sauce & can't even think of not having any to cook with.  The uses for this sauce are multiple, and all my friends & co-workers that taste it get hooked on it.  It gives an incredible taste to meats/chicken ... I salt & pepper chicken thighs or breasts (not breaded), sprinkle this sauce over them & then cook on simmer in an electric skillet.  I also use this sauce to marinade & baste a roast pork.  It is incredible to season refried beans & chicken with rice.  I even use it in salads!!!  I am glad Amazon is carrying this sauce now, so I won't have to carry so many back from Costa Rica due to the multiple requests I get for it.

review/summary: Best Salsa Ever!
review/text: Lizano Salsa adds flavor and spices up a variety of dishes.  I recently went to Costa Rica and learned how to make the very best Bloody Mary's using it.  Start with a glass filled with ice add 2-3 TBLS of lemon and/or lime juice.  Add Lizano Salsa approx 1 TBLS or to taste.  Add a couple dashes of Lizano Tabasco sauce or amount depending on how spicy you like it.  Add black pepper and a dash of salt. Add Vodka and tomato based juice example bloody mary mix, reg tomato juice, Clamato, Vegetable juice, any will work. Shake and pour into glass with the ice.  Garnish with celery, green olives, and lime. Then sit back and enjoy :)

review/text: People DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE from Costa Rica. This product is harmful to your health as it contains Hydrolyzed Corn Protein which is MSG. This CHEMICAL is bad for your health and has different effects on your body.<br /><br />The numb skulls down in Costa Rica just want to make DINERO off of you and do not care what the consumers scarf down their throats. Just like the cigarette companies...their bottom libe is PESOS. Don't believe me? Just google Hydrolyzed Corn Protein and see for yourself.<br /><br />Also, this sauce can be easily made in your home with wholesome ingredients and without the chemicals and MSG that is detrimental to your health and your families health.

review/text: This stuff is super-fantastic.  It gives chili a great flavor (especially goes with a beer and some cornstarch to make a great chili sauce), and when added to a crockpot with chicken and cream of chicken soup, produces some fabulous seasoned shredded chicken for everything from tacos to enchiladas and burritos.  It's not chunky - very smooth like a puree - and is definitely high in sodium - you can feel it when you eat too much - but worth it for a splurge every few weeks.  Yum!

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I tried this at a friends house and decided that since it was so delicious I had to get some for myself. For some reason, I couldn't find this product anywhere. It wasn't to be found at any major grocery store or Hispanic market in the North Bay (SF metro area). Fortunately, I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Lizano Salsa has a very savor flavor with strong hints of cumin and turmeric. It is great because it can make simple bland dishes really come alive. You can add it to just plain black beans and rice for a quick, tasty, and inexpensive meal. It also goes really well on quesadillas and adds a nice zip to them. It isn't spicy at all, so I also like to add a dash of cayenne pepper when I use it.

review/text: A friend who grew up in Costa Rica gave me a bottle of Lizano Salsa several years ago.  It is the "Magic" ingredient in Black Beans and Rice - any many other things.  For years she has given me a yearly "salsa fix" - Even a huge jug one time.  It's nice to discover a source where I can now get my own - Amazon of course.  My 4 bottles were packed well and arrived in good shape.  The first one will be opened soon when my earlier supply from my Costa Rica connection runs out.

review/summary: GREAT STUFF but please read to find out why only 4 stars not 5
review/text: I was introduced to this stuff at a small outside cafe in Nosara, Costa Rica, where they made the BEST arroz con pollo i've ever had. So much so that we went back repeatedly, and over the years the lady remembered us and took us back into her kitchen where she showed us how to make it. I brought home several bottles of the stuff and each year we went back bought more. Sadly, I haven't made the trip in a while so I found myself scrambling. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was unable to find a normal sized bottle (23 oz will go bad before I can use all of it) but I didn't want to buy a bunch of small bottles either. the 4 star rating may or may not be fair as it has nothing to do with the quality of the product, but rather the way it is sold.

review/text: Like most of your reviewers, I tried this sauce in Costa Rica and fell in love with it.  I brought a bottle back and wished I had room for more.  I was shopping at one of the local, (St. Louis) mercados and found it.  They have the large 23.7 oz bottle for sale, (NOT ON sale) @ $4.99 so your minimum price of $7.99 per bottle (NOT including shipping) is WAY too high for my pocketbook.  I feel sorry for those who love it and have to purcase it online.  Thank God for the large Hispanic population in my area that make it worthwile for this market to carry it.

review/text: I first tasted this delicious sauce when I was on holiday in Costa Rica.  While I was there I was told it was unavailable in the states.  You can only guess my surprise when I found it on Amazon.  I was very happy.<br /><br />When people think of salsa they think of a hot, tomato tasting salsa.  Lizano is not this way.  It gradually warms your mouth, but never burns.  Its very pleasant sensation.  Lizano is not a sweet salsa.  It has an undercurrent of sweet vinegar. Its not bitter. Its a light, smokey brown in color.  I love it on chicken, eggs, and  rice.  Its amazing.<br /><br />The price was a bit steep, but I was happy to pay it since it was cheaper than another vacation to Costa Rica.<br /><br />The seller was an amazing fast ship.  I would definitely do business with the Costa Rican Store again.  They were great!
