review/summary: perfect lunchbox meal
review/text: my daughter is a vegetarian and i pack her lunch for her.  while it is easy to find things to send her off with, providing her with variety is tough.  along comes San-J...  she will take 2 packets of the white miso and a (refilled) bottle of water for a wonderful soup.  all she needs is a microwave and a bowl.<br /><br />aside from the convenience, the flavor is wonderful.  we like white miso for its subtlety.<br /><br />when this 36-pak runs low i will be getting more.  five stars.

review/summary: Only Have the BEST to Compare this to
review/text: I read all the POSITIVE reviews on this Miso soup before buying, and hoped it would somewhat compare with the soup I had gotten at the Japanese restaurant we frequented.  But, alas, I'm afraid it didn't come close.  I did like the sea weed and onion and would like to have had more onion in it.  The actual soup base itself is missing something; maybe fish sauce, soya, or SOMETHING, though it was salty enough. I am sorry to be a bum note in the feedback circle, but I AM a perfectionist when it comes to "taste".

review/summary: Excellent.. but price increased 40%
review/text: This is a great product and I used to buy this at the grocery store.  After searching, I found it here on Amazon for a much better price.  When I ordered this item a few months ago, it cost $35.38 for 36 packets.  Now that I have gone through most of the packets, I am here to order again.  Unfortunately, the price has jumped considerably!  Now the price is $49.58, up $14 (almost 40%!!)  Now the price is almost in line with regular grocery store prices ($1.38/packet -vs- $1.59/packet).  I think Jim Rogers is right.

review/summary: HIGH on convenience factor!
review/text: This was an impulse buy (I think Amazon is Latin for impulse buy) but it was one of those curious things I just had to try for myself.<br /><br />The convenience of putting the tub in the microwave and pulling it out ready to eat with no mess and no fuss is outstanding.  However, there are some very important things that should have been noted on the product description.<br /><br />First off, the instructions have "popping time" directions for microwaves that are between 450 - 850 watts.  It specifically says DO NOT use in microwaves over 850 watts.  Well, umm... mine is 1200 watts and I had 6 tubs of popcorn sitting here.  Well, needless to say... I did try it in my 1200 watt oven and watched over every second of the popping.  It took less than 90 seconds and it came out... PERFECT!<br /><br />Secondly, not all microwaves would be able to fit this tub inside!  It's about 6 inches high and you'll want at least an inch or two above it since it does pop over the edge (but is held in by the saran wrap type material).<br /><br />All in all, it was a good buy for me and I might purchase this again.  The taste and convenience was great, but I'd have to decide if it's worth the price difference on getting it by the box/bag.

review/summary: Inconsistent flavor
review/text: I rated this only 3-stars as an average. When I took it out of the microwave it smelled like I was at the snack counter at the movies. Wonderful aroma! And the top third of the bucket was outta sight, great flavor and texture. But as I worked my way down through the bucket the popcorn deteriorated in flavor until the lowest third tasted like cardboard. In all fairness, it might be my microwave. I dunno. But if I got this again, I'd pop a couple tubs, scoop out the top thirds and put it in another container, and throw the rest out to the birds (figuratively only - I don't think birds receive much benefit from seasoned or buttered popcorn). So, 5-stars for the top popcorn of the tub and 1-star for the popcorn at the bottom equals 3-stars.

review/text: First off, it says on the front that it should be installed indoors.  I cannot understand what use one would have for an indoor electric fence.  Second, it doesn't have enough juice to properly power 100' of electric poultry netting.  The charge should be between 2000 & 3000 volts on the fence, I could not even get a reading & could hold onto the fence.  When I connected the fence tester directly to the energizer I got a reading of almost 2000 volts, clearly insufficient.  I don't know what this product would be good for, I should have not tried to cheap out and gotten a Gallagher in the first place.  On the positive, amazon was great & processed my refund very quickly so at least I'm not out any money

review/text: I have a tolerance problem with caffein and usually decaf tea is weak and flavorless, not this Stash decaf Chai.  You can brew it for a long time and it doesn't get bitter like some teas.  It is delicious. I add a couple splenda packets and some hot milk and I'm set.  It's very, very good.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I have a hard time finding it at my local grocery stores.

review/summary: Not impressed by this tea
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

The caffiene-free Stash is a step above the rest for two reasons - better taste and no need to worry about drinking it several hours before bed time.  Best way to get the flavor from any bagged black tea is to microwave a cup of water for 2.5 minutes and immediately "throw" the tea in it from a distance.

review/summary: No thanks!
review/text: I bought a 10 pack sampler directly from Stash of the Decaf Vanilla Chai Tea, and I am glad that's all I bought!  This is not real vanilla flavor; it has very strong notes of chemicals and artificial flavors.  I tried this tea chilled with milk and sugar, and it has the same qualities of brewed potpourri. I'm not sure who could like this tea.  A much better tea is Stash's Organic Black and Green Chai tea, or Green Chai tea by the same company.  At least try the sample pack before buying 120 bags of this.

review/summary: This Tea is Even Winning over Non-Tea Drinkers
review/text: This is the first product that I have ever felt strongly enough to write a review on.  This tea has definately gotten some undeserved bad reviews.  It is a Chai Tea!!  It is supposed to be spicey, have a fairly strong flavor, and you are supposed to add sweetner and milk to it.  This VANILLA DECAF CHAI is fantastic!  My kids love it, my guests love it, and I love it!  Everytime I serve it, everyone wants to know where to get it and how I made it.  Even non-tea drinkers get hooked on it.  It is wonderful cold or hot, and has a lighter spice flavor than most Chai teas, but they added a touch of vanilla instead.  This tea really is one that you can enjoy everyday.  It really is worth a try.

review/summary: Elegant white tea AND raspberry . . . so very good!
review/text: After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.

review/text: This is my favorite tea ever, I drink it daily iced. It has a nutty rich flavor almost like a coffee. I used to drink Celestial Seasonings Dessert Teas but as usual another company has discontinued the products. I originally ordered a cse of this from Stash last year and was hooked and hopefully they won't take it off the market. It seems like all that's out there is fruit flavored teas, which I don;t like, so if you like a rich bakery flavor tea, this one is it.

review/summary: Perfect Dessert Tea - Baby Bear
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker and got tired of not having something to drink with a dessert. This tea is perfect with milk and sugar! I feel like a grown up when I drink it. Don't get me wrong I know I could just drink hot chocolate and I do but sometimes depending on what I have it with or when, hot chocolate is too sweet. Which feels hypocritical for me to say because that's how I like it, but only when it is the dessert. So this is my perfect medium. It's like a term I like to use, it's baby bear! We all know the story of Goldie Locks and the three bears. Well coffee is pappa bear's bed, too hard to get over the bitterness. Hot chocolate is mamma bear's bed, too soft or sweet for everyday. This tea is baby bear's bed, just right. Now I'm no Goldie Locks but I'd like to think of myself as that content when I drink this tea. Love it!

Surprisingly, barely a year has passed and I'm out (in spite of having an average of 4-6 other favorite boxes of tea open at any one time).<br /><br />As with most teas, the flavor definitely improves with a bit of milk or cream (my favorite) or honey (with the milk or instead of ...). Sometimes I brew two bags at once...my favorite: this vanilla nut with Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Smooth and delicious
review/text: I've been drinking Stash teas for some time now but usually stuck to their caffeinated versions.  Once I found out I was pregnant, I made the switch to decaf and was happy to find that Stash has a nice selection of flavored decaf black teas.  However, this tea in particular is a favorite.<br /><br />In order to really bring out the flavors, I would suggest adding some milk and a sweetener (I usually use honey and if I do use sugar, I use turbinado sugar).  This makes the tea very smooth and creamy, something close to a tea latte.  The flavor is nicely chocolaty with just the right touch of hazelnut, which I find to be overpowering in large quantities.  I often drink this tea as a dessert-like indulgence but it would also be good in the morning in place of a flavored coffee.

review/summary: Good, mild green
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply.

review/text: This is a great tasting Tea that is unfortunately no longer on the store shelves in my area.<br /><br />It tastes sort of like a creamy hot cocoa. So it's a great replacement if, like me you're lactose intolerant. It also comes in regular I believe for those who need their caffeine fix :)<br /><br />Also of note is that each tea bag is individually sealed in a foil package so the last bag is as fresh as the first. I've seen a lot of tea companies switch to loose bags and they get old quickly after you open the box. These are always fresh.

review/summary: chocolate hazelnut tea
review/text: The first time I tried it I was kind of dissapointed. It just tasted like chocolate flavored water. I brewed it a second time and got better results. You have to steep it till you get it kind of strong, add quite a bit of sugar and milk, and it is quite good, for a tea. I think that was the problem, I expected hot chocolate - you can't get hot chocolate from a tea. I would rather drink ovaltine, if I want something that tastes chocolatey. It does smell wonderful. I gave it four stars as a tea, and not especially as a hot chocolate drink.

review/summary: Not bad for a decaf green
review/text: As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea, I highly recommend Stash's regular green tea. That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh "green" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them.

review/summary: My cure for morning coffee
review/text: My doctor recently suggested (strongly) that I cut out my 3+ cups of coffee per day. Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid! I get my STASH with the regular subscription monthly. Can't be without my STASH Decaf Chai!

review/summary: Taste Okay
review/text: I ordered way too many boxes of this tea. I ordered several boxes before trying this tea, I had to give some of them away. It is not as good as I thought it was.  The key is to put more milk and a sweetener in it to improve the taste.  It taste okay, but not good enough for me to order this product a second time.

review/text: This is really, really great tea. It's rich and delicious (especially with just a dab or milk or soy milk in it).

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I didn't like tea very much until recently, and to me sugar and milk make tea taste disgusting. I've enjoyed a few flavors but when I got my hands on this, I knew it was meant to be. You take the teabag out of its pouch and it smells delicious, better than any tea I've ever smelled. Seriously, they could make potpourri out of this stuff! Compared to other chai's that I've tasted, this is my favorite. It comes in both decaf and caffeinated, so you can have it anytime... and just, yum. I highly recommend this tea!

review/summary: An office favorite!
review/text: All the ladies at my office LOVE this tea. I introduced a coworker to it and she convinced me to buy several boxes for the office. I just bought a box last Friday and today (Monday) it is half gone! The flavor is not super chocolatey, but has a delicate chocolate taste to it with creamy hazelnut notes. It's great with a splash of almond milk and a tiny bit of sugar. This and Mighty Leaf's chocolate mint truffle tea are my two favorite afternoon teas. When I'm craving something sweet, I just have a cup of this tea and it satisfies my sweet tooth and my chocolate cravings all at once. Again, if you're looking for a really chocolatey drink, this tea isn't anything like, for example, hot chocolate. It's just a hint of chocolatey and nutty flavor.

review/summary: Disappointed in STASH PREMIEUM TEA
review/text: STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used.  The Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea has absolutely NO flavor even when I try 3 tea bags to a cup of boiling water. I purchased 6 - 18 count boxes.  I had tried a hot chocolate tea in one of our little delis and it was wonderful.  I don't remember the name of the tea.  I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch.  I'm sitting here with over 100 tea bags with absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tea with flavor, I would discourage your using this tea.

review/text: One thing I like about Stash teas is the packaging. Each bag is sealed in a foil pouch which retains the tea's flavor. I also like the box because once I take the plastic wrapper off, it becomes a dispenser that I keep on my counter. I love the fragrance and taste of bergamot which is added to quality decaf tea to make Stash Premium Decaf Earl Grey Tea. I often breathe in the scent of the tea while waiting for it to cool. Heavenly!

review/text: I make Stash Premium Decaf Raspberry & White sun tea to drink iced during the warmer months. I make a half gallon at a time and add a quarter cup of sugar and store it in the fridge to drink through the week. The raspberry adds good flavor to the mild white tea. It's also good hot, but I prefer it iced. I get this once a year through the Super Saver program at Amazon which I'm very happy with as it's simple and saves me money. Since I drink a lot of tea, it's a good value.

That being said, be sure to not allow this tea to steep for more than a minute, and the water should *not* be boiling. Following that, the tea is most pleasant.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tucker

review/text: This Chai tea has such a great flavor. I drink it year round. In the summer I make iced tea out of it and always keep a container in the refrigerator. Once it cools off outside and I need to warm up I switch to hot tea. I've tried several other brands and always come back to this one. My grocery store stopped carrying the decaf version which I like since I drink so much iced tea in the summer, so I'm happy to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: THE ONLY TEA I DRINK!
review/text: Like others, I too have a big issue with caffeine.  And, most decaf teas are dull. Even the other Chai Teas (in other brands) didn't taste as good as Stash's Chai Tea decaf does.  So, this is the only tea that I drink!  It starts me off every morning.  I add 3 packets of the Natra Taste sweetener and some milk and it's just delicious!<br /><br />I love the flavor.  I do not find it heavy in clove, or cinnamon or anything.  I find this a very nicley well-balanced, flavored tea.  Of all the Chai Teas on the market (reg. or decaf) I love Stash's blend the best of all.<br /><br />I was buying it regularly at my Safeway grocery, and then for some reason, it just wasn't around anymore. In fact, there wasn't any decaf tea at all in the store.  Geez!  So, then I went over to the Giant (a longer drive), and was buying it there.  Suddenly, it's not there anymore either. Geez!<br /><br />Thank God I found it on-line.  So, these people have me now as a loyal customer and I hope this is going to be available for a long, long time.

review/summary: First Time Tea Drinker
review/text: I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.  I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.  I have a local store that sells items at a good price.  18 bags were $2.69, so I have no reason to buy it in bulk online.  I think I'd save 8 cents on a 3 month supply, then there's shipping.

review/text: I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural "flavors". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea.

review/summary: Love the Flavor
review/text: Stash Chocolate Hazelnut tea is my new favorite variety (and I drink a lot of tea). I bring the water just to the point where it starts to boil and then I pour. I let it steep for about 3 minutes and drink it hot. I added a half packet of stevia and a dash of milk to this tea and loved the results. It tastes rich and smooth and for me is a great substitute for hot chocolate. I could definitely taste the chocolate, but the nut flavor was less noticeable. I especially like that it's decaf, so I can drink it in the evenings while I'm relaxing with a book. I haven't tried it iced or without milk, but I plan to. I've tried other Stash teas and thought they were superior to most other brands I've tried.
