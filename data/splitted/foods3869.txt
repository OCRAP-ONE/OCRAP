review/summary: Bob's worst product
review/text: I love most Bob's Red Mill products and have been buying from them for 10+ years.  However, this is my least favorite of their products.  This stuff is easy to cook with, it's true, but it tastes like rubber, smells bad when it's cooking, and has no flavor until you add your own spices.  I have no idea why I used to cook with this stuff so often other than that I didn't know much about cooking in HS and it looked "high protein" on the label.  I recently read The Whole Soy Story by Kaayla Daniel (Amazon has it), and was amazed to learn that processed soy products like TSP are processed at high temperatures, denaturing the proteins and leaving in loads with antinutrients that damage the thyroid among many other health problems they cause.  Although TSP appears to be almost all protein (like meat or tofu), in reality, you don't absorb much of the protein, anyway.  While I am glad Bob's is using organic soybeans to make their TSP (thereby leaving out the pesticides and genetically engineered ingredients), the fact that it's "organic" doesn't make it a healthy or even a safe product.  The dangerous antinutrients in soy are not a chemical additive or pesticide, they are in intrinsic part of the beans themselves, the plant's natural way of deterring pests.  Traditional foods made from soy and eaten over the past 400+ years were slow cooked and fermented, destroying the antinutrients and leaving the protein, vitamins, and minerals intact.  TSP is the total opposite of whole, healthy, fermented soy products like tempeh or miso soup, as it is not fermented and leaves in all the antinutrients.  As a longtime vegan on a gluten-free diet because of food allergies, I'll continue to buy other Bob's products (they have an amazing gluten-free line), but I am saddened they are still making highly-processed, extremely unhealthy items like TSP.

review/summary: Delicious. A Good Product.
review/text: I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Chocolate wafer cookies at a nearby Fresh and Easy Store. It's only a 4.42 ounce bag, but otherwise is the same product. I wish I had an 8.82 ounce bag. These things are delicious. They're labeled chocolate, but they taste more like cocoa. I guess the taste is pretty close. In any case, they're not very sweet and I like that. They're also nice and fresh. It's a good product. I'll try some of the others when these are done.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Very different flavor, but good!
review/text: First off, lemme say that I've been eating sunflower seeds for over half my life. I've had pretty much every brand & flavor out there. For years I was buying the David variety of seeds because they're the most readily available. You can find them in pretty much any local store. And for the most part, I like the David seeds with one exception...too much salt! Going through a bag a day while at work would make my mouth dry and tore up from all the salt.<br /><br />So I took a chance & ordered a 12 pack of these seeds for a few reasons. First off, they're bacon flavored. What's better than that? NOTHING! Big props to the genius who combined sunflower seeds & bacon. Second, the reviews here are mostly favorable. Third, most of the reviews stated these had much less salt than David seeds. And they're right.<br /><br />I went through a bag of these seeds yesterday and they did not leave my mouth dried up like David seeds. The seeds are larger than average, but I'm not so sure they're bigger than David jumbo seeds. Nevertheless, if you're used to David seeds, get ready for a big change. The flavor of these seeds are pretty good overall, but very different from David seeds. The bacon flavor is somewhat authentic, but I would like to have a bit more of it in these seeds. It just seems a tad too weak in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these seeds. The resealable bag is a big plus too. I look forward to trying their other varieties.

review/summary: GOT TO HAVE 'EM
review/text: I drive alot for work. It's easy to snack and put on weight so I have turned to sunflower seads to help keep me alert and happy. I have tried about every seed seen at a convience store (except for the Jim Beam can't find em) and can't find a regular supply of these fabulous bacon salt seeds. They carry the Biggs regular and buffalo wing but I search thru the racks with no joy! I've shared seeds with a few good friends and now they ask me for them, we are all on the lookout from San Diego to the High Dezert. Until they are a regular stock item Amazon will keep the wheels turning. Amazon has a good price and free shipping on orders over $30 right now, can't wait to get them. Hope UPS/Fedex dosen't try them, they may never arrive haha.<br /><br />Spits are tasty seeds too but they are made in Canada I'd rather buy USA products given a choice.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I saw these in a local corner store and had to try 'em, and ended up eating the whole bag that day. I never would have imagined a company actually making a bacon flavored seed. One handful is never enough. May be too salty for some but not anymore than other name brand's salted flavor seeds. At the time I wrote this review one of the product details was 'zero calories', not true. There are 170 calories per 1/4 cup kernels (no shell). As some other reviews have stated there are some stems and broken seeds throughout but can easily be picked out before you throw them in your mouth. Decent price and awesome taste, highly recommended.

review/text: When I saw this product I thought it was going to be great.  BIGS claims to have bigger sunflower seeds.  I found that to be untrue.  David's JUMBOS sunnies are far bigger and juicier.  I found the BIGS to be a bit too salty and the actual seeds too dried out, some bitter.  There were too many empty shells in the bag as well.  It could be that the Bacon Salt flavor just didn't agree with me.  I'm willing to give one of the other flavors a try before I drop the whole BIGS line altogether.

review/summary: Good, but the garlic is overpowering
review/text: I recommend trying a single bag before going in head first with the Amazon 12 pack.  I found the 5.35 oz "Sizzlin' Bacon" flavored seeds at a liquor store for $1.60 (had it on my wish list but hesitant to commit $18 for a 12-pack).  Ate the first 1/3 of the bag....they were great! I should have stopped there and just enjoyed the flavor at that moment.  But I forged on with the second 1/3 of the bag. The salt and garlic became way overpowering!! I had to double check the ingredient list on the bag for garlic...yep, it's in there....like eating a whole clove! The garlic stayed with me thru the next day. I waited a few days to kill off the last 1/3.  I didn't enjoy the last 1/3 as I knew what I was in for with the garlic.<br /><br />The Bacon Seeds are good, not great.  That one bag was enough to satisfy my curiosity. I can't see committing to a 12-pack. It would be nice if BIGS had a variety pack.  The liquor store didn't have their other flavors, so I'll try them like I did this, one bag at a time as I come across them.

I can have a lot more Spitz brand seeds before my mouth says no more salt.

review/text: I buy sunflower seeds by the case on Amazon, but only after trying them first to make sure I like a given flavor.<br /><br />Yesterday I picked up single bags of various flavors and brands of seeds, including BIGS Sizzlin' Bacon. Out of the three taste testers (myself included), we all agreed they taste like they took regular sunflower seeds and roasted them with ramen noodle seasoning (I'd say somewhere between beef and oriental, so not too bad). While they do not taste horrible, they are still too salty and taste nothing like the front says they should. They don't even have a smokey flavor to them, just the saltiness of ramen.<br /><br />If you like ramen noodle seasoning, you'll enjoy these. If you want your bacon seeds to taste like bacon, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Far too salty (also beware if you have a milk allergy)
review/text: Let it be known that I love sunflower seeds.  And I like bacon.  So it seemed like this concept would have worked out well for sunflower seeds.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />These seeds are WAAAAYYY too salty.  I put a handful in my mouth and could barely swallow them because of how much salt there was.  The bag has a picture of bacon salt on it, but it seems as though there is too much salt and not enough bacon.<br /><br />Also, just like with the Bigs Dill Pickle sunflower seeds, there are a lot of non-seed particles in the bag.  I found myself spitting out stems, empty shells, and other plant parts far more often than I would have liked.  I was very disappointed by these seeds and would recommend the pickle-flavored ones anyday.<br /><br />Also, be advised that milk is listed as an ingredient for these seeds.  If you have a milk allergy or lactose intolerance, you should probably stay away from these.  But given how salty they are, you might find them inedible anyway.  I actually had to throw my bag away because they were just too salty to eat.

review/summary: Top Quality, Great Price
review/text: You can't go wrong here.  Nature's Variety is one of the top brands in terms of quality and I've researched this extensively.  If you choose the subscribe and save option the price cannot be beat anywhere.  The beef and lamb formula is the favorite of the Instinct flavors amongst my three dogs.  While not a cheap food, you get what you pay for.  I've been feeding Nature's Variety and admittedly a few other high quality brands for years.  First off, the amount to feed listed on the bag, at least for my adult dogs (10, 6 and 5 years old) is much lower than recommended.  My dogs generally get 3/4 cup twice a day, with the 10 year old getting a bit less.  A nice perk is very, very small stool production (gross I know) but if you have multiple dogs it's nice to have small "packages" to pick up in the yard.  (If you fed supermarket brands you'd be scooping all day- I know as I have a pet related business.) Kibble size will work for any size dog- big or small.  Perhaps most importantly, I truly believe your dogs will be healthier and live longer on Instinct foods.  My 10.5 year old Merlin is just starting to show signs of aging.  I adopted him as a scroungry rescue at age 3, so he didn't have the best start in life.  It's amazing what a great diet can do for a dog.  Definitely a food worth purchasing, and Amazon makes it easy.

review/summary: Good quality food
review/text: It's difficult to review a food when each dogs tastes may vary.  This food is a high quality, grain free food.  The kibble is small (slightly smaller than ToTW).  I moved my dog onto it after she spontaneously decided that she didn't like ToTW Pacific Stream anymore.  Reviews on dogfoodanalysis.com and dogfoodadvisor.com both list the food as a high quality food.  I have seen comments on using asorbic acid as a preservative that can lead to bloating if you pre-wet the food.  If that's the case, well, just don't pre-wet it.  My dog is loving this food and has been on it for several months.  Her coat and breath are both good.  I also add salmon oil and royal jelly to her food, so I don't know if it's the food or not.  She also has Antler chews in the house.  Either way, I'm just happy that the fussy eater is eating.  The subscribe and save option offers about $10 per bag off of the regular price, plus I'm a prime member so I don't pay shipping.  They offer the different flavors in small bags if you're interested in trying it out before investing in the biggers bags.

review/text: My Rat Terrier seems to love this food.  Usually, he eats a portion of what is in his bowl and stops.  Since I've started him on this Instinct he eats all of it in one go.  He has allergy problems and they seem to be less of a problem also.  The fact that the food is grain-free has to help with the allergies, and without the grain the food has more nutrition.  I've been very pleased with this food.  It arrived well packaged and in excellent condition.

review/summary: Happy dog, happy tummy, happy human.
review/text: My nine year-old labracollie has a very sensitive tummy and is allergic to a lot of foods.  I started my labracollie on Instinct Grain-Free Duck/Turkey about two months ago, when I ran out of her usual dog food (which was working out "okay") and had to give her our wiener dog's food.  I immediately noticed how pungent this dog food was.  It smelled very concentrated but I ensured myself it was not bad by checking the kibble and expiration date.  The smell may shock some people, but after that initial surprise, I noticed how eager my dog looked when she got a whiff of this food.  I think some dogs like stinky-smelling food.  She started eating it right away, and the very next day I was happy to see that she passed a normal stool!  It was even great that she was not scratching like she a maddog.<br /><br />After she did well on the Duck/Turkey, I bought the Beef/Lamb.  She was fine on this one too.  I try to give her a variety of options to keep her interested in her meals so I was glad that I found at least two choices<br /><br />It's only been two months so I can't comment on how she does long-term.  I will probably update this review if I find notice anything that I feel could be shared.  My dog is about 52 pounds and I go through the 13-pound bag in about two weeks.  The results, so far, definitely validate the additional cost; and I feel this brand is decently priced compared to other grain-free dog foods out there.  So far she has tried the Turkey/Duck and Beef/Lamb and she liked both of them, and is still passing normal stool.  Unfortunately she's allergic to chicken so I can't give her the Chicken mix and she has never particularly cared for fish so I am debating if I should bother with the Salmon Meal.  My next bag will probably be the Instinct Grain-Free Limited Ingredients, just to give it a try.<br /><br />So to recap...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for dogs with sensitive tummies and food allergies<br />2. Kibbles are small.<br />3. Reasonable price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Smells strong.

Five stars because both my "complaints" are trivial and are irrelevant to the quality of the product.

review/summary: a little disappointing . . .
review/text: I ordered this tea in search of a good chai in a tea bag. (My favorite is Harney & Sons "Indian Spice" but it is a loose tea, pretty expensive, they make tea bags, too, but they are even more expensive.) So I was on a mission to find a really good chai, with less mess.  The spice in this chai is great, tastes very good, but it is lacking tea flavor and body, if I put too much milk in it, it over powers the tea altogether.  It just seems watery to me, maybe I'll try 2 tea bags per cup.  I really relied on the reviews above and the worst part is I bought the 6-pack and now I have all this tea I really don't care for.

review/text: While Numi's Ruby Chai has an overtone of mixed ginger and cloves, their Golden Chai makes the notes of cardamom and cinnamon more obvious. The two teas are surprisingly different, despite the fact that they both share a certain warmth and coziness. The assam tea that serves as a base for the Golden is a mellow, mild black, giving the tea its golden color and light flavor. You end up with a mellow, subtle, warm, complex blend that holds your tastebuds' attention while it warms, relaxes and refreshes you.

review/summary: Authentic, delicious chai flavor
review/text: I love chai (unsweetened) & usually sprinkly the spices in a standard black tea. However, I've tried other chai formulations so I can get the chai flavor quickly. I tried the Numi Golden Chai for the first time a couple months ago at a small coffee shop near the Indiana University campus & liked it so much that I asked if they sold boxes of the tea bags. I quickly finished the bag of tea in a couple weeks, but live two hours away & wouldn't make a trip to IU to buy the tea. The next best thing was to search for it on the Internet. I found several places, but ordered the multiple boxes from Amazon because the price with free shipping made the overall cost less than other vendors. The tea is the same delicious blend that I can now enjoy for a few more months before I have to re-order my new favorite tea bag formulation!

But this is awesome! It's beat out my usual morning Earl Grey and I'd certainly drink a lot more of it if it was easier to find. Amazon appears to be out of it. Two other sites I tried ordering from were out and the store I originally bought it from said it wasn't part of their regular inventory and wasn't something they were planning to stock again. I think Tazo hates me. This is the second tea of theirs I've fallen in love with and can't seem to get my hands on.

review/summary: delighful, surprisingly original and great tasting tea!!
review/text: I have been long-time fan of the Earl Grey Tea...  I love drinking tea, and have tried endless variety over the years...  and I always come back to Earl Grey...  there is such a simple, yet powerful magic in the taste of black tea with the citrus flavor of bergamot...<br />(and of course, not all the brands deliver the same standard of excellence, there are some Earl Grey brands, that taste as bland as any generic black tea...)<br /><br />All right, that being said, discovering this Tazo Focus was quite a delightful surprise.  I just randomly bought it in a store, that I could not later remember, and when I was ready to buy another box, I was not able to find it in any of the stores I usually shop at - that's why I turn to Amazon.  As usually, I was not disappointed, and I found it here (except I had to buy six-pack, now that's quite a supply of tea!! :).<br /><br />Anyway, the combination of orange essence and cocoa peel is surprisingly tasteful and delectable, and in a lot of ways reminds me of really good Earl Grey in it's uniqueness.  I do not regret having to buy the whole six pack, as I have already gone through one of the boxes in less than two weeks.<br /><br />Bottom line - love the taste, and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who likes delicious and unique tasting tea!!

This blend is very pleasing and not quite as strong as "Awake" which is also a favorite of mine and not quite as bluntly fruity as some other black and fruit mixes. Much more interesting than Earl Grey although I love that too. I found this one first at Target and when they stopped putting it on the shelf I started the web search. I was so worried it was going to be discontinued I bought a 6 box case. I hope they do not discontinue it as it is really part of my routine now.

review/text: I also discovered this at a giant-sized Target (the smaller Targets don't usually carry this, and the giant Target runs out) - and fell in love with this! This is a dark tea with smooth RICH QUALITY cocoa and orange undertones. I prefer stronger tea - so I steep two bags in 12oz of water, then add a couple of ounces of milk. (I recently developed itchy rashes to Splenda, so am bummed that I can't drink this as sweet, anymore!) The "darkness" - and the "caffeine" level - is moderate-to-moderately high, compared to other teas. It was virtually impossible to find this at local stores, so I ordered 15 boxes online (I think it was via an Amazon seller offering free shipping - and came out to a little more than $3 per box. At first, I thought I was going to have to give boxes away, but I loved this so much that I'm down to the last box! I go through weeks of craving this stuff! (When I'm not drinking this in the early morning, I might drink TAZO "Awake" with a Mighty Leaf "Vanilla Bean" +/- a Mighty Leaf "Chocolate Mint Truffle" . . . or a Lady Grey or an Earl Grey . . . just to give you an idea of what tastes I lean toward. I love the flavor of rich coffee - with a little cream - more, but my stomach and skin often can't handle the acid and caffeine, so I am always looking for a rich full-bodied interesting tea that can fill the bill! :)

review/summary: TACO FOCUS and TAZO THRIVE
review/text: Finally two great tasting teas. I picked up these two teas on a whim at Target. The flavor of the TAZO FOCUS was so different and I think it is the cocoa petals. I reviewed the TAZO tea site and did not even find them there. I sure hope they do not discontinue them. They contain Mate' which I have been meaning to try but the flavor of Mate' by itself is not great.

review/summary: Improves Mental Clarity?
review/text: Tazo's Focus tea is a blend of black tea, lemon balm, chicory, cocoa peels, roasted yerba mate, rose petals, citrus essence oil, rosemary and natural flavors. To me it mostly tastes like a mild lemony tea. It tastes pretty good with a few tablespoons of powdered milk (so it doesn't dilute the taste like milk would) and a packet of stevia. What I've noticed with this tea is how it makes the world shimmer. It is as if you are more aware of beauty when you have had a cup of this tea. I've read negative and positive things about yerba mate. So I think it is best to drink this tea occasionally and not to drink it instead of your normal tea or coffee. It is good if you want to focus on reading a good book but this tea can also make you a bit jittery from the caffeine. I also noticed that this was a good appetite suppressant. When I drank this a few hours before dinner I ate way less than normal. I was only eating a salad but made it much smaller than a dinner salad and even skipped adding the chicken. This tea also contains theobromine which is found in chocolate. Since some articles online state that yerba mate causes cancer and others say it cures cancer it is probably best to do your own research before deciding if you want to drink this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I purchased mine through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for $8.73 per order *I got 2* 'cause it was such a good price! These normally go for $3.49/per bag in the supermarket/grocery store and usually are not 1 of the type of Pepperidge Farm Cookie that goes on sale at all, unlike their Milano Cookie Brand counterpart which do on a semi-regular basis. A great deal, highly recommended, buy them if the price is right!

review/text: The plants arrived, looking healthy, and carefully wrapped in labeled bits of tissue paper. They all look very much alike, all green with none of the colorful bits in the photo, so I didn't even try to keep them separate or keep up with their names. I placed them in a cup of water for 20 minutes and then arranged them in and on small containers. I'm hoping they thrive and grow. I'm terrible at watering plants just right, but maybe I can do better with these tiny bits of life.

review/text: Cahill's Prickly Pear Syrup is a decent rendition of this product.  It tastes very good. My only observation here is that (at the time I bought it) the price was the same as the price for an equal amount of Cher's Prickly Pear Syrup, and Cher's is quite a bit thicker and more highly concentrated -- so you're really getting more for your money.  If the price for Cahill's was 20% lower than the price for Cher's I would rate them both 5 star.

review/summary: The perfect margarita
review/text: While traveling to the Texas coast last winter we spent a few days in Fredricksburg where my wife fell in love with prickly pear margaritas at our favorite restaurant.  We spent the rest of our trip searching for prickly pear syrup with no sucess.  Once we got to our winter destination I took what is usually my first option when looking for something: check on Amazon.  I ordered one bottle of Cahill to see if it was worth the price and, upon receipt and a homemade prickly pear margarita, I attempted to purchase several more bottles.  Unfortunately no further were available from Amazon, so I had to search the net for another source which we located and purchased.

review/summary: Don't Fall For This Scam
review/text: I hadnt realized when I purchased this that is said sold individually. It was to my understanding that you got an assortment of 1 of each of the 3 flavors.  1.99 for a lollipop WOULD have been acceptable, if<br />1. The shipping didn't cost 8 dollars. (How hard is it to put a piece of candy in an envelope.  Seriously? thats 40 cents.)<br />2. The candy was received completely unmarked.  It is a single, red lollipop wrapped in unmarked, clear plastic and its TINY. About the size of a Dumdum sucker.<br />3. It says "choose from 3 flavors" and I did NOT get that option.  I just got a random color.  Turned out to be red.<br /><br />Finally, we decided to try the thing and didn't even finish it. It went in the trash.  It smelled like a hamster cage /pet store and tasted more like concentrated oregano than its advertised flavor.  Over all it was bad in every way.  Don't eat this.<br /><br />I still haven't heard back from the seller, even though I contacted them. Based on the other seller reviews, this seems to  be a common issue when there is a problem.  Avoid at all cost.<br /><br />Bad seller. Bad policies. Bad product all around, no matter who you buy it from. "Kush Kandy" is just a gross, sketchy product in every way.

review/summary: amazingly delicious!
review/text: While in Dublin, I stopped by Butlers and picked up a few different types of chocolate. While they are all good, this one is simply amazing. Everyone in my family (and extended family) raved about it (we had to ration pieces so all could try it). Just let it melt in your mouth and savor the flavor. We must get more!
