review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: After a rash of pet food recalls about seven years ago we went searching for a brand that was not involved in recalls--and that's how we ended up with Holistic Select.  Never a regret, it's an awesome dog food.  And as it turns out, not only has our dog done well, but she thrives on the hypoallergenic duck and oatmeal type.

review/summary: Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100%
review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe.

review/summary: Noticable Weight Gain in My Dog After Only 6 Days of Feeding Her This
review/text: My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing.

review/text: I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs.  He loves it and, in my view, it is a very healthy dog formula. I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein.  My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select. I rate this product 5 stars.

review/text: We have been feeding our three dogs Eagle Pack Holistic for almost eight years.  I've never once had a reason to question the integrity of the company or the health benefits from feeding it to my dogs.  Eagle Pack has never recalled any of their foods (even when it seemed like almost every other brand was).  They have a great proof of purchase rewards program.  You can sign up on their website to receive monthly coupons.  My dogs have amazing coats, amazing teeth, and amazing energy.  I don't think that there is a better food that could be recommended.

review/summary: It's a Keeper
review/text: We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16" thick and 3/8" or so in diameter. They vary some.

review/text: I can't say enough nice things about Eagle Pack brand dog foods, especially their holistic line.  Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good food for English bulldog
review/text: We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.

review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.

Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product.

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

However, a quick call to customer service - within 3 minutes, the phone was picked up and no question asked - they told me the first batch of bowl has some manufacturer defect and they promptly offer a full replacement with no further questions asked on receipt etc.  Mine was one of the first initial batch that was bought at Babysrus.  The new shaft and bowl will be sent to me and I have to return the lid - all return shipping paid by the company.  I would give my comments on the new design later.  But as far as the two months use, and the great customer service - I will give it 5 stars.  The design is really really innovative.  I compared to the competitor's product - this wins hands down.  There's no transfer of food. I can carry my baby on one hand, and throw some carrots (chopped) and peas / spinach and add clean water (cos' the water will steam the food and will be in the bowl as part of the puree) - and press a button (Steam and blend) and just wait for 15-30mins (depending on the quantity) and all will be ready.  It's as easy as ABC - scoop out the food and serve - fresh and hot :  If the puree is not fine enough - just hold down the blend button for one more round and it will come out in smooth consistency.  I like it with a little texture since my baby is a big older. There's enough control and I foresee using it for the first few years.

review/summary: doenst work to reheat/defrost right in jar or glass container
review/text: I think this machine is nice and the steam and blend cycle is nice but it takes an insignificant amount of extra time to dump food from basket directly into the blending container in the Beaba.  So as far as this difference I don't really think it is significant enough to go with the Brezza.  Beaba now makes a larger machine also.  I guess the cost is a little less for the Brezza but because of the disadvantage I am about to mention it absolutely does not work for me!  I chose the Beaba because you cannot put your jar or small glass container right into the Brezza to defrost or reheat like you can with the Beaba because of that middle rod that is part of the blades.  It is completely in the way in my opinion and they force you to use their plastic containers to store and reheat food!  I freeze my baby food in these tiny glass lock containers because I try to use glass when I can for storage.  I also buy the glass organic pre made baby food when I don't have time to cook as a backup and I need to be able to warm those since the baby doesn't eat the whole jar yet so I store left overs in the refrigerator.  You can put the jars and the glass containers directly in the Beaba basket to defrost and heat and I could not use the Brezza to do it.  I would have to defrost at room temp or in fridge then transfer to heat which takes way too long and I would have to transfer to the brezza containers which are plastic and then heat.  Not only this is completely time consuming (I do not use the microwave it irradiates your food, destroys nutrients and it is horrible!) it is also plastic and even though BPA free I am trying to avoid plastic like I mentioned so just steaming and blending in plastic is already too much for me so for storage I use glass only.  So this is a good machine but if you are looking for defrost/reheat function where you can put your own containers and jars into this machine will not work.

review/summary: very disappointed
review/text: I was so excited to get this product and start making baby foods for my little one. The product demonstrations sold me, despite all the mix reviews, I ended up buying it anyway. Two weeks in, the product stopped working, and I was so bum because I barely used it to puree peas and carrots. The most I used it was 2 times a week over 2 weeks... I tried calling customer service they never call back, I left messages but no luck. Now the product just sits there collecting dust. We ended up using a regular food processor for the past 2 months 4 times a week and no problem. I wish I didn't spend so much money on this product. I should have listened to the bad reviews and not buy this product.

review/summary: Great while it works...now leaks oil
review/text: I bought this when my daughter started eating food...around 6 months of age.  It works great although it doesn't make a large amount of food...maybe enough for 3 servings.  But now that I've been using it for about 4 months I noticed the drive shaft is looking a little blackish/rusty and leaking black which spills into the food when you pour it out.  I tried to take out the drive shaft before I poured it out but the taste of the food doesn't taste right.  I can't feed the food to my baby any longer using this machine.  I'm going to return it and probably just make it the old fashioned way.  If you want to try a baby processor try another brand.

review/summary: Go With Another Option
review/text: The first problem with this product is the fact that their manual is so vague and also incorrect. The manual indicates to fill the water to the 160mL line - it says 180mL on the carafe. The instructions are incomplete - I had to call them to get clarity on exactly how much water I should be putting in for just an ounce or two of food. The gentleman on the phone that helped me was very nice, however, after doing what he told me, I noticed that there was still water in the reservoir after steaming. Additionally, the food was cold again within seconds of pulling it out. I also don't like the fact that after steaming, the water dilutes the baby food - you have to drain it and, in the process, you lose much of the food that was in there in the first place. The whole reason I chose Brezza over the Bullet was for the steam feature which is extremely flawed.<br /><br />Also, again, following the directions, I used the steam and blend feature for some fresh China Peas I was pureeing for my daughter. After it steamed and blended, there were still pretty decent chunks in the puree - enough to have my child coughing and nearly choking.<br /><br />I read one of the other mommy's reviews on this product about how she had to take the thing apart to fix it and make it work, and, frankly, at the price you pay and the limited time you have with a baby, I don't want to take a machine apart for it to work.<br /><br />I took my Brezza back and have been using my Vitamix blender and it's AWESOME. Everything is silky smooth after I blend and now for steaming, I just put the baby container in hot water for a bit and it's warmed. SAVE YOUR MONEY.

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: Ive been using my baby brezza for close to two months now and it has been exactly what i was looking for.  In fairness I havent utilized the reheating feature because as of right now Im only needing one container at a time and its easier to just put it in the fridge the night beforeto defrost.  As for steaming and blending I couldnt be happier.  The texture is nice and if your little one is starting to eat more textured food you can set it to steam only and then just pulse the blend button to your desired consistency.  If you are looking to make HUGE batches of baby food the good ole steamer basket and blender with ice trays will still be your better bet, but if like me you make food for your little one (based on what you are eating) throughout the week it is a wonderful help.

review/summary: Making Baby Food is a Breeze with the Baby Brezza!
review/text: I started using the Baby Brezza a couple of months ago and I have been able to make fresh, homemade, tasty baby food for my 7.5 month old daughter with such ease it has been a delight!  I wish this had been around when I had my first daughter as I attempted to make her baby food, but gave up after a couple of weeks.  The Baby Brezza has made it possible as a working mom of two young girls to make my little one's meals that are easy to make and don't require constant monitoring.  You just chop up the veggies, select the steam time, press steam & blend, and walk away.  A little while later, the food is ready and there's only a few parts to clean up.  I can make her food 2-3 times a week with different ingredients and blend different veggie/fruit combinations.  I've tested sweet potato, apples, pears, peas, carrots, avocado (just blending), mango, peaches & plums and various different combinations. I envision this will be useful for many months and afterwards steam veggies for the entire family.  It will definitely more than pay for itself with the money saved!  Of course, I could make it with other kitchen equipment, but the Baby Brezza saves so much time and makes the whole process much easier and I'm much more likely to continue to make her food for as long as possible.

review/summary: Best for smaller quantities
review/text: When I made baby food I liked to make massive quantities, freeze them in ice cube trays, and store them in Gallon storage bags.  After using the Baby Brezza for a few months it stopped working.  The company quickly sent me a replacement part, however during that time I realized it was much easier to just steam fruits and/ or veggies on the stove and process in a food processor.  It was a much more efficient method.<br /><br />The 'set it and forget it' motto is nice, however it cannot be used with every food.  Most fruits (apples and pears for example) have to be drained after steaming and before processing.  This means you can't just set it and foroget it.  Certain vegetables (broccoli) require adding water prior to processing.<br /><br />This product would probably be best for making smaller quantities and if you don't already have a food processor.<br /><br />It also comes with great recipes which are all from (...)

review/text: The baby breeza worked great for a couple of months.  The machine started leaking grease from the driveshaft into the food.  It made my stomach turn to think I had been giving my son food with grease!  I bought this machine b/c I didn't want to give my son baby food from a jar and so that I know what he's eating.  I was very disappointed.  I also searched to see if other people have had the same problem and I was not the only one.  I ended up buying a Ninja blender and a stovetop steamer.

review/text: I have heard that there were some problems with the older model of this device due to defective drive shaft (gray color).  The good news is that the one I purchased is the new model with the orange-colored drive shaft.  I've used it for a few months now and would say that it works well and is incredibly easy to use. So far, no issue with leakage and I know not to put the drive shaft in the dishwasher (although all the other parts can go in there).  I love the ability to steam and puree food all in one step so making baby food doesn't get any easier than this!

review/summary: Nothing special, really
review/text: Got BabyBrezza 5 month ago. Nice for steaming, but blending never worked properly. Here is why:<br />1. When you steam the food a lot of water gets accumulated in the food container - too much, so before I blend I have to get some water out. The instructions said that you can get water in the food container if you put too much water in the water chamber - this not true, I tried everything and no matter what there is just too much water in the food container.<br />2. The food is not blended enough to be as smooth as the babies prefer there food, so I ended up blending the steamed food in the blender. And, there are always a couple of chunky peaces in the bottom of the container after blending. Fine, I could use the blending function on a later stage, I thought. But...<br />3. After 4 month of use (mostly for steaming), the blending function is not working. The machine makes a loud noise but the blades do not move. Some reviews suggest how to repair this "flaw", but seriously, I just gave up.<br /><br />Finally, I got a hand mixer and happy with it. The baby does not need all foods to be pureed anyway now.<br /><br />I considered BabyBeaba before I got BabyBrezza, but my fried had issues with that one since the steaming chamber cracked within two month and the replacement did exactly the same again.<br /><br />Other flaws of BabyBrezza:<br />- loud when blending<br />- a piece of plastic broke on the bottom of the food container after 2 months.<br /><br />I would have returned it after the first use but my husband threw out the box instantly. :)

review/summary: Four Units Same Drive Shaft Lock-Up Issue
review/text: We love this unit when it is working and has become a staple in preparing food for a son. The down side is every 2 to 3 months the Drive Shaft locks up. We have been going back to the store and exchanging it for another one. At first we thought it was user error and we might have gotten the Drive Shaft wet causing it to lock up. But we never put it in water, the dishwasher and only wipe it down and immediate dry it and every single Brezza has developed the locking Drive Shaft. I have read in another post Brezza has a fix and recall in place for the Drive Shaft! We have not received a message from Brezza about this. I have e-mailed them looking for some assistance. In the mean time we are off to do another exchange today.<br /><br />The Drive Shaft locking up as been our only issue and it this is in fact fixed I would be inclined to change my rating.

review/summary: fantastic time-saver... some assembly required
review/text: We love the Breeza baby food maker. In a household where my wife's 'neat and tidy' habits forbid even our toaster from being out on the counter (it's hidden away in a drawer), this baby food maker is the only product that broke through her edict of no appliances out. With a six month old, it's just that much of a timesaver. Both because you just set it and forget it, and because it's just a single dish to clean, instead of having to use a separate steamer and blender. We love it.<br /><br />The ONLY problem with it, is that ours came only partially functional. The blending didn't work. A quick search on the internet revealed that some of the units come from the factory with the drive belts misaligned (or maybe they slip in shipping). I'm savvy enough to remove the screws, open the unit, set the belt properly, and reassemble the unit. I found it quite easy, but I could imagine some who would not. After resetting the belt, the unit works perfectly, and is just an incredible tool in giving our daughter home-made baby food with a minimum of effort.

review/summary: Breaks Easily!
review/text: I ordered this unit and loved it initially.  After about 8 purees, I noticed little bits of hard, clear plastic in my dish rack and realized that they had broken off of the bottom of the Baby Brezza unit.  These small bits of plastic hold the drive shaft in place.  The unit can still be operated but it is very difficult and frustrating.  It is very hard to mount the unit and have the lid stay on without the drive shaft being properly supported.  I have contacted the company and hope to get a replacement unit soon.  How discouraging though that this happened after just a few uses.  I have never used the dish washer to clean it either, so that I could just leave the drive shaft in place.  I will also comment that pulling the blade out of the unit in order to clean it is difficult which is probably what led to the plastic pieces breaking off.  Had the item not broken so quickly I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars.  I love the recipe booklet that comes with it.  My son loves the variety of purees that I have made him.  The idea of steaming and blending in one step is so convenient.  Hopefully my next unit will not break.

It steams even the hardest veggies and fruits to perfection. The food comes out very pureed and soft, great for a baby 4-6 months. It's quick as well. I also love the fact that it also comes with a guide telling you when and what your infant should be eating by the age. A fantastic product that I would recommend anyone to get.

review/text: I have been using this for a week and love it!  The instructions are terrible but this is a great idea and is very easy to use.  I love that one product does it all:steams, blends, warms, defrosts.  Also, make ur life easier and buy the insert containers that drop right in the machine. Its worth an extra $18 and will help you with portions.  Very satisfied with purchase so far.  ++Well, its been 2 months now, and my opinion has changed. There is a black lubricant/oil coming out of the machine and getting into the food.  Amazon will not accept a return for this item. WTF. I spent $118 (with accessories) and only got 2 months of use.  Again, great idea, but poor execution.  The machine is not of good quality.  I should have just bought a blender that I can use for other things besides making baby food.  A lesson learned, an expensive lesson.

review/summary: Baby Brezza is a Breeze
review/text: With all of the things I'm getting used to as a new mom, one being that I just don't have time and/or energy to get a lot of things done around the house, Baby Brezza sure has been a big help! Just put the food in and walk away! I've even tried some of the recipes that came with the manual, and my son hasn't turned one down yet :-) I also have the storage containers with the daily markers (which I love) and the spatula. Both work great.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to say that I also received one that didn't blend properly at first. I used the steam and blend function on my first try, and when it got to the blending, it made the noise but didn't move. However, I didn't take mine apart. I pushed the manual blend button and it worked. Ever since then, it's been working fine on both settings. (I don't suggest this as a fix but just thought I'd share).<br />Also, I don't have that many machines in my kitchen so I don't have much to compare it to. But, do all food processors make that much noise??? I thought this was a task I'd be able to do when my son's asleep (which is when I get most things done) but that is not an option.<br /><br />Still, I'm a fan!

review/text: As a first time mother I spent hours researching and preparing for my daughter's arrival last July. She is my first child and I wanted to make sure I knew as much as possible about food and nutrition for a happy and healthy baby.  I breastfed for 3 months and then had to stop due to some health issues I was having.  I wanted to make sure that when it was time for her to start soft food she was getting the maximum amount of vitamins and nutrients needed for optimum health.  I was given the Baby Brezza at my baby shower and when my daughter turned 4 months I decided to give it a try. The set up is a breeze and the recipes included were labeled by age, so I knew which ones to make for her based on her age.  I decided to try the carrots and pears first.  From prep to clean up it took all of 20 minutes of my time. I followed the recipe for 1 batch which was 2 carrots and 1 pear and I was able to make 5 jars of food.I felt even better that it was preservative and chemical free and only cost pennies to make as opposed to store bought baby food that can run as much as a $1 per jar. It steamed and pureed everything beautifully and tasted AMAZING!!!  My daughter gobbled it up and even wanted more!  Clean up was a breeze.  I honestly didn't think making my own food would be so simple.<br />This sleep deprived first time mother gives Baby Brezza 5 stars.  I love it.  Set up and clean up is easy.  Great recipes.  And I make quality food for my daughter for just pennies a jar.  Highly recommend it for parents and those looking for baby shower gifts.

review/summary: Must have product, wonderfull customer service.
review/text: Purchased this product in August 2011, made our life so much easier, Steam+Blade can not beat that when preparing the baby food, and this is way better than buying off the shelf, You know You can put the best organic products for You baby. Also what a wonderful customer service they have.<br />The holders on the bottom for the blades got broken. I called in on Sunday 2/12/2012, left a message additionally send mail, Nancy got back to me on Monday next day in the morning, I explained the situation, since I have the old model - no question was asked - they send me the new machine. THAT what the Customer service should be. Excellent experience of using the product and feeling like they treat the customers like they deserve.

review/text: I bought a similar model in the fall and after three uses the motor burned out and the blend function would not work. After that I would have rated this machine a lot lower. So, why the 4 star rating? I contacted the company and they sent me a completely new machine this week! Excellent customer service and now I am back up and running making food for my baby.

review/summary: Hard to Remove the Blade
review/text: I've had the Brezza for about 4 months and have blended many fruits, vegetables, and meats with it. It steams and blends well. It is quite convenient to simply put the contents in the bowl and set the machine to do the rest. I really like that it has a button that will steam and blend as well as a separate setting to manually blend and to steam. It also comes with a recipe booklet with a list of how long to steam common items, which is very helpful. Luckily I have not experienced the issues some of the 1 star comments have discussed. If I do I will definitely submit an update.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a novelty item more than anything since using a steamer and a blender/processor will do the job just as well, although having to only deal with one dish is better than handling two. At least those are common kitchen items that anyone will get more mileage out of for other reasons besides making baby food. Have that in mind when considering whether or not you want to buy the Brezza.<br /><br />My main complaint is that it is EXTREMELY hard to remove the blade, which makes it difficult to get the food out from the bottom of the bowl. The only way to remove the blade is when the bowl is on the unit. It took me a while to figure out that the blade needs to be turned and pulled at the same time while the bowl is still on the unit. It doesn't matter if you turn it clockwise or counter clockwise, just pull/turn and hope it comes out.  This is very hard to do especially when the blade is not clean because I can't get a good grip to pull it out. I now use a paper towel to get a better grip. The top piece of the blade shaft ALWAYS ends up coming apart from the rest of the blade when pulling, which is very annoying.<br /><br />Overall the Brezza gets the job done by consolidating two common household kitchen items into one, which makes the baby food making process much more convenient, but it definitely has its kinks that need to be ironed out.

review/summary: Good product, but it broke after 2 months
review/text: I used the Baby Brezza for about 2 months and it broke. It was good while it lasted - very easy to use.  A couple issues I did have with it -<br />1) It is difficult to remove the blender attachment. It seemed to be easiest to remove while hot but you have to be careful not to burn yourself in the process. Otherwise, it took a lot of force to pull out the attachment.<br />2) It broke after two months - it was the plastic part that helps to hold the middle rotor on the bottom. I didn't use this that often - probably 3-4 times every week since my baby just started solids and there were a few things I just mashed up instead of using the Baby Brezza.<br /><br />I had intended to get this replaced through Baby Brezza but saw that it would cost $10 for me to ship it back to them - since this seemed like poor manufacturing on their part, I didn't want to pay to have it shipped back to them. I contacted Amazon and they provided me with a postage paid shipping and refunded the money very promptly.<br /><br />I ended up buying a pressure cooker and using my food processor which seems to work just as well - it does mean using more pots/items which means a little bit more clean up but it's actually faster and I can make larger batches of food.

review/summary: Did I just get a lemon?
review/text: I researched every available baby food maker on amazon.com and this one seemed to be the best bang for the buck. It steams and then purees the food in one fell swoop.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Steams quickly and throughly, as long as food is cut into small chunks.<br />-Has a steam and puree setting, so little handling or work on your part until the food is ready to eat. However, the instructions do suggest that you first drain the container when cooking foods that have a high water content.<br />-Makes enough for a new eater to have food for a week. You won't be spending all your time making baby food, because who has time for that?<br />-Fruits and vegetables are blended to a smooth consistency, great for new eaters.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Removal of food and clean-up is a pain, because the blades do not come off easily. Blades slip onto the top of the container, and food and water can slip down the opening once the blades are removed.<br />-Water gets into the drive shaft while steaming, and I am pretty sure the instructions said not to immerse the drive shaft in water. Not sure how this will affect future functioning.<br />-Machine seems to run out of water for steaming pretty quickly, sometimes in the middle of steaming.<br />-You must purchase a separate insert to steam grains. I tried cooking and pureeing oatmeal on the steam & puree setting, and had to add water several times, and the consistency was rough. The instructions do not tell you how to go about cooking grains so I am assuming the insert comes with those instructions.<br /><br />However, I am returning this item because the blades have started to chip, the stainless steel on the lid is starting to rust, and the plastic handle has broken. This is all after only three uses. So, I am unsure if I will be ordering a replacement or if I will be ordering the Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker.

review/summary: POOR customer service
review/text: I purchased this product from Babys R us and was using it for a few months until all of a sudden the steam start button or the blend button wouldn't always consistently worked.  Tried to return to Babys R us with my repceipt.  They wouldn't take it back and said to contact Baby Brezza.  I left an email with customer service in early November and actually got a call back in a day.  She said she would ship out a replacement and I had to ship back the lid.  I still haven't received the replacement as of today (1-10-12).  I left another email last week and haven't heard from anyone.  I will try calling the 888 number tomorrow.  But it doesn't look promising.  If only they'd give me a refund, I can buy the Baeba.

review/summary: Love it, so far.
review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift. Last night I wanted to try it out. So I tried making some carrots.  The steaming portion seemed to work great. It kind of put a lot of water in the carrots, though. Once it came time to process, all it did was make noise. The blades did not spin at all. My husband and I tried taking it apart and putting it back together, but it still would not work. I have contacted the manufacturer today. Hopefully, they will replace it. Overall, it was really disappointing. I really wanted it to work. It's a nice looking little machine. It takes up very little counter space and it has little suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place. I really hope I can get a new machine.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />After calling the manufacturer and leaving a message (I got the voicemail) I was promptly called back. The woman on the phone explained to me how to open the bottom of the machine and reattach the belt (she claimed that it would not void the warranty). According to her, the way Fed Ex was shipping the machines is causing the belt to come off inside. Unlike the other reviews, I found the manufacturer to be quite helpful and very nice.<br /><br />I only have a few issues with it, so far. The blade is difficult to remove after it is done processing. You have to turn it and pull kind of hard at the same time. This is difficult to do after steaming because it gets pretty hot. I also noticed brown liquid leaking out from the bottom of the canister. I am assuming that it is lubricant from the drive shaft. It's not getting into the food, but it is annoying.<br /><br />Other than that, I have no other problems. It's actually a lot of fun to use.

review/summary: Hard to clean and now leaks a brown liquid
review/text: It was great the first couple of times I used it but then over time, I started noticing a brown/black liquid left on the base and driveshaft. At first i thought it was food dripping out and didn't think much of it, then I realized it was coming from the driveshaft and I kept trying to clean it off but more and more comes out every time I use the machine. And now the last time I used the machine, the blade and holder seem to be stained with brown as well. I've been scrubbing and scrubbing those parts as well but it's impossible to clean off. The last batch of green bean I made also ended up getting brown/black liquid leaked in so of course now I'm freaked out as to what the baby has consumed and now am too scared to use this machine at all.

review/summary: Very cheap product, have had to get replacements many times!
review/text: I have never reviewed an item before, but taking the time to review the Baby Brezza because of the unfortunate experiences I have had with this product and to warn people not to spend $100 on such a poorly made product.. I read multiple reviews on the Baby Brezza and read some negative reviews about the blade not working. But I tend to go with positive reviews if they outweigh the negative ones, but from now on, I will definitely reconsider buying anything with negative reviews, and the Baby Brezza purchase has actually discouraged me from buying anything from Amazon that is expensive and can be broken, as you cannot return the product after 30 days.<br /><br />I bought the BB in February 2012 and should have returned it right away after I had some problems from the beginning, but I was too excited to use it so I did not.<br /><br />1. The cover never fit quite right. The manual said that the blade has two positions, up for steaming and down for blending, and obviously up if you are going to steam/blend but it did not seem like the blade had 2 positions and I always had to readjust the cover to make it fit, turning the blade slightly down from the up position so the cover would close and lock.<br /><br />2. I bought the grain basket accesory and it never fit! The cover just would not close, it was much too tall! That should have been the final indication that I had a defective BB but it was so much trouble to return the product to Customer Service and I just played phonetag with them!<br /><br />I was still able to use it for the purposes I wanted, to steam and blend fruits and veggies so I just kept using it for a while til the final third thing happened!<br /><br />3. The whole thing just broke! The driveshaft and blade just popped off one time! Blade just would not turn!<br /><br />Called customer service. Terrible experince except for one rep that was really nice whom I had been playing phonetag with. Before I talked to the rep I really liked, the two I spoke with including the manager were rude and unhelpful. Granted, I called when I was upset and was probably mean myself but I thought customer service people's job is to make the customer happy, which I learned at 14 years old at my first job at a restaurant. They argued with me, displayed frustration even mild anger with their voice as well as impatience when I asked if I can get a full refund. They said I would have to return the product and wait for it to be inspected, and maybe I will get a refund. They also said that I could not get a refund on the grain basket as they do not give refunds for accesories and the first rep even argued with me asking if I had left the blade in when I put in the grain basket, which is impossible to do if you wanted to put in the grain basket at the same time.<br /><br />So I asked to speak with the rep I had been playing phonetag with, and she was really nice, patient, and tried to keep her customer happy. She offered to send a new Baby Brezza without me sending in the broken one, a new grain basket that she said she would make sure it fit, and another free accesory of my choice. The new BB along with the other two products came quickly, few days and so I was a happy customer again!<br /><br />The new one I received is different from the one I originally bought. The blade was a different color, more brown instead of orange, the driveshaft lock at the bottom of the pitcher was configured diffrently, and the blade had 2 definite positions, up and down, the cover fit perfect, and the grain basket fit. But guess what!<br /><br />4. This time the blade was broken. It still works but the top part that twists comes off, which I didnt think was a big deal as it still worked but when I was cleaning it, the bottom with the blade part fell off and almost hit my dog! I checked the old BB i had and the top of the blade did not come off so...<br /><br />I called the nice rep again. She sent me a new pitcher, driveshaft, and blade. She didn't send me any new accessories for my trouble when I asked, but she was still very nice. I did tell her that this new BB is a lot better than my first one and she said the one I have is from a different line, so their product is not even standard!<br /><br />5. Got it the mail today, the top of the blade still came off! I left a message with the nice rep again but this is now ridiculous. My baby is one year old and I donT even use it as much anymore!<br /><br />So hence, why I am writing this review. Save your money and trouble and get a steamer and a handheld blender to make babyfood. Oh, I used the grain basket to make small sized pasta like it suggests, not big size pasta. It came out like paste, all stuck together!  And I made same pasta in a saucepan in 5 mins and it was fine. Grain basket took 25 mins and pasta was one solid, pasty mess when it was done! So just boil pasta in a saucepan.<br /><br />Originally gave  it two stars for the nice rep but changing it to one star. If it was not so cheap and a poorly made product with all the malfunctions, I would have been happy with it. Should have gotten the Beaba fron William and Sonoma, maybe they at least would take back a broken product without me packing it in a box, going to usps, spending money, to get my $100 back! Or they should only charge $40 for the BB, not $100 or have the accesories go with it for free! I guess that is what you may get with products made in China.<br /><br />Addendum: my husband just told me that he noticed there is water leaking in the back when it is on steam mode, when the first one did not do that. It seems like the second BB we have has a new set of problems. When I decided to buy the Brezza earlier this year (2012) there were only a few one star reviews compaining it did not work. I just read the current ones and there are so many one star reviews complaining of the same defects I experienced or different ones that really scare me like oil leaking that I donot want to use this product anymore. I would not have bought it if  I was reading the same reviews back when I decided to buy it. I am goIng to call Amazon to see if they can issue me the refund. It is near impossible to get a live person on the Brezza customer service and they do call back, but it takes a while and it is so incovenient. And with a product like this that you use a lot for only a limited amount of time when baby eats babyfood, it is really a rip off to not just send someone a replacement right away. Planning to call Amazon to see if they can take a look of how many complaints there are of this defective product and not sell this product anymore. It is a disservice to loyal customers of amazon. Makes me want to stick to brick and mortar stores so you don't have the inconvenience and frustration of not getting a refund or a replacement immediately. Maybe for some people, $100 is nothing but for us, $100 was an investment of a product I was planning to use well into my baby's toddler years to sneak in pureed vegetables in their spaghetti sauce like the BB site advertises. Cannot do that with a poorly made product that is only on warranty for a year!

review/summary: Do not buy this!!!
review/text: I never bother to write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after my experience with the Baby Brezza.  Right out of the box, this machine did not work.  I had the same issue with it that other reviewers discussed- it steamed but did not blend.  When I called customer service (they do not answer the phone, though they do call you back),  it took us days to actually connect. She insisted that this isn't a problem with the machine, it is a problem with the way it was handled when it was transported.  (???)  Umm... I'm pretty sure if this machine can't handle being shipped, then something is wrong with it.  I was then given directions to open up the machine and told that once I put the belt back on, it will work perfectly.  I couldn't open it up, but my father is an engineer and he opened it up and said that it appears to be very, very poor quality and he doesn't expect it will last long.  I spent $100 on this!  Please save your money- this machine is not good quality and is over-priced!!

review/summary: Do not waste your money
review/text: I received this item as a gift from my parents.  They asked what I wanted, and this was it.  What a mistake!<br /><br />I was only able to use this device three times before it completely broke.  I was never able to steam AND blend all at once, for various reasons.<br /><br />The first time I used it, sure enough, the blade didn't spin.  Upon reading other user's comments, we unscrewed the bottom (this took some effort to find *just* the right screwdriver, sadly) only to find that the belt was not attached to the gear.  Apparently the Baby Brezza folks know that this is a design flaw, and yet they haven't fixed it.  If your product can't even stand up to the rigors of shipping, imagine how "well" it's going to perform under daily use!<br /><br />Now, I know a little bit about design flaws.  I am a mechanical engineer.  I am so disappointed that mine eventually died for a STUPID reason - after steaming and pureeing (separately, since it was broccoli and I had to add water per the instructions), the blade WOULD NOT come out of the bowl.  We pushed, we pulled, we rotated, we spun it, we knocked it on the counter.  It was stuck, as was my broccoli under the blade.<br /><br />Come to find out, the small pin that provides the up/down motion had DUG ITSELF INTO THE PLASTIC OF THE BLADE MOUNT.  REALLY?!?!?  This was not our doing - this thing was stuck in there from the get-go.<br /><br />Cheap, plastic, not durable, flawed design....there is no good reason to buy this thing.  I use my steamer, my oven, and my small combo food processor/blender and it works great.  Save your money and use the tools you already have.  You'll end up dirtying just as many items anyway.

review/summary: Beware: Leaking Brown Liquid over Time
review/text: I have been using this little machine for just a few months(2-3 months).  I absolutely loved it for a few times in the beginning.  Then, it starts to leak brown liquid that looks like lubricant or oil from the center steel part.  I tried to clean the center vigorously and completely dry it before using it again.  Same leaks happened.  What a waste of $100 for very short usage.  I am calling service center but, I will not be using it again until permanent solution is found.  I am not going to feed oil/lubricant to my 8-months-old baby.  Very UPSET!!!  Going back to old pan and magic bullet method for now.

review/summary: Finally got it fixed.
review/text: Update: Thanks to the wonderful folks at Lowe's they got the stripped screws out of the bottom of the item, and I purchased some new better quality screws to put back in it. Now that my item is fixed, I still will not give this product 5 stars, just because I do not think it is worth its cost.  I think as easy as the belt comes on and off that is something that should be addressed whenever the company goes to make a newer model.<br /><br />Received this off my wishlist for Christmas and was excited to use it, it steamed the veggies just fine, however it would not blend. The blade and its unit inside the baby food maker would not spin. I noticed other people on here have had the same problems. I tried to call the Baby Brezza company at 9:23 am EST since on their website it says their business hours are 9-5 EST. However their automated system would not let me speak to a customer service representative, you have to leave a message. Sorry, I want to talk to some one and NOT wait to be called back at YOUR convenience, but rather MINE. I gave them their chance, so I now have to wait to receive the Amazon invoice in the mail from my mother since she is the one who purchased it here on Amazon for me, and then I will be printing a FREE shipping label and returning with ease through Amazon. I was really looking forward to this baby food maker, however, I think I am going to be going with a different brand. This thing is a piece of crap. IT is so disappointing to try to make your baby food and to have this thing not work; on top of that, their customer service has disappointed me too.

review/summary: Can't Live WIthout It
review/text: I was hesitant about this machine because of the price tag, but I am glad I made the purchase.  I have made every food combination under the sun using various fruits, veggies and meats using this machine. I love that I can set the machine and not think twice about it until it beeps at me letting me know it's done.  As my son got older, I loved how I was able to make chunkier foods; I feared this machine would only make purees.  Currently, I use it to make a chunky ground turkey, brown rice and veggie (broccoli, sweet potato, peas, etc) combination.<br /><br />I have to also add that this company has beyond exceptional customer service.  Reading the reviews about how some people experienced the complete opposite leaves me baffled.  I contacted the company via their Facebook page and had contact with someone in the company within the hour.  The blade was starting to crack from the plastic base and after speaking with customer service, I had a brand new machine at my door step within a week.  The company provided a postage paid envelope to return my broken components, so I was very happy that it didn't cost me anything to return the machine.  I really thought I was going to get the run around or be told that I would have to replace the blade myself, so I was very impressed with the company shipped me a brand new machine.<br /><br />Overall, I've recommended this machine to several friends and all of them have also been very happy with it.

review/summary: diappointed, wish I could send it back
review/text: The problem with this machine is that I would steam items extra extra long and go to work chopping to fine pieces.  The motor is so weak that it smells like burning even when you expect it to do the smallest job. I wish I had never wasted the money.  I didn't think that anything this expensive would have such a bad motor.  Now, I just use the cuisinart that I have had for years.  I'm so angry at myself for wasting money on this thing that it makes my stomach cringe.

review/summary: Excellent customer service!
review/text: UPDATE:  Customer service has been excellent!  They Sent me the container I needed to make the former machine work and an extra bonus for my trouble.  Given the kind of service I have received I would highly recommend their product.  They stand behind it and have made changes to keep the belt on in shipping. It really does save time in making the food and it is dishwasher safe, which was a main reasons we chose this product to begin with.<br /><br />We bought this for our 6 month old son to have homemade food and we thought it would save time from the steam/blender option.  We were excited when it arrived, but dissapointed that it wouold not blend.  A customer service rep suggested taking the screws off the bottom and putting the belt back on.  We could not get the screws off so they put another one in the mail to us as a replacement.  While waiting for that one I continued to try at the screws (afraid I would strip them) and finally was able to get all of them out.  I replaced the belt and it worked like a charm!  The other machine arrived so we sent the other back as requested.  Unfortunately, this one leaks water into the base (where the electrical parts are).  I can't figure out how it gets down there, but I am nervous I will electrocute myself if I try to use it.  Before we realized what it was doing we would run 2 or 3 batches and then it would just die.  The first time we called customer service we left a message and then we had to call multiple times, but eventually spoke with someone.  The very first call we left a message and I have to say that customer service was very diligent about following up with me to work a solution - they left me multiple voicemails asking for a return call.  Little did they know we had already received a replacement and I (terrible I know) did not return their phone calls until the second machine broke.  Unfortunately, now I can't get a call back.  I do love this concept and the convenience when it works, but it seems I have received a lemon for the 2nd machine.  Had I known I would be able to get the screws off the first one and be able to make it work I would have just kept that one.  Grr.  All said - I would recommend this to a friend, but I would hope that baby Brezze takes comments to heart and improves their product...perhaps a thin strip of plastic over the belt to keep it from jarring loose during transport??  I have no suggestions for the leakage...

review/summary: Absolutely The Best!
review/text: I have never made my own baby food being a working mom of 3 I just didn't have the time. Now 8 years later number 4 came along and being older and wiser I decided to give this baby food making a try. With this machine it is easier than making dinner for the other 3. I wish they would all eat baby food! Don't pay attention to the reviews with cleaning issues just take the pieces apart wash with a small brush and warm soapy water and that's it. You are ready for your next batch. A must buy for any new mom or seasoned mom that never made baby food.

review/summary: Great...when it doesn't break! Good Customer service.
review/text: I got this baby food maker off of my baby registry. I wanted to make my baby's food so I knew what was going into his mouth. Well, it worked great the first few times and then the plastic broke off the bottom of the container that holds the metal pin in (holding in the blade.) I was able to rig it so that it still worked anyways. Then, a couple days later while making a batch of prunes, the motor went out! Well, surely this was designed to handle something a little thicker like prunes.<br /><br />So, I called and emailed the baby brezza company. About a week later, they did call me and ended up sending me a brand new machine for no charge to me. But, in the meantime I steamed the food in my steamer and used my food processor. I loved that SO much more because I could do large batches. So, I think I may return the brezza. If you want to make food in tiny batches, this would be great. But, I found that a food processor and steamer are much more efficient for large amounts of food to freeze. So, 3 stars (being generous) for the machine and 5 stars for their customer service if it breaks :)

review/summary: Fast and Functional!
review/text: I was balking at buying a baby food maker since I already had a nice food processor.  But the ability to steam and puree in one simple appliance was too tempting to pass.  My first attempt was sweet potatoes.  I made them two ways - one in the Baby Brezza and the other in the oven followed by a blender.  The Baby Brezza was faster and the food tasted better!  Cleanup is also very simple, which is important for me as I work full-time.  Every weekend I make a new item and freeze cubes.  So simple!<br /><br />I love the item so much, I am buying another one of these for a relative who just had a new baby.

review/summary: Baby Brezza is Awesome!
review/text: Being the natural freak that I am since having my little one I had been debating back and forth on whether to get a baby food maker knowing that I would only be happy if I was able to make my own food and know exactly what was being put in it.  I had heard everybody say "Oh...you don't need one of those fancy things.  All you need is a pot, some steam, and a fork.  That is the way we used to do it."<br />After looking at several brands I decided that the baby brezza looked worth the $100.  Let me say I was totally right.  This thing is awesome.  I spend about an hour or two a week (usually on a Sunday) dicing veggies and fruit, put everything into the baby brezza, push the button, and voila! Baby food complete.  I just pour it out of the canister into freezer safe containers and store it frozen for the whole week or two. It is a breeze to clean, does an awesome job making a smooth puree, and saves me tons of money by not having to buy organic baby food.<br />I would definettly recommend this product to anyone thinking of making their own baby food.  It makes our jobs as mom's a breeze!

review/summary: Really poorly made.
review/text: My Baby Brezza journey is so disheatening that I have to share. I did extensive research into baby food maker and as most of you who are reading this, I narrowed it down to the Brezza and the Beaba. Brezza won me over with the one button touch and step away function. So....<br /><br />November 2011: Bought Baby Brezza on cyber monday sale (was around 100 bucks), arrived 2 weeks later -- dead on arrival. Plugged it in, no light, no function, nothing. Thankfully, my baby wasn't quite eating yet. Called Baby Brezza/emailed, a few days later a new machine came out to me.<br />Jan - March 2012: Brezza #2 working well, around the end of March, started seeing a black oiling residue. I'm a pretty chill mom, so just wiped it off and soldiered on.<br />April 2012: Brezza #2 stopped working, steams fine, but will NOT blend, can hear the motor, but no action. Called Customer service, again a few days to connect up. The agent said there was an old batch of shafts that have caused problems, will send new shaft -- a few weeks later a new Brezza showed up.<br />May 2012: On to Brezza #3, plugged it, made applesauce, take extra care regarding the shaft (purported to be new and awesome). Brezza #3 stopped working 10 hours after arrival (2 batches of baby food). Called customer service, no answer, called again, left a VM, called again, spoke to a very apologetic lady who states she will send out another new shaft and as compensation for all the inconvenience an accessory of my choice. Per her, it should arrive within 4-5 days.<br />June 2012: still waiting, almost 14 days later, placed another call to customer service.<br /><br />So my advice.<br /><br />1. didn't save money (need to have jarred baby food on hand in case your Brezza busts)<br />2. went through 3 units in 5 months<br />3. Spent A LOT of time tracking down Baby Brezza customer service.<br />4. Have a lot of spare Brezza parts in my house.<br /><br />If you were thinking about buying, consider getting it at the big box store so when it busts you can just return it and get your money back and lessen the anger and frustration at this product.<br /><br />Cheers, hope it helps. Thankfully, as we rarely had a working baby food machine, my daughter quickly graduated to mushed up food and small bites and grew out of the baby food phase... still such a bummer, what a poor made product.

review/summary: Don't Buy This, Even If You Really Want to Ignore the Bad Reviews
review/text: I really wanted this to work so I sided with the 60 some-odd positive reviews as opposed to the 30-ish nays & purchased this when my daughter turned six months. Well, two months to the day I started using the BB (today she is eight months), the blender function stopped working. It will still steam, but not blend. Also, day one some of the plastic curved pieces on the bottom of the container broke off (but it still functioned), and the unit has been leaking the brown/black fluid for a while. I just disregarded these issues because I really wanted it to work. Romanticizing the all-in-one factor and all....<br /><br />I of course recycled all the packaging so I don't know if Amazon will take it back. Sounds like BB customer service is a waste of time too. AND I even took the unit apart this morning and the belt is turning just fine...<br /><br />So, all I can do is warn other parents - do not buy this machine! It's not worth the trouble for the few weeks of service it provides. I really don't understand why it's so difficult to make a quality product when you're charging this much for it.

review/summary: Please Read Poor Reviews and Use Caution with This Machine
review/text: I purchased the Baby Brezza at the end of October, 2011. I immediately fell in love with the machine for its simplicity and ease of use. However, about two weeks later, the blade on the machine started to rust. I hand wash my machine 90% of the time with organic soap - this was alarming and made me question the quality. Shortly after that, the blade began getting stuck in the machine. There are instructions in the manual that tell you what to do if this happens. It worked but I had to do it every time I used the machine. I was constantly splattering food everywhere. Next, I had the black oil leaking from the drive shaft. I removed the drive shaft with every wash and never put it in the dishwasher. I cleaned it up and hoped it wouldn't happen again. Following this, the blade became completely lodged in the machine and unremovable. I did receive a quick call back from customer service and when they asked for the lot number, I lifted up the machine to realize the entire bottom had melted. The plastic was all disformed. The last batch of applesauce I made had the black oil IN IT. The company offered me a new machine but I am refusing. I do not want anything from this maker. I see that it has happened to other parents and it is absolutely inexcusable that a foreign black substance is being leeched into our baby's foods!!! This is the whole point of making homemade food - so that you know everything in it. I nearly cried when I discovered the black substance. Yes, it's easy and yes it's a great idea. But please, please just steam your baby's food and process it with something reliable and without a strange substance in it!<br /><br />*Just to add: Contrary to other reviews, I had an excellent experience with Baby Brezza's customer service. I spoke with two different women who were helpful and seemed truly interested in solving the problem. I may have gotten a rare defect in my machine and I don't want to bash the brand but am very concerned with my experience. I believe that the company will do something about the problems that their customers are experiencing and I hope for future parents that they're able to have a successful machine.<br /><br />*Also: I've used a Beaba and found that the Brezza was a much better machine in terms of proper steaming of food. My experience with the Beaba was that the food almost always came out undercooked when steamed according to the times in the manual. I don't recommend that machine either. Additionally, I've used a Magic bullet for a few years and have never had a perfect blend. I always have to take the cover off and move the food around in order for it all to blend. I am not sure that any of these baby gadgets work but will say that if I didn't have the defective brezza, it would be far superior to a beaba or baby bullet.

review/summary: doesn't blend or work well
review/text: I got the baby brezza about 6 months ago, when it was time to start introducing solids to my baby boy. Back then all the reviews were 5 star, so I was super excited to get this item and thought it was worth the higher price. Well, it's not. The main reason why I got this item was so that I could make vegetable and meat purees in one steamer/blender. In the product review it stated that the machine can be used for meat and fish. It can't. In the operating manual it says that you can only used ground meat, which I didn't like. I thought that maybe I can cook the meat separately and then put it in the brezza to blend with the veggies. Well, it couldn't do it either. It couldn't handle blending even very soft turkey breast and would quit after several seconds. Having to stand there and hold the button down was also very annoying. I was extremely disappointed with the brezza and wanted to return it, but the seller I got it from wouldn't accept returns once you open the box. Anyway, now I use the brezza only to steam the vegetables. I cook the meats separately and then finish it all in a blender. After 6 months it can't blend even soft vegetables, by the way. So basically I paid a $100 for a vegetable steamer, which you can do in a simple pot.

review/summary: Only sort of works :(
review/text: I was so excited to start making baby food...I diced my sweet potatoes into little bitty cubes, set up the Brezza, and everything appeared to be going fine...until I realized the blades weren't actually moving!  It steamed perfectly, but when it came time to blend, the Brezza made lots of noise but the blades didn't do anything!  So I had to whip out my old (non-BPA free!) food processor to finish making baby's food.  I was pretty annoyed...  Apparently I have a defective model; I have since contacted Brezza customer service, and I'm expecting a replacement unit shortly.  They also notified me that this unit is an older model, and they have since made improvements, so the replacement will be the newest model.  I'll update my review when I receive the new Brezza.

review/text: I was excited to get started on making my homemade baby food. They did not have anything like this when I had my other children. I splurged because I felt that this would save me time. I had it all ready to go food in the blender and then nothing! The blue lights lit up and then nothing! Followed the instructions step by step thinking I may have put the lid and bucket on wrong and still nothing. I called the customer support line and they are sending me out a new product plus something extra for my inconvience. It does have a year warranty on it so I will give the second one another try and hope it last longer than one use!<br /><br />Update:9/27/2011-I continue to wait for my replacement from the company and have called multiple times and left several messages to find if they have shipped me another baby brezza and they will not return my phone calls or pick up the phone. I would be weary about purchasing this item since it looks like they don't stand behind their product!!! I am returning it through amazon today!!!

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: I, like many first time moms I assume, thought I needed every cool baby-specific gadget available so I was really excited to get my Baby Brezza and really enjoyed using it at first.  Making baby food with the Brezza is just as simple as they say, it is nice to just turn the machine on and let it go to work.  After a month of making my son's food though, it broke.  Mind you, I was making larger batches, so it broke on only the second day I actually used it.  After the Brezza broke, I learned a lot.<br /><br />My advice it use the tools you already have in your kitchen and you'll be much happier.  The ease of the Baby Brezza was great, but if you're making large batches of food you'll end up spending your entire day on it because you can only cook a small amount of food at a time with it.  Instead, set up a large stock pot with a few cups of water, boil the water and set your veggies/fruits in a colander above the water (resting on the rim of the stock pot), and cover the colander.  Let the food steam for a few minutes until tender, then pour it into a blender or food processor.  This way you can cook large amounts of food and quickly move through everything you need to steam.  This solution is MUCH cheaper and MUCH more efficient (and surprisingly less cleanup).

review/summary: Worked OK the first time I used it...
review/text: I got this product as a gift at my baby shower and I was thrilled.  The first time I used it, it worked pretty well.  The carrots, peas, and green beans didn't puree as fine as I would like and my baby gagged on them, I even doubled the cooking time just to be sure they were soft enough to blend!  The second time I used it, when it came time to blend the food I heard a horribly loud sound and didn't blend at all.  After I got the thing detached and turned it over I realized that there was a crack in the plastic where it attaches to the motor on the base.  The motor was working, but it couldn't grab onto the plastic part because of the crack and it just stripped it.  Until I find out if I can get a new plastic piece I will be using the Baby Brezza as an overpriced steamer and using my Ninja blender to blend the food.  Oh, I also took all the carrots, peas, and green beans out of the freezer and re-blended them with the Ninja drink attachment and all of the chunks were gone and I had smooth creamy baby food.

review/summary: Poor blending
review/text: The blender functioned poorly from the very beginning of usage. After the steaming is done, the food just sit on top of the blending blade without much movement. I have to shake it or stir it before I got the appropriate consistency. After just two to three months of weekly usage, the blender died on me after creating some black smoke and a bad plastic smell. Interestingly, the steamer is still working. But why do I need a $100 mini steamer and mash things up manually afterwards? I'd not recommend this product.

review/summary: Never got to use it
review/text: I received this product for Christmas and I finally got a chance to try it out last night. I had the avocado and banana in there (softest food around, right?) and the blades wouldn't even spin. The white hexagon in the base is supposed to insert into the drive shaft to make the blades spin. It was this hexagon that wasn't turning, so I know it wasn't that I didn't have the blade in there right or anything.<br /><br />What peeved me the most was that the machine won't even turn on unless you have food in the container, so there's no way to try it out before making a big-a** mess. I realize that's probably a safety feature, but I can't tell you how irritating it was to have to take all the food out and clean the stupid thing when it didn't even work, and also I cut my finger on the blade when trying to do so (so at least those are sharp). I ended up mashing up the food by hand with the bottom of a drinking glass, mortar-and-pestal style, at 11:00 at night so my baby would have food to take to daycare this morning..<br /><br />The Brezza has a one year warranty, but after reading some bad reviews about the customer service at Baby Brezza I decided to just return it. At least Amazon customer service is awesome...I didn't have an order number or anything since it was gift, but I chatted with a live rep and they sent me a prepaid return label and I'm getting a gift card for the full purchase amount.

review/summary: Broke after a Month
review/text: well, I'm constantly reading reviews on products I'm about to purchase.  The baby Brezza got mixed reviews.  I was really sold on the set it and forget it option.  Well, I never used it because I would make more food than recipes called for.  My LO is now 6 months old but the size of a 10 month old - very tall and lean like daddy.  He eats like a piglet.  Needless to say, I was cooking a lot of food.  I was making applesauce the other day.  Blended to smooth, went to add banana and it never blended again.  It would steam, but not blend.  Many people said that it would stop working, so I had my mother buy it at BRUS in case we had to return it.  Thank goodness she did!  Back to my old school steam and food processor...at least I can make bigger batches instead of small dinky batches.

review/summary: Metallic smell on food
review/text: I absolutely loved this product at first.  I had one of the first models and it worked wonderfully until one day it simply wouldn't turn on.  I called the company and they sent me a new model.  The steam chamber of the new model smells horrible, I can't quite pinpoint the smell but it is somewhere between metallic and burnt plastic.  All the food I've steamed also has this metallic taste to it.  I've done the cleaning with distilled vinegar and distilled water twice already but the food still tastes metallic.  This freaks me out because I have no idea what is being deposited on the food. Obviously I won't be giving any steamed food to my baby. I've called customer service again and I'm waiting for a call back.

review/summary: Really trying to be happy
review/text: I've had this product for 3 weeks and have used it a total of 3 times. I'm really trying to get passed all of the kinks.  Of course, most of the poor reviews are after I purchased the Baby Brezza.  I, as some, was lured into the "one step process".  I have 3 kids and thought this would be simple to use. I have difficulty placing the blade into the container.  The instructions say don't force the blade in, but that's the only way to get it in.  I'm just hoping each time I don't push too hard and break it.  I'm finding with each use the driveshaft is becoming more difficult to pull out. Setting all of those aside the machine (in my opinion) works great! I've had no problems with puree or steam.  It works beautifully!!!  It does leave too much water in the chamber, but I just pour the excess after I'm finished.  If I can get these problems resolved it will be a nice machine.  From reading the other reviews it seems the problems will only get worse. I'm hoping I didn't buy a lemon.

review/summary: Loved it at first but DO NOT BUY - Leaks oil into food
review/text: I was using this baby food maker for 2 months and I loved it. It was so easy to steam the food and then puree it in one machine. I used it almost every day and raved about it to friends. However, last week I noticed a small amount of black smudge on the drive shaft when I went to clean it. I really didn't think anything of it or I thought that it was from the banana I pureed because it had a bruise. Today I made a large batch of food and when I was done and went to clean the machine the entire drive shaft was coated with the black liquid. I now know that the black stuff is lubricating oil. Needless to say dumped the batch of food. I am so upset because I don't know if the oil got into any of my baby's past food. I had ordered it from One Step Ahead and they are giving me a full refund plus an extra $25 for my troubles. They tried to act like this was the first they've heard of this problem but I don't buy it. At least 15 other people on Amazon have complained of the same thing. Ugh. Don't take a chance on this one!

review/summary: DONT BUY  -  READ ME
review/text: CONS:Weird smells, Blender blade will not engage and a slappin' crap warranty.<br /><br />$10 to pay for shipping and for Baby Brezza Enter/Crap-prises to look at it.  There are postings that say you can fix the blade issue by disassembling the Baby Brezza , but who would want to do that and risk completely voiding out any warranty AND IT WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN.. EVER. EVEVEVEVEVR. RRRRRR. I digress, the fact that I experienced such lack of quality, with the Brezza,straight from the box makes this product a piece of dog pooo... poop from China.<br /><br />PROS: It was a gift. :P

review/summary: Poorly made and bad quality control
review/text: The two problems other users have complained about are the same ones I experienced, which shows that this product is badly made and should be recalled.<br />Two weeks into using this product the base of the plastic cup where the drive shaft is inserted broke into pieces. I returned the product and they sent me a new one. The new one had the other problems, it would steam but when it was time for it to blend, it'd just make a really loud noise and the blades would not move at all. The drive shaft is so tight that I find it impossible to take out of the cup and was afraid to force it in case it broke again.<br />I would NOT RECOMMEND this product at all. It's very poorly made and I wish I had read the bad reviews before I got it.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I received this babyfood maker as a baby shower gift and I was so excited to use it! I have used it for about two weeks and everything seemed fine. It pretty much did the job, except for you can only do a small amount at one time so it can take all day to make a week's worth of food. It is hard to clean also. It retains the color of whatever you are making even if you wash it right away. I was willing to deal with this, but I thought there had to be a better way. After using it and washing it today, I noticed about 4 hairline fractures on the inside of the gray plastic. I can't use it now. I plan on returning it and using a regular steamer and food processer. NOT worth the hundred dollars!!! Please save your money. This thing is not worth it.

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in my baby brezza. It was extremely promising at first, however, after 2 uses, we figured out that it takes us a while to start the machine. The button just wouldn't "click". Then, after 2 months after using it, the drive shaft broke. First, we were worried but then figured we could still use it without the drive shaft being locked into place. After 2 weeks of our drive shaft being broken, now our blade broke- the plastic part. Now, we can just steam and not blend. This whole equipment was also brought brand new. We were really excited about this, and used it daily but definitely WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone else. I wish the machine was built better!

review/summary: does not operate properly
review/text: i just got the Brezza today and tried to prepare some food. It steamed food nicely but did not blend properly. after reading instruction i realized that blades do not fall down for blend cycle as it suppose (based on the instruction). the maker definitely goes back.<br />Since all reviews are so great, i think my product is defective. i will try to order a replacement, see if it is going to work.

review/summary: A real bummer
review/text: I am so disappointed in this product. It broke the fourth time I used it and the warranty still requires me to pay $10 to have it fixed or replaced (which especially stinks given that this was a gift). It purees food okay, but not as finely as my food processor, and I think that is really sad considering it's the primary job of this machine. Also, it leaves too much liquid in the chamber after steaming, and made my puree too thin.  I had to start draining water before pureeing my food, which is a pain.<br /><br />And to add insult to injury, the metallic chamber where the water reserve lives, it somehow affected the taste of the water and made my fruits taste metallic. The steamer feature would be nice if it didn't make the food taste funny.  No sense in making organic baby food yourself if your child won't eat it due to the aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm so bummed as I had high hopes for this machine.  I recommend you get a food processor instead- it will work better for baby foods, and you'll get more mileage out of it.

review/summary: Hard time getting it to work!!
review/text: When I first bought this item I loved it. But after having it for a few months the biggest problem I have is starting the darn thing! I'll select my steam time I need and when I press start it beeps at me. In problem shooting it says if it beeps 6x then its not locked in but it beeps more then 6x. Plus it doesn't even puree most stuff like green beans, carrorts, and apple sauce, are some of the top ones I can think of.

review/summary: No!
review/text: I bought this about 5 months back..<br />Cons:<br /><br />If the food is not exactly small enough,it wont get soft and the puree will be grainy.Sometimes chunks get stuck and it just wont get pureed.<br />Have to stand there and blend it.No timer for blend button.<br />Within this short period the lip of the jar broke a bit and now steam is escaping through there and so I have to put something really heavy on top to keep it stay put.Plus the jar is stained so much that its a light brown shade.Both of this shows the material is super cheap.There was no way to even contact the manufacturers through amazon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Can steam food and not have the mess to transfer to another blender.Well,thats just a tiny inconvenience compared to the cons.<br /><br />Returning this!
