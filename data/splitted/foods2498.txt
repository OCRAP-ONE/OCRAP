review/summary: Not a seaweed snack!
review/text: This product is for making sushi- not for munching on it as a snack. I meant to buy those little seaweed salted toasted things I see people eating. This is good for rolling your own sushi or doing whatever else one does with sheets of seaweed. I tried to eat it plain but its just not that good- I put it in the oven and sprinkled it with some salt that seemed to help- otherwise I have no idea what I am going to do with 10 packets of seaweed sheets.

review/summary: Reasonably Good Mix
review/text: This mix consists of the dry ingredients for devils food cake and basic butter cream frosting.  You need to supply 1/2 cup + 1/2 tbsp of milk, an egg, 3/4 stick of butter, and 3 tbsp of vegetable oil.  The cake is authentic.  However, the frosting would be authentic if it contained marshmallow and vanilla in addition to the butter cream.  Hence the 4-star rating.

review/summary: Warning: wheat gluten
review/text: These are not boxes of 16 taco shells; instead, each box contains 8 taco shells and 8 flour tortillas, in a combined hard-and-soft taco package. As this purchase was made for a person who can't have gluten, half of the product was useless. Ortega should have provided a product description and photo. Amazon, in turn, would be doing buyers a service by refusing to sell products that lack descriptions or photos. I, of course, should have purchased a brand that had a description, but I mistakenly thought that Ortega's taco shells were a standardized item that would not vary.

review/summary: An Earl Grey Tea for Earl Grey Tea Lovers!
review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by "the all natural flavor of bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Best Earl Grey tea!
review/text: Within seconds of immersing St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea bag into steaming water, the enticing, aromatic blend of Ceylon tea and the all natural flavor of bergamot, a citrus fruit, wafts gently above your tea cup.  The uniquely pleasing taste of St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea could be due to its 100% certified organic status - no chemicals or preservatives to interfere with its taste.  Each tea bag is hermetically sealed in a foil-wrapped container which retains its flavor until tea time.<br /><br />From St. Dalfour's site:<br />"Does it taste great and is it as healthful and nutritious as possible? These are the principles which are at the core of each line of St. Dalfour products. A simple philosophy. For simply fantastic food. The quality of our products depends on each ingredient, so we travel wherever necessary to source the finest raw materials.

review/summary: I had to have it with jelly
review/text: I was very satisfied with another product by New Hope Mills called sugar free pancake mix, so I wanted to try a different product this time. Without being aware of the orange/cranberry muffin mix receiving better reviews, I went ahead and purchased this blueberry muffin mix instead.<br /><br />The sugar free part indeed holds its promise. I tested my blood glucose one hour after eating a blueberry muffin, it did not raise my BG much at all. The taste part is somewhat weird. It has a strange after-taste that I don't know how to describe. I had my 2nd muffin with little fruit jelly to cover up the after taste, but then it kinda lost the point of having low carb desserts!! Perhaps I will add splenda and use butter next time when I bake the rest mix.

review/summary: Muffins are back in my life!!!
review/text: Ok so I ordered this product from one of the low carb websites(forget which one) and was skeptical since I had tried a 'low carb' blueberry mix one time before and it was wretched. It was like eating a blueberry-flavored shoe..blech! I looked around online before making these to see if anyone was recommending making it differently than the box suggested. I found that some people were saying to add some packets of splenda to the mix and use butter instead of oil(previous reviewer...that must be the key!)..so I did just that and baked them at the minimum time(17 min). YOWZA!! These are delicious!! I had 3(don't judge me...I could've eaten 6!lol)..the first 2 by themselves. They're so fluffy and moist that you don't need to add anything. That being said, with the 3rd one, I decided to mix things up a bit and add some of my sugar-free strawberry preserves(smucker's brand) and it just took it to a whole new level of awesome. I am so impressed with this stuff! Apparently, I also need to try the cranberry orange ones too because I've read really good reviews about them! I think my only complaint with the blueberry muffins is that I wish there were a bit more blueberries. And if that's the only complaint about low-carb blueberry muffins...then all is right with the world. ;)

review/text: I got this mix after being on low-carb diet for a few months. I baked bread and it came out very nice looking and tasting. I was happy that now I could have a slice of this bread with my morning coffee. But could not enjoy it enough as my kids liked it so much they just eat it all. We always have a supply of cookies and sweets at home but they preferred my low-carb blueberry bread.

review/text: I am a fan of strong coffee and I really enjoyed Emeril's Big Easy k-cups, but this version has a pretty bitter aftertaste.  I'm guessing it's because it's decaf, as I'm having trouble finding a good decaf k-cup.  So I guess for a decaf it's okay if you like strong Starbucks-like coffee, but I'm going to keep trying to find one that's not so bitter before buying this again.

review/summary: Full bodied but a little bitter
review/text: I really like full-bodied coffee -- I learned to love european years ago and no long enjoy the weaker/lighter American style roasts. Now I have to cut down on my caffeine, and I have a much more limited choice than before.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf, I was excited to find out how good it would be for my new Keurig. I find it marginally more tasty than Timothy's similar style decaf (which is slightly bitter), but it also has a bitterness that I just do not enjoy. Strong and/or full-bodied coffee does not have to be bitter. I bought the Keurig filter so I could brew my own choice of coffee (without K-Cups). No K-Cup I have tried so far compares with Peet's decaf using the filter -- but the filter is just not convenient, and convenience is the reason why I bought the Keurig.<br /><br />I have finally settled on Green Mountain Donut Shop Decaf for my K-Cup of choice. It may not be quite as full-bodied as the Emeril's (it's actually pretty close), but it definitely does not have the bitterness.

review/summary: Didn't find it all that jazzy.
review/text: I have to admit that when I first tried this one I wasn't crazy about it.  It seemed lacking in flavor and richness to me compared to Green Mountain French Roast decaff, which is my favorite.  I have had several cups of it now and am figuring out how to brew it for my taste.  I brew it on the 10 ounce size cup and then add a little cream and sugar and it's perfect.  Not terribly complex in structure, but not bad, just a different, lighter variety.  I have tried brewing it on the smaller cup serving, and it didn't seem to make a difference in taste or fullness so I think I will just keep this one for what it is....a reliable, lighter variety for days when I feel like it.  Worth keeping.

review/text: I'm incredibly picky about my coffee and have been making my own lattes and cappuccino's for years.  When I had to give up caffeine temporarily, I was thrilled to find this decaf - one that isn't lacking in body or flavor (no winey, raisiny, watery coffee for me, please).  Now that I'm consuming caffeine again...this decaf has stayed on auto-deliver.  It's THAT good.  And for the record, I've tried all of the top rated decaf K-cups here and this one has beat them hands down (even the Dark Magic, which I had high expectations of!).

review/text: Bought this because I like strong full bodied coffee.  Flavor is great and a bit more body that Timothy's Columbia Decaf.  Problem I have is that when I brew this Emeril K-cup I only ever get a partial cup and it brews extremely slow.  I can then pop in a Timothy's or Coffee People's Organic bold and I get full cups which brew at regular strength.  The partial cup and dribble brewing ONLY happens with the Emeril.  Not sure why.  I thought maybe they used a different density filter or something to have it brewing slower to get more brew time.  However, after many attempts with same result I don't that that's it.  Perhaps a defective lot of K-cups.  The brewer has been descaled recently so that's not the problem either.

review/text: We really like our Keurig Brewer but recently we've encountered an intermittent problem of generating enough hot water through the K-Cup to get a decent cup of coffee.  We discovered that the brewer worked correctly, but for some reason, about half the Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf K-Cups did not let the water through. Something in the module was blocking free-flow of hot water.  The result was a K-Cup full of water and coffee grounds on the Keurig Brewer. When it works--and lately it's been a crap shoot--the coffee would rate five stars; but, given the frustration of getting a good cup each time, I rate it at three stars.

Our family is impressed!

review/summary: Best DECAF Period
review/text: Tried various Decaf Brands of Ground Coffee, or Instant coffee, or K-Cups, etc. over the years, but this Jazzed Up Decaf by Emeril tastes so good! You can't tell it's Decaf in my opinion. I'm now able to cut some of my caffeine consumption without "suffering". Thanks Emeril and to discovering it on Amazon.

I served this to guests over the holidays who could not stop raving about how delicious this decaf coffee is.  If you close your eyes you'd never except a decaf brew to be so bold.  There's no bitter after taste at the end in this one smooth all the way to the finish.  Sign up for subscription you won't be sorry!

review/summary: Excellent for decaf
review/text: Emeril's K-cups, Jazzed Up Decaf and Timothy's Decaf Rainforest Espresso Extra-Bold show that great coffee can be made from decaf K-Cups.  Both are rich and full bodied with ample taste and aroma.  I'm not sure which I like better at this point but you can't go wrong with either if you drink decaf.  Actually, it would be difficult to to know you are drinking decaf unless you looked at the K-Cup.  Moreover, there is no buzz with this decaf, unlike some other decaf coffees which still have a lot of caffeine.

review/text: I wasn't really a coffee drinker until I got the Keurig.  I don't like the coffee that sits in the pot a while.  I am sensitive to caffeine so there is enough of the stuff in decaf to get me going.  I tried all the samples that came with the machine and they were good.  I have been getting the variety packs of decaf just because I like having a choice.  They were out of the variety packs when I went to order more and I thought I would try the Jazzed Up Decaf.  Man, am I glad.  I am hooked.  It is rich and full bodied and I love it.  I am leaving the 5 or 6 K-cups of the variety packs I had left for anyone who drops by.  Like I said they are good but this stuff is great.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Nothing like Big Easy Bold
review/text: Apparently alot of folks like this product, but I have to say... its terrible.  I tend to drink dark roasts, and have been on a search for a good decaf Kcup for a while now.  I have to admit I have found very few decafs that are drinkable (coffee people's decaf French Roast is pretty good, and Timothy's decaf espresso is drinkable).  Since I thought Emeril's Big Easy bold was surprisingly decent, I thought this would be a decaf version- but its not even close.  Maybe its me, but I've sampled a half dozen decaf dark roasts, and this one is the worst of the bunch.  During brewing it starts off dark, but quickly becomes watery, lacking body.  The resulting drink tastes to me like someone ran the water trough the coffee twice, and I'm drinking the second cup.

review/text: We've had a Keurig Coffee maker in our office for a couple of years now and I've enjoyed it immensely. I've probably tried every offering that has been available in the office, including regular caffeinated coffees. By far the most flavorful is Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf. While I do tend to favor decaf, this one stands out to me among them all. One of the favorites in the office is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso which is good in it's own right, however, after we ran out of Emeril's I was forced to brew myself a cup of Rainforest and was left disappointed in the taste department. Other reviewers may call the taste burnt, but to my palate it is robust, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable coffee.

That's rather like coke without cocaine. Or tobacco without nicotine. Or the Democratic Party without Bill Clinton.<br /><br />It lacks the active substance.

review/summary: Tried most - this is best
review/text: Well, we got a Keurig machine last year.  Almost all of the coffee samples that came with it were too watered down tasting for my wife and me.  So we started to experiment.  I'd say we have tried about 85-90% of the available decaf offerings.  This Jazzed Up version has been, by far, the best yet.  It has even allowed me to appreciate the Keurig again. My wife - not a decaf drinker - has even switched to this.  She's a bit particular and likes the store bought, caffeinated Sumatra coffee. I was going to try the extra bold Rainforest Espresso next, based on the reviews here.  I was about to order the Rainforest product but the rich, bold coffee taste of Emeril's Jazzed Up convinced me to go with it again.  Now my wife can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about it affecting her sleep.  I'll get the Rainforest Espresso next time and add a comparison here.  The Espresso will have to be very good to get us away from this one though. I do hear that the two are comparable - we'll see.  You can use the larger setting on the machine and fill a mug without sacrificing taste.  It's just a great cup of coffee, even for decaf.  I'm off to have another.<br />___________________<br /><br />I did purchase, and have tried the Rainforest Espresso since the above post.  I'm sticking with Emeril's Jazzed Up decaf coffee for my k-cup selection.  While still a good cup of coffee, the Espresso lacks the smoothness I feel we get from the Jazzed up coffee.  I'm not sorry I had two boxes of the Espresso as this was a very acceptable alternative to Emeril's product, but I don't believe I'll be ordering it again.  IMHO, the Rainforest Espresso is just a small notch, or two, below the Jazzed Up coffee for the smooth and robust flavor of Emeril's Jazzed Up k cup coffee.

review/text: This is a decaf for people who like a "real" cup of coffee.  It is strong and full of coffee flavor.  Most decafs we've tried are kind of weak.  I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes I do get an odd aftertaste that I associate with decafs.  I don't taste it every time, so I wonder if it's because the K-cups get old?  We don't go through the decafs as fast as the regular.<br /><br />For those of you that know New Orleans coffee (with chicory), this is different.  No chicory, just good coffee.

If you can't live without the Charbucks burnt style of flavor, you might try the 5.25 oz setting.  If you like  amilder cup, use the 11.25 oz setting.  This is now what I drink after I have had enough caffeine for the day.

review/text: This has to be the best decaf I've ever brewed at home.<br />I was a little scared of the darkness of the roast, but the flavor is incredible.<br />Absolutely not bitter at all and full of flavor without tasting burnt or harsh.<br />Being VERY caffeine sensitive, I was concerned about the name being "Jazzed Up" decaf as sometimes names like that mean half-caff, but I had no reaction at all, even after multiple cups.<br />I enjoy this coffee very much, and I will have this in stock at home as long as I own a Keurig.

review/text: The product arrived quickly, the only thing is that I ordered 50 cups and once I tasted it I realized that the Emeril brand, although decaffinated, was too strong for my taste.

review/summary: Decaf?  You Wouldn't know!
review/text: Bamm!  This decaf is a winner.  You could serve it to anyone who swears they can tell the difference between regular and decaf, and they would not guess.  However, you must love bold coffee.  This is not for coffee whimps.  I did not find it bitter or burned-tasting, as I have read in other reviews.  Brew the smallest Keurig size, top it with foamed milk or cream, and sprinkle with cocoa or cinnamon, and you have a fab cappucino.  (Buy one of those great little milk foamer wands at Amazon!)

review/summary: Good, but not bold
review/text: I have this product on auto delivery.  I've been getting it for about a year now.  The last shipments must have been defective because they are not as bold as when I first started getting them.  I have been reducing the brew cup size as to get the bold taste.  Disappointing.  Maybe the next shipment will get back on track or I'll need to find a different decaf.

review/summary: Strong enough for 12oz + cups
review/text: I need to drink decaf in the morning and use a larger travel mug for my early cups of coffee.  While regular decafs dilute on the Keurig 12oz setting, I find the Emeril's decaf stays strong.  While I am concerned about the recent jump in K-Cup prices and Green Mountain's new monopoly, I can't take that out on the review of the taste of this product.

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: I've found my decaf!<br />I'm one of those freaks that can have sensitivity to coffee sometimes. Which is a shame, love the stuff. It's safer for me to do decaf, but sometimes even that can be a problem for pathetic ol' me.<br />But I've found the decaf that makes me happy when I do drink it and this is it. The flavor is potent and smokey but not acidic. I think this is a difficult balance to strike but here it is. I especially like sweetening it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVK9CI">Madhava Pure Organic Agave Nectar, Vanilla Flavor, 11.75-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a>. This time of year I enjoy it iced, using reusable ice cubes like these<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C54DVO">White Ice (TM) Reusable Ice Cubes for your Drinks</a> so that it doesn't water my coffee down (by the way, reusable ice cubes are fantastic in the summer to keep very chilled the things you won't put ice cubes in like beer or milk).<br />Hopefully my husband will consume the other decaf k-cups we have left, because I'm not drinking anything but the Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf from here on in.

Yes you can believe all the good reviews about this coffee. I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have a decent cup of coffee again. Ty Emeril and TY Amazon for such a great price. With subscribe and save it's less that 20 bucks for 50. With free shipping. Hello? I have been to Starbucks hundreds of times and I have to disagree with a previous poster..this does not taste like Starbucks. Yes it is a dark coffee but smooth as can be and no aftertaste. You are going to love it!

review/summary: Very good coffee...lower caffeine, but probably not no caffeine.
review/text: I typically only like to drink Timothy's and Emeril's coffees.  I like coffee strong, without bitter aftertaste.  For a decaf, this is great coffee.  It's not as bold as Timothy's Midnight Magic or Rainforest Espresso (my 2 favorite caffeinated coffees), but for an afternoon or evening coffee that won't keep you up all night, its great.  Only downside is that I think it has more caffeine than other weak decaf coffees.  I like it, but it does affect sleep.  On a positive, if you have it in the afternoon/evening, it might give a LITTLE bit of a much needed pick-up, without getting you overcaffienated as can happen if you have too much regular coffee!

review/text: EMERIL'S JAZZED UP DECAF K-CUPS make for a bold, smooth, delicious-tasting cup of dark-roasted coffee without, as other reviewers have noted, a trace of bitterness.  I drink a fully-caffeinated cup of coffee in the morning which provides all the caffeine I want.  If I want more coffee, I follow the first cup with this decaf, and I can't tell the difference.  It's just another great cup of coffee.  Delicious!<br /><br />If you limit your caffeine intake and enjoy a full-bodied dark roast, don't hesitate to try this one.
