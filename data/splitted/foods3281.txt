review/summary: Twinings Peach Tea
review/text: I discovered this tea while on vacation in Punta Cana but could not find it anywhere in Canada so I was happy to find that I could purchase it online on Amazon.  Shipping was not the fastest but considering it came from Asia, it was acceptable.  The vendor also emailed me letting me know that they had shipped the tea.  As a bonus, the tea came with a cute litte gift (a bear on a key chain and a chocolate).  If I run out, I will certainly purchase from this vendor again.

review/summary: Very dissapointed with the quality of these seeds.
review/text: I have been a consumer of NOW foods goods for at least 20 years and have generally been very satisfied with their products (mostly vitamins or supplements). In fact, I had a previous good experience with this product--raw pumpkin seeds--(received as a gift a couple of years ago) and so I thought that what I was ordering would be very close to the product I had previously experienced: a package of well-proportioned, well-colored (dark green), good-tasting raw pumpkin seeds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I received could hardly have been any different:the packages I received (I ordered 8 in total: 2 x Pack of 4)contained many small and broken seeds, and the seeds were pale and as much yellow as green. Worst of all, but unsurprising given their appearance, they do not taste anywhere near what fresh raw pumpkin seeds should taste like and I have had raw pumpkin seeds from many sources over the years so I know what they should taste like. The packaging claims nitrogen flush technology in packing to maintain freshness and the expiration date is a year from now so the packaging presumably is not to blame. The circumstances of this order make it unfeasible for me to return them (they are now several thousand miles away from the US and the postage back would cost more than the product) but had I received them directly from Amazon I most certainly would have sent them back immediately. I can only hope that nutritionally they are uncompromised and that by including them in salads and other dishes I won't be reminded too much of their inferior taste.<br /><br />I recommend that you avoid this product unless you are able to buy it in the store and can see what you are getting.

review/summary: Very Low Quality pumpkin seeds
review/text: NOW pumpkin seeds look like a product that had been culled by Bob's Mill. Up until this purchase I have been totally satisfied with the quality of NOW products.<br />I was originally buying Bob's Mill seeds which were great in quality and taste but change brands because Amazon's price of Bob's Mill seeds increased to more then the retail price buying direct from Bob's Mill not including ship. I cannot understand all these price increases when the Consumer index has change very little this year. (GREED?)  I purchased 8 pounds in order to get the free shipping. The Seeds are nothing but busted up bits and pieces and the seeds are not dark green like Bob's Mill seeds. They are lite in color meaning that they have dried up due to being broken and crushed like they are. This indicates the nutritional value of the seeds have been lost. The outer shell must stay intact in order for the nutrients to be preserved thus this product is a terrible value and I strongly recommend a do not purchase. Shame on you NOW FOODS for distributing such a low quality product. Why does Amazon continue to sell inferior quality products when they have been told that certain products are of low quality?

I'm not sure why the jerky went bad even though it was sealed prior to opening and a year left before expiration. Make sure you check each bag when you receive your order.

review/text: If you like oil cured olives and don't like shelling out Gourmet prices at your grocer, this is a really nice deal! The 5 pound bag I ordered arrived very securely wrapped and the olives every bit as good, perhaps slightly better, than I had been buying at my grocery store's deli department...one of the high-end stores I'd rather not name. Buying five pounds of oil cured olives was a concept that took a little getting used to,...I don't run a restaurant and my cooking is pretty basic but it's surprising how many dishes are enhanced with a few of these babies. And a nice little snack too! A little cheese, some wine and a few olives...suddenly life is better!  The 5 pounds is a nice quantity that allows you to be generous with a couple pounds to friends and still have an ample supply left for your own consumption. These olives are as fine as any I've ever had and I fully intend to repeat this order again and again. Try 'em! This is a great price and they are excellent quality. As a matter of fact, I think I'll have a few now!

But the flavor.....I am sooooo disappointed!<br /> I have an old Italian family recipe and was so excited to serve these to family and guests.  The flavor is very odd with a heavy after taste.  My husband said it all.....they taste like old plastic!  They arrived air tight sealed in plastic and I was concerned they might be ransed because of how they smelled when I opened the bag.  I bought 5 pounds and used a lot of ingredients.  I went on ahead and prepared my recipe and waited 2 weeks before serving them, to my embarrassment ...I am very disappointed!!

review/summary: DONT buy this product!!!
review/text: I love Watermelon! At work one day, a friend offered me a Dunkin Donuts Watermelon coolatta. I didnt think I would care for a slush drink - but it was fantastic and soon, I was buying one every day. I have a home snow cone and slushy maker, so I went in search of a good Watermelon Syrup.<br /><br />I tried Monin, Torani, DaVinci, and Best Bargain brands Watermelon syrup. Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.<br /><br />Avoid these products like the plague!!!<br /><br />Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the "Contact Us" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!<br /><br />Otherwise, make your own! Its the only way to get good taste. However, these products, Monin, Torani, DaVinci and Best Bargain are horrible and while they look like transmission fluid - I will wager THAT tastes better!

review/summary: Excellent taste poor package
review/text: I am very pleased by the great improvement in taste of gluten free cookies.  Even people who can eat wheat like these cookies. Unfortunately rice based baked goods require a more protective package when honey or molasses is not prominent in the recipe.  Cookie tins lined with corrugated cardboard that have crinkled paper cups provide some protection from shock, and should be used instead of thin plastic wrap.  Makers need to be aware that many gluten sensitive people don't have local stores that carry special foods, and pack for shipping by mail.  Click on my reviews to see more on this packing issue with gluten free shortbread cookies by Pamela.

review/text: Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless.

review/text: A distinctive decaf tea is hard to find.  I want a black tea taste but have rebuffed other decaf teas because they are flat and have weak flavors.  Early Grey decaffeniated has enough flavor and no flat taste residue.  I drink it at night to unwind and have no worries that I will be up all night!

review/summary: Perfect Match to Twinings Tea Bags
review/text: These Keurig cups are are perfect match to the Earl Grey teabags Twinings has. I know Keurig has expiration dates on all of the cups, but these cups are far more shelf stable and fresh-tasting than a box of teabags that have been opened. I occasionally like a cup of tea and this makes sure the last cup is as fresh tasting as the first one.

review/summary: Great Earl Grey!
review/text: Twinings is a great tea maker. And their Earl Grey is the best IMHO. I love to save money, especially when buying K-cups. You can buy a 25 pack for $9.99 at the Twinings USA website. Buying 2 packs plus shipping is still less than the $30 advertised here.(depending on where you live). So if your a fan, buy from the source. Happy Hunting! And also a place called [...] has good prices too. I don't represent any of these websites, I am giving back to consumers, because we sometimes pay too darn much for things. Pay it Forward and share good value! Smiles...

review/summary: Not bad, just not great.
review/text: I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K-cups if I want to go caffeine-free. I have had the Twinings brand Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T-disc. The K-cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink.

review/text: We've had our Keurig since December and love it.  We tried the Twinings Earl Grey tea K-cups and, although the coffee is uniformly great, we had a bit of pessimism whether a Keurig could "brew" a good cup of tea.  The Twinings K-cups more than passed the test and have become a favorite in our household.  The tea is brewed just right, flavorful and refreshing.  Twinings (and Keurig) have become a big hit in our home.

I bought this for my wife who can't have caffeinated varieties, and I can say i'm not a big fan.  The English Breakfast decaf is EXCELLENT.  I prefer my tea black, hot or cold, but this earl grey is not tolerable unless drank with a splash of milk and sugar (splenda for me though). It is undrinkable as iced tea.  I'd return this if i could. Avoid this at all costs, young jedi.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

It makes a quick and healthy alternative to the potatoes, pasta, or white rice I prepare for my husband.

GREAT source of protein, fiber and lots of other nutrients and minerals.  It's quick and easy to prepare, just heat up some water, dump in the Quinoa and cook for about 15 minutes.<br /><br />It makes a great substitute for Pasta and/or rice.  You can use it for stir fry meals, soups, toss some tomatoes, garlic and olive oil in it for a nie simple tasty dish, mix it with seafood and anything else you can cook up.  Each box is about 2 cups dry which is 6-8 cups cooked.  It's more expensive than rice and most pastas but well worth the extra expense!  Like pasta or rice, the flavor is little bland if you don't add anything to it but it does taste ok just plain.

Some sea salts can be intensely salty while others lack any panache.<br /><br />But this salt is beautifully pink and its flavor is mild and balanced with a wonderful finish. It has the character and class expected of a salt in its category.<br /><br />Extra points for packaging..I loove the space-efficient airtight design with screw on lid.

review/summary: Don't like
review/text: I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.

review/text: After buying Himalayan sea salt from health food stores for over a year, I decided to look online.  This is a really great deal and the quality is excellent.  The bag seems like it will last a pretty long time and the fine grind of the salt makes it easy to use in almost all dishes.

review/summary: In The Pink
review/text: Salt comes in a sturdy aluminum pouch with a screw cap. We live in South Texas where the humidity can turn salt into a brick overnight. This packaging keeps the salt nice and dry. Salt is finely ground which we liked as most dishes require a pinch. Taste is very mild and doesn't bite you with lingering after taste like regular table salt can do. 5 Stars

review/text: I gave this as a gift with a salt box to my girlfriend who loves to cook. She said this salt tastes very much like what we are used to cooking/seasoning with (table salt), so she didn't feel like she would have to adjust the quantity in recipes. Southern quisine is usually heavily salted and seasoned. I ordered some for myself on her recommendation, but I haven't tried it yet.

review/summary: Nice Addition to the Spice Rack
review/text: I had purchased this because I had gotten hooked on Himalayan Pink Salt at the local grocery store. They offered it in small rocks in a grinder container. Seeing this online, It was much cheaper to purchase it in this size, especially since I already had a grinder.. This stuff adds great texture to a meal when you finish it with a small crust of it. The only reason I gave this particular kind 4 rather than 5 stars is that the salt is already pretty finely ground, when I thought I was getting something similar to the small rocks of salt I was getting before, and I could grind it as I wanted it. Still a good buy, though. I barely ever use regular iodized salt for anything other than pasta water any more.

review/summary: So far, it's the best salt I have found
review/text: I felt that I had to give an update reassuring people a little more about this product.  I can assure you that I have no connection or financial interest in this company or in regard to this Himalayan salt.<br /><br />The reason for my interest is that I have an autistic son, and I am very watchful for contaminants in his food. I avoid the type of sea salt from the ocean since heavy metal contamination is an problem.  So when I found this Himalayan salt, I was glad because the label states that they monitor the contents for contaminants.  And it doesn't come from the ocean, which greatly reduces the likelihood of heavy  metal contamination.<br /><br />One reviewer was quite concerned because there seemed to be some sediment left at the bottom of a glass of water when he attempted to dissolve the salt.  He felt that this sediment was dangerous and not fit for human consumption.<br /><br />So I did some research of my own.  I tried to dissolve some of the salt in a glass of water also.  I noticed that some of it did not dissolve immediately.  It took a while, but eventually all but some red powder had dissolved.  So I know that some of the salt dissolves immediately, some of it will dissolve after a lot of stirring and perhaps after it sits in the water for a couple of hours.  But the red powder did not dissolve.<br /><br />I looked up Himalayan pink salt and found out that the Bavarian consumer protection agency analyzed the composition of 15 Himalayan sea salts sold in Germany.  They found that it was composed of 10 different minerals, including, of course, sodium and chloride (98%).  It contained 2-3% polyhalite or gypsum and 10 other minerals in small amounts.<br /><br />Gypsum is a very soft sulfate material made up of calcium sulfate dihydrate.  I am assuming it is safe for consumption since it is used as a coagulant in tofu.<br /><br />Polyhalite is a hydrated sulfate of potassium, calcium and magnesium.  It's reddish color is due to various levels of iron oxide in salt deposits.<br /><br />This may seem alarming, but I did yet more research and found that insoluble minerals do not absorb and simply pass through the body. Based on that information, I am not ready to assume that this insoluble mineral is harmful.<br /><br />Himalayan pink sea salt has been harvested from the salt mines in Pakistan since the 13th century.  So they've been eating this stuff for a long time.  And if they've been consuming it for that long, and if that's the way it comes out of the ground, I think I can feel pretty good about it.<br /><br />I am not 100% confident about my conclusions, but for now, I am feeling a bit better about serving this to my children rather than serving any other salt on the market.

It's sodium is lower, and its trace minerals are higher and more importantly are in the appropriate proportions to actually be used by the body, so that you don't have massive salt cravings all the time. Definitely worth the switch.<br /><br />[...]

The salt is fine but you still can grind it if you prefer (I like salt grinders better, it allows to control the amount of salt more easily). Just adjust the grinder screw from coarse salt to fine salt and it works perfectly. Love the taste of this salt, it is slightly lemony and very mild. Low sodium!!! This package will last probably over a year (2 pounds of it!!!). Totally will buy again.

review/summary: Salty salt...
review/text: I heard that Himalayan Pink Sea Salt was spoken of highly so when I needed to buy some more salt I decided to try this.  I have always used sea salt in a salt grinder.  The main differences between regular sea salt and this product, I would say, are that this is a very finely ground product, and it seems to be the saltiest salt I have ever tried.  I definitely have to be careful and not use a lot because a little goes a long way flavor wise.  Also, even though it is a finely ground sea salt I still use it in my salt grinder and it works perfectly fine.  Overall I would say that I do like this product and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new to add a little more flavor to their food. Just remember, a little goes a long way!

review/summary: Diogenes Sleeps Deeply
review/text: When my grandson was born, Diogenes was able to retire and seek the sleep he so deserved after searching so many centuries for an honest man. My grandson speaks his mind eloquently and succintly.  Upon the arrival of my order of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNHQ34">Funfresh Foods Real Food Trading Company Himalayan Pink Sea Salt, 2-Pound</a>, I quietly served it at a family meal.  Almost instantly my grandson asked who put sand in the salt.  I smiled, chuckled and told him no one had put anything in the salt and that this was special pink salt from half way around the world.  "It has sand in it, Grandpa! I don't like it!" he replied.  Nay, nay, not so, I assured him (and everyone).  "Let me show you."<br /><br />I drew a small glass of filtered water and added a liberal amount of the pink salt.  (BTW, if you like the C.Cola bottled water, *asani, much of it comes from the same source in FL as my tap water)  So I swirled the pink salt around in the water.  Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I've been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I'll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the "salt" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.<br /><br />It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between "regular" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.<br /><br />This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?<br /><br />I'm returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!<br /><br />Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.  Nevertheless, sediment is sediment and sediment is not salt!  This is another example of when a low price is not a bargain!
