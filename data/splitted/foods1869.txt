review/summary: LOVE IT!!!!
review/text: I absolutely love this product. It has a wonderful taste. It is light on the caffeine, but you can mix it with regular coffee and it taste great! I add a little whip cream on top and feel like I have Starbucks right in my kitchen. The Chai Latte is absolutely wonderful too!!! (Light caffeine as well, but a wonderful soothing and calming treat) The Chai Latte taste exactly like the one you can order from SB, but it's half the $ and you don't have to drive anywhere to get it! Highly recommend  both of these products!!!!! (One thing I do do different is brew a the smaller cup, which I believe gives it more flavor and especially if you want to add regular coffee, you'll still have room in your coffee cup.)

review/summary: chocolate heaven
review/text: So I have worked in a gourmet coffee shop for several years now and this tastes better than the coffee hot chocolate mix that I make myself everyday. I prefer a mild brew so this is perfect. It wasn't watery at all so its likely other reviewers were using the wrong setting. If you are looking for a bold coffee flavor either add espresso, get a different variety k-cup, or add buffalo sauce for that kick you desire.

review/summary: It's just watery hot chocolate....
review/text: I don't know why they call this coffee - it's watered down hot chocolate with a bit of coffee flavor thrown in.  While I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate with a shot of espresso now and then this has nothing to do with that.  It's watery (even on the small cup setting), has almost no coffee flavor, and a very odd aftertaste.<br /><br />I would avoid this flavor k-kup if you're looking for cafe mocha or hot chocolate.

review/summary: real Diet Dr. Pepper
review/text: My package was mailed out 1st and received on the 3rd in perfect condition. The tap fit the BIB with no trouble or leaks and is very easy to operate. I had a few questions; I emailed and received answers fast by the owner. The 1 gallon box of syrup is much smaller than I thought it would be, about the size of a medium cheese cake box. What I do is drain syrup into a washed out Sodastream container and store it in the fridge. The Sodastream syrup cap has 3 circles in it, bottom, second and top. The top circle is 2 oz. so you would fill it to that 3 times just remember after carbonating you water you remove 4 oz of water or the 1 liter bottle will over flow when adding the 6 oz. of syrup. 1 gallon BIBs are a good way to test if this is right for you before paying high price for the 5 gallon BIBs.

review/text: The product came exactly when it was scheduled to. The 30 lbs were divided into two 15 lbs bags to make the box more manageable. The gumdrops taste exactly like they're supposed to and weren't stale. We were using the product to teach engineering concepts to younger students by building towers and it worked out perfect since the gumdrops were stiff and didn't melt in the sun like most do. For this price, this was by far our best option and I only hope it will continue to be sold.

review/text: These pork chomps mini knotz are of very good value. For the 21 count, I purchased it for $10. Other products with similar size and weight was in the $20 range.<br /><br />Our Labrador pup likes these bones and definitely keeps her occupied. Give it as a treat or hide it, either way it keeps them busy.<br /><br />The knotz are about 2 - 3 inches in length and about half an inch wide. The size varies, but that's the rough size of the bones.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. If my dog could, she would say so too.

review/summary: What sea vegetables?
review/text: I purchased this as an alternative to the popular Japanese furikake because the Asian version incorporates sugar in all of their varieties, which I don't like. However, my glee at finding a sugarless version was soon cut short once I was able to inspect the contents in person. The ingredient list boasts of sesame seeds, seaweed, and pickled shiso leaves, but the last two ingredients are so disproportionate as to negate the necessity of even listing them except to highlight possible allergens.<br /><br />Seasame seeds, sesame seeds...both black and traditional versions...with a flake here or two that might be seaweed. Not that my tastebuds could tell. You're honestly just better off buying a bottle of sesame seeds and tossing in a sprinkle of salt.<br /><br />While not a direct commentary on the company itself (I really like their umeboshi), I think it's sad that they felt the need to Westernize this delightful condiment by eliminating or reducing the tastiest parts.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/text: I first had this product from my mother in law who was from Germany. It is her favorite salad dressing. Then my kids love it too. We used to get it from Germany either sent to us by my mother in law or we would buy a year of supply when we visit Germany. We run out the dressing recently and could not get it because neither us or my mother in law are traveling to Germany any time soon. So my kids helped to search on Amazon. What a great surprise, we ordered it right away and actually found this bulk package instead of the expensive individually packaged ones. Thank you Amazon! You can control how much and what kind of oil to add into your salad. It makes any salad taste great!

It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.<br />  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.

review/summary: Lucy loves it!
review/text: I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog.

review/text: Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.  I feed her Redbarn Premium Variety Pack Food Rolls cut up in treat-size pieces for all day treats and lay NOW dry food and extra supplement cubes (all combined to equal her daily allowance) on the floor in her exercise pen for her to eat at her leisure until just after her last meal of the day and what is left is taken away and all food and treats are suspended until breakfast the next morning.

The crackers were almost white--half baked, no flavor except heavy salting.  Gone was the golden color, the buttery flavor.  All that was left was white cracker and heavy salt.  I contacted Kraft/Nabisco.  They apparently thought I was complimenting them, and only sent back ads for more Nabisco products.  They were very flip and apparently didn't care that the quality of this product was utterly gone.  Use extreme caution in purchasing this product any more.

It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply. This flavor lasts longer than some of the sweeter flavors such as the strawberry remix.  Another victory for the orange.  This is more of a special occasion gum, when you're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country. I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby. Review over.

review/summary: decaffinated?
review/text: I bought this decaffeinated Midsummer's Peach tea directly from Harney, when they had it on sale for $5.95 a tin. I don't know if there was some mixup with the decaffeination process or what, but the tea in the tin I received certainly had some sort of stimulant in it -- if not caffeine, then something just as potent. I know tea contains theophylline and theobromine as well as caffeine. But I was expecting less of a stimulant effect from this tea than I get from regular tea, not more of one. I'm still baffled as to whether I received "caffeinated" peach tea that was mispackaged, or whether the removal of the caffeine somehow increased the amount of theophylline and/or theobromine enough to offset removal of caffeine.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I was a bit disappointed. It's not the worst tea I've ever had, but usually Harney tea tastes better. The peach flavor wasn't even the best "fake peach" flavor I've ever tasted. And if the tea doesn't have the benefit of no caffeine (or other stimulants), you might as well buy a better tasting tea.

I drank it so much that I used to buy it in bulk directly from them. When this tea arrived I quickly brewed up a cup and couldn't believe it was the same tea! The flavor was overwhelming, jarring, not subtle. Maybe this is the last stash that has aged poorly. Anyway, if you like Harney & Sons' Midsummer's Peach this won't be your nostalgia tea.

review/summary: prefer coffee filter set without the screw top
review/text: Ever since I came back from Vietnam, I have been using these small "French presses", or Vietnamese coffee filter sets. I bought 3 sets for one dollar (15,000 dong) in Vietnam, and soon realized that I needed more. So, I bought a few in the U.S. (local VN grocery store) and noticed that they come in different forms. This one has the screw in press, which I don't like as much as the simple press down piece that just sits on top of the ground coffee. It works great. The screw in needs to be tighten until you hit the coffee, but don't tighten too much (low drip, or no drip) and too little (too fast), but just right. I can't figure it out.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to remove the screw part after the coffee is done. Worse, sometimes it can be that it is screwed in too hard, so the water does not drain through, but now you can't loosen it, because the hot water covers the piece. That's why the simpler version works much better. I have never seen this construction in Vietnam either.<br /><br />However, there is one advantage, it is that it is sturdier and lasts longer.

review/summary: Unique, yet ubiquitous use
review/text: The Vietnamese styled coffee filter is really a nice bit of kit. It makes the often mundane act of drinking coffee into a ritual.<br /><br />While its origins are south-east Asian, its has a cosmopolitan use that is quite underrated. If you're like me and have several different blends of coffee in your home to choose from, its nice to offer guests their choice of coffee without having to make several pots to do so.<br /><br />You can alter the strength of the coffee by how tightly you compress the top filter in this apparatus. Thus enabling a "Lungo" or "ristretto" type of taste as you would find with espresso machines. This is however, not technically an espresso maker as espresso is made by forcing water through the ground coffee beans, while this apparatus uses gravity to distill the coffee.<br /><br />Many people who first experience these will be in specialty Vietnamese restaurants, offered as a traditional "C&agrave; ph� su'a d&aacute;" (translated "Coffee milk ice"), but you should be able to find this nice little filter at many oriental specialty shops for anywhere between $3-$4. Don't worry about manufacturer, as I have seen several, and there seems to be absolutely no difference in quality. So don't pay a high price for this item.<br /><br />Often, the best things are the simplest, and it doesn't get any simpler than this. It should last you decades of use.

They are pretty cool for serving coffee when you have company.  I don't think the online price is outrageous, but if you are lucky enough to live in a city with a Vietnamese market you can pick these up for $3 each.

review/summary: Great coffee filter!
review/text: Ever since having Vietnamese coffee at a restaurant in St. Louis (and then returning regularly to have Pho and coffee), I have wanted to buy one of these filters to use at home.  The one at the restaurant uses friction to compress the coffee grinds with the insert, so this kind is a bit different in that you actually screw the insert down, but I haven't had any problems with it.<br /><br />To use this properly, make sure to not screw the insert down too tightly - it should be snug, but not tight.  It might take a couple of tries to get this right.  The coffee grounds need to be able to expand a bit.  Once the insert is screwed down, pour a little bit (less than a cm) of water into the filter, and let that drip through.  This allows the grounds to expand.  If you don't do this step, sometimes the grounds actually escape from the filter up into the water chamber.  Not too big of a deal, but the water runs through too quickly when that happens.  After the small amount of water goes through, then fill the filter almost to the top with water, and cover it with the cap.  About 4 minutes should pass before all of the water has gone through.  Then, enjoy!

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: I'd encountered these before, when ordering ca phe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) at better pho-houses, and I decided to pick one up as a possible single-cup coffee solution (the coffee at my office is hideous, and I prefer to make my own).  Having only had coffee brewed in this sort of filter in the aforementioned situation, I really didn't have an opinion on the quality of the brew (sweetened condensed milk will cover a lot of sins).  After a few tries to get the brewing procedure down just right, I can say this makes one of the best cups of black coffee I've ever had.  The brew is somewhat between that of a French press and a standard drip filter; it's as strong as a strong pot of French press, and as aromatic, but has the more balanced flavor profile of a well-brewed cup of drip coffee.  I've only had the chance to use middle-of-the-line grocery store beans in the thing, but I'm looking forward to brewing up some top-end coffee in this; with the well-balanced extraction it offers, I expect it to be a treat.<br /><br />Clean-up is a breeze, limited moving parts and the grounds rinse right off, much quicker than fine-mesh filter cones or french press.  I picked up two, one for work and one for home, and I have a feeling they will both get plenty of use.

Assembly and use are easy and straight forward, but getting that screw top adjustment just right is a bit of a pain. I brew with this using true Hung Nguyen coffee and it does a great job, if not for the fact that it lets some coffee grinds through. For me, getting coffee grinds in my mouth triggers kind of a gag reflex, so I have to fish them out before drinking. Overall though, I'd say I'm happy with the product. It works well and was cheap enough to be worth it.

review/summary: Something Unique
review/text: Lapsang Souchong - 'Russian Caravan' as it is commonly known - is a truly exceptional Chinese tea, and it is done proper justice by the ladies at Culinary Teas. A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong.<br /><br />But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand.

review/text: This Lapsang Souchong from Culinary Teas has a rich, complex flavor that surpasses quite a few other brands at a price that is comparable to or better than most.  A pound of loose tea can take a while to get through, though, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking to try smoked tea for the first time.  If you are already a fan of Lapsang Souchong and are looking for a satisfying cup, this is a great find.

review/summary: Less smoky flavor than some other Lapsang Souchongs
review/text: What first attracted me to the Lapsang Souchong variety of tea leaf is the distinct Latakia-like smoky flavor. This particular variety strikes me as unusually light on the smokiness. Granted my experience has so far been limited to the Twinings variety that comes in tea bags and the variety sold by Le Pain Quotidien bakeries. I thought that perhaps letting this tea steep a bit longer might help, but I've found that by the 5 minute point, the tea becomes disappointingly bitter and sour. I guess if you're looking for a more subtle, mild version of Lapsang Souchong this might be perfect.

The kids don't like the other flavors, and neither do I!<br /><br />The other great thing about this mix as compared to others, is that it can sit in a pitcher on the counter all day without being mixed over and over, before serving.  Saves tons of room in our over-packed fridge.<br /><br />So the product is very good, it is just more expensive here then at the BBS's.  So the product is 5 stars for the product, just price is 2.5 stars!

Other K-Cups that I've purchased are all powder, but the Cafe Vanilla had problems that you could hear when you shook the cup. With the clumps not dissolving in the water, the flavor is more watered-down than it should be. I have used other products from this same line of K-Cups, but this was sub-par to any other K-Cup I've ever purchased.

If you're looking for a coffee that has chocolate flavors you can actually taste--keep looking.
