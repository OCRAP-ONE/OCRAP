review/summary: perfect for high protein diet!
review/text: I've started a high protein diet since I began exercising recently. I wanted a simple breakfast in the morning that would be easy to make, nutritious and specifically high in protein for my muscles. This cereal is just perfect for that. It's a bit plain in taste although very crispy, which I don't mind at all, especially since I'm not into sugary tasting cereal. In conclusion, very good nutritional cereal for a healthy life style!

review/text: New years resolution season and all, bought protein plus to have a healthy cold cereal choice in the morning. It provides nutrients and the taste is best described as "non-offensive".

review/summary: Perhaps the best cereal you can buy without
review/text: the unnecessary high sugar content.<br /><br />This cereal is far superior than most so-called nutritious cereal you'll find at specialty nutrition stores.  A lot of these so-called nutritious cereal are still high in fat, sugar and sodium.<br /><br />If you find a cereal low in fat, chances are they are high in sugar and/or sodium.<br /><br />As a health guru for at least 20 years, this is truly one of the best and most nutritious cereal you can find.  Ralph's (Kroger) quit carrying this cereal because I was told that no one was buying them.  I understand why...It was just too healthy for the majority of cereal consumers.

review/summary: Great Cereal
review/text: This is a breakfast staple that I've bought for years and is increasingly hard to find in local grocery stores, for some reason. I usually cut it with another sweeter cereal, but the additional protein is really helpful to get me through the morning. I use Amazon's subscription service to buy this and that has been fantastic for me. I've used it for several months and it always reliably ships.

review/summary: Best, most nutritious cereal I know
review/text: Special K Protein Plus is by far my favorite cereal, & the one that packs the biggest nutritional wallop out there in cereal-land.<br />Even the wimpishly modest portion of 100g delivers 10g (12% DV) of protein, not counting the milk you'll add.<br />My usual portion of this is 50-100% bigger. On top of it I sprinkle a measure of kosher whey protein isolate (about 52% DV).<br />Then I dump sliced fresh fruit on top: say, a banana, a peach or nectarine, pitted cherries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, yellow raspberries (yes, often all at the same time), & finally pour in enough 2% Lactaid milk to suit my taste.<br />Not only is this delicious, nutritious & healthful, it gives you at least as much protein as you'd get from a gigantic steak. And it's a lot better for you & easier to digest. Try it!

review/text: I was so craving cereal and being on the atkins diet I had to research low carb cereals. I read about this online and went and bought some, with apprehension. But WOW!!! You wouldn't even know it was low carb unless you read the box or someone told you. It was very light and flaky and had a sweet flavor to it. It kept it's crunch quite well. It also makes you feelfull which is great. I used Almond Breeze no sugar vanilla almond milk. again WOW!!!! Go out and try it... You'll be glad you did. Also... This can be used as a low carb breading.

review/text: I love this cereal.  I bought four boxes, and I plan on buying many more.  I love that it is high in protein without the added sugar of most cereals.  The taste is fairly bland (as it should be), but add a packet of splenda and some fat-free milk and this stuff is glorious.  Great for people interested in upping protein intake but leaving calories out of the equation.

review/text: Tastes exactly the same as regular Special K, with the bonus of added protein. I had gastric bypass surgery, so I'm always worried about getting enough protein in my diet; this allows me to continue my lifelong breakfast routine (cereal and milk) without adding protein powders (which mostly taste awful). The four-pack lasts me just over a month, and it costs just about the same as the grocery store - it works out to about $3.43 a box, as opposed to the $3.49 I pay in the grocery store (I'm an Amazon Prime member, so I don't pay shipping) - so I don't ever have to worry about running out.

review/text: I went ahead and ordered the cereal because I've tried the regular Special K(which tastes pretty good),<br />and figured this would be like that except with protein.<br />You can imagine my "if it sounds too good to be true.." moment when I had my first bowl.<br />Now I'm a pretty utilitarian kind of guy, I like good food, but I can eat just about anything edible just for survival.<br />This is what this cereal is all about.<br />Eating out of necessity.<br />The taste is almost non-existent, which I can live with, but the texture is what kills me.<br />All I can think about is cardboard boxes which were ripped into flakes and hardened. (The color of the cereal doesn't convince you otherwise either)<br />Now I don't care about high fructose corn syrup and all that, but if something tastes this bad.... it should at least be 100% good for you.<br />I don't think I will be ordering more.<br />Protein is good, but you know.. life can be rough... you don't need to start out each day with rough cereal

Low and behold, they have changed the formula and it no longer fits into my low carb life style!!

I'm miffed.

review/text: Hawaiian Punch has switched to using sucralose.<br /><br />I'm not talking about the "diet" version - I'm talking about the regular version. Some (but not all) of the high fructose corn syrup (which is worse than sugar) has been replaced with sucralose. The result is that the drink is less thick than it used to be, and there's also an aftertaste. I plan to finish what I just bought, but I'm not sure if I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />The switch a long time ago from sugar to HFCS was already bad enough, but the introduction of sucralose is far worse.

Maybe that's the nature of brown Basmati??<br /><br />The second time I ordered a pack of six, the box it came in said it was Basmati, but the bags inside said it was long grain brown rice (a lower priced product, I think).<br /><br />Amazon sent us a another box with no hassles and this time it was the right stuff.

review/summary: Good rice, great value
review/text: The first thing I will say is to disregard the directions on the bag! It took me about 3-4 batches before realizing the hard bits weren't the imperfections that are very prevalent in this brand. After upping the amount of water to 2.5-3 cups I haven't had a problem and the rice has been great.<br /><br />I was excited about this product because brown basmati is a rare find in my area and is generally over $3 per lb. My only issue is that I do have to pick over it a little better before cooking if I don't want unattractive black bits of some part of the rice in my finished dish.<br /><br />I do see the price had raised quite a bit since I purchased mine, but I would still buy more, especially with the deal offered with subscribe and save.

review/text: Yes, it is a good basmati rice, and being brown it is more healthful than that with the bran (nutritious exterior) removed: just what I'm looking for - BUT - yesterday the price went from right around $20.83 for one-time delivery, to [&#8230;]. That is very close to a 50% increase.<br /><br />I cannot know whether this is Amazon's choice or whether the supplier suddenly raised its price. But in light of the earthquake in Japan, a huge jump in the price of rice has the smell of nasty profiteering, since there now will be a need for countries with rice supplies to replace damaged goods in a highly-populated, rice-intensive nation. You do what you want, but for me the answer is to not encourage this kind of price gouging. In other words, I'm not buying. I'll look elsewhere.

review/summary: Vanilla Paste is terrific
review/text: Based on recommendation from King Arthur Flour (KAF), I bought the vanilla bean paste. It came in quickly. I tried it and came to several conclusions. First, the flavor is outstanding..rich vanilla flavor. As described at KAF, the paste contained small vanillla bean specks which were visible in the lighter colored preps I made, like French Vanilla ice cream. It gave the preparations a special touch. One caution. If used in a thin batter, the specks will sink to the bottom. I learned this when I made Creme Brulee. The vanilla flavor was great, but at the bottom of the ramekin were all the bean specks. Use the paste in recipes where the specks will stay suspended and not sink.

review/text: This is the first time I have purchased this particular brand of vanilla and I normally would not purchase such a large bottle, but I found that the flavor is just wonderful. I'm glad I bought it because I like to bake and the size of this bottle will keep me busy for a while

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I purchased a bottle of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla about a year ago through Amazon and noticed how the vanilla enhanced<br />the flavors of whatever I used it in. Cookies had a richer flavor as well as pancakes and other baked goods. When I ran out I purchased<br />a couple of smaller bottles of vanilla at my local market, but the flavor just wasn't as intense.  So, I recently purchased another<br />bottle of Nielsen-Massey and am very satisfied again with this product.  Keep in mind this is "pure" vanilla as opposed to "imitation"

review/summary: FLAVOR-filled :)
review/text: Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla is BY FAR the best vanilla I've ever used in my baking--and I've used a lot of vanilla from numerous companies over five decades of baking.  There have been store-brands, spice company brands, the famous vanilla sold door-to-door years back, and even vanilla brought home from a foreign country.<br />When I opened this bottle of vamilla, the aroma was fresh and fabulous.  Then I tasted the "old" cakes and cookies I've baked umpteen times.  I could have sworn they were new recipes, and my guests responded likewise.<br />I proudly recommend Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla for your use.  Buy the 32-ounce bottle, because you're going love baking with it :)

review/text: I received this item with several other items - it was carefully packed in an individual, padded box within the larger parcel Amazon delivered.  While I prefer vanilla bean paste as a general rule, extract is much more economical and this is fairly good quality product with a standard alcohol base.  The value is hard to beat.

review/summary: None Better
review/text: Stop what is going on and bring out the baking materials because a cake is on the way and it will be the best cake ever as long as Nielsen-Massey Vanilla is one of the ingredients.  I have used almost every type of real vanilla over the years and none is better than this one.  The taste fits my needs perfectly and those who eat the end result agree.  Even though cheap imitation vanilla is readily available at a low cost per unit and other real vanilla is also readily available this one is the absolute best.  I thought that the 32 ounce size would be too much and it might not get used before expiring but I was just plain wrong.  It will be gone long before its expiration and all the consumers in this house will say thank you.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as having one of the church ladies or a guest extolling the goodness of a pound cake made with Nielsen's.  I know the vanilla is just an insignificant part of the total product but it is the one element that adds so much to the flavor and goodness.

The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract.

review/summary: A Passion for Vanilla
review/text: Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar "Bourbon Islands," Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Weak Vanilla Flavor
review/text: After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean "look" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.<br /><br />I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Tastes like Pure Alcohol
review/text: I feel bad writing a bad review, but I feel cheated and I don't believe other people should buy this product based on my experience with it. Maybe other products of theirs are good, but this one is exceptionally bad, especially since it is supposed to be gourmet. The small bottles of vanilla that you can buy at Walmart taste much, much, much, much, much more like vanilla than this product, which tastes to me, like vodka with a dash of vanilla in it. I feel like I have been cheated, even though for the price it should be a good value. I am actually scared to purchase vanilla now on the Internet in bulk other than from companies I can find and try out in the stores. I can only speak about the bottle I purchased. I would recommend something else. Most vanilla is gluten free although many have corn syrup in them. This one has sugar in it. I really don't understand positive reviews about this product. I bought it because it was cheap (for the amount) and gourmet. It (I think, tastes worse than the imitation). Imitation at least tastes like vanilla. I apologize for writing such a review but other people need to be aware of this product. If you want to buy from this company try something that will have more vanilla in it.

review/summary: 80% of a good on the go tea experience
review/text: This is a decent set to take with you for good on-the-go tea making. I've got three things I would change about it that stop it from 5 stars:<br /><br />#1. The bottom of the pouch is not sewn on. So when you open it it opens from both directions which I find slightly annoying. That might just be me though.<br /><br />#2. The can that holds the infuser is lined with foam. This protects the infuser but forces you to make sure that it is 100% dry before stowing it. Again just a little annoyance to me.<br /><br />#3. The real reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars. The cans do not have the plastic air seals on the lids like the Teavanna tea holders do. Because of that the tea cannot be left in these cans. This is my biggest compaint because I feel like I am loosing freshness when I put tea in here for more than a week (even though I cannot prove that).<br /><br />Overall, a great buy if you really like your tea and feel like taking it with you. I wish it was $5 cheaper but in the long run I will get enough use out of it to justify the cost.

review/text: It's perfect for it's intended use. The kit comes with 2 small airtight canisters, a pouch, an infuser, and case for the infuser. I personally love this set because it keeps everything together so I can just throw this in my tote and I'm ready for tea anytime. To correct the last reviewer you cannot use the canisters for actually preparing/steeping tea they are merely used to store the tea and infuser. The pouch feels very durable and the quality is good. The infuser opens up and acts as a scoop so you can scoop up the desired amount of tea. It's a great set for the office or for travel.

They've been on dry food since kittens and I've yet to find a brand they don't eventually throw up from.  They both suffer from runny eyes and occasionally nasal discharge.  I recently started them on this 95% organic food.  Both my cats, even the girl, devour it like wild animals.  And to our delight, they have stopped vomiting.  Both of them have bulked up slightly, have even healthier coats and less eye and congestion problems since this change in diet as well.  I hope this review helps.

I knew exactly what I would do the next time I hosted my bookclub, I would create my own cookie & wine tasting bar.. So I ordered the 3 pack and then went  to the cookies and corks web site,  and paired my cookies with wine using the expanded wine wheel (each box has a pairing guide but the wheel is as more)  and got tips on "how to create a bar" . I was set.. My girls friends loved it, we didn't get to review the book but we did have a fantastic time trying cookies and wine and I discovered I actully like red wine (Pinot Noir) :)<br />Cookies and Cookies is a must try, for every hostess or even great for gifts..

We tried another type of bait (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACMBJK">Combat 766694/519 Quick Kill Formula Large Roach Bait Stations</a> rated 5 star) and they had done nothing to stop the roaches we were seeing so we went back to these and are happy to say that they are working well.  Would be nice to not see any roaches at all, but am okay with seeing them dead or almost dead.  The challenge has been getting to them before our 11 month old twins do.

review/summary: Maybe these worked for a while
review/text: If these worked at all, it was for less than two months.  I have my doubts about even that, as I watched a couple of small roaches completely ignore the baits before I gave up and killed them.  In any case, it's been about two months, and I just killed the first large roach I've seen since I put these down.  (I've seen plenty of small ones, though.)<br /><br />I previously used Combat baits and was more convinced they actually did something for the three months mentioned on the box.

review/summary: Worked great in combo with Combat Roach Killing Gel
review/text: Put all the traps out at once-- this is for the medium/small roaches, not the huge palmetto bugs --along with the Combat Platinum Roach Killing Gel (used the whole tube-- used both products exactly as described on their packaging) and NO MORE ROACHES. This is in a 1-story concrete slab home, about 1700 sq feet, including garage. Concentrated mainly on bathrooms, kitchen, laundry area, and a little in the garage, and it really worked. We did NOT have a severe infestation, but just seeing 2 roaches each week, on average,  was too much for us. Anyway, this really did the trick.<br /><br />If they ever come back (these things work for about 3 months, per directions), will get this combo and do it again. Very happy!

I love them because they're crunchy because they have almonds in them, but chewy at the same time. They have fruit, and nuts in them, and they're the perfect late afternoon snack. You know, when you want something sweet, but a candy bar is a BAD idea? Try one of these, they really hit the spot :)

review/text: My cats eat every scrap of this food...not just this flavor but every Organix flavor.  It NEVER smells.<br /><br />One thing I am afraid of with cats is their bowels movements.  If the food sucks, so will the movements.  Hence, my plan is to improve the food they take in and the bowel movements will follow.  Also remember cats are very susceptible to stomach cancer.  The better the food, the longer your cat will last and the higher the quality of the purr....get it?<br /><br />I can tell you the stool has been clean, with nearly without any incident.  As long as the stool is simple, I think the food is doing what it should be, and thats Organix.<br /><br />Worth the cost, in my eyes.

review/summary: Bummer- throwing it away daily.
review/text: I bought this because it was highly recommended on several 'nutritional review' cat food sites and because of the raving comments here. My cats are hard to get to eat 'any' food except dry. This includes raw, fresh cooked, or people-canned chicken, tuna, salmon, etc... Anyway, at first my cats gingerly ate a little bit (PROGRESS!!!), so I ordered another case, but this whole case has literally ended up in the garbage.  I'm not sure if the ingredients have changed (in quality or quantity) or if it's my cats. All I know is that it's being thrown away on a daily basis, can after can. So I'm on the hunt again for a quality canned food that they'll eat-with minimal waste. Bummer!

review/summary: Great Catfood But
review/text: I have been very much impressed with the entire range of Organix catfoods for some time.  But the two stores I frequent in Northern New Jersey that have supplied the product no longer, for some reason, do; maybe it's too expensive in today's economy.  I ordered a case of one flavor through Amazon.  Nothing wrong there, but if I wanted to provide my cats with some variety, I'd have to order five or six cases, and I live in an apartment.  I'd be great if, since their catfoods are no longer available in a very population-dense and upscale section of the country, Castor & Pollux could offer a mixed case of catfoods.  That way, they'd never lose me as a customer.  As things now stand, I've gone back to Iams (not easy to find either, but still available in stores!).

review/summary: Really Surprisingly Good Baked P-Chips! MMmm!
review/text: I'd pretty much given up on baked potato chips cause I hate that funky texture that, for instance, the Lays one has.<br /><br />Since I really love the organic Kettle Chips in chipotle flavor, I decided to give these a go. I got the lightly salted first, and the texture was great. They were very nearly like regular. (A very minimal difference). Crispy, potato-y. Nice.<br /><br />I then ordered these, and I love them. Much tastier than the somewhat bland "lightly salted" regular ones. They're sweet and smoky. A very nice barbecue flavor, I have to admit.<br /><br />I really hope they make the chipotle flavor in baked (and organic). I'd buy those in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So, for folks looking for a non-fried potato chip alternative (great for brown bagging lunch, four servings to a bag makes them more economical), I recommend the Kettle Bakes. Very good product.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: The BEST! Kettle Baked Cheddar Chips
review/text: My husband and I went to Kauai  in Feb. of this year and we tried these chips for the first time. And my husband started a saying then "an opened bag of these chips is and empty bag of these chips"  and once we came home we could not find them anywhere. No store around our town of Grand Junction Colorado carried the baked cheddar chips. So I looked to Amazon and there they were. So now we have them available and we will order more. Yesterday we had sandwiches for lunch and as my husband ate the last few chips and crumpled the bag up he said" an opened bag of chips is an empty bag and he laughed. They really are good tasting chips whether a person is watching their calorie intake or not. We will buy them again!

review/text: These potato chips are absolutely the best baked potato chip I have ever tried.  They are so good that my husband and son will also eat them.  In fact, my college-aged son says he prefers these over the greasy regular potato chip.  With 65% less fat and baked, they are a healthy alternative to regular potato chips.  We got the lightly salted because husband is watching his blood pressure and these are perfect with just a touch of sea salt on them.  Sodium is lower than Lays baked and the taste is much better.  These look and taste like real potato chips, unlike Lays Baked which don't even look real.  Highly recommend these.

review/text: I have been a fan of the Kettle Bakes for a long time now.  They truly are the best chips available anywhere.  In my opinion they are far better in every way than any brand of fried potato chips, not counting Fritos, which aren't potato chips anyway.  I don't see how they could really be improved.  The crunch is fantastic, the flavor is fantastic, and you sacrifice nothing but greasy fingers!  I have tried every flavor, and my favorite is definitely the Aged White Cheddar, but you won't see me turn my back from the BBQ, or the Lightly Salted.  The Salt and Pepper flavor is a bit peppery, so if you like that then you'll like them, and I even eat them sometimes.  The Salt and Vinegar doesn't work for me, but then I'm not a fan of vinegar potato chips anyway.<br /><br />Just buy these, please, any flavor that tickles your fancy.<br />And then you can thank me later.<br />=)

If this matters to you like it matters to me, stipulate that you receive the Lightly Salted version ONLY.

I was going to have them delivered every six months.  When I got my first order I got seasalted chips instead of lightly.  I called about it and they put through another order at no charge to me.  Second order again wrong chips.  So I called and cancelled automatic delivery.  The chips are good except they are a little too hard and hard on my gums.  Also too salty for me.  The above should have read (lightly salted)<br /><br />I have to admit though that I do like the chips because they are lower fat and may order again.  I just wish I could have gotten lightly salted ones.  "Thank you.  Irene Zalonski (zalonski @sbcglobal.net)

review/summary: I love these chips!
review/text: I first tasted these on a trip to NYC and my wife and I were hooked.  Tough to find them around here and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  No other baked chip even comes close to these - you would swear they were kettle fried chips but with no greasy feel.  Our current favorite snack!
