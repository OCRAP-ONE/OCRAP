review/summary: Very spicy
review/text: This is a spicy and lo-cal (60 per serving) winner from Progresso. It has a decent amount of chicken, other vegetables such as beans, corn, celery, and tomato, and a great flavor. The broth is thin, but with the vegetable content it is filling. At that calorie level, it's perfect in combination with a sensible sandwich to total out to a 200 to 300 calorie lunch that will include good nutrition and good satiety.<br /><br />In the grocery store it's about 2.50 to 2.70 dollars, so don't buy it online unless you can beat that price including shipping, per can.

review/summary: Perfect for homemade iced tea
review/text: If you make your own iced tea, this (plus a pinch of citric acid) is just the thing to get that slightly tart peach flavoring that Snapple does so well. This, and the "old fashioned" bitters, are my favorite flavorings for iced tea.

review/summary: In the Age of Bitters
review/text: Bitter has made an intense comeback onto the craft-cocktail scene at bars and restaurants, and amazon is making it super easy to create your own craft cocktail at home by offering almost the entire Fee Brothers line of bitters.  Fee Brothers has always been our bitter manufacturer of choice and we were super excited to see amazon offering it at such an amazing price.  This flavor, Peach, has been pushed to the front of the line at our bar since we have been playing around with some fun southern cocktails... is there anything more southern than a Georgia Peach?<br /><br />A+ on Value, Shipping and Quality.

review/text: I've tried these bitters in two drinks so far and it has been a great addition to both.<br /><br />The peach flavor comes through perfectly -- it's a natural-tasting flavor, not artificial at all.  The first thing that strikes you might be the price.  It may be the most expensive four ounces of liquid in my house right now, but a little bit goes a long, long way.

review/summary: The best popcorn seasoning out there
review/text: I had been searching high and low for popcorn seasoning and finally found what I was looking for with Cornzapoppin.  I ended up buying the Sour Cream & Chive, Parmesan & Garlic, Jalapeno and Barbeque.  I wasnt sure which one I would like so I got a "sampler" order.  I liked all the flavors to differing degrees but definitely preferred the Sour Cream & Chives.  It was a perfect blend of seasonings and strength of flavor.  If you are not sure which flavor seasoning to choose, I would recommend the Sour Cream.

review/summary: Looking for that cup that makes me shout wow.
review/text: I use a French press exclusively. I rarely make espresso but I love espresso beans. I also grind to a fine grind rather than coarse so this being said your results may vary. This coffee is not one to make me shout wow, but it is a very good drinkable cup. As I pour the hot water into the press I can see a little bit of crema forming on the top. I give this product four stars more for the value than the flavor. The quality is good and the Java Trading Company boasts of their "air roasting" method. I have also tried "Jet City" from them which I thought was superior to Java Gold.<br />The texture in my mouth is smooth and the flavor complex with a tiny hint of sweet spicy. In my opinion a better cup of coffee than Pike's Place or Verona. For the money it is a better value than some of the lower priced LaVassa but it doesn't come close to Crema de Oro. This coffee if I had to guess is more African/Asian than South American.<br /><br />I've been drinking it daily now for about 40 days and am almost bored. It is satisfying but I will be exploring more. Looking for that cup that makes me shout wow.

review/summary: Zipfizz-Orange soda
review/text: Zipfizz, one of the best drinks there is.<br /><br />  This product Zipfizz Healthy Energy drink is my all time favorite energy drink. Out of the the flavors orange soda is my favorite. Zipfizz is this powered like drink (almost like kool aid). They also come in about 2" tubes, which then you pour into about 16-20 oz. of water. Shake. They also have Zipfizz in many different flavors- Grape, Berry, Orange soda, etc.<br /><br />  What i enjoy most about it is how easy and how fast it takes to make it. Its super fast, it only takes you 1 minute to make the drink. But the thing I don't like about it is, is when you go to shake it. It can explode on you. It's a negative and positive, drink but mostly positive.<br /><br />  I drink one almost everyday. I've also have showed it to many of my friends and they feel in love with the drink. Another thing is, is that it is more than 50% healthy and you can drink more than 3 times a day. Unlike Monsters or Amps. This Zipfizz actually works with energy. It last up to 5-7 hours!<br /><br />  People who wouldn't like Zipfizz would be optional, because everyone is different with the flavors they like.Zipfizz is every cheap to. it's $2 per. tube and or buy a case with 20 tubes for $10, when you purchase the drink.<br /><br />  I don't like Zipfizz, i love it. I also suggest to get the Orange flavor or the new flavors Creamsicle. They are very flavorful. And they are the one that don't explode on you when you're making them.

review/text: My wife bought this at the recommendation of Dr.Oz for blueberry tea to be helpful in some cases of stomach issues. This was one of the few that really had blueberries (however small) as an ingredient.  The tea bags are circular and store in a can which helps keep them fresh.  As far as teas go, Republic of Teas are more expensive than most teas. With 50 bags, you won't run out any time soon.  The taste is different as blueberry is not a regular flavor.  As for any stomach help the jury is still out.  We will probably not buy this product again.  I can't speak to other flavors as we have not tried them. I guess I am one who thinks green tea is green tea.

review/text: These are the best rawhides I've ever used. I became concerned about the quality of rawhides after reading an online article and wondering what was actually in these treats I was giving my dog every night. To spare you the details on the article, I tracked down Wholesome Hides as a company where the rawhides were made in the US and not chemically treated. The added bonus was that these rawhides are incredibly thick and this version of their retriever roll has about 6 layers of rawhide coiled around each other. On a normal night, my beagles consume a whole rawhide. They worked on the super thick retriever roll over over a week. So I think the extra cost of these is negated by the fact that it takes my dogs so long to get through them. Be careful when you order. I ordered another retriever roll from someone else on Amazon that did not have the "super thick" designation. It still lasted longer than the grocery store-bought rawhides, but not as long as this one.

After reading the reviews here I decided to risk it.  This is really wrapped tight and he's been chewing on it for days, safely I might add, the rawhide is very thick before they even tightly roll it.

review/text: I got this for my 3 month old Golden Retriever because I did not want to be giving her rawhides from walmart that can come from dead decomposing animals and really not be good for your pet. I was very pleased with the size and how tightly it is rolled. We have had it for almost a month now and you can barely tell the thing has been chewed on. Maybe the reason for this is that our dog does not seem to be to interested. She will chew on a small dingo from Walgreens until it is gone, but will only chew on this for minutes at a time. I am thinking that maybe she is not in love with it because of the fact that it is so big in comparison to her still puppy mouth and teeth. So all in all, the jury is still out on this one in my mind, I will update review in a couple months, but people will smaller dogs may want to look elsewhere.

It tastes very good and you can't tell it is sugar free.<br /><br />Two reasons I am not  giving this five stars:  1. The price.  While this jam is very good it is pretty expensive, especially seeing they have other flavored jams for half the price.  2.  No nutritional info.

review/text: I usually drink mint or chamomile herbal teas, so I didn't know how this would be.  I am pleased.  The various herbal ingredients mix together well.  No individual flavor rises to the top, but if I try, I can "locate" each herb.  Does not get bitter after soaking.  It will be added to my tea library.

review/text: I have long been a fan of this product. For those who get bored with the traditional Orange Marmalade, here it the boredom antidote. This Marmalade is smoother than most Orange version but it is more expensive. One was of economizing is to mix it in a ratio of 1 part Lemon/Lime to 3 parts regular Orange Marmalade. The Lemon/Lome has enough tang to infise itself into the rest and create a delightful concotion.

I purchased 10 Naps boxes for Christmas gifts; however, not all boxes could be given out as gifts because some of the boxes were damaged upon arrival due to bad packaging quality control.

The candy is very sweet with a hint of cream and plenty of whisky flavor.  They are truly addictive! Looks like I'll need another tin for my guests, because these will be long gone.

review/summary: More of a Crunchy Caramel than Fudge
review/text: I guess fudge can be any flavor, but I associate it more with chocolate than anything.  This product appears to have no chocolate at all.  Looks and tastes more lie a scotch flavored caramel.  And a poorly executed one at that.  Too soft, and the sugar seems undercooked and "crunchy" to the teeth.  Not smooth and delicious like a fudge should be.  Scotch flavor is there and well balanced, but overall disappointing.  Hopefully this is just a bad batch.

review/text: Well, like most foods that someone brings to the market and tries to convince<br />you it is a great substitute for the real thing... the fake is worse than the real.<br />Add this bar to the list!<br /><br />We tried this just yesterday.<br />Admittedly, they are not horrible to the taste. Of course, sweet taste overrides most<br />other tastes on the tongue, so anything sweet will taste okay upfront.<br />They taste like one of those sugar wafers (the ones you can get in vanilla, strawberry<br />or chocolate really cheaply in the stores) dipped in chocolate flavored coating.<br />It had an odd aftertaste I could not pinpoint.<br /><br />Then I decided to look at the ingredients. That made the decision that I wouldn't be buying<br />these again. Why do mfgs continue to make chemical cocktails for us, shape it like a treat<br />and tell us how great it will be for us?  I guess because we keep buying them. I'll pass!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS OF THE SKINNY COW HEAVENLY CRISP 110 CAL BAR:<br /><br />SUGAR, whole wheat flour, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, nonfat milk, cocoa processed with alkali,<br />high oleic canola and/or sunflower oil, chicory root fiber, partially hydrogenated palm oil,<br />maltodextrin, milk, baking soda, corn syrup, partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil,<br />vegetable emulsifiers (soy lecithin, sorbitol tristearate), salt, natural and artificial flavor,<br />TBHQ (?) to protect flavor, ground peanuts.<br /><br />Wow - what a cocktail of garbage!<br />anything partially hydrogenated are the artery cloggers and should always be avoided.<br />I checked the wrapper and did not see peanuts mentioned anywhere except the ingredients list,<br />so if you have a peanut allergy, you should not eat these bars, but saw no warnings on the label.<br />Sugars, oils, salts and junk, made to look like a candy bar.<br /><br />All in all, have a real chocolate bar. Those have sugar too, but they'll taste good<br />and not be nearly as bad for you as these things.<br />I'll never buy them again.

However, the prices on the net leave alot to be desired.  I just bought these at Walgrens for $2.69 a box, so of course I stocked up.  The calories run from 110-120 depending on the product but they are a good alternative to a 300 calorie candy bar.

review/text: I've been on a low cal diet for a long time, and with the major sweet-tooth I have, it's not easy . These are delicious and perfectly crunchy. To me, they taste better than Kit-Kat or twix. They're not overwhelmingly sweet like most "diet" candy tends to be-most diet candies use a boatload of artificial sweeteners to set off an otherwise bland taste, but these are perfect level of sweetness and have excellent texture.<br /><br />PS. For your own sanity, don't read the ingredient list.

review/text: I love to bring these to work as an afternoon snack since they don't require any special storage, containers, utensils or prep. I can just throw it in my bag on the way out the door. These satisfy the "I NEED A CHOCOLATE BAR RIGHT NOW" cravings pretty well. Other chocolate fix favorites include 3 muskateers minis and fun sizes (one is only 30 or 50 calories depending on the size), a couple of chocolate wafers, and chocolate covered raisins.<br /><br />A quick note though, these aren't "special" in regards to calories. Pretty much all wafer cookies are like this calorie wise. You can have 3-5 wafers for 100-150 calories from a normal package. The thing that makes this special is that chocolate covering. If you are in the mood to snack lots, a regular wafer will let you eat more within the same number of calories. My personal favorite wafers are the Goya Guava wafers, but those aren't chocolate covered.

review/summary: low calorie but unhealthy option
review/text: These taste so delicious! Very chocolatey and hits the spot if you have a chocolate craving. Its a much better option than kit kat since it has lower calories. I do recommend you buy this elsewhere. I got a box from Walgreens for $4.99. Edit: I didnt realize at the time that these bars contained partially hydrogenated palm oil. So why does the nutrition label read 0g trans fats? Its because the government doesnt count trans fat of less than 0.5g per serving. The problem is however, if you consume beyond the serving size. Is it a low calorie chocolate bar? Yes. Is it healthy for you? No. So make your choices wisely.

review/text: Growing up in Brooklyn, Streit's was always the preferred brand of matzoh on my old school parents' table.  My dad had some every night with dinner to remind him of his childhood.  It's been very hard to find outside of NYC, and impossible to get at the grocery stores in my very non-Jewish area.  I was thrilled to find it available via Amazon.  Light and crisp the way it should be, with all natural ingredients.  One downside: shipping is high.  Wish Amazon would ship it directly so I can take advantage of the Prime discount.  UPDATE, APRIL 1, 2012:  Amazon has started offering prime, and a VERY reasonable price, making this the ultimate true matzoh lover's dream come true.  Thank you, Amazon!!!!  PRIME ROCKS!

review/summary: Not a Mushroom Expert, but Seem Delicious to Me....
review/text: I almost hesitate to review a product when I'm unfamiliar with the genre essentially.  But since this doesn't have any reviews yet, I thought I would go ahead.<br /><br />I ordered a large bag of these "stir fry mix" dried mushrooms.  They are very clean, very large, healthy looking pieces, without bruising, cuts, or other damage (other than where they were sliced up, obviously).  In many cases the mushroom is whole, not cut up (this seems true of all but the shitake and the portobello).  I really don't know what the individual mushrooms are and am trying to find out; but I believe the mix includes shitake, trumpet, maitake, some portobello type mushroom, and a smallish golden-colored capped type of mushroom.  Each is absolutely delicious and the blend seems well designed.<br /><br />I haven't actually stir fried them yet, but I have used them rehydrated and added to other dishes, such as stroganoff, in which they are awesome.  They rehydrate into beautiful, large, fresh seeming mushrooms, with a clean, natural scent (no mustiness or dirty smell).  They aren't stale, crumbly or bland tasting.  Actually these are particularly good tasting mushrooms, better than many fresh ones I've had.<br /><br />I will definitely turn to this company again once I've used up this giant bag of their mushrooms; I feel I can rely on this company to give me a good and safe product.

What good are natural sweeteners if you load me up with chemicals in the end anyway?<br /><br />Here's the deal. On the Sobe website it says only 3 flavors out of their entire line are all-natural and those are the Sobe lean drinks.  They say all-natural and "sobe lean" on the bottle.<br /><br />This isn't one.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think they used far too much Erythritol in this...the sweetness is simply overpowering.<br /><br />Dudes, it's water with pear apple flavor. And vitamins.  The only reason not to make this all-natural is to make it cheaper...it could so easily be made all-natural.<br /><br />If it were kool-aid, it would be one thing, but promoting it as healthy when it has detrimental ingredients is odd to me.<br /><br />It has nutrients...it hydrates...but label readers will feel taken aback.

review/summary: Please Send to China
review/text: My wife bought one 10 ounce canister of Trader Joe's Spicy Chai this summer, and I wish she had purchased several packs of this stuff. Since we live in China, after we drink our seven servings it will probably be many months before we have a cup of this chai. Each serving is 170 calories (30 from fat), and it is very easy to make. Simply mix one scoop (3 tablespoons) with six ounces of hot water. If you want it cold, mix a scoop with two ounces of hot water, two ounces of cold water or milk, and add eight ounces of ice. I prefer it hot although you cannot go wrong with the drink regardless of the temperature. Some of the yummy ingredients include sugar cane, nonfat MILK, coconut oil, black tea, honey, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and vanilla extract. No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives are made with this product. Why you wouldn't like Trader Joe's Spicy Chai Latte is beyond me.

review/text: This is by far not only one of the best gluten free pastas I've had , but one of the best pastas period.  Meaning I would pick this over most glutenous pastas.  Has a very great taste to it and will continue to buy this pasta for as long as it's around!

review/summary: This is the absolute best gf pasta!
review/text: My entire eats gluten-free due to having 3 celiacs. We first tried this pasta at an Italian restaurant in San Francisco and were blown away with the taste and texture. It was just like wheat pasta! We've tried many brands of brown rice pasta, corn pasta, corn/quinoa blends and this is our absolute favorite.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise
review/text: I don't need gluten-free pasta but I like trying new foods. I was pleasantly surprised with the ditalini in the 250 gr box (9 ozs). I like this small pasta to put in soups and sides. It is a beautiful yellow color and tastes great. I was also very happy that it comes packaged in a bag within a box.  That means no chance of little critters getting inside the inner sealed package, love that. Most pastas out there do not have pastas in a secondary plastic insert and I've had to throw boxes out b/c I didn't get to eat them b/4 the critters did! The expiration date on these is also great--Sept of 2012 and it is only February of 2011 as I type this. On the ingredient label I do not see any listing for the fiber content which I like to know b/c I'm on WW; but that's a small negative.  This is made in Italy which seems to me a place that knows their pasta.  All in all, a good find and I will share it with friends, celiac and non-celiac alike.

review/summary: Best gluten-free pasta on the market
review/text: I have several family members with celiac's so cooking for a large italian family gathering is a huge challenge if you want to keep your meals simple when pasta is a must have menu item.  I've tried all the brown rice based pasta brands with mixed results.  They are either cook up too gummy, release a lot of starch in the water while cooking, fall apart when mixing the cooked pasta with other ingredients or they do not make great left-overs the next day.  The Le Veneziane pasta is fantastic!  My very picky daughter didn't even realize she was eating gluten-free pasta (she always turned her nose up for the brown rice pasta).  This corn based pasta cooks, feels and taste like the "real" deal and my entire family now prefer this brand over all other wheat based or gluten-free pasta.

review/summary: BEST GLUTEN FREE PASTA. PERIOD.
review/text: I first discovered this pasta at the NYC restaurant Nizza (if you're gluten-free, you NEED to check them out!). The first time I had this pasta, I was not on the gluten-free diet but I tried some of my Mom's dish (she has Celiac's). As someone who knows what the real thing tastes like, I was absolutely amazed that this pasta was gluten-free. I actually preferred this to regular pasta. It doesn't give you that heavy feeling after eating, and it's great with basically any recipe. I'm now eating gluten-free, and we order this by the case. Skip the other gluten-free pastas (that generally taste like cardboard) and try this, I promise you will be amazed!

review/summary: Finally - Pasta Again!
review/text: There are a lot of foods I can't have - wheat is one of them. I have tried several different brands of gluten free pasta and while they were okay or good enough to eat none of them gave me the satisfaction that wheat pasta did. Until I tried this.<br /><br />This pasta acts like wheat pasta - cooks up very well and it is just as good the next day. Stays together - doesnt fall apart like some GF pastas and holds any type of sauce you put on it.<br /><br />However, if you make it too el dente the next day it will be a little harder and you wont be able to eat it cold (pasta salad) without reheating it with a little oil or butter.<br /><br />I didnt follow the instructions for cooking instead I cooked it this way:<br /><br />Bring water and salt to a boil - put the pasta in - and boil for one min. Cover and turn off - let sit in the hot water for 8 mins. (keep it covered)<br /><br />This worked great for me and comes out perfect each time. You can go up to 9 mins - but i wouldnt leave it too long unless you like pasta on the mushy side.<br /><br />I'm so happy I found this by mistake - I love this and its wonderful to be able to have a good wheat free pasta!

review/summary: Ohhh so delicious!  THE perfect gluten free pasta.
review/text: The La Veneciane fetuccine pasta is absolutely delicious.  I have tried many, many different types of gluten free pasta in the past, quinoa based, brown rice based (tinkada, trader joe's) and they all come out somewhat mushy and just don't entice me to eat them.  This pasta comes out in texture exactly as wheat versions.  The taste is delicious and you cannot tell that it is gluten free.  It is perfect with just plain olive oil or truffle oil and garlic and also adapts well with regular tomato based or pesto sauces.  Would highly, highly recommend this product to everyone, gluten free or not!  I will never buy gluten free pasta again, my search is over.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pasta I Have Tried
review/text: Most of the time, going gluten-free because of a recent celiac diagnosis has been fairly easy to do. You just have to remember to be vigilant, ask a lot of questions and read all labels and ingredients lists. Realistically, who is going to actually MISS crappy fast food (most of which is loaded with gluten)?<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago after peppering my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant with questions about their gluten-free preparation methods, I decided to roll the dice and order a gluten-free pasta dish.<br /><br />Wow. It was so good, with the taste and consistency of regular semolina pasta, that I was extremely nervous that I had blown it. Needless to say, I was wrong and felt fine after enjoying the meal.<br /><br />After trying countless gluten-free pasta types and brands: rice, buckwheat, quinoa, corn, etc. etc... Le Veneziane is absolutely hands down THE best gluten-free pasta out there period. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The owner of the restaurant gave me some to take home and then the hunt was on to actually FIND some in a store. Then again, why bother when you can buy it by the case and get free 2-day shipping?

It comes from Italy and is a bit more expensive but well worth it. Love love love

review/summary: A big winner - tasty and ultra crunchy
review/text: Just tried these for the first time - and they're a very nice snacking cracker. There's nothing I can compare them to because they're just unique. Their texture is very different from a ritz type, or saltine type cracker. These nut-thins have a MAJOR crunch - a snappy crunch - hard crunch - but still not a problem to bite down and chew since they're very thin. If you break one in half, you'll hear a clear snap. The flavor comes through as pleasantly nutty. Not necessarily an over-abundance of almond flavor, because the almond seems subtle to me, but I think the toasty rice must be the nutty flavor I get. There's a hint of a buttery flavor - and just a pleasant bit of saltiness not too much.<br /><br />The ingredients list is fairly simple: Rice Flour, Almonds, Potato Starch, Salt, Expeller Pressed Safflower, Natural Almond Flavor, Butter Flavor (Contains Milk).<br /><br />Health aspects: As a lactose intolerant person, I can tell you the "contains milk" has been no issue for me personally in these nut-thins - I am not getting a lactose reaction. I suspect the "milk" is mostly butter, and butter is something I never have issues with anyway. I would guess this product has no more lactose than lactose free milk - as the grams of sugar are listed as zero on the package for a serving. (The gov lets them list zero if it is below .5 grams I believe). If you're more severely affected than I am by lactose - you may still want to proceed with caution.  As an ibs and acid reflux sufferer - I found this food totally neutral - no reactions - again this is my personal reaction. I'm not a doctor - so take that with a grain of salt. Also - the box notes this is a gluten free food - and the ingredients show no wheat.<br /><br />So far I've been munching them plain - and they're really nice. But I can see where any topping: cheese, cream cheese, ham, etc. would be super on them. I'll buy them again for sure.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I have recently discovered that I can't (scratch that - shouldn't) eat wheat. But I love wheat! Anyway, these nut thins have solved 2 problems for me. One, what is a wheat free person supposed to put cheese on? Two, why can't I find the perfect cheese cracker? They're always too salty, too crumbly, too buttery, too something.<br /><br />These things are fabulous. They are delicious on their own and have added the perfect little something to every cheese I've tried them with. You can bite them in half and not get covered in crumbs or you can spread a soft cheese on them and they won't break or crumble. Yet, as durable as they are, they are no struggle to chew.<br /><br />Yum! Thank you Blue Diamond. You have brought happy, crunchy snacking back to my life. :)

Needless to say, this is a great deal - two bucks a box with free shipping.  Can't go wrong here, since I recently saw (and yes, bought) these same crackers at the local grocery store for nearly four bucks.  Buy some, but make sure you leave some for me.

I first found them at a local store; when they sold out, the store disavowed any knowledge of ever having had them!  But here they are (they cost less from Amazon), arrived very quickly, and pleased everyone--gluten and gluten-free eaters alike.  Blue Diamond has a winner here.  And if you are gluten-free, a whole case is wonderful to have on hand.

This cracker has pushed those two treats from the top of my crunch list. You simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap, and the flavor is amazing. I like them with bean dip, guacamole, cheese spread--and with no topping at all, just plain. At only 8 calories per cracker, they also compare favorably to my mini pretzels, which are 5 calories each.<br /><br />Blue Diamond is known for nuts and products made with nuts, and they have two other nut flavors for these crackers besides almond, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H154WQ">pecan</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5FV2">hazelnut</a>.

They are nut and rice flour based, essentially, so they are thin, light, but with a nice crisp bite, and wonderful flavor.  The nut flavors of course go great with all the foods one would want a cracker for.  But they are equally great by themselves as a snack.  They are also satisfying and you feel good and healthy after eating them, not like you are dragging from eating junk snack food.

review/text: YUM. I love nut thins, but these are my third favorite of the bunch. My preference is to have the lightly salted nut thins or the cheddar cheese nut thins. I think these crackers are a little bit too salty. If you're looking for a potato chip replacement I would recommend this brand since their crackers are addictive, delicious, and crunchy. If you're into salt I would also recommend this specific flavor of nut thins. If you like to keep that salt down a little bit these probably aren't the best for you. Try to find the lightly salted, which I have not seen on amazon at a reasonable price.<br />PS: My friend uses her nut thins and dips them in hummus! I think they'd also be good with nacho cheese

review/text: In the glass jar were twelve peppers.  I de-stemed them and blended them, placing them in a small batch of chili.  Needless to say, it was HOT!  But, many returned at the chili cook-off to get more, even through they were sweating profusely!  We won!

review/summary: The real deal !!!
review/text: This is the real deal, the actual Habanero peppers, just the way you would buy them in Fredericksburg, Texas.  Those Habanero sauces do not come close in flavor to these peppers.<br /><br />And what a great price!  Let's keep this product a secret so the price does not go up.

review/text: I have celiac and I really miss my candy, especially twist.  I tried this product three times now and 1/3 times they were fresh.  I don't know why 2/3 times they some of them were hard.  And trust me I don't waste in finishing them once I get them.  I wish the owner would do a better job in quality control.  Overall they are a good product and really quick shipping.

review/summary: Not worth the price or the calories
review/text: I was delighted to find wheat free licorice on Amazon and ordered 3 kinds - the black and the raspberry from Candy Tree and a black licorice from another company.  The Candy Tree licorice is terrible.  The raspberry tastes vaguely like almost flavorless jam.  Unfortunately, nobody in the family liked it, so this ended up in the trash.

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious - Great snack for endo sufferers
review/text: I have endometriosis and am very sensitive to foods.  I love candy and can eat handfulls of these without consequences.  I can devor a package in a day.  I actually had to start pacing myself!  After eating these I will never go back to twizzlers... I wish I made more money so I could buy two boxes at a time! I reccomend this product for people who love candy but can't eat typical store brands because of food allergies and to parents who want a healthier alternative to store candy.  WARNING -- these candy's are SUPER addictive :)

review/summary: My son was not wild
review/text: I like these, but my son, who is the gluten-free one, did not.  I don't think it was the taste, I think it was that he did not like the texture.  He is only about three, and we were looking for new textures for him.  We now know that the licorice texture is not the way to go.  We will try it again in a few years.
