review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I confess I do not eat this granola from a bowl with milk, I keep it stored in an airtight container and use a shot glass to scoop out an ounce at a time for snacking.  Very easy to toss back using the shot glass and my fingers stay clean.  It is very good and has no bad ingredients.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: Not too crunchy and not overly sweet, but it is sweet. I like that the bag has a zip lock top to take it on the go. It is high in calories (220 for half a cup) but that's granola for you. Took it to the park with a large group of kids 5-10 yrs old and they went wild for this granola. I wish I had brought small cups to put it in since it has more of a cereal consistancy to it.

review/summary: Great snack!
review/text: I got this today, and it couldn't have come at a better time.  Every once in awhile I get a craving for chocolate, and today was that day.  I tore open the bag, and grabbed a handful.<br /><br />The granola itself is slightly sweet, with just a hint of saltiness.  Exactly how I like my granola, but the chocolate was the real surprise!  It was rich and melted in my mouth.  Not really the sweetness of milk chocolate, but not the bitterness of dark chocolate either, but a very nice in between.<br /><br />You get six 12 ounce packages for $21.57 or about $3.60 a bag.  That seems to be about the price for natural, organic cereals, so this is an average deal.  That said, I would certainly buy this for my family as a snack.  For me, it's too crunchy and the clusters are just a tad too big for a morning cereal.

review/summary: Simple & Decadent!
review/text: Very addictive stuff.  The day I bought this I almost finished off an entire bag in one sitting.  Whole grains, no artificial badness, luscious chocolate chunks, good stuff!  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find it overly sweet or chocolatey; I thought the granola and chocolate had a nice balance.  And I didn't feel "heavy" after eating it- I just felt happy!  One complaint: why not organic?  It's not cheap, and being organic seems like a no-brainer.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

review/text: This is a tasty product, however, it's got a tad too much sugar (and consequently calories) for my taste.  If I'm trying to eat healthy, I really do try to avoid eating things with a lot of added sugar.  Now, if I'm going to have a chocolate chip cookie, so be it.  I expect the sugar and carbs.  But, if I'm aiming to eat some granola, then I might just prefer it to be high in fiber, some added protein and a minimal amount of added sugar or otherwise useless carbs.<br /><br />The taste was good...don't get me wrong.  But, don't think this is some health food sorta thing cause it's not really that!

review/summary: Tasty chocolate, but not much else.
review/text: I found the actual granola part to be rather bland, though I did enjoy the crunchy texture. The chocolate part is delicious in contrast to the granola. They are little chunks of good quality dark chocolate. I eat it because I have it, but it's not something I would seek to purchase.<br /><br />The ingredients are mostly natural and consist of whole grains for extra fiber and nutrients. However, as with most granolas, there is a notable amount of fat (6g per 50g serving) and sugar (14g) and calories (210).<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS (SUGAR, CHOCOLATE LIQUEUR, DEXTROSE, COCOA BUTTER, SOY LECITHIN), BROWN RICE FLOUR, BROWN RICE SYRUP, EXPELLER PRESSED SAFFLOWER OIL, MOLASSES, VITAMIN E (A NATURAL VITAMIN TO HELP PRESERVE FLAVOR), NATURAL FLAVOR.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: This product is an alternative to eating granola bars. The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.<br /><br />This is very tasty, and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion. While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.<br /><br />Much as I like this, since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that I eat, and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion, for now I will stick with my granola bars. But if portion control is not a concern, then this is a great snack.

review/summary: Mmmmmm Chocolate
review/text: The back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola was better tasting than I had expected. The dark chocolate is delicious and the granola is good tasting too. It is a bit difficult to eat out of the bag because it is broken up fairly small. This is a good thing for younger kids, but as an adult I would like bigger clumps. It is a bit on the dry side, but what granola product isn't. There seems to be a nice mix of the granola to chocolate. I found a couple of large clumps of chocolate and claimed them as mine before anybody else in the house could get them. ;) It makes a nice, quick, snack. It would be nice to take on the go, but I wouldn't take it along if it was too warm because the chocolate would probably melt and make a mess. My 10 year old came along and grabbed a handful and a few minutes later came back and asked if they could have some more, so this passes the kid test with me.

review/summary: pleasant enough, but nothing exceptional
review/text: While I am enjoying eating the pouch of Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola that I received, I doubt I would order this product again.  The flavor of the chocolate pieces is not as intense as I would like (in terms of my chocolate consumption, I typically eat dark chocolate) and the granola itself is nothing extraordinary.  It's a little drier than many other granolas I've had -- not a bad thing once you put it in a bowl with some milk, but it makes snacking on it out of the bag a little more difficult since the granola pieces are so small.<br /><br />If I could rate this using half stars, I would probably give it 3 1/2.  Since that's not possible, I'll bump up my rating to 4 stars.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate and Granola - a winning Combo.
review/text: I like Granola, I like Chocolate but I have never mixed the two.  Until now.  I have found out that I also like Chocolate Granola. This is a crunchy granola with dark chocolate that is great as a snack right out of the bag or with milk as a breakfast cereal.  The chocolate seems to be a high quality dark (semi-sweet) chocolate that is a nice contrast to the sweet granola.  There is just enough chocolate flavor but it is not overwhelming.

review/summary: A surprisingly good product!
review/text: Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is a surprisingly good product.<br /><br />The granola portion is similar to some of the better granola products that I have had before - slightly crunchy, a bit chewy but not overly so, with a mild but pleasant taste of oats.  And though I wasn't sure that the taste of dark chocolate would go well with the granola, it does actually combine with the oats to make a great tasting snack food.  One interesting thing in the ingredients is the lack of honey - apparently Back to Nature uses cane juice instead.  I can't say that I notice any difference in taste because of this difference.<br /><br />The other thing that I noticed is that while not a "low-fat" food, it is lower in fat calories than similar products from other companies, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRKOIE">Bear Naked All-Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PVV7X8">Udi's Original Granola, 13-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>.  On the down side, this back to Nature product has a bit more sugar per serving than the other two products.<br /><br />While agreeing with other's criticism that the small bits make Chocolate Delight Granola a bit messy to eat by hand, it is still a great option as a snack food.  Even my wife (not a chocoholic) gives this product the thumbs-up.  Two thumbs up for me.

review/summary: Good Dark-Chocolatey Snack
review/text: I have tried Back to Nature products before and always been a little bit underwhelmed, but this product is pretty good.  The granola is not too sweet, which is perfect, and the dark chocolate chunks are great.<br /><br />I was also pleased by the amount of fiber and whole grains, though the product is also higher in fat (6g) and calories (220 per 1/2 cup).  Another plus, I could pronounce all of the ingredients.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bag contained mostly crumbles, so it may have been better eaten with a spoon than by hand.  I'm not sure if putting the snack in a box would have been any better at maintaining the larger clusters of snack or not.  (After all, my Kashi Go Lean Crunch cereal has nice clusters on the top and a bunch of tiny crumbles otherwise.)<br /><br />I could see taking this snack on a trip, as the bag size is not overwhelming and has a reclosable zipper top.

review/text: Finally a snack that "appears" healthy that I can get into!<br /><br />Although I find the chocolate not to be to my liking (it seems to be dark chocolate), it does add a strong enough flavor as to reduce the blandness of the granola.<br /><br />Don't be fooled however by the packaging.  While it may contain natural products, it's high in fat content, carbohydrates, sugars, etc. (1/2 cup equally about 4 points in the Weight Watchers program)<br /><br />If your not concerned about the health content but products use to produce, then this is a great product!

review/summary: Fine.  Pricey.
review/text: This is a fine product.  I think if it had more complexity of flavors, it might be worth the price.  But if this was something more than just an occasional treat, I'd recommend going to a health food store and buying bulk plain whole grain granola and adding dark chocolate chunks.<br /><br />That said, it is good.  The chocolate is tasty, with the granola and alone.  The kids like it, but I don't really want to give it to them because they get messy fingers from the chocolate.<br /><br />Instead of the little pieces of chocolate and the loose granola, I think this would have been better and less messy as clusters.  By the end of the bag, it was so broken up it needed to be eaten with a spoon.<br /><br />I wouldn't exactly call this "healthy" just because of the nature of granola and chocolate, but it is refreshing not to have it filled with junk and preservatives.  Back to Nature products are generally reliable about that.  I think it alternate flavors, I might be more enamored with this product.

review/summary: Yummy with a bit of sinful delight!
review/text: Ordered these because I mistakenly thought they were granola "bars" but am pleasantly surprised with this "plain" old granola.  What saves this from being just "plain" old granola is the semi-sweet dark chocolate chunks.  If you enjoy dark chocolate then you will love the taste that combines with the granola clusters.<br /><br />I love to munch on it while watching television.  My 6 year old also loves having a little baggie as a healthy snack.  Very tasty, high quality steel cut oats that is sweetened with only natural ingredients.<br /><br />For any individuals with allergies the product contains soy and milk and is manufactured on equipment that processes wheat.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product and even more so because it provides 28g of whole grain in a 1/2 cup serving.  Awesome!

review/summary: It's chocolatey!
review/text: Back To Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola is so chocolatey it was almost too much for me. I definitely prefer it as a snack, not a breakfast food, it was just too sweet for breakfast. The good thing is, the sweetness and the chocolate meant I didn't need a very big serving to satisfy my sweet tooth. I tried it both as a traditional cereal with milk as well as out of hand as a snack. I think I enjoyed having a handful for a snack the best. It's your basic granola of sweetened oat clusters plus chunks of semi-sweet chocolate. The cereal must have a dusting of cocoa on it too since the milk turned kind of chocolatey when poured over it.<br /><br />Marketed as delicious, simple and wholesome (which it may well be) one should not get the idea that it's either low fat or low calorie. A 1/2 cup serving is 220 calories and 6 grams of total fat (2 grams of saturated fat) and mostly sweetened with "evaporated cane juice" (um, that's essentially sugar with a euphemistic name and some trace minerals) so it still needs to remain in the "treat" category.

review/text: I really enjoyed the taste and texture of the Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola.  The granola clusters are good and not overly sweet and the chocolate is more a hint than an overpowering ingredient.  I'm not sure that I would eat this for breakfast (it feels a bit decadent with 1/2 cup for 200 calories), but it's the perfect treat for an afternoon snack or in place of desert.  If your watching calories, carefully measure your portions as this is so tasty that it'd be easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting.<br /><br />The only fault I found with this product was that some of the chocolate in the sample I received was melted and stuck to the sides of the bag, making it a bit messy if you're an "eat from the bag" granola consumer like my husband.<br /><br />A tasty treat - would definitely recommend!

review/summary: Pretty generic chocolate granola...
review/text: Plain and simple, this is pretty generic tasting granola. I've had tons of different types/brands of granola and this one ranks right in the middle of the pack.<br /><br />The chocolate isn't sweet, which is perfect. Milk chocolate in granola just doesn't stand up to the hearty/nutty taste of the oats and grains. The chocolate came melted in my bag (go figure...), so I just tossed it in the freezer and the chocolate pieces firmed right up.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty tasty treat just that for the price I'll stick to my plain granola and adding my own dark or semi sweat chocolate pieces to it. Tastes the same if not better then this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No additives/preservatives.<br />Quality ingredients.<br />Chocolate isn't super sweet (which I think is a pro, some might see it as a con).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price.<br />Is pretty generic tasting, nothing extraordinary.<br />High in calories, but what granola isn't?

They used cane juice, brown rice syrup, and molasses as sweeteners.<br /><br />Chocolate Chunks: I love chocolate and can be a little picky about it. This is very good quality chocolate. This surprised me. It is not too sweet and has just a touch of nutty bitterness to make the flavor linger without being offensive to those who like a more mellow chocolate.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is for the folks who don't like the chocolate to be so strong. The flavor really lingers. I love that. Some folks may not. And, some may not see it as breakfast food. Even so it will make an awesome snack.

As soon as I popped the bag open, and took a whiff of the content, I could tell that this granola was very fresh and going to be delicious.  I was certainly right; the first thing I did was pour some into my hand.  The rolled granola held together tightly and there were large chunks of chocolate mixed in.  I put the handful in my mouth and ate it dry, very good!  The granola has a very natural taste it, and was absolutely delicious.  The sweetness of the chocolate enhanced it and made for a very pleasant experience.  Next I poured some into a cup with some nice cold milk and took a spoonful, again delicious.  This granola can be eaten as a snack, a cereal or a dessert, amazingly versatile and just as tasty to boot.

review/summary: Is it a snack or breakfast cereal?
review/text: When I ordered this from Amazon the description said "heavenly snack" so I had it sent to the office instead of home (the kids might make short work of it at home and I'd never see it).  But rather than being like "clusters" of granola it looks more like the Sweet Home brand of granola CEREAL we buy from the grocery store - except for those chocolate chunks.  But I tried it and it's pretty good, except there's so many little pieces and try as I might, it ended up getting all over my desk and lap.  The taste is fine but it's a bit messy, so I figured it must not be a snack.<br /><br />I took it home and tried it for breakfast.  It's not bad but I'm not used to eating cereal with chunks of chocolate (and I'm a big chocolate fan, dark chocolate, too - I even love chocolate chip bagels).  My 6 year old daughter, who loves granola cereal and almost always has it for breakfast, took one look at the chocolate chunks and declined.<br /><br />So I'm not quite sure what this product is: snack or cereal.  It's too messy for a snack but the chocolate is a bit much for cereal (to my taste anyway).  Calories are higher than the Sweet Home brand of cereal we usually buy (220 vs 200 for a half cup serving - the Sweet Home brand uses honey and almonds) but calories from fat were lower (50 compared to 60).  It's okay but I'll stick with the grocery store brand.

Containing whole grain rolled oats and dark chocolate chunks, CHOCOLATE DELIGHT GRANOLA is an extremely pleasing blend of crunchy and sweet.  This cereal is chock full of chocolaty goodness and will satisfy any chocolate-lover's sweet tooth.  The crunch holds up extremely well, even in milk.  I had a bowl (at the recommended serving size) this morning for breakfast, and found it to be quite filling, as well as delicious.<br /><br />I also gave a bowl of CHOCOLATE DELIGHT GRANOLA to my 4 year old daughter.  "Mommy," she said, "this tastes like chocolate chip cookies!  Chocolate chip cookies cereal!"  She dove right in, and finished the entire bowl.  High praise coming from a picky eater.  And I have the comfort of knowing that it is made from all natural ingredients and doesn't contain artificial flavors, trans fat, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, cholesterol, or high fructose corn syrup.  BACK TO NATURE CHOCOLATE DELIGHT GRANOLA is also an excellent source of whole grains and fiber, something we could all use more of.<br /><br />I have to say, I agree with what it says on the bag.  BACK TO NATURE CHOCOLATE DELIGHT GRANOLA is simple ingredients, simply delicious, and simply good.  Surprisingly so.

review/text: With granola, it's usually a trade-off between taste and health, and Back to Nature Chocolate Delight is no exception, delivering only moderately on both counts.<br /><br />By using different kinds of sugars, the ingredient label looks better, but added up, it's still a lot of sugar.  With 13g of sugar per 50g (1/2 cup), this granola is almost one-fourth sugar:  evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, molasses, sugar, and dextrose.  Back to Nature isn't the worst in this regard, but if you want to minimize your sugar intake (and everyone should, of course), be aware of what you're eating.<br /><br />The fat content is also moderate for a granola, 6g in the form of safflower oil.<br /><br />The taste is okay; I didn't find it to be outstanding.  And the granola pieces are extremely hard and overly crunchy (which I didn't like).  However, my eight-year-old daughter loved this granola and would be delighted if I got it all the time (the chocolate chips, though not particularly tasty, in my opinion, were a big hit with her).<br /><br />This granola is worth trying if it sounds like it might suit your preferences, but try to get a single pack of it from a local store to try before committing to a big multipack.

review/summary: Good but too sweet for cereal
review/text: I have always loved granola cereal and I have always loved chocolate so putting the two together seemed like a dream!  I have to admit, I like this but it is much too sweet for my breakfast desires.  Granola alone is sweet so adding chocolate would obviously make it even sweeter.  However, I was surprised at just how sweet it was.  I could not eat it as cereal.  Instead, I used a handful to manage the occasional sweet urge.  While good, I am not sure it is worth the price.  It would be cheaper and equally as good to add chocolate chips to plain granola if desired.  While I enjoyed this as a sweet snack, I will not be purchasing it in the future.

review/summary: Tasty, but...
review/text: Overall, I like the way this granola tastes. It has a good ratio of granola-to-chocolate, and the chocolate tastes good. It doesn't taste cheap, and it's not too sweet.<br /><br />Unfortunately it melts pretty quickly to the touch, so this can be a messy to eat with your hands. (It's worth pointing out that the bag was in a hot car before I tried some, but I still had this problem even after it cooled to room temperature.)<br /><br />The granola itself is a bit dry, unlike more honey coated brands, and the pieces don't stick together that well. So, after the big chunks are gone, you're left with lots of tiny bits that are messy to pick up. I suppose this wouldn't be a problem if you like your granola in cereal or yogurt, instead of trail mix.<br /><br />Even though it's healthy, I wouldn't recommend this product (or any granola) for mindless snacking. Just 1/2 a cup contains 220 calories, which in my opinion is a lot for a snack. On the plus side, it's great for a hiking food or a quick pick-me-up.

review/summary: They should call it Brownie Granola
review/text: The chocolate in it is that good.  Most of the time when you get granola or trail mix with chocolate, it is cheap-tasting milk chocolate bits.  Along with that, the chocolate is decent sized, no mini morsels, nice little chunks of dark chocolate.  The granola is pretty good, too.  It gets a little lost in the taste of the chocolate.  Its great the way it is, but I would love it if they made this with almonds or nuts of some sort in it and it would be the ultimate snack.  This is going to go by the handful, no yogurt topping for this stuff.  Although, ice cream would be amazing...yum

review/summary: Chocolate for Breakfast
review/text: I'm a big proponent of eating chocolate for breakfast...or any other time.  Let's face it, chocolate is sooo delicious and has some health benefits too.  It's a mystery why there aren't more chocolate filled breakfast cereals.  Well thankfully, Back to Nature Chocolate Delights Granola fits the bill to a T, whatever that means.<br /><br />This cereal has the exact balance of granola, chocolate and sugar that I've always dreamed of.  Plus, you won't find any yucky corn syrup.  The ingredients are all top notch (though I would have preferred more molasses and less evaporated cane sugar).  The chocolate chunks are outstanding.  They are the perfect shape and size and melt in your mouth, not in the bowl.  This is the first chocolate cereals I've seen that doesn't turn your milk brown!  I was blown away.<br /><br />As I said, the cereal is balanced, so it's not too sweet for breakfast.  It will likely appeal to the more refined adult chocolate lover as well as any kid.  I had only two gripes - (1) the granola is a little too loose with little pieces to eat easily straight out of the bag.  (2) it has a moderate to high sog factor when left in milk.

review/summary: Chocolate Delight? Sounds just right!
review/text: After trying Back to Nature's cereal and being completely satisfied, I decided to see what their snack food held in store for me.<br /><br />Now I know: it's a bunch of chocolate and granola goodness!<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />The bag was taunting me from the get-go, the transparent leaf showed all the oats and chocolate - like it was just waiting for me to start eating!<br /><br />On the back, there's the mission statement of Back to Nature - they make a point to mention that this snack doesn't have any artificial preservatives, colors or flavors.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:<br /><br />There was no shortage of chocolate chunks or granola in the bag. According to the Nutrition Facts, there were seven servings...I had to work very hard to limit myself to just one serving for the review! I was quite pleased to see the bag was reseal-able - nothing like a longer shelf life for those future snack fests!<br /><br />In one serving there are about 220 calories. No trans fat, 2g of saturated fat, no cholesterol, and the sodium comes in quite low at 5mg. If you need carbohydrates, there's 37g per serving, so look no further.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />Back to Nature has done it again...this is absolutely DELECTABLE. Amazon sells these in 6-packs and the price is right! The chocolate chunks are very sweet and tasty, and the granola is a perfect match.<br /><br />My sweet tooth and his 31 neighbors agree - if you're looking for snacks without the additives, Back to Nature is the way to go.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Good trail snack or TV snack
review/text: My girlfriend complained that the packaging didn't open the way it should have and she needed to use a scissors, but other than that, we both enjoyed the fresh-tasting snack made with natural ingredients. The mix is of course loaded with carbs, which could be a good thing (trail) or bad (TV) depending. The taste and amount of the semi-sweet chocolate chips is probably what sets this apart from other granoloa snacks, so if you like the idea of chocolate in your crunchy granola, then get it. Oh..it's also great mixed with yogurt, keeping its crunch throughout.

review/summary: Maybe not the healthiest snack....but sure tastes great!
review/text: I am definitely a chocolate lover, and fond of granola as a cereal so thought I'd try a bag of this, even though it isn't necessarily meant as a cereal. I think it would be a bit hard to eat as a snack, as the granola is fairly crumbly and not in large chunks. The chocolate as well is separate from the granola so hard to just eat from the bag. As a cereal, it tastes amazing! I probably would have liked a little *less* chocolate just so I didn't feel so much like I was eating candy, but I can't fault the taste at all, it really had a great blend of granola crunch, a bit of sweetness, and that semi-sweet chocolate taste that blended perfectly. Definitely not something I would eat everyday, but for a mid-day snack with milk, I really loved it.

review/summary: Tasty and with good quality ingredients.
review/text: I do have a soft spot for chocolate, but I like something a little more sophisticated than, say cocoa puffs, not to mention a little more nutritious.  I've tried Special K Chocolatey Delight, which I liked, but I have this habit of occasionally checking the nutrition facts. I found out why they call it "chocolatey" rather than "chocolate."  The bits in the Special K are mostly sugar and partially hydrogenated oil.  That cereal is also sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and preserved with BHT.  It has some other added vitamins, but I don't really understand the benefit of adding those to cereal vs. just taking a supplement if needed, or better yet eating more foods that contain them naturally.<br />In comparison, I see that this granola has "real" chocolate chunks, is sweetened with evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, contains no trans-fatty acids, and uses only vitamin E as a preservative.  It also has 4g fiber per serving, vs. 1g.  That doesn't magically turn it into health food, in fact this granola has more total sugar and fat per serving that the Special K, but given the choice between the two it still clearly wins on ingredient quality.<br />As for the taste, I like it.  It's simple, without too much going on, and it's sweet enough to satisfy the sweet tooth without going overboard.  The amount of chocolate is just about right as well; enough to find some in most every bite.<br />Overall I'd say it's a pretty good choice to stifle a morning chocolate craving as long as you stick to a reasonably sized serving.  I'll almost certainly be getting some more, especially if I find it on sale.

review/summary: Very Yummy, Hardly Healthy
review/text: Given the "Back to Nature" brand and the marketing material printed all over this package, you would think you were eating health food.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Sure, it has lots of whole grains and no artificial ingredients, but this is a high calorie, high fat food.  Admittedly, it is incredibly yummy, and my wife and I struggled to stay out of the bag.  Since my wife has a nut allergy, we were happy to find that this granola is free of nuts and is NOT produced in a facility that also processes nuts.  If taste were the only criteria, this granola would get 5 stars.  However, as granola, I believe it ought to be a little healthier.  In my mind, this is a great alternative to junk food, but it isn't for the extremely health conscious consumer.

review/summary: Coco-Puffs for hippie kids...
review/text: "Quaker" is to granola is what "Kleenex" is to facial tissue. Quaker granola tastes so good that it's almost impossible to stop eating it. In the marketplace, it's the 800-pound gorilla of granolas.<br /><br />"Back to Nature" granola is, by comparison, bland. It doesn't taste bad, it just isn't very exciting. The (good-tasting) chocolate bits don't help. If anything, they distract from the taste of the granola.<br /><br />And it's expensive. If you want chocolate on your granola, just throw some bittersweet morsels on it.<br /><br />I can imagine a cartoon commercial for this product, with tie-dyed teens chanting its praises. ("CHOC-late-bits granola -- yum yum yum") What's next -- sugar-frosted acid flakes?

review/summary: So-So
review/text: I would caution anyone ordering this to realize that the chocolate melts in warm temperatures.  Mine arrived in a chocolate coated bag.  I put it in the fridge to try to solidify it a bit, but it wasn't a big improvement.  Makes it hard to eat out of the bag.  I really didn't want a chocolate flavored cereal, so I was planning on enjoying this as an eat out of the bag snack, but the melted chocolate makes it messy.  The chunks are an okay size for that, but it would probably work better as a cereal since the chocolate melted.<br /><br />When I purchase granola, I usually look for ones with either almonds or pecans.  This has neither. The only solids listed in the ingredients are whole grain rolled oats and chocolate chunks (first 2 ingredients). The rest of the ingredients are predominately sweeteners.  A serving is 1/2 cup and that has 220 calories, 50 of which are from fat.  There are 4g of fiber, 13g of sugar, 20g of other carbohydrates, and 5g of protein.  Just because something is "natural" doesn't mean it is good for you.

review/summary: Tasty and crunchy but could be improved.
review/text: I can't really add too much to the other reviews; I received the product yesterday, and immediately tore into the bag.  From the first mouthful, it was clear this is a tasty product.  As someone who likes granola anyway, and who is a chocoholic (especially dark chocolate), it was a winner.  The only real complaint (and it's a minor one) is the fact that it's too crumbly.  As someone else noted, bigger chunks would be an improvement.  It was a bit difficult to scoop out without dropping some (although my cats liked to pounce on the pieces as they hit the floor).  Given this, it probably is better served being added to yogurt or sprinkled on fruit.  All in all, this is a really good product.

review/summary: Tasty & Crunchy with a good balance of chocolate to cereal but a bit crumbly
review/text: Like most Back to Nature products, this is every bit as tasty as it sounds from the description.  The Granola has a nice crunch to it and the dark chocolate tastes rich and decadent. I'd give it five stars if the product weren't so darn crumbly.  Other reviewers have stated that would have liked to see this product produced more as crunchy large clusters and I agree with them.  Over half the bag was reduced to single oat pieces and crumbles of chocolate buy the time it reached me.  That may be a result of the packaging choice to put it in a pouch rather than a box.  it's hard to tell.<br /><br />Even so, the crumbly nature didn't alter my enjoyment of the product too much.  It goes nicely into vanilla yogurt as a stir -in and works equally well straight out of the bag as a snack.  My husband told me he thought the molasses used as a sweetener stood out a bit too much but I didn't think so.  The product is a little on the sweet side but certainly not as sweet as most cereals available today.<br /><br />Highly recommended item but buy with Auto-ship to get the best possible price.

review/text: I love the granola taste and the touch of chocolate is just right.  It would have been nice if it came out in clumps but at least the bag we received was evenly distributed.  That is nice for cereal but not ideal for granola.<br /><br />But that is a minor issue easily solved by pouring out what I wanted into a bowl rather than eating from the bag.  Doing the latter gets kind of messy.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: When I saw all those chocolate chunks in Back To Natures Granola I got a little too excited.  I love me some chocolate and when it is in granola I can only imagine the orgasmic experience in my mouth.  I am sad to report that no orgasmic experience was to be had.  Upon first bite I noticed a great crunch but the flavor of the granola by itself almost had a raw taste to it, like a raw flour/oat taste and it was very off putting. Not at all sweet and that could be a plus for someone who is trying to not eat too much sugar but I need my granola to have some sort of sweetness to it which this granola did not have.  I had some of the chocolate in the mix and that by itself was very delicious but not worth the cost of the granola, will just get a chocolate bar.  I much prefer the Love Crunch Granola By Natures Path, that is absolutly scrumptious and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor and pieces along with freeze dried berries, plus it is all organic.  So if you are looking for a nice flavorful granola that has nice chocolate goodness look elsewhere because you will not get that with this granola.

review/text: I normally don't buy these products...but when I do, unfortunately I don't know when to stop consuming them.<br />I love chocolate, but not granola.  However, the combination makes for an interesting taste.  The sweetness of the chocolate is offset by the granola.<br />The way this product comes, are you supposed to eat it out of the bag as a snack, or put it in a bowl like cereal?  Here is where a chocolate/granola bar would be better. With the bag, you open it, and eat and eat until you ate too much.  A wrapped bar is a finite portion.<br />Would I buy this again? I wish I didn't have to buy a 6 pack.  One pouch would suffice..for both my wallet and my waist.

review/summary: A look at the ingredients -- I'll stick with muesli
review/text: I'm a muesli eater who tries a granola every once in a while to see if I've changed my mind and decided I like it any better. Like other granolas, this one did not convince me to switch. My basic gripe about granolas is that they get that crunchiness from sugars. That's true here as well, although the sugars have fancier names -- plus you have chocolate added.<br /><br />The ingredients of this product are as follows: whole grain rolled oats, semi-sweet chocolate chunks (chocolate, sugar, dextrose, cocoa butter, etc), evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, brown rice flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, molasses, vitamin E (to preserve flavor), natural flavor.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, but since I really enjoy muesli more anyway, I guess I still don't see much of a reason to switch to granola. I'm glad I tried this product, but it seemed pretty much like a typical granola to me.<br /><br />If you want a chocolaty granola, this could be a great product for you.

All there is to say, is this: Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is pretty tasty and made a good munching treat.<br /><br />The chocolate bits in it aren't high quality confection, but they're better than, say, the waxy chocolate bits you might normally get in a grocery-aisle chocolate chip granola bar. The wheat and such comes in small, flaky bits (I might have preferred slightly larger nuggets), and it's very dusty, so keep a dry towel on hand.  I also appreciated that it came in a resealable bag, so I could just keep in in a drawer at my work desk without needing a separate container.

review/summary: My wife's favorite, but second place for me
review/text: First off, I must say that my wife absolutely feel in LOVE with this granola. I almost didn't get to have a taste of our first bag before it was gone! She would easily rate it 5 stars, but needless to say I have my own opinion.<br /><br />Being a bit of a chocolate granola snob, I have to compare the flavor and texture of this granola to that of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAMK5O">KASHI COCOA BEACH GRANOLA</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZ9R3O">Cascadian Farm Cereal, Dark Chocolate Almond, Organic, 13.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, my long-time favorite. I have enjoyed all three as both a snack and a meal, usually with milk.<br /><br />Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is more enjoyable than the Kashi as both a snack or as a meal. The flavor of the Kashi can be a bit too generic, and this granola just tastes healthier and more natural. As a snack, my only complaint is the amount of small bits that are hard to snack on. Perhaps my wife got all the large morsels before she let me have a taste, but I do feel there should be more uniformity for best enjoyment. This is not as important in a bowl, of course.<br /><br />I enjoyed a medium sized bowl with milk, but this is where the Cascadian Farms granola takes it a step further. I ALWAYS want a second bowl of Cascadian Farms because it just tastes so good, but here I didn't find myself going back for more. While this does lead me to rate this granola just below my personal favorite, it might be a positive point as others trying to lose weight (such as myself) are less likely to give in to the urge for "just one more bowl".

I did like the taste, but it got pretty soft in the milk, except for those plentiful chocolate chunks. When mixed with milk you need something with the granola they used to perk it up and that's where the chocolate comes in.

review/summary: Simple Natural Goodness
review/text: Sometimes a food doesn't have to be complicated to be good.<br /><br />When I saw this granola only had sweetened oats and chocolate chunks, my first thought was "that sounds boring."  But after I got the first handful in my mouth, I changed my mind completely.  Two tastes bouncing off each other perfectly, with the added bonus of no artificial ingredients.  A great healthy snack.

review/summary: WOW!!!  This stuff is GREAT!!!
review/text: My title says it all.  I thoroughly enjoyed this "Chocolate Delight" granola -- as did my wife and my oldest daughter.  It's not too sweet (a problem with many granola products) and the small chunks of dark chocolate were perfect.  I have to admit -- my sample bag didn't last very long!  (The last portion topped my dish of vanilla ice cream last night!)<br /><br />Very highly recommended!!!

review/summary: Tasty Crunchies for your Munchies
review/text: I liked this product, for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />One is it's all natural. We get no preservatives, or corn syrup processed in any of it's many incarnations. We get oats, and chocolate. And who doesn't think chocolate should be one of the major food groups?? It's dark chocolate to boot, so not full of sugar and sweeteners that we don't need.<br /><br />The other reason I like it is that it isn't too sweet. It's definitely not a cheap bag of 'trailmix' from those major stores that's full of candy, dried sugar covered fruit mixed in with some nuts and oats perhaps. The only sweeteners I could find on the label were molasses, evaporated cane juice, and brown rice syrup. The semi sweet dark chocolate has some sugar in it, but that's ok, sugar is natural, as long as you don't make it one of the primary ingredients.<br /><br />A nice healthy and tasty snack food, that's what you'll find here. I don't think the kids will be too disappointed in the taste, it does have chocolate after all.

review/summary: Made ME drink the milk
review/text: I don't usually use a lot of milk in my cereal because I don't want to waste it (it goes to the cat--I know, bad cat owner!) I haven't drained the milk from a bowl of cereal since I outgrew Cookie Crisp (mmm. Cookie Crisp)...this was so good I drank it all.<br /><br />First the con and the reason for the four instead of five star review: price. 12 oz. for 3.60 (plus shipping on Amazon) or 3.79 in my grocery is out of line. Comparable products offer 17 or 18 oz. for the same or a slightly lower price. So Kraft (and yes, it's a Kraft product) lower the price to get another star.<br /><br />The rest is all pro. The mouth feel is perfect; as the uploader of the customer photo states, not big bad chunks. Nice and crunchy in cold milk. The flavour is fantastic. DARK chocolate...not milk. Yum. Plus just the right amount of little choc pieces. Others criticised the Summer Berry Blend variety for being too sweet (others too tart,) but I found it and this just right on the sweetness scale.<br /><br />4g of fiber, low sodium, 5g of protein...and a couple vitamins all natural. No HFCS, no Sucralose or Aspartame so your liver and brain don't need to fear it either!<br /><br />Notice I didn't mention the calories...220 in a "serving" welll, a 1/2 cup serving size is a wee bit unrealistic. I measured it out and it's about five bites. A cup was good for a light breakfast...so 440 calories about the same as a bagel...not for weight watchers--but an excellent treat!

review/summary: Quite possibly my new favorite food
review/text: Who doesn't love granola?  Adding dark chocolate to it is possibly the best thing a chocolate lover could imagine although you must use caution in eating this because it is definitely a snack.  Granola always has fat and of course chocolate does too, but it is a good alternative to a candy bar.  It has more nutritional value since it does contain whole grain and several vitamins and minerals.  The flavor is as satisfying as a candy bar and granola is pleasing as a snack because it is easy to munch on.  Overall A+!<br /><br />The pros:<br />~The flavor is amazing!  I loved it!  It reminded me of a candy bar but more satisfying.<br />~It is easy to munch on making it great for a snack.  It is packaged in a reselable plastic bag.<br />~It is more nutritious than many snack foods on the market.  It has quite a bit of fiber in addition to other beneficial vitamins and minerals making it more nutritious than many "junk" foods.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-The chocolate melted a little during shipping. Although it wasn't completely melted, some of the chocolate melted before I opened it.<br />-Granola still contains fat no matter how you cut it.  Although more nutritious than many things, this granola contains 6g of fat per serving.<br />-The bags are hard to open.  The tear here strip resulted in me searching for a pair of scissors to actually open the position.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great choclately snack, you will love Chocolate Delight Granala from Back to Nature.

review/summary: Delicious with a capital "D"...but Expensive wtih a capital "E"
review/text: The good folks at "Back to NATURE" have put together an absolutely scrumptious granola offering.  It's so good that you can sit there with the open bag and snack on it handful after handful.  The granola is heavily punctuated with chunks of real dark chocolate.<br /><br />I wanted to try more of this before it was gone, but before I knew it my family had discovered and devoured the entire bag...and that's a good sign!<br /><br />I could also see adding nuts, perhaps almonds or cashews, maybe some M&Ms, and before you know it you'll have a super-fantastic trail mix...good for hiking or camping.  It's the sort of thing you could send out the door with your teenagers and be happy knowing that they are getting something that is good, and good for them.<br /><br />At the same time, this treat may deserve to be stashed away in your secret place for those times when you need something great for yourself.  Perhaps this granola is too good for kids to wolf down before they realize what they had.  You'll have to make the call on this one :-)<br /><br />Now why doesn't this product get 5-stars, with all that glowing praise?<br /><br />It's like this...this granola is pricey, pricey, and expensive!!!  That's the only reason this product misses out on the 5-star mark (at least for me).  Again, only you can judge whether your budget can handle an item like this.<br /><br />"Back to NATURE", thanks for a great tasty treat!

review/summary: tasty, but not healthy
review/text: I love granola...in both bar and crumbled form.  So I jumped at the chance to try this Chocolate Delight Granola.  Long story short, it tastes great.  If you like chocolate and granola, you'll like this (that isn't really saying much is it).<br /><br />However, my major problem with granola of any kind is that it isn't particularly healthy.  Don't get me wrong...it isn't like going out and eating some lard enriched southern breakfast.  But it isn't very low on the calories either.  A single serving of this stuff is about 200 calories...and there are 8 servings per bag.  I don't know about any of you, but 1.5 ounces of tasty granola isn't going to be enough for me :)...especially since it comes in large pouch form.  Suffice it to say that this bag lasted me two morning drives to work...and 800 calories a morning is just a bit too much for me :/

review/summary: Crunchy, chocolatey, not bad at all
review/text: I had doubts about this cereal.  I don't like super-sweet cereals, and I haven't cared for chocolate breakfast food since I got over the Cocoa Krispies craze of my youth.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the chocolate flavor, while definitely present, is not overwhelming, and the sweetness level is tolerable.  Best of all, it reminded me why I used to like Cocoa Krispies - it left the same chocolate milk in my bowl at the end!<br /><br />I compared Chocolate Delight to Post Bran Flakes, a cereal that was recently named a "Best Bite" by Nutrition Action Newsletter.  Both are made primarily of whole grains (oats in the case of the granola, wheat in the bran flakes).  Both contain sweeteners, and as one would expect, the chocolate granola contains more sweetener because it includes chocolate chips.  The flakes have 5 g of fiber in a half-cup serving; the granola, 4.  The bran flakes have much more sodium - 220 mg compared to 5 mg in the granola.  The granola has more carbs (again, the chocolate), but also more protein, 5 g to the flakes' 3 g.  The bran flakes have significantly more vitamin A and iron, but the granola has more calcium (although only 2% of the RDA, not counting any milk added).<br /><br />There is a whopping difference in calories:  for half-cup servings, 100 calories for the bran flakes, 220 calories for the granola.  But hey, no one thinks they can eat chocolate for free, do they?<br /><br />The granola is also more expensive, 30 cents per ounce (assuming Amazon's price and super-saver shipping), 24 cents for the bran flakes (purchased at a non-sale price at a grocery store).  I'm not sure that's a significant difference, though, as most sweetened cereals cost more than unsweetened (it's also debatable whether the bran flakes can be considered "unsweetened," since they contain both sugar and corn syrup).<br /><br />Both cereals are crisp in milk, the granola more so because of its crunchy granola clusters, and the granola maintains its crunch, a plus if you like to dawdle over your breakfast bowl.  I don't tend to eat dry cereal as a snack, but if I did, the granola would certainly be the hands-down winner there.  All in all, I was much more satisfied with Chocolate Delight than I expected to be, and if your taste runs to chocolate for breakfast or granola for snacks, it's worth trying.  (If you like it a lot, note the discount for automatic shipping.)

review/text: This Chocolate Delight Granola is absolutely scrumptious and the main ingredients are whole grain rolled oats and semi-sweet chocolate chunks.<br /><br />To me this is a five-star product. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is a calorie dense product since you really need a one-cup serving to be satisfied and that's 440 calories. There are seven half cup servings per package at 220 calories each (50 fat calories).  However, for me this is not enough breakfast or snack per serving so I was only able to get three servings out of the package.

review/text: This is a good granola.  Some other granolas seem very dry and hard to eat, but this stuff has a nice consistency and the bits of chocolate are just enough to give it a little pop of flavor.  The ingredients are pretty good and simple, with whole grain rolled oats and chocolate chunks as the main ingredients and then a few sweeteners and other stuff to hold it all together.  It also has 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber per serving, so it's pretty filling.  If your looking to try a new granola and like chocolate but don't want a bunch of extra stuff in your food, this is a good choice.

Well, even if I had thought of it, I would not have done as good a job as Back To Nature did with the combination.

review/text: If you liked Cookie Crisp cereal as a kid, you'll probably love Back to Nature Chocolate Delight granola as an adult. Yes, the thought of eating chocolate for breakfast might make some people's stomachs turn, but this product is anything but unappetizing. Tasty, not-too-sweet chocolate chunks accent but don't dominate this granola, which - quite fortunately - isn't heavily sweetened otherwise. It's fairly filling and doesn't leave that oily feeling in your mouth that some granolas do. Folks who prefer really toasty oats in their granola might be a little disappointed; this isn't the crunchiest cereal in the breakfast aisle. But for a yummy, healthy breakfast - or, maybe even better, a snack - this granola is worth a try.

review/text: I saw another review that warned against buying this product from Amazon if you live in a hot climate.  I would concur!  My weather is pretty close to what you'd find in Las Vegas and the chocolate had melted all over the place.  I think that was actually nice for what got stuck on the food but a lot of it stuck to the bag and was uneaten chocolate.  In some cultures, uneaten chocolate is one of the seven deadly sins.  So beware!<br /><br />Otherwise, this tasted pretty good.  If you love Granola, you can't go wrong by adding some chocolate to it.  It was a little hard for trail mix but it makes a good breakfast.  I'd say the only ones who shouldn't have this are those who do not like dark chocolate.  If you prefer milk chocolate than this product isn't for you.

review/summary: Only one complaint: Not Uniform
review/text: Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is a great product, but it could be better.  Specifically, the granola did not have uniform clusters of chocolate.  Some clusters were large and had adequate chocolate coating while others were small and had little or no coating of chocolate.  Because of this I gave the product one less star than I would have had the product been more uniform.  That said the product was otherwise great!  For granola lovers (or even those who don't regularly consume granola) the addition of chocolate is quite clever and actually changes the expected taste and texture of granola.  I decided to try sprinkling the product over top some vanilla ice cream and couldn't believe the wonderful experience.  Adding some walnuts and a little extra Hershey's dark chocolate syrup was incredible.  You can of coarse consume the product straight from the bag, but if you want to stretch the product out over a number of weeks I would recommend using the chocolate granola as a topping of sorts on your favorite desert.  I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Only one star taken off for not putting the word "snack" on the packaging and the clusters being too small.
review/text: CLUSTERS: If you're going to call them clusters they should be only a bit smaller than popped corn kernels.  These clusters are so small that you couldn't even call them that if this was cereal.  What we've really got here is a granola cereal with bits of chocolate in it to be eaten a pinch at a time.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE CHUNKS: Looking at the granola through the window in the packaging you would think you could hardly taste the chocolate, like when you're eating Chips A'Hoy and somehow get a cookie that only has a couple of chips in it, but you actually taste plenty of chocolate in every bite.  It's very good, not too sweet, and very chocolatey without murdering the taste of the granola--which is also delicious.<br /><br />WHOLE GRAIN: There are two main reasons why whole grain is good.  First, it's more filling; one sandwich made with whole grain bread is as filling as two sandwiches on white bread for example.  You simply wont feel the need to keep stuffing yourself and that will reduce your total calorie intake by hundreds of calories per day if you have whole grain snacks like this one in addition to whole grains in your meals. The other is that whole grains range from tougher to impossible to metabolize, so your body works harder, burning more calories trying to do that (calcium does this too by the way, so it's a good idea to take a swig of milk with your whole grain snack).<br /><br />One added feature of whole grain is that it adds volume to your stool, so make sure to have that plunger at the ready if you're suddenly adding whole grain foods to your diet.<br /><br />PACKAGING: If I saw this on the shelf in the supermarket I would assume it's a cereal to put milk into or to top yogurt with.  Whomever designed the packaging and omitted the word 'snack' should be flogged.<br /><br />WITH MILK, EATEN WITH A SPOON: Hey, guess what, it is good as a cereal.  A half cup serving, with milk, would be about 350 to 400 calories I guess, which isn't bad for breakfast.<br /><br />THE F-WORD: Yes, it's got fat in it, like all granola, but since it's not in bar form, molded together with marshmallows or corn syrup you really shouldn't worry about it.  'Fat is the flavor' as the saying goes, and that warning only purtains to people who somehow think one bag of cookies should be eaten in one sitting.  Even the suggested serving size here is quite large for a snack.  Personally I found myself eating two pinches of this granola whenever I went into the kitchen to feed an urge to eat something, and that was enough to do the trick.  So don't worry about the slightly over the line fat percentage.<br /><br />If you're really worried about gorging yourself not only on granola, but ice cream or crackers and cheese and other delicious little goodies, don't bring the whole container with you to the living room for your several hours of nightly television.  Instead, put any snack you're going to eat in a 6oz custard cup and don't fill it more than three quarters of the way--which is about half a cup since it gets wider towards the rim.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There really isn't any supplement that can substitute for getting your nutrients and whole grains from actual food such as granola.<br /><br />This is really delicious, healthy, proper snack food to get you through those periods between meals when you just want to stay satiated, keep your energy level up, and reduce any cravings you might have for something bulkier and with more calories.

I also like chocolate, ok I love chocolate.<br /><br />I thought this might be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />I first tried it in cold milk as cereal.  The granola is typical granola.  Lots of chewing, so so taste.  On top of that was the chocolate.  Something about the chocolate and the milk made the chocolate taste practically overwhelm the granola.  Not bad, just not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I next tried it as a dry snack.  Except for the mess of eating granola without a spoon and some milk to hold it in place, this was better.  The chocolate taste was a little more subtle, basically coming in the bites that had chocolate.  Plus with it being dark chocolate, it's not overwhelming.<br /><br />Back to Nature products are expensive.  That's what you get when you go with a small company who is actually producing less processed products.  This isnt' that important to me, but it could be important to you.<br /><br />As some others here have suggested, the idea is a good one.  Maybe having a bag of chocolate chips that you love mixed with a bag of granola that you love, and coming up with a good ratio would make for a wonderful snack (or even a wonderful breakfast) but to me this isn't it.

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: This granola is not near as good as many others I have tasted.  The chocolate leans toward bitter or there isn't enough sweetness or richness to the mix.  Something isn't quite right.  Oh, it's edible, of course, but with spendy granola, it needs to be really delicious before you fork over that kind of dough for the product.  It's just not worth the price.

review/text: I am by no means a granola connoisseur, but this stuff is pretty darn tasty.  This product is made with all natural ingredients. There honestly isn't a lot of chocolate in it -- just the right amount. It's dark chocolate but isn't too bitter or too sweet. Overall it's just a very nice blend and tastes delicious. Maybe a little pricey, but not a dealbreaker when considering it's made with real ingredients. I'd say 5/5 for taste, 3/5 for value. Recommended.

review/summary: What will they think of next?
review/text: I suppose the problem with a product like this is that it's too easy to create for yourself once you get the idea.  I mean, who would even think of buying their favorite granola, in bulk perhaps, and then their favorite chocoloate chips, or chunks, and throwing them together one's self.<br /><br />Now, this particular product for me is defintely OK.  In fact, if you're hungry and you're just sitting in front of the computer typing stuff you could much through a whole back of it before you can say "one thousand calories".  So, as a snack food it's almost as dangerous as cashews as far as I'm concerened.<br /><br />However, I found the granola taste to be uninspiring.  It just didn't seem very fresh, if that makes any sense, and the chocolate chunks couldn't save the day.  This product just makes me want to do it myself because I know with my hand picked ingredients I could likely do better and not have to pay as much.

review/summary: Great Granola, from a non granola guy
review/text: The is an Amazon Vine review, and my first one.  When I saw this product, I decided to give it a try, wow am I glad I did.  Several simple points of interest.<br /><br />1) The packaging is nice, the colors and textures of the bag make you feel like it is "environmentally friendly."  I am not in any way suggesting it is, but the coloring and make up of the bag make you think it's a natural type of product.<br /><br />2) Upon opening the bag, one is treated to an olfactory delight.  The smell is fresh and good, and you will be tempted to dig right in, and not share with others.<br /><br />3) Texture and taste.  The granol is fresh and not at all dry or stale.  It could be mashed together and would "hold" large pieces together it is so moist, it is not wet, but certainly not dry.  The taste is a nice blend of flavors and the addition of the chocolate chunks is very welcome.  When you get a mouthful that has a piece of chocolate in it, it is a real treat.<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, I am not a granola eater; however, this is an excellent product.  My somewhat choosy eater 6 and 7 year old children love it as well.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/text: This granola is a mix of rolled oats and semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  I couldn't find a description on the bag as to whether it's a snack or a cereal.  As a snack, it's a bit dry for my taste and isn't as sweet as the delicious Quaker 100% Natural, but I quite enjoyed it with milk.  Its crunchy texture is just right and the chocolate is a treat.  If you like granola, this is a good one.  A good source of fiber.

review/summary: Could not have been worse!
review/text: I requested this item from the Amazon Vine program and decided to have my family help me get more info for my review. I love eating healthy and was looking forward to a better alternative to the already semi-healthy granola I was enjoying. So, I sat my family down at the table. My dad, mom, two brothers, one sister and one grandmother and asked them to taste test it.<br /><br />My mom and sister were the first to protest. Now, I hadn't tried it at this point but everyone else had. My sister and mom told me it was too bland and the chocolate was too grainy. It didn't taste natural.<br /><br />My two brothers were next. My older brother (who is 28 years old) told me that the only time he would eat this would be if he was walking through the woods and hadn't eaten anything and had stumbled over it. My younger brother (22) said that while the taste wasn't awful, it "just wasn't good either".<br /><br />My grandmother was indifferent. She was the first person to like it a little bit even though she claimed it tasted like dry oatmeal and tiny flakes of chocolate.<br /><br />My dad said the same thing. That it tasted as if there was no chocolate in it at all and the granola had an oatmeal taste that didn't sit right with him.<br /><br />I figured that maybe they were making a fuss out of nothing so I decided to try it. In my hand it looked harmless but upon eating it, I found that I could not produce enough saliva to even slightly moisten the granola chunks and the chocolate used was horrible and crumbled in my mouth instead of melted.<br /><br />This is my very first bad review and I have to say... it deserves it. I will never purchase this item and if anyone wants the half of bag I got, it's being fed to my hampster. He happens to think it's wonderful!

review/summary: Delicious, but Difficult to Eat!
review/text: "Back to Nature" Chocolate Delight Granola was certainly a pleasant surprise.  I have always been a fan of granola bars, oatmeal, and, of course, chocolate, but I never expected to enjoy this food quite as much as I did.  The taste is not merely the blandness of oats or the sugary sweetness of the chocolate but a wonderful combination of the two, neither of which comes across as overpowering but as a subtle, healthy snack for one to eat.  If you are interested in this product, you might also be most interested to note the excessive fiber content, which is another of granola's additional benefits.<br /><br />Any complaint I have regarding the product is purely logistical.  Let's be honest: eating loose, bulk granola isn't easy.  I dropped as much on my floor as I put in my mouth.  I suppose the most effective method of eating the granola would be to put it in a bowl and spoon it like cereal, but that eliminates the ability for the product to be carried around for a snack, taken camping, etc.  While one cannot as easily control the portion size of granola bars, they remain a much easier and more effective method of consumption than loose granola.

I won't buy it again because eating this stuff is no way to stay a size 6 (can't I brag?).  1/2 cup has 220 calories, 6 grams total fat, 4 grams of dietary fiber, 5 mg of salt and 13 grams of sugar. NOT BAD AT ALL, especially the fairly high fiber and very very low sodium.  The ingredients do not offend.  It's crunchy and delicious.

review/text: It tastes like granola with chocolate chunks thrown in, and it tastes good. That aside, the main thing this product is trying to be is natural, which it appears to be. An important distinction, though, is that it doesn't claim to be organic. It seems to me that if I was going "Back to Nature," it would be organic. I don't think I'd pay a premium for this, but it tastes as good as expected.

review/summary: Tasty Breakfast Food
review/text: This chocolate delight granola comes with rich dark chocolate chunks that create a tasty breakfast. I recommend adding some sugar with milk for a richer taste. Dark chocolate has lowering of high blood pressure and it is a potent antioxidant. Although I liked the taste of this mix, but I thought it is a little pricey. If you are health conscious and like chocolate this could be your choice. You may also be pleased to know that it doesn't have artificial flavors or fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HNXTS4">Galaxy Granola Not Sweet Vanilla Munch - 6 Pack</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WQ5732">Hi-Country Cereal Mix</a><br />3.

review/text: very tasty, but watch the calories!!! A 1/2 cup has over 200 calories! And the fat content is high, also. I tend to eat more than a half cup of cereal at a time. Having said that, the flavor and texture are very nice. Yummy chocolate pieces. Not too soft, and not too crunchy. So, if you don't mind the calorie/fat content, it's a very good cereal. Probably better as a small snack or treat.

review/text: The texture is good, the chocolate bits are good, but oh my goodness, this is so sweet.  It's way too sweet for me as luck would have it.  I expected sweet with the chocolate but wow!  Blech!<br /><br />And at 220 calories for a half cup, there's not much nutritional value.  It is filling, I'll give it that, and it has a significant amount of fiber.<br /><br />You might like this if you pour sugar in your cereal.  And it's OK for a snack, but I wouldn't eat this on a regular basis.  There are far too many tasty, healthy products around for me to eat this &lt;gag>.

review/summary: High calories disguised as a health food.
review/text: The first encounter I had with "Back to Nature" was one of their breakfast cereals.  I found it to be very good, yet nothing that Special K red berries couldn't tackle.  Nevertheless I stumbled upon this granola and figured I give it a taste.<br /><br />I must say that this granola has a good taste.  It could be easily used as breakfast cereal, put into yogurt, used in baking or just eaten out of the bag.  However, I was really surprised at the serving size versus the calorie count.  A half of cup of this "all natural" granola is 220 calories.  That seems like a lot.  Then if one reads the ingredients, it is quite plausible why the calorie count is so high.<br /><br />Overall, this granola is good, but nothing to get excited about or shell out a great deal of money for.  Besides once you read what is in it and how "unhealthy" it is, you be wondering how you are getting back to nature.

review/summary: A Failure for Granola - Maybe a Win for Cereal?
review/text: I wanted to like this product, but I didn't on so many levels.<br /><br />Since this was marketed as a snack, I expected to be able to reach into the bag and grab a cluster or two of delicious chocolately granola.  No.<br /><br />The top-most layer of the bag did indeed have clusters, but they didn't last long.  The bottom 80% of the bag was tiny pieces of granola and flakes of choclate... better suited for cereal than snacking.<br /><br />The clusters, when they were together, don't contain chocolate.  So even if you managed to get a few clustery snacks, it was just granola stuck together.  Tasteless granola.  The chocolate is there in little flakes, which were good, but unless you were scooping the stuff into your mouth you're not going to get any.<br /><br />I should probably have tried the product again as a cereal with milk, alas I was out of milk and rarely enjoy cereal anyway.<br /><br />Oh, and anyone tagging this as "healthy" has another thing coming.  Half a cup of the stuff is 220 calories.<br /><br />The only thing this product has going for it is the resealable packaging which was quite good.

review/text: I wasn't sure what I was getting. I have never really cared much for granola so I thought I'd see what they would do with chocolate. It's just square bits of chocolate mixed with granola. The chocolate is nothing special and it's just plain old granola. You might as well buy bulk granola and a bag of chocolate. That way you can have granola however you want it: with milk, alone or with chocolate. And you can have the chocolate by itself as well.

review/summary: Yum! Very tasty snack!  And lives up to its promise of "natural"!
review/text: Basically, with this snack, the granola (comprised of rolled oats) is a delivery mechanism for the CHOCOLATE.  Big, rectangular pieces of chocolate, that dominate the taste of this snack.  If you love chocolate like I do, you'll like this snack.<br /><br />Now, my next question would be, how healthy is this?  I was for some reason expecting this to be another "faux healthy" snack like so many of the granola bars you find these days, which are loaded with hydrogenated oils and artificial flavorings.  The ingredients list of this granola is 100% comprised of things YOU could buy at the grocery store!  Sugar, skim milk, molasses, etc.. even the preservative is plain old vitamin E.<br /><br />Next I was curious about the calorie/sugar/fat content as compared to my usual granola, Kashi Apple Orchard.  This product (same serving size) has 1 gram less of total fat (though saturated fat is 1 g more than the Kashi), 1 gram less of carbohydrates, and one less grab of protein.  Total calories are the same per serving.  Contrasting with the Kashi, I would never eat this for breakfast since my days of chocolate (Count Chocula) early in the morning are long since past.  But I do think this granola is a good snack and worth checking out.  I bet it would be easy to make GREAT cookies out of this, as well.<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide whether or not you want to try it.

review/summary: *YUMMY* But...
review/text: BACK TO NATURE'S CHOCOLATE DELIGHT GRANOLA tastes really good and has the perfect blend of crunchy and sweet that makes this a tasty snack, either as a cereal or right out of the bag.<br /><br />It's made from natural ingredients and doesn't contain artificial flavors, preservatives, hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />But here's the rub... the BACK TO NATURE CHOCOLATE GRANOLA, like all granola, is high in fat. Some of it is the good fat, Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated, but it does contain 6g of total fat--2g of that Saturated Fat. It also packs 220 calories per 1/2 cup serving, which is about 2 1/2 handfuls, and it's very easy to keep eating it.<br /><br />Since opening the bag, I've probably eaten three servings already, because it's that good, but that can't be good for my waist!<br /><br />OK, I shouldn't be that harsh and deduct 1-star from BACK TO NATURE... for my own lack of will power, but many customers will see the words "nature" and "whole grain" and think "healthy treat." The small serving size of the granola is also deceptive because many will think "this is such a tiny amount that I'll just eat a little more" because it really does seem like you're eating a small amount, but then next thing you know you can't zip up your jeans.<br /><br />On the plus side, that means that the product is delicious but just be aware of serving size and portions. Otherwise, it's a good alternative to say a 180-calorie cookie that's full of high fructose corn syrup and sugar and no fiber.

review/summary: Granola for people who don't love granola.
review/text: While you read this review, please keep in mind that I'm not a huge granola/trail mix/nut type fan at all. Nuts only appeal to me if they are super salty. I'll only snack on trail-mix if it's got a lot of M&Ms. I'll eat a granola bar, but only if it's got enough junk food in it to render it a mislabeled candy bar. It's just never appealed to me even though I'm an extremely healthy eater.<br /><br />However, "Chocolate Delight" is satisfying to me. It's basically like a crumbly, crunchy lightly-sweet oatmeal cookie with small chunks of chocolate laced throughout. I didn't find it sweet OR salty, to be honest- it's just lightly sweet which makes it snackable. The chocolate isn't bitter, nor is it overly sweet- it's just the right compliment for the granola. I also like that the chocolate doesn't leave a weird aftertaste in my mouth like a lot of other dark chocolates do. There's not a whole lot of chocolate, just enough to provide a nice "kick" to the granola.<br /><br />It's definitely a satisfying snack because it's got some bulk to it- if you eat it by the handful, you won't feel like you've just crunched on baked air, like a lot of other healthy snacks. It feels like you've actually eaten something satisfying.<br /><br />My husband, who IS a fan of granola, said he would have preferred it without the chocolate. I probably wouldn't *eat* it if it didn't have the chocolate, so your milage may vary on that one.<br /><br />By the way- this *isn't* a cereal, as another reviewer noted - it's meant to be eaten as a snack. I'm actually anxious to try it out with my daughter when she gets home from school. She's three and an EXTREMELY picky eater. I'm hoping this might be something she can snack on instead of cereal and chips. I think the chocolate will be a huge draw for her and I can feed it to her without worrying about all the salt and sugar she's getting.

review/summary: Good, very chocolately
review/text: I needed a little afternoon pick-me-up today, so I tested out the Chocolate Delight Granola.  Chocolate Delight is right.  Those little semi-sweet chocolate bits are pretty potent.<br />I tried this both without and with milk (eating it as cereal).  I liked it better without the milk.  It is nice and crunchy and simple.  I don't think that I would eat this in the morning for breakfast--I love chocolate, but that much early in the morning is too much for even me.<br />This is a good, simple, whole grain, fiber-rich (4g) snack.  Don't go overboard with it, though, because it does have plenty of calories (220 per 1/2 cup).  A 1/2 cup is just enough for a pick-me-up in the afternoon.  I'm keeping a bag at my desk at work for the afternoon slump.<br />If you like semi-sweet chocolate and you like granola, you can't go wrong with this snack.

review/text: I've got to admit, I wasn't expecting much from another granola product but "Back to Nature" has certainly caught my attention. Having just arrived home (and I was hungry) when this product arrived, it couldn't have been better timing - I'm sitting here munching on this delightul blend of fiber mixed with just the perfect amount of semi-sweet dark chocolate is putting me into a state of granola-bliss. In fact, I really can't remember a time when I've had granola that tastes this good! Just as wonderful is that all-natural ingrediants are used and contains a lot of fiber. This would be a great product to take with you on outings or to the movie as an alternatative for popcorn. Regardless, "Back to Nature" simply tastes good!

review/text: This granola is delicious.  Crunchy, with satisfying chunks of chocolate mixed in clumps of granola as well as chips of loose chocolate.  I use it in yogurt and it is awesome.  I like the packaging, too ... The resealable bag is convenient and practical.

review/summary: Tasty granola, reliable source
review/text: I have been a fan of this granola for about a year - I add it to a cup of vanilla soy yogurt for breakfast. It is a tasty, hearty granola. I don't think there is puffed rice filler, just oat clusters and chocolate pieces. This granola flavor is regularly out of stock at my local grocery store and find Amazon's subscription service extremely convenient.

review/summary: GREAT as a cereal!
review/text: I eat this as a cereal with rice milk and it is GREAT!  I have not experienced the issues other customers have had with opening the bag.  Just be sure to tear across and downward.  I have received a bag or two that was melted, but the chocolate did not stick to the sides of the bag, it just formed clumps in the middle.  My shipments originate from Allentown, PA.

review/summary: Great with yogurt
review/text: I tried this at my daughter's house recently.  Her husband couldn't find it in the grocery store so is now purchasing through Amazon.  I put some in my yogurt and a smile came across my face:)  I didn't read the nutrition label before ordering some for myself but not sure if that would have changed my mind.  It's high in calories - fat and carbs, especially for only a 1/2 cup serving.  However, protein and fiber is a positive for me.  I love the flavor and crunch.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: It's hard to compare food items since everyone has a different taste for what they like. For me this is the best chocolate granola. It has a significant amount of chocolate, which I find particularly good since pretty much every other I have tried just has a bit of chocolate chunks. This one is generous with the chocolate, which is also of very good quality, I think about 60% cocoa contents. So if you like chocolate this is one granola worth trying.

review/summary: Excellent granola, resealable bag, natural ingredients.
review/text: It passes the taste test of multiple people. I like granola and chocolate, and desire organic and/or natural products over all else.<br /><br />Now that we as consumers have many choices for most products, it will come down to taste, packaging, and the environmental awareness of the company itself.<br /><br />Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Good stuff Maynard
review/text: Very good stuff. Maybe a little hard, but I guess that's what REAL granola is all about. Very nice in vanilla yogurt or mixed with other granola cereal. Resealable packaging makes sure it doesn't turn into a big pile of amalgamated mush.

review/summary: Very interesting and tasty snack.
review/text: What is there to say about granola and chocolate mixed together? Plenty if it is done as well as this Back to Nature treat is. The combo is a nice break from boring granola but without the guilt of pure chocolate or candy. It is a very dry snack so have a liquid handy. The chocolate is a little biter which detracts from the overall flavor resulting in a 4.

review/summary: Yum Yum
review/text: I loved this granola. The chocolate pieces were a great addition! Wonderful flavor and great in milk. My own personal preference is a little chunkier granola, and this is definitely not chunky. The kids wanted some and I let them try (they loved it too), but the package is pretty small, so not economical for our big family. I can't imagine anyone not liking this if you like granola and chocolate!

review/summary: Chocolate... What's Not to Like?
review/text: This granola has bits of chocolate in it, which I thought would be way too sweet for my taste. But it works. The chocolate is in small slivers and it doesn't overwhelm the cereal, and it's really not sweeter than most cereals. So far, this cereal hasn't even made it into a bowl because I keep snacking on it straight from the bag, but I think it will do quite well in milk. If you like granola and chocolate, it's definitely worth a try.

review/summary: not overly sweet, relatively healthy granola
review/text: I'm not one of those people who consider granola as breakfast because it's often too sweet and sticky. This one could almost qualify because it's not overly sweet, and there aren't that many chocolate pieces. So it's like an oaty breakfast with chocolate chips.<br /><br />However,if you're wanting that super-sweet granola flavor often eaten as snacks or for energy on hikes, this probably will not give you the burst of energy and flavor you might want.<br /><br />I was debating between 3 or 4 stars, but I decided to go lower because I felt like the product was a compromise to be both healthy and sweet, but not exactly succeeding in either. I guess I'd rather go all healthy or all indulgent.

review/summary: Natural and sweet
review/text: It's rare to find a cereal that is reasonably sweet and healthy. Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola contains chocolate chips made from natural ingredients. It DOES NOT contain vanillin or other artifical colors and flavors commonly found in cheap chocolate products and often found in cereals. I have two children allergic to artificial colors and flavors. This is a great find, allowing the whole family to have a special treat for breakast. My children also snacked on the granola. This is easy to do because it comes in a portable 12 ounce plastic package.

review/summary: Scrumptious!
review/text: This is some of the best granola I have ever had.  Crunchy, great flavor, and just the right amount of chocolate make it extremely satisfying.  Great as a cereal with milk, or just straight out of the bag.  My daughter loved it and ate most of it!
