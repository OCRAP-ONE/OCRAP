review/text: I got them when on sale so better price than off-brands. They taste great my daughter loves them. Toddler must have! Get the off-brand though like parentschoice or up and up if not on sale though cuz they are the same thing taste just the same just not as pretty packaging.

review/summary: she loves it
review/text: My baby (13 months) loves this flavor of Gerber Puffs. The flavor is mild and the texture is really easy for her to chew now. I've actually been giving my baby Puffs since she was about 5 months old and had no teeth. We've tried and approved of Strawberry+Apple, Banana, Sweet Potato and of course this one. We also tried and dislike Apple cinnamon (too sweet) and Cherry (too tart).

review/summary: 10 month old LOVES these!
review/text: I bought this package for our 10 month old to practice self feeding and to have an easy snack on hand when traveling.  They are a step up from plain ol' cheerios!  She loves them and they melt quickly in her mouth.  The price was great with Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: Puffs Are Great For Early Self-Feeders.
review/text: These little snacks are wonderful for little ones learning to self feed. They almost instantly melt in your mouth and I feel that under supervision pose very little choking risk. I had tried many things before these, from Cheerios to Nilla Wafers (crushed up) and nothing was even worth comparing to these puffs.  The sweet potato flavor is also very tasty, and my little one eats them up as fast as I let her!

review/summary: Taste great, not messy
review/text: My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.  I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).  Giving it in smaller quantities should also alleviate concerns about sugar in the product (sugar is the fifth ingredient in the banana puffs).

review/summary: good flavor, melts in her mouth
review/text: When my baby got too big to eat mashed sweet potato--and didn't have teeth to eat it otherwise--I started giving her these. She loved the taste and the texture was crunchy enough to soothe her teething gums while still being soft enough to dissolve easily in her mouth. They're also a really great finger food. I put some in her tray and she'll eat as many as she wants and drop the rest on the floor, which we pick up and put in the bird feeder. Incidentally, the birds enjoy them too :)

review/text: my toddler loves them,they are convenient,perfect for sitters house or on the go,and my boy likes all of them.walmart has them under 3 a canister i think.i usually get them there.my star review is based o how much sugar they have.i prefer to give my kid flavored cheerios,they have less sugar and better on price,they just don't melt in your mouth or come in a convenient can.besides the sugar and price,i love them.but i do pretty much use all of the gerber toddler stuff for on the go,and  when i am home i try to use a different sub,like cereal,yogurt or what ever the mainproduct is for that specific gerber item.my dad and babysitter pretty much love to have these on hand for mess free convenience though.

review/summary: Stain clothing
review/text: This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains.

review/summary: Tasty, but very sweet
review/text: I bought these because I like the idea of a veggie flavor over a fruit flavor.  They really are delicious, but they are very sweet.  They taste a lot like a kids cereal (which they kind of are).  I prefer the Plum and Happy Baby ones because they have half the sugar, and my 11 month old doesn't mind.  If I try to mix the low sugar ones with the Gerber, she will go for the Gerber.  If you don't care about the sugar increase (it is really small), these are tasty and your child will eat them.  If you care about sugar, go with Happy Baby.

review/summary: A good choice for new crunchers and munchers!
review/text: I was pretty wild about these for awhile when my little guy started eating solid food; they dissolve easily and he has fun picking them up. If I put a bunch in his tray, he'll try to shovel them in, but if I put one at a time down he'll pick them up with a thumb and finger. He's fun to watch, learning new things.<br /><br />I do worry about the added sugar, so I've been holding back a little on these lately, offering them less often and giving him Cheerios instead. The Gerber/Nestle corn crunchies are a little up in the sodium, too. Kid snacks don't need that stuff, really, so I'm looking for alternatives, but I think these will still be around at our house for awhile; everything in moderation. :)

review/summary: perfect first finger food
review/text: We used this as a first finger food with our twins and broke them into even smaller pieces.  Our babies had lots of teeth by 8 months, so they were able to chew.  The puffs melt down when sucked on, so it's a great first "real food" for the little ones.  The sweet potato is not "too sweet" as most of the other flavors are.  Even my older kids (ages 5 and 7) like to snack on these.  I never go anywhere in the car without them.  The star shape seems to be easier for the babies to get to their own mouths when just learning to self feed.

review/text: I love all the Gerber Puff varieties and so does my son. I was eager to try the Sweet Potato to see how he would like them. He loves them!!! All was well until I removed him from his high chair and saw orange spots everywhere. He is learning to self feed and drools quite a bit so I when he was grabbing at them with his wet hands some of the puffs on the tray got wet. When I went to clean off the tray the puffs came off but everywhere there was a wet puff I now have an orange stain. I wouldn't be so mad of there was some kind of warning on the jar but I can't find one. I am really glad he was shirtless or I can't imagine what his clothes would look like.

I don't know what kind of company charges $15 to mail 20 oz, but apparently this one does.

review/text: I was worried about the oils it contains because I thought it would weigh down my chin length hair and also because my home is on a septic tank system and I know grease is the worst thing for the drain field.  But in fact I love how my hair feels after using this conditioner and since I am not detecting any sort of oily residue in my tub I am assuming there is not enough to wreak havoc with my drain field.  The bottle is very easy to handle because the lid and spout are on the bottom and opening it is a simple matter of pressing on one side so the opposite side pops up.  Super easy to open and close.  I withhold one star because the product is heavily perfumed.  Fortunately for me I do not find the scent objectionable but I would rather it had no scent at all.

review/text: This is officially my new shampoo and conditioner combo. The smell is just absolutely incredible--so fresh and clean. My husband always compliments me on how nice my hair smells and how soft it is. It makes my hair shiny and manageable. I rotate it so that I only shampoo every other day to keep my hair from drying out. Once a week I use the anti-dandruff shampoo. I condition every day. I don't use a lot of heat styling or put any product in my hair, so finding a shampoo and conditioner that lets me wash my hair and air dry it, leaving it soft and laying nicely and smelling great is huge! My hair is color treated, but I prefer the way the lengths conditioner feels in my hair.

review/text: I am going to see if over time the product does help prevent split ends. Meanwhile, this conditioner has a mild scent and has the consistency of hand lotion. It applied easily and washed out without a problem. Overall I am pleased with it. But I can't say that about the bottling.<br /><br />The flip-spout is located on the bottom of the bottle. So it will either leak over time or get an accumulation from use and piddle on whatever counter you store it on. I realize that the idea was to be able to avoid shaking it like a catsup bottle. Additionally, since their shampoo bottle has the flip-spout on the top, this helps to avoid grabbing the wrong bottle.

I love how my hair feels when I run it through my fingers. And there aren't any split ends to think of, despite our extremely hot and dry weather conditions. Why, I even got a compliment on it today. I hesitated to say it's the conditioner -- too much like a commercial. But yes, Clear Scalp & Hair is a part of my hair care routine for healthy, shiny hair.

review/text: While you can spend a lot of money on conditioner if you want to, you can also get well-formulated conditioners for a reasonable price. This is definitely a well-formulated conditioner that would be well suited for normal to moderately dry hair. This conditions well and rinses cleanly from hair without leaving heaviness or build up behind. It conditions with almond oil and shea butter. This is also only lightly scented (unlike some brands which contain heavy chemically perfumes). This is definitely a good conditioner option at a very reasonable price.

review/summary: Not entirely natural hair conditioner that's part of a hair care system.
review/text: My gal and I take good care of our hair and mainly use natural hair care products.  Her hair is dry and brittle.  My hair is also dry.  After using her usual <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P85MAM">NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Dry Hair - Unscented - 16oz.</a>; while I used my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LTP8VO">Johnson's Baby Shampoo 20-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>, we applied this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> (CSH) for about a week.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Non-greasy with a apple-like scent.<br />>Our usual shampoos and this CSH conditioner left our hair softer and manageable with no scalp irritation but she still prefers her favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RL92B0">Komenuka Bijin Moisturizing Hair Treatment / Conditioner with Natural Rice Bran - 7.7 Fl Oz</a> while I don't feel the need for a conditioner. Tip: our dermatologist has always advised us NOT to use our fingernails vigorously when shampooing hair, always use fingertips gently to avoid scalp damage and to minimize premature hair loss (thinning/balding), and dandruff.  Use common sense.<br />>Hair breakage was already minimized with her prior usage of organic shampoo and conditioner so it's difficult to determine whether the CSH conditioner was effective.<br />>We liked this sample and it's easonably priced at $4.22 with free shipping from Amazon; It's only $4.01 with Amazon's "Subscribe & Save".<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Even though CSH conditioner has "Nutrium 10": ten vitamins and nutrients, there are a whole lot of other artificial ingredients including Zinc Sulfate and Lysine HCL.<br />>The conditioner is only the second step of a four step regimen: cleanse, NOURISH, treat, and repair.  The manufacturer obviously advises using ALL of their products within this system over 7 days for best results.<br />>Scent is ok during use but may smell a bit acrid to others.<br /><br />Overall:<br />My gal still prefers her organic shampoo and conditioner without all those synthetic chemical ingredients.  I still prefer scentless or lightly scented shampoos.  Individuals have different types of hair so shampoo and conditioner preferences are highly subjective.  If one has NO problems/sensitivities with artificial ingredients, then this CSH system is certainly worth a try.

review/summary: horrible product
review/text: I decided to try this new shampoo and conditioner line and greatly regretted it. After the third time using it i noticed my hair still looked and felt greasy. I thought i just didnt get the conditioner out but after washing it again thoroughly it still felt and looked greasy. I figured it was the shampoo and had to buy this neutrogena shampoo that stripped my hair of all the chemicals that crappy line had in it. It took 2 days for my hair to go back to normal.  I will NEVER use clear again. Its shit.

review/summary: Not Best Choice For Me
review/text: I ordered a bunch of different products in this line to make a comparison between them.<br /><br />I think I was exposed to too much of whatever is now making me itch and break out all over. It started with my arms after washing and conditioning my daughter's hair in the sink (I had already washed and conditioned my own hair with different products from the line)...I noticed red spots along my arms, small bumps and itching. My kids then saw the red rash across the front of my neck/chest (which happens when I am allergic to something).<br /><br />For the last several years, my previous shampoos and conditioners were mostly PH balanced and all natural.<br /><br />These CLEAR beauty products have a "common thread" between the shampoos/conditioners, despite have slightly different smells...They are most abundant in ingredients that may initially detangle, but are drying and irritating on my hair and skin with accumulated usage/exposure. It is now clear that these products are not good for me to continue using.<br /><br />*Not the outcome I had hoped, but found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.

review/summary: Does the job
review/text: Four women in my household used this product.<br />-1 x Brown, very curly<br />-2 x Black, bone-straight<br />-1 x Blond(ish), straight(ish)<br /><br />All thought it did well.  Got their hair feeling clean, easy to brush, maybe even lighter.<br /><br />Their hair looks really good, no oily appearance, and the smell is pleasant enough.  I can't say it's strengthened their hair, but I did notice less hair in the drain.  So that's a good thing since it's my official manly duty to clean the vile hair-sludge before it travels to the sewer system and creates a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JP9OP8">Ghostbusters II</a> situation.<br /><br />I'd buy it for them again.

review/text: This conditioner has it all. It has a wonderfully feminine fragrance, and it leaves hair feeling nourished and conditioned, not dried out. And because it is highly concentrated, you use less of this product than you would of another conditioner. It is especially effective when used with Clear Scalp Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo. It leaves hair shiny and soft and fragrant!

review/summary: My Girlfriend Loved It
review/text: I gave this to my girlfriend to review since she has long, color treated hair.<br /><br />The fragrance is interesting. I don't think it's too terrible, but it's not one that I just have to use. This was sent in a padded envelope. It didn't leak but there is the possibility.<br /><br />I used the conditioner with the corresponding shampoo. When I first used it, it didn't feel like I was actually putting anything into my hair. I'm used to conditioners that have the feel of a thick lotion that gets worked into the ends of my hair. My hair did feel a little dry when I rinsed it out and I was very skeptical.<br /><br />I could easily run a brush through my wet hair. Usually my hair is a knot from ringing out the water, but this time the brush slid through my hair with no knots. This is a lighter conditioner so my hair has more volume when dried. My hair is not weighted down by the excess product that didn't get rinsed off.<br /><br />I do like this conditioner. This would be a conditioner that I would purchase again. I have bleached fine hair and this conditioner made it feel thicker and healthier.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: Great for my hair
review/text: As I mentioned on my review of the shampoo, my hair is:<br /><br />- Plentiful, but very fine and therefore easily broken.<br />- Straight with a small amount of natural body.<br />- Lacking in volume.<br />- Easily weighed down.<br />- Oily.<br /><br />I had one primary concern about this conditioner. The directions state that it is to be worked into the scalp and throughout the hair in order to work properly, because it is supposed to help condition the scalp. I never put conditioner directly on my scalp. My hair is so fine and so easily weighed down that I avoid conditioning the roots as much as possible. But, in order to truly review this product properly, I went ahead and followed the directions.<br /><br />I was VERY pleasantly surprised! Not only does this conditioner not weigh down my hair, it also really did create a moisture balance along my scalp to help control the oil in my hair. In fact, not only have I noticed a decrease in the oiliness of my hair, but I have also noticed a decrease in facial oiliness as well.<br /><br />The combination of the shampoo and conditioner has seemed to increase the strength of my hair and reduce the amount of hair lost in brushing and washing.<br /><br />My one frustration is a reduction in volume. I really like to avoid excess products in my hair as much as possible, but I have to use volumizer more with this shampoo/conditioner duo than I did with my old set. My hair is not weighed down by this product, but what little body I have seems to be reduced dramatically. I have to say, though, that the reduced volume is a small price to pay for oil control and greater strength.<br /><br />**Note: I have not been to my stylist since using this product. So, I do not have confirmation from her that my hair is indeed increased in strength.**

review/summary: A Conditioner with an Equal Mix of Pros and Cons
review/text: A little background on my hair: it's long, thick, coarse, and naturally "wurly." It's also color-treated, gets blown dry at least a little bit every day, and gets flat-ironed about once a week.  Needless to say, I'm always on the lookout for products that can make it look and feel better, so I thought I'd give this product a chance.<br /><br />First, I know that a lot of people (and I'm one of them) are sensitive to heavy fragrances.  When this product first arrived, it was wrapped in a sealed plastic bag that was then enclosed in a bubble wrap-lined mailing envelope.  Somewhere along the way, a small amount of the product had leaked out, inside the plastic bag. When I made the first tiny slit in the top of the envelope, I was almost bowled over by how potent the fragrance was, and that was through the *sealed* plastic bag (and it had totally permeated the envelope).  So, the smell is definitely on the strong side, and it does stick around once the hair is dried, although to a lesser extent.  That said, even with the strength of the fragrance, I was happily surprised that it has never wound up giving me a headache, even after a couple of weeks of use.<br /><br />As for the actual impact of the conditioner, I was initially a little wary of trying it, since every time a product is touted as being "strengthening," "fortifying," or some other variation on that theme, it inevitably intensifies my hair's coarseness and dryness.  Fortunately, this conditioner did not follow suit - it makes my hair quite soft and does a pretty good job of detangling.<br /><br />However, it pretty much eliminates all vestiges of volume in my hair, and I've noticed that my scalp will get oilier much more quickly after using this product (as directed) as compared with others.  That could be a result of the conditioner's serum and oils, and/or the fact that you're supposed to massage some of the product into the scalp (when normally, stylists will usually recommend applying conditioner from around the bottom of the ears, down the length).  Also, when I try to embrace my hair's "wurliness", I find that this conditioner really weighs down every single bit of curl and wave that my hair possesses.  So, it's fine when I make the effort to straighten my hair, but I have to avoid it all costs when I try to wear it in its naturally wurly state.<br /><br />Another aspect - on the more positive side - is that I've noticed a bit less shedding since I began using the conditioner, and I think that I've had slightly fewer split ends than I otherwise would have.<br /><br />Since I got this product, my local Walmart is now selling the whole line for something like $4.68 a bottle.  Is it worth that price?  Well, it could be worse, and the conditioner does have some positive qualities.  At the end of the day, though, it also has quite a few drawbacks.  This conditioner was mostly just OK for me, and while I might try other products/conditioners in this line, I don't think I would spend money buying a bottle of this particular one once the one I have runs out.

review/summary: Nice smell but a little heavy
review/text: I really like the smell of this line of shampoos and conditioners. They leave my hair smelling so fresh and clean and not overly perfumey. I thought this version left my hair heavy and weighted down. Styling was more challenging than usual. I will use this as a weekly deep conditioner and not an every day conditioner.

review/summary: Not my favorite Clear product...
review/text: I've tried a few Clear products in recent months, and the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing conditioner is probably my least favorite of the bunch. It's not the worst conditioner I've ever tried and actually smells better than some of their other products, but it just didn't leave my hair as soft and manageable as, say, Clear's Volumizing Root Boost conditioner. That might be because it's more about strengthening your hair than leaving it soft, but I didn't notice much help for me there, nor did I have any less tangles (sometimes gets severely tangled in the front, to the point that I basically have to cut the knots out).<br /><br />Now, I realize that my hair might not be what this product is aimed for, as I don't really have long lengths (currently about shoulder length, long-ish for a guy), but my wife's definitely is, as hers is long (mid back) and can be prone to breakage (naturally quite curly, but often heat-straightened). She didn't particularly care for it either, also preferring some of Clear's other products (again, just didn't seem to condition as well to her either; this is probably why this one is still half-full while the others are almost empty).<br /><br />There are worse conditioners out there, but if you're looking for something that's going to really make a noticeable difference, then there are much better options within Clear's own product line at the very same price point.

review/text: This product did not give desired results. I have chemically relaxed hair, that is around my shoulder blades. I felt that my hair was not particularly nourished after using both this shampoo and conditioner. However, I am used to the results from more expensive products, so maybe you just get what you pay for. The price is reasonable, just don't expect your hair to feel luxuriously moisturized.

review/text: I have tried several of the Clear Scalp conditioners.  They have all been good conditioners, but this is one of the better ones.  I have long fine color-treated hair, and this conditioner left my hair soft and mostly tangle-free without weighing it down.  You don't need to use a lot to get good conditioning, so the bottle lasts quite a while.  I think this is a great conditioner for long hair.  I find it comparable to many more expensive salon brands.  I definitely recommend giving this a try if you have long hair and are looking for a cheaper alternative to salon conditioners.

review/summary: Makes your hair fall out...
review/text: I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.<br /><br />Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT. Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.<br /><br />Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else. Went to the doctor and had all blood work done. Everything FINE!<br /><br />I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....<br /><br />Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene. Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out. Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.<br /><br />Called the manufacturer and complained. They said this was unusual... I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.<br /><br />They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...<br /><br />If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck. If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment. IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.

review/summary: Good conditoner, even better bottle
review/text: I gave this conditioner a try, and was really looking forward to it, because I have very long hair. (more than halfway down my back) I wanted a conditioner that would strengthen my long hair, and this conditioner looked as if it would be great for me.<br /><br />I used the conditioner several times, and was reasonably satisfied. My hair looked ok, didn't have any static bothering me and snarling my hair, and smelled very nice. I didn't notice any strengthening nor anything that seemed special for my long hair. It would be good for hair of any length.<br /><br />The best thing about this conditioner is the packaging. Really. The cap is on the bottom of the bottle, and a simple press of a button opens the bottle. Because the bottle is upside down, the conditioner is always at the cap and you'll be able to get all of conditioner out of the bottle without wasting any. Good job!

review/summary: Decent Conditioner. Lightly Scented. Thick, No Tangle Formula. Leaves a Non-Dissolving Residue in Your Shower Drain.
review/text: UPDATE:  This conditioner leaves a non-dissolving thick, slimy residue in my shower drain.  I have not noticed that any of my other conditioners did the same thing.  I do not know if this enough residue to cause a drain build-up & future plumbing issues.<br /><br />I have medium to fine shoulder length, non-treated, layered hair & found the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner to be on par with my other conditioner (Suave Professionals).<br /><br />This conditioner goes on thick & takes a little work to rinse out (Suave does too).  It leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny & bouncy all day long.  I did not notice a significant difference in "no tangle" or hair loss from Clear versus my other daily conditioner, so I cannot comment on Clear's "strong lengths" claim.  In the end, my decision to continue to use Clear will be based upon price point since the results seem to be similar to other products that I have used in the past.<br /><br />Note: I like the bottle design (dispenser on the bottom) & have not experienced seepage.

review/text: This is not an expensive product.  Sometimes you will find that a less expensive conditioner is very watered down and just makes your hair greasy as opposed to looking nice/conditioning it.<br /><br />That is not the case with Clear Strong Lengths.  It smells nice and it works as advertised.  A little dab applied as directed and it does a nice job of conditioning your hair.  I am a guy and my hair is fine, and shorter than most women, so for peope with longer/thicker hair, you probably want to use more conditioner than just a dab, similar to an product you already apply.<br /><br />The ingredients are typical of a hair conditioner.  It does perform nicely ad I would use it again, especially at its present price point.

I was impressed, though, by how nice and soft his hair was after that single round of conditioning, considering how rough it had started out. The difference was really dramatic, so I'm more than happy with how this conditioner performed.

review/summary: This Conditioner Does The Job Without Spending Big Bucks
review/text: "Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner" (12.7 fluid ounces) conditions your hair with a slight and pleasant scent at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />The conditioner consists of a moisture complex of vitamins B, C and E plus sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils and aloe vera to cleanse and nourish hair that is prone to breakage.<br /><br />My wife found this product easy to use and was pleased that it rinsed so well without leaving any residue in her hair. She preferred the light scent over heavy chemical smells of other conditioners. And this product did what she wanted, left her hair soft, tangle-free, and a clean feel. Because my wife highlights her hair she is very careful about conditioners and found this one met her needs.<br /><br />More expensive conditioners may perform better but this product makes for a very functional and pleasing every-day conditioner that is easy on the budget.

review/summary: After Seven Days...
review/text: This review is for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner, written after using these products for seven days.<br /><br />I should start by saying that I consider this an inexpensive product. The shampoo and conditioners I am used to cost 3 to 4 as much as these. Because of this, I didn't expect any improvement in the condition of my already very healthy hair after using these products. While I wouldn't consider the condition of my hair improved after seven days of using these products, I was pleased that the condition of my hair was pretty much maintained. Despite my hair feeling okay after using these products, I won't be giving up my usual products. I like to mix it up with my shampoo & conditioner, so I will continue to use these occasionally, but not every day. One of the main things I'm not crazy about with these products is the fragrance. It's not that they don't smell good; they smell okay. Not my favorite scent, but it's fine. The issue is more that I don't feel like the scent stays with my hair. I don't wear perfume and rarely use any kind of body fragrance, so it's important to me that my shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair smelling nice. I don't get that with this product.

review/summary: Silky feeling conditioner that smells nice
review/text: This conditioner has a silky feel when going on and smells nice. In addition, it was easy for me to run a comb through my hair while the conditioner was in it.  I've tried three Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty conditioners and this one is my 2nd favorite.  My favorite one is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>.<br /><br />I can't tell a difference in my hair strength like the bottle implicates but I like it enough that I would definitely consider purchasing this if the volumizing conditioner were not available.

I have a natural beach wave and some conditioners weigh my hair down. This product truly left my hair silky and soft without weighing it down!

review/summary: Adds body
review/text: It has a pleasant though strong scent.  The good news if you're sensitive to such things the smell only lasts in the shower.  I have long, wavy hair that's turning grey with the texture that grey hair usually has.  My hair is prone to tangling so I usually leave some of the cr&egrave;me rinse in after washing.  This cr&egrave;me rinse has an oilier texture than I'm used to so I was a little hesitant to do that for fear it would weigh my hair down but it actually came out fine.  In fact I noticed more body and a minimum of frizziness.<br /><br />The container design is flat where the product dispenses.  In effect you store the bottle upside down which allows gravity to work as the bottle empties.  Guarantees ease of use as the product ages.

review/summary: Floral and Generic
review/text: The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. How does this accompanying Strong Lengths conditioner hold up?<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Similar to cheap children's perfume.  While it is not overpowering, I think a simple "clean" smell would be much better.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />The texture is thick and it takes a lot to spread throughout long hair.<br /><br />CONDITIONING<br /><br />The name suggests that this is a lighter conditioner than the Dry Scalp type, and that seems to be the case.  My hair was soft, but something heavier might be needed during the winter.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Strong Lengths conditioner is very reminiscent of a generic conditioner, with a cheap floral scent and basic results.  If you are a fan of the Clear shampoos, I suggest looking elsewhere for the conditioner.

review/summary: A Little too Fruity but Overall I like it
review/text: I am a bit picky when it comes to shampoos and conditioners. I like products that don't smell overly fruity (I prefer a herbal... mint or rosemary smell). I also like products that rinse out quickly and do not leave my oily. The Clear Scalp Strong Lengths Conditioner meets most of my requirements.<br /><br />Notes<br /><br />- It does have a fruity scent, but it is not overpowering<br /><br />- It does wash out of my hair quicker than other conditioners. After a thorough rinse my hair feels very clean with little residue .<br /><br />- Since it is a thinner conditioner it does require use to use more than with some other brands. For me this is not a big deal, but my wife has a lot longer hair and she finds that it requires a lot of product to achieve the desired effect.<br /><br />Final verdict - I like the Clear Scalp & Hair Conditioner, but it is not our favorite. At this price point it is certainly worth giving a try!<br /><br />4 Stars

review/summary: Okay, but I actually like SC&H's...
review/text: I have longish hair which goes wild with summer humidity and which gets sort of dry from pool chlorine, so I was interested to see what 'Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner' could do for me.<br /><br />I have to say that it's a rough equivalent of Pantene conditioner in thickness and how it goes on and rinses out.  Even afterwards I can't say that I could tell the difference in how my hair looked and felt as compared to Pantene.  And I'd probably buy one or the other interchangeably based on price.<br /><br />I would like to note though that if you have long crazy hair like mine that you might want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8T8">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner</a> instead.  It really calmed the humidity frizzies for me and with my next shampoo that's what I'm planning on using for the duration of Summer.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: New conditioner by Unilever
review/text: This conditioner comes in a very handy packaging.  The bottle has flat base on the botton that can be easily opened to extract conditioner.  This nourishing hair conditioner has Nutrium 10 ingredients (10 carefully selected vitamins and minerals that will make one's hair stronger).  Although this conditioner can be used by both men and women, strong lenghts clearly indicate that it primarily helps women with longer hair by keeping ends from splitting.  Although this product does not compare itself with similar products on the market, the bottle indicates that it is helpful for maintaining health and strenght of one's hair when used with Clear shampoo.  I will be using this product in pair with the shampoo of the same brand to ensure that fragrance and ingredients complement each other.<br /><br />This conditioner has thick, white texture and it is easy to rinse off.  It has a very pleasant and not too strong fragrance.  I love this latest product and I recommend it to others.  I wish the bottle has a full list of ingredients used in this product, but unfortunately it does not.  For that reason alone, I give this product four out of five stars.

review/summary: Really happy with this line
review/text: I've been using this with the matching shampoo, following the instructions.<br />My hair is hip length, very straight, medium thick with fine strands. Undyed, and I don't use blow dryers or curling irons on it. Just a wide tooth comb. I'm pretty picky about the condition of it.<br /><br />The instructions call for this to be massaged into the scalp, then distributed along the length. Like with most conditioners, if you have long hair, you go through a lot more conditioner than shampoo. It takes a fair amount. I start with a small amount and massage it into my scalp, and work that down as much of the length as possible, then get a second small amount to finish.<br /><br />My hair is wonderfully moisturized and clean. It feels super soft without being greasy looking and it's completely manageable. I'm also not getting lots of split ends like most shampoos and conditioners seem to cause in my hair.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this, and looking forward to seeing how it does when the weather is freezing here which can be very drying.

review/summary: good with matching shampoo
review/text: I have hair that is thick and goes about 3" past my shoulders and difficult to manage-it always seems to be frizzed out (just thought I would included that so you know when reading the review you can compare your hair type to see if this will work with your hair or not) I am a Head and Shoulders Loyalist, however, this conditioner works pretty well.<br /><br />It is smooth and goes on easily.  I also like that I didn't have to use a whole bunch to get full coverage (I only had to use about a quarter sized amount). It smells pretty good (I would say about as good as Pantene or Garnier Fructis, but better than any of the Head and Shoulders scents I've tried) and after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy-even the next day.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/summary: Good, But a Little Too Heavy for Regular Hair ...
review/text: I used "CLEAR Strong Lengths" conditioner in junction with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2">CLEAR Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo</a>." The results were mixed. Here is my experience:<br /><br />While this conditioner did its "job" (it smoothed any frizz and made my hair shiny/soft), I found the same amount of hair in my brush as I usually do ... even after over a week of usage (as is indicated on the bottle). Likewise, it made my hair feel a bit weighty. When I switched to another shampoo and conditioner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYRYZ4">De-luxe Rosemary Mint</a>), my hair was even softer and bouncier. I wonder if after days of use, the CLEAR shampoo (which was very viscous) and conditioner (which is quite thick) caused unwanted build-up.<br /><br />CLEAR is inexpensive. Moreover, I really like the "upside-down" design of the bottle and its pleasant smell. And, I believe that CLEAR could be extremely effective on deeply damaged hair. However, those with "normal" (not color-treated or chemically processed) might find this product too weighty.

review/text: Has using this made my hair stronger?  Less breakage?  Heck, I don't know.  How can I tell after just a few weeks?<br /><br />I do like it.  I have very long, extremely fine-textured blonde hair.  It does not weigh my hair down.  A little seems to go a long way.  It also rinses out easily.<br /><br />The scent is not overpowering and goes away by the time my hair has dried (I let it dry naturally, no blow dryer or such).<br /><br />I have very sensitive skin and a lot of shampoos and conditioners make my scalp itch (and also my back since my hair is very long, reaches to just below my waist).  No such problems with this so far.<br /><br />I intend to continue using it in the hopes it will help control breakage for my very fine-textured hair.

review/summary: My hair loves this stuff!
review/text: I've always been one of those people who roll their eyes when they see ads for hair products that make actual changes to your hair. I mean, it's dead, how many changes can you make to it?<br /><br />Well, darned if I have to quit the eye rolling routine from now on, because this stuff has changed how my hair looks and feels!<br /><br />I used to have long silky blonde hair. I loved it. Then I turned 40 and this evil gray curly stuff invaded my scalp. Now nearing 50, about half of my hair is still straight and fine, and the rest is grizzled and curly. It is NOT pretty.<br /><br />I did try some different products to tame the evil mass on my head, but nothing really worked, and if it did anything to the curly stuff, it made the straight stuff look like an oily mess, so I had about given up.<br /><br />Fortunately this product was offered to me through Vine, and after 2 weeks of use, I am completely amazed at how different my hair looks and feels. I can't say it's the same as it was when I was young, but the curly stuff is no longer frizzy, and the straight stuff looks good too. I can wear my hair back in a ponytail again without having the sides look like "crazy cat lady" by afternoon. It is wonderful!<br /><br />I don't know if it will work as well for everyone, but if you've got "middle-aged hair problems" I definitely recommend giving it a try!

review/summary: Pretty Average
review/text: I have used this conditioner a couple of times and I find it be pretty average. It does have some of the botanical ingredients that I use such as sunflower and coconut oil but those are only a small fraction of a conditioner that basically has the standard commercial conditioner ingredients. I say this so that you won't be drawn in simply because of these "special" ingredients.<br /><br />With that said, I condition-wash my hair because it is thick and curly. I don't have any chemicals or dyes on my hair either. My preference is to saturate my hair with conditioner in order to detangle it. Unfortunately, this conditioner did not work as well for this task as some other cheaper commercial conditioners. I have used the V05 Moisture Milks line with great success although it is thinner than CLEAR. CLEAR required me to use nearly half of the bottle the first time because I have so much hair and it just wasn't allowing me to detangle the way I need to.<br /><br />CLEAR has a medium thickness and it's pink. I haven't noticed a fragrance that's worth remarking about. The top (where the product dispenses from) is actually the bottom of the container which is a positive since conditioner gets harder to access as the bottle becomes emptier and emptier.<br /><br />In terms of the length, well, that takes more time than one bottle of conditioner will allow. Most hair grows at a steady rate of about 1/2 inch a month regardless of what shampoo and conditioner you use. Diet is also a factor in hair growth so I wouldn't get hung up on the "Strong Lengths" part of the title.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that there are other conditioners that cost less and can do more (if not just as much). I did not experience any negative effects from using this product but I didn't see any positive effects either. However, hair health, just like any number of things requires effort and nurturing for positive results over the long term.

review/summary: The shampoo is much more impressive.
review/text: I have used the clear scalp & hair beauty strong lengths shampoo alone and with this conditioner and I don't see any benefit to using the conditioner.  By comparison the shampoo is very thick and luxurious and the conditioner is very thin and light.  It is most likely because with the nourishing and moisture rich feeling you already get from the shampoo you can get by with a light duty conditioner.  In my case it just isn't needed at all and that is taking into consideration before using this product line, I have experienced breakage while trying to grow my hear longer.  I might use the conditioner once or twice a week for the heck of it but in the future I will probably not bother buying it again.

review/summary: Leaves my hair feeling nice AND less breakage
review/text: I have longish hair (to between my shoulderblades) that's curly and tends to frizz in the damp climate where I live.  Lately it's been kinda blah and dull, so I was excited to try this new conditioner.<br /><br />After using it for two weeks, I've noticed that my hair feels pretty nice.  It's soft and shinier than it has been, and it's super easy to get a comb through my hair after a shower.  It also does feel stronger than before, which is awesome.  My hair has this bad habit of getting delicate after I've colored it (and I color every two months or so; I'm too young for greys), so it's nice to have my hair feel stronger and more elastic than it has been.  I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in how much I'm shedding from the scalp, though, but that might be hoping for too much from a conditioner.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice conditioner with a great scent.

review/summary: I love how it smells and feels
review/text: This shampoo smells so clean and subtly fresh all day long!  I love it! Love it!  You only need the smallest little dab to get a really good lather worked up.  I am on several medications that have made my hair very weak and almost a year and half ago it fell it out in large chunks.  My hair is fine, wavy and likes to tangle with itself.  It is prone to breakage.  I sleep on satin pillowcases, with a satin head wrap on.  I baby and pamper my hair and spend a lot on products that will strengthen it or keep it in shape, I'm a product junkie for better or worse.  I try shampoos and conditioners frequently and return to my old standbys.  These is a keeper for me.  I used it for 3 weeks before coming to a conclusion.  I had my scalp 'cleaned' before I started.  I go to the beauty college and they do a deep scalp treatment and clean your scalp of product buildup.  Three weeks later according to my hairstylist I still did not have any build up to scrap.  So my head was very clean leaving the hair follicles free for growing.  I had about 10% less breakage according to the beauty schools breakage test.  Which for me, is a plus and improvement, I am trying to grow my hair out, I can't do that if it is constantly breaking.  For conditioners I need something that has some power in the shower to detangle effectively and leave my hair smooth and tangle free.  Some of the more expensive conditioners do not have the thickness or something in the cnditioners to really soften and separate my hair.  This conditioner really worked without me having to double dip and use twice as much conditioner.  For the price and the smell and the noticeable improvements I say yay!  How does a shampoo and conditioner get a 5 from me....no breakage at all.

review/summary: My New Favorite Conditioner
review/text: Within only a couple weeks after starting to use this conditioner (along with the shampoo, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8AM">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>), I have noticed a big difference in the softness, strength and health of my hair. My hair tends to be very dry and this shampoo-conditioner combo has worked wonders.<br /><br />My daughter also loves it because it's such a clean product (without all the dyes etc. that can weigh down fine hair), leaving her hair shiny and silky. She kept stealing mine so I had to get her some of her own.<br /><br />The packaging states it has nutrients for the scalp and the hair and I believe it. I trimmed my hair right before I started using it and it has definitely helped prevent split ends. It's every bit as effective as the shampoo-conditioner combos I've paid premium prices for in salons.<br /><br />I'm liking my hair more than I have in a long, long time, and am looking forward to seeing the results after a few months.

review/summary: Makes my hair healthier and shinier
review/text: UPDATE: The longer I use this conditioner, the healthier my hair seems to be and the better I like it.  The concerns I mention in the original review are still valid, but I've decided to continue to use this conditioner given its reasonable price and the health it's imparting to my hair. I'm still not wild about the fragrance, although I have friends who are, so I'm keeping my rating at 4 stars.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Just like you, I am accustomed to the hype that comes with personal hygiene and beauty products. So I take it all with a grain of salt. My hair is fine, limp, and has no natural body. Conditioners that add body usually leave my hair feeling dry.  Conditioners that add shine and moisture usually weigh my hair down. So my conditioner needs aren't easy to meet --and my guess is that yours aren't either. I love my Fekkai Glossing conditioner, but it's so outrageously expensive I use it less often than I'd like.  Other days, I use different conditioners and haven't settled on anything reasonably priced that really works for me. I like this CLEAR conditioner, but I don't love it.  It leaves my hair shiny, but adds no body at all. It does make my hair feel healthy, but only time will tell whether that is merely superficial or truly healthier hair. (See UPDATE: it made my hair healthier!)<br /><br />The really odd thing about this line is that there appear to be more conditioner names and claims than distinct formulations. It's as if the marketing program is the tail wagging the product development which is the dog. For example, the Volumizing Root Boost, the Total Care, and the Strong Lengths conditioners all have EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS LISTED IN THE SAME ORDER.  They all look exactly the same, feel exactly the same, and leave my hair feeling exactly the same.  They even smell the same (mediocre). Yet they are being marketed for different hair problems.<br /><br />Volumizing Root Boost indicates it has "lightweight nourishers" and is for "all day volume & body from the root." It does not volumize at all, doesn't boost my roots in the least.  Total Care says it has "advanced moisture complex" and provides "total care for scalp & hair." I don't have dry scalp, so I can't say for certain, but these claims seem more in line with the way the conditioners actually perform.  Strong Lengths states it has "strengthening serum" and will give "stronger hair in only 7 days."  My hair seems no different after 7 days, but in a month or two who knows? (Again, see UPDATE, above)<br /><br />Since all these conditioners have the same ingredients, it would follow that the claims made for each of them should apply to all three of them. If all the conditioners did all they claim that would be one great conditioner. It would volumize, moisturize, provide total care, and make my hair stronger. But, as I said, they don't. They are okay for me, but they don't do everything I want. If I can get any of these conditioners at the right price, I will buy it, but I won't go out of my way to find it and I won't pay a premium for it.

review/summary: African Hair - Not Bad
review/text: Every once in awhile I don't need a super-rich therapy type conditioner. This works well for that for my thick hair. Suave type products leave my scalp itchy and uncomfortable. This worked well for a quick shampoo and conditioner. Because I don't, and shouldn't, wash my hair daily, I need my conditioner to keep my hair soft for a couple of days, and it did that. I did use liberal amounts compared to the small amount of the more expensive products. I also like the smell of it and love, read, love the shape of this bottle. It opens at the bottom which is just fantastic, and didn't fall over while I was showering. Those are two great pluses in terms of bottle design.

review/summary: Great Conditioner, Nicely Packaged Design
review/text: Finally, a conditioner that does what it states.  This is one of a few I've used over the years that helps me avoid post shampoo and drying tangles and leaves my have manageable but not so heavy it looks fake.  Also has a very pleasant but not overpowering fruit essence scent.<br /><br />One thing I really like is the bottle design.  Since most of the bottles in this shampoo and conditioner line look alike, it's a welcome change to see that this bottle sits upside down (opposite of the shampoo that sits right side up).  That and the curved top make it easy to spot when in the shower (and without my glasses).<br /><br />Very good product and I'd recommend it.

review/text: I used the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner for a week.  The combination leaves me hair very soft, but by the next day it is flat and oily looking.  I like that it is for long hair.  The conditioner is pretty thick, which is much better than the watered down cheap ones.  It smells great, too.  I'm looking for a conditioner that doesn't make my hair oily, but makes it soft and keeps away static at the same time.  This conditioner wasn't the right fit for me, but it may be for you.

Perhaps when used with the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty shampoo it will work better.

review/summary: A lot of hype
review/text: I've been using this conditioner for two weeks and as far as I can tell it is just a lot of hype. It's no better than any other department store conditioner. In fact, I much prefer my regular conditioner Aussie Moist to this. It takes twice as much of this conditioner to get it through my hair and remove tangles that it does my Aussie. Afterwards, my hair feels good, but no better than it does with my regular conditioner. What I especially don't like is that the conditioner is tinted pink. I have light blonde hair and I don't normally use conditioners with dyes because they stain my hair. It has been years since I have even seen a conditioner with dyes in it. I thought that went out of practice in the 80s.<br /><br />Overall, I would not use this again. There are better conditioners on the market and I would prefer something without dyes.

review/summary: Effective conditioner....
review/text: I use this conditioner, along with the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY shampoo. It smells great, goes on thick, and doesn't make my hair and scalp feel like I am suffocating it. Instead, it feels I am nourishing it and giving it hair food, to keep it clean and strong. Like anything, or any part of your health regime, you've got to make sure your hair is in good shape. Breakage and dryness just won't do. Think of this conditioner as a tall glass of water for your hair region, on a hot, summer day. Nice.

review/summary: OK conditioner, but made my scalp itchy
review/text: I used this conditioner for one week paired with the shampoo for color treated hair and I'm not impressed.  The smell is a bit strong and chemical-ish.  Plus, even though it is for the scalp, the two CLEAR products made my scalp dry and itchy.  Another bummer is that I learned the product contains an animal byproduct (from cows) and the company does not have a no animal testing policy.  In summary, I won't purchase this conditioner.  I'd prefer something a bit more natural with less chemicals.

review/summary: FANTASTIC
review/text: The bottle promises improved strength in 7 days, but my hair felt infinitely better after just a single use. I have a great deal of very long, very fine, very straight hair, and generally I find that conditioners leave my hair feeling not conditioned enough (and sadly dry and static-y, particularly since I moved to the desert) or far too weighed down by product. This conditioner did neither -- it just left my hair feeling thick and shiny and smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces split ends -- I brush carefully, so I'm not particularly prone to them anyway -- but it's worth the price even if that particular claim is bunk, because my hair has never in my life felt this healthy before.

review/summary: Less tangles, less flakes
review/text: I have a mass of very fine frizzy hair.  After washing and upon towel drying it resembles a cave woman's:  dry, tangled, and bushy.  I hate to wash my hair as it takes 20 minutes to comb out and during the process I have a lot of breakage.  Afterwards, I dare not run a comb through again as it will continue to snarl. This makes it difficult to even place a part in my hair.  I am sure some of you share my pain.  This is why I recommend this conditioner.  When applying it feels like it is truly being absorbed.  It has cut my comb-out time in half and I have less breakage.  My hair feels softer.  It is still just as frizzy and if I use a straightener and then go outside, the 80% southern humidity will still cause it to frizz. Of course, this product does not claim to help with this issue, I am only sharing my experience.<br /><br />I have small patches of bumps and flaky skin on my scalp. This conditioner has been the best for this issue.  I have used T-Gel, Nioxin, Matrix's Biolage, and a variety of sulfate-free products.  This product has cleared the flakes. It uses Zinc sulfate, lactic acid, and zinc pyrithione.  I know Matrix uses zinc pyrithione also, not sure why this works better.  Maybe the combination of acid, zinc and healing oils? The oils include sweet almond, coconut, sunflower, soybean and aloe.<br /><br />The one negative for me is the strong floral scent.  Thankfully a lot of the fragrance rinses out and only a mild scent is actually left behind in my dry hair. Personally, I think this product is a winner and plan to continue using it.<br /><br />Update:  I have since given away all my pricier shampoos/conditioners and only use this product due primarily to the ease of comb out.  I am now using Clear's "Ultra Shea Smooth and Nourish" line in the gold bottle as I prefer its scent.  I was hoping the "Smooth" would help tone the frizzes but it doesn't.  Still, I highly recommend this product and can not wait for Clear to create a line that combats humidity, smooths, and adds a little shine.

review/summary: Terrific hair products for fine hair!
review/text: I've been using CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce and CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce for three weeks before writing a review, just to give them a good test, but there was a noticeable improvement in my hair after the first shampoo.  For several months, I had been getting hairs caught in my comb when combing out my wet hair.  After using these products for the first time, there was only one hair left behind in the comb.  After shampooing and conditioning a couple of times, there were no longer any hairs in the comb at all.  I've waited three weeks to see if these products would accumulate on the hair strands, because my fine hair just collapses under the weight of product build-up.  But there doesn't seem to be any build-up at all.  They leave my hair manageable, soft & springy, and very shiny.  I was surprised that neither product is clear (both are pearly in color.)  Be advised it takes very little product to work up a rich lather, so start out small and add to it or you will be rinsing for a while.  I recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.

review/text: When I put the conditioner in my hair, my hair really feels weighed down, moreso than with other conditioners.  Maybe that's just their way of getting the job done.  My hair does feel smooth and conditioned when I rinse it out.  However, the following morning, there is much more poof in my hair.  It does not have a strong scent.  Overall it does the job but I would not say it is any better than any other conditioner.

review/summary: Noticably great conditioner!
review/text: I normally wouldn't rant about a hair product---I'm just not the type!  But this conditioner is literally the best one I've ever used.  I first used it on my daughter, who has long straight hair.  I noticed that it felt different than other conditioners---lighter somehow, more formy and more able to cling to hair than most I've used.  The real test was the next day.  Her hair looks noticably thicker, smoother and just plain better.  It was easier to brush----important for brushing a little girl's hair!  I used it the next day, and noticed the same thing---my hair just looked and felt noticably better.  I'm going to seek out this brand for sure in the future.  It's nice to see a product that really seems to work.

review/summary: Seven Day Trial
review/text: This conditioner claims that it is a conditioner," that feed your scalp and give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days".<br />I used it for 7 days. My hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders and at that length I really have to watch that it does not get in tangles and pull out. As I have gotten older my hair just does not seem to be as strong as it used to be (neither does anything else for that matter).<br /><br />After 7 days, using this in the same manner as other conditioners I normally use - ones that are on the lower end of the price scale, this does not work as good. I have more tangles in my hair and for that matter it just does not seem as creamy, even to the feeling on my skin as others.<br />Also the bottle is fashioned to be stood `upside down' so that the opening is on the bottom. That is great in order to get all of the product out of the bottle and not to have to shake it to the top while you are waiting to use it; but the bottle then drips, so that it will wind up in a small pool of conditioner the next time you use it - not good in a practical sense and not really as effective as other conditioners that I have used.

review/summary: A difference in 7 days? Yes!
review/text: I am cursed with very fine hair, that is now also thinning as I get older. I am always dubious of products that make grand promises, but had not tried a "scalp conditioner" before, so thought I'd give it a try. First, the smell of this product is wonderful, but may be overpowering if you are using it with other scented products. The product itself is very thick and a small amount goes a long way. Directions state to shampoo, then gently massage this product into your scalp and hair, then rinse. The product takes a long time to rinse out thoroughly. All that said, I do notice, just 7 days from starting to use this product, that my hair feels stronger and my scalp itches far less. I do not have dandruff, just a few "itchy" spots on my scalp, and this has been cut down noticeably. Immediately after use my hair is left very soft and very shiny.<br /><br />I will continue to use this product as it seems to do what it promises, and I enjoy the scent as well as the results of shiny hair and less itchy scalp. It's all good!

review/text: My husband gives Clear Scalp's conditioner four stars.  It adds so much body that his hair looks thicker.  It's silky and shiny and I like running my hands through it. There's a definite difference between Clear Scalp's shampoo and conditioner and the modestly priced VO5 that we routinely use.<br />He knocks off one star because he isn't crazy about the fragrance.  He's neutral about it but says he'd prefer something else.<br /><br />I, however, would have to give Clear Scalp one star because I'm very sensitive to certain synthetic fragrances and this product reeks of one that goes straight to my sinuses and gives me a dull throbbing headache.  It's an odor that cloys in my nose.  I'm overly-sensitive to it and if you have similar problems, you may want to steer clear of the conditioner and the shampoo.  If not, listen to my husband, not me.

review/summary: Used once, wont finish the bottle But it might just be me
review/text: Disclaimer- my hair is keratin treated and may not be representative.<br /><br />First, I recognize that the shampoo and conditioner claim to make stronger hair in 7 days and that I didn't use it for that time. But I don't feel that the immediate downsides of this product make trying for a long term benefit a good idea.<br /><br />My hair is fine and quite long (well past the bra line). It is also keratin treated. Like most people with long hair I care a great deal about it and put quite a bit of effort into it's care. I was excited to try this product.<br /><br />After using the matching shampoo, I applied this conditioner.  The shampoo had left my hair feeling stripped and I was hoping this would fix it.  The conditioner was light and smelled good.  I left it in for several minutes.  When I rinsed it out, I was disappointed to find that my hair still felt dry and stripped.  I rinsed it thoroughly and let it air dry. My hair was a tangled mess.  I ended up needing to use my daughters detangling spray and brush it out very carefully to avoid breaks.<br /><br />While this product is meant to be used over time to gain results one of the biggest things to avoid with long hair is dry tangly hair. A long term gain is not worth the short term breaks and snaps that will occur due to tangling.

And for a conventional conditioner, I am pleased with the long list of healthy ingredients included in the formula.  My one complaint, and the main reason why I haven't given it a five star rating, is that while it doesn't give my hair a completely dull look it doesn't give it much shine either.  I'm a brunette with lots of natural red highlights and they don't seem to be visible much with this conditioner.  The scent is light and pleasant and I like the lavender color.
