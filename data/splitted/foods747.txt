review/summary: RELIEF AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!!!
review/text: Most people don't even want to talk about this TABU subject and view it mostly as an 'Old Folks' malady; but, I'm here to tell you that, if you have ever suffered with constipation, as I have, you will absolutely love this tea.<br /><br />I have been drinking this tea for my problem for over seven (7) years now with perfect results.  Once I drank it for one week and got on schedule, I only drink a cup once or twice a week.  The only drawback is the tast; however, I put either honey or, MORE BENEFICIALLY, Black Cherry Juice Concentrate (which helps with my arthritis)in for flavoring.  There are NO cramps or any other side effects to this remedy.  It has also relieved the bloating in my stomach and I can now wear my smaller sized clothes, which I had packed away for this day.<br /><br />My brother has been drinking the old fiber stuff every morning of his life for well over 15 years.  He was complaining to me that it just didn't seem to be working any more and I told him about GET REGULAR.  "No," he said, "I'm just afraid to stop using what I've been using."  "Well," I said, "What do you have to lose.  I'll send you 3 or 4 tea bags to try, but be sure to put some kind of flavoring in it because it tastes bad.  I use Black Cherry Juice Concentrate."  He finally tried it and called me immediately wanting to know how to order it.<br /><br />My daughter's live-in boyfriend, who is paralized from the waist down, wanted to try it because I had told her about it when she mentioned his problem.  I sent him four (4) bags to try and he called me the next day and ask if I would order some for him.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for keeping all my orders straight and thank you, Yogi, for making this ALL NATURAL way for relieving my stress (anyone who's experienced this knows what I'm talking about).<br /><br />Thank you also, Amazon, for keeping the best price available for this tea.

review/summary: It works in a gentle way....I'm switching
review/text: I have been using different supplements and medications to keep myself regular throughout my life.  Some over the counter medications are very harsh, they sometimes make you want to go at the time you are not supposed to.  Some would give me terrible cramping and keep me in the restroom for a long time.<br />I was using some natural supplement capsules before I discovered Yogi.  The capsules worked fine but are more expensive than Yogi taa.  Yogi gives me the predictable results the next morning.  I usually bring a few my favorite tea bags for a trip.  Now I bring a couple of this Yogi tea bags in case I get irregular during the trip.

review/text: I was previously using Kleritea which was recommended by a pharmacist. Kleritea worked but was expensive and did not taste good. I decided to try this tea by Yogi since it is more reasonably priced. It works just as well as Kleritea and tastes much better! I recommend it...it does the trick.

review/text: This stuff works, it does what it's supposed to do within 8-12 hours for me. It tastes really good, just like slightly sweetened peppermint tea, it goes down easy and things come out easy. Amazon also has it for a great price, all the local stores in my area sell it for around $6 or $7 a box so getting 6 boxes for under $15 is a total steal.

review/summary: Works
review/text: I got this laxative tea for a cleanse I was going on. I chose it over the other main brand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3PJE">Traditional Medicinals Organic Smooth Move Herbal Stimulant Laxative Tea, 16-Count Wrapped Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> because, though the ingredients are mainly the same, the other tea contained fennel which I can't stand. This tea tastes fine. I don't like mint flavoring, and you can taste the mint, but it is subdued. I even drank this tea for pleasure once on a cold day when I had nothing else warm and calorie-free in the house.<br /><br />This tea definitely performs the stated purpose. It does get things moving. The active herb is senna, which contracts your digestive muscles to get things out. I find it causes me to cramp just a little too much, however I'll happily take a natural remedy to constipation that makes me cramp if it means I don't have to put the totally bizarre ingredients in over-the-counter laxatives in my body. Overall I'd definitely recommend it.

review/summary: It works, though not quite "comfortable"
review/text: I started a new high protein diet and have been less regular than usual, and was getting bloated from all the waste building up. I decided to try this as a "natural" way to deal with this issue. I drank one cup last night at about 9pm. This morning when I got up around 6:30, I had moderate stomach cramping. It was a strange feeling and I know now from reading that senna products can cause this. Anyhow, about an hour or so after getting up I had a "soft stool" and thought that was it. However, I have had continuing mild stomach cramping along with diarrhea a few times since that first BM (its about noon now). Anyways I suppose the tea did it's job as I am definitely getting "cleaned out" - its just a bit more uncomfortable than I was hoping for. Perhaps I am just more sensitive to senna?<br /><br />The tea tastes great though, just like normal peppermint tea. I will probably continue to use this occasionally in the future, knowing that the following day might be uncomfortable and just planning for plenty of toilet access!

review/summary: Better Than Other Gummi Rings - Juicy Peach Flavor
review/text: I am so in love with Albanese Gummi Bears.  The consistency is not too soft and not too hard.  So, I decided to try the Albanese Gummi Rings in Peach for a change.  The consistency is quite gummi and not like a fruit slice, but the flavor just was not what I expected.  They are a tad bit softer than a gummi bear.  I expected a fresh taste like a juicy peach right off the tree.  There is definitely a peach taste, but not a fresh real peach taste.  It is not horrible and I enjoyed them to some extent.  Two gummies at a time were enough, any more and it was too much.  I suppose calorie wise, that is a good thing.<br /><br />I'm going to give these four stars as I do like them, but probably would not buy them again.  I can see other people enjoying these more than me.  I think really that it is a consistency thing.  To compare this to other types of gummi rings, I would say these are definitely better.  If you are a gummi ring lover, I would say that you would enjoy this candy.  The price is phenomenal.  You get two bags of 4.5 pounds each for a total of nine pounds!  That's a lot of candy.  I always have candy out in pretty clear containers at my home so that my friends will feel comfortable taking what they want.  My guests really enjoyed these rings and my stash went very quickly.<br /><br />The gummy rings were shipped in perfect condition and there was no melting and I am in Florida.  They were a bit warm, but they quickly come to room temperature and are perfect.<br /><br />These would be cute for wedding treats and a candy bar too. This is a candy everyone can enjoy, young and old!

review/summary: Best Gummi Rings Ever!!
review/text: Our family buys these gummi rings all the time, and now we have gotten our friends hooked on them, too!  First, the quality is amazing.  We actually took a trip and visited the Albanese Factory where these rings are made.  All of their products and flavors live up to expectations.  Also, the variety of flavors is awesome.  My favorite is the peach, because it reminds me of being on some tropical island.  When I'm craving something sweet I can pop one or two of these and be satisfied rather than go through a whole package of M&Ms.  The value is unbeatable.  I tried pricing these rings or similar kinds at those candy bins at the mall or even at the grocery store.  You get so many and they keep very well in zip-lock bags.  Our family keeps coming back for more!!

review/summary: Addictive, exquisite confection
review/text: We had the pleasure of hosting an exchange student from Aragon, Spain last year. One of the many wonderful, small pleasures he brought to our lives were these Christmastime confections from Spain.<br /><br />They seem incredibly simple to make: confectioner's sugar, ground and chopped almonds, cinnamon, lard and flour mixed and baked in small ovals and rolled in more sugar and cinnamon when warm. Yet I have used every recipe I can find and nothing compares to these amazing treats. La Estepena is the Spainish company that bakes them, they are imported and sold in the US by La Tienda.<br /><br />We were so lucky to get two large boxes in early December--but we went through them in less than a week! We ordered two more from La Tienda and they arrived before the holiday.<br /><br />If you can imagine eating something that is crumbly, sweet, crisp and nutty and so incredibly rich that you must stop at three cookies, order these. La Tienda's stock is fresh and arrives in excellent condition.

review/text: The ingredients listed by amazon are inaccurate.<br /><br />The number one ingredient on the product I received was "Invert Sugar"; Amazon is currently listing "Organic Sugar" as the number one ingredient.<br /><br />From my label:<br />Ingredients: Oganic Invert Sugar, Oganic Cocoa, Water, Oganic Vanilla Extract, Salt, Xantham Gum.<br /><br />According to Wiki (so it must be true) Invert Sugar is: "a mixture of glucose and fructose; it is obtained by splitting sucrose into these two components. Compared with its precursor, sucrose, inverted sugar is sweeter"<br /><br />As I was most concerned with the "Fructose" in the High Fructose Corn Syrup alternatives I was very sorry to see that the number one ingredient contains fructose.<br /><br />Regardless of the ingredients my main concern with this product is that it just does not taste "right". It's not exactly bad tasting but in chocolate flavor is somewhat light and there is a weird taste that reminds me more of ovaltine or maybe molasses.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do with six bottles of this stuff. Right now it is the chocolate syrup of last resort when we run out of our sugar cane juice powered organic chocolate milk.<br /><br />Why the 3 stars if I'm so unhappy with the syrup? Tastes are subjective, not everyone is concerned about fructose consumption and bravo to Santa Cruz for making one of the few organic chocolate syrups.

review/summary: not here yet?
review/text: I ordered this chocolate syrup to share with a neighbor, we order a ton of stuff off Amazon. For some reason my order did not ship for 7 days and I am on the Prime 2 day shipping. I called to find out what the deal was and was told they could not ship the product as it was close to expiration, it would ship when the fresh syrup came in a few days from the Vendor. I am very happy that Amazon is getting better at not shipping grocery items that are about to expire. I previously received 9 bags of organic corn chips that were close to expiration and after complaining they promptly refunded my money. I would rather wait  than to receive bulk groceries you can not possibly use before the expiration date as that defeats the purpose of bulk buying. Amazon is a top notch online way to shop for low sodium and organic foods for those of us living in rural areas. I am pretty impressed and I order here constantly. I will review the product for taste as soon as I get the shipment, but I will say all the Santa Cruz products I have tried so far have been excellent quality.

review/text: I have been popping Vicodin like candy to alleviate some of the pain in my knees, hips and ankles after a long day.  Carrying too much weight, a family history of osteoarthritis and a year old knee injury, there are days I ache so much I am in tears.  Since I started taking the ElastiJoint three days ago, I am down to 1-2 vicodin daily and the only pain I have felt is in my old injury.  My other joints have been stronger and much less painful, despite that I have been running around town the last couple of days getting kids ready for school and whatnot.

review/text: In theory the product is excellent for those with joint trouble.<br /><br />I have been taking Optimum Nutrition's Glucosamine + CSA for years now and wanted to give something else a try.  I tried it for a month and can not say that this product is any better or any worse than the Optimum Nutrition product I've been taking.<br /><br />It was however more expensive on a per serving basis and it DID NOT mix well in a shaker cup.  In fairness, the label says to mix it with room temperature water and NOT TO USE A SHAKER CUP.  I tried mixing with a spoon but that was just laughable.<br /><br />In cold water the taste was actually pretty good, but in room temperature water (as the label recommends) it tasted terrible.<br /><br />I would never ding a product because of taste (unless it was totally unpalatable), and I am not saying this is necessarily a bad product.  For me it was simply not a good value when compared to other options available and I did not experience a benefit to justify the increase in price over those other options.

review/summary: It works
review/text: I've been taking this for about two weeks now and I can feel a difference in my knee joints.  I wore my knees out running too much and ever since my knees have been achy.  Since drinking this the pain in my knees has subsided a lot although it is not completely gone, so elastijoint definitely helps.  As for the flavor, it doesn't taste good but after the first two times it's not horrible either.  It tastes like grape flavored cough syrup or bitter jello mix.  Just a really strong artificial grape flavor and medicinal flavor.  I make three servings at a time and chill it so it's easier to drink and the flavor is milder.  If it were a pill I would give it five stars but since it doesn't taste great and I have to blend it I give it four.

review/summary: Medium Sized Treat, Big Yummy Taste
review/text: Milkbone Original Crunchy Treats / B000EBKSCU<br /><br />My puppy just loves these Milkbone treats. Though the box says "Great for Training", they are a bit too big for proper treat training (which involves slicing the treats very thinly so that the dog doesn't get satiated or fattened up) because the treats are very hard and cannot be easily sliced into smaller pieces.<br /><br />However, they are uniquely good for training "Leave It!" - I can drop it on the floor and the puppy immediately notices the smell and comes over to investigate. And if he decides to ignore my "Leave It!" command, the treat is big enough and hard enough that it survives in his mouth long enough for my to reach in and grab it and start over - no rewards for ignoring "Leave It!", or he'll ignore it always. After only a few weeks of training, "Leave It!" is well-understood and almost always obeyed, thanks to these yummy Milkbones.<br /><br />Also, since these are larger and more satisfying that his usual treats, he also gets these at crate time. When Mommy says "Crate!" that means he snuggles into his crate and waits anxiously for his Milkbone treats. He absolutely adores them, and loves gobbling them up happily.<br /><br />These came carefully packed from Amazon with no shipping problems. The bulk price on Amazon is much cheaper than anything I've found locally and much more convenient.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: These are nice, small treats that my dog enjoys very much. Only reason that it gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the "great for training" call on the box. As one reviewer already said, these really aren't very good for training. They are too big to work well - the dog looses focus and they are too crunch to cut up and use in smaller bits. However, with that being said, my dog loves these! I'll continue to pick them up as general treats or as a big treat at the end of a training session.

review/text: I've never found a dog biscuit my little Maltese likes so I knew I was taking a chance. Still,  I'm VERY disappointed that there are no returns for the 11 unopened boxes.  I wouldn't try them if you have a finicky dog or a small eater. They are bland. There's no tasty smell, I mean nothing. The cardboard box smells as appetizing. I realize my dog is hard to please so I won't blame it all on MilkBone. He's not a big eater and has never been a chewer (never chewed on furniture, shoes etc) so although he won't grab ANY bone, he does enjoy them. Most beef bones are too large but he crunches lamb or pork rib bones up completely.  There must be SOME kind of biscuit to keep a small eater's teeth healthy.

review/summary: Nothing like Mee Chun
review/text: I normally buy Mee Chun fermented black beans from a local store (a tiny family run placed called "Nak's Oriental Market" in Menlo Park by Oak Grove). Those have a wonderful strong flavor and nice texture. I thought these would be similar. They are not. They are also NOT like in the photo.<br /><br />The photo makes them look just like Mee Chun beans, but they are not like those beans. They are dryer and lack the flavor of Mee Chun. These are not as salty as Mee Chun, but they do not add to a dish at all. In fact, they detract from it. If anything, the flavor of these is a bad flavor.<br /><br />The little market (Nak's) I go to normally has 8 oz Mee Chun for less than $1 each package (it even used to be $0.69 per 8 oz), but it is not close to me now, so I ordered these from Amazon because all Amazon vendors of Mee Chun charge an absurdly high amount for Mee Chun.<br /><br />Back to Nak's for me. It is worth the trip to get the real deal. I do not recommend these at all.

review/summary: Very disappointed...again.
review/text: My wife and I were looking forward to a great cup of Highlander Grogg after all the great reviews, however, the flavor of this coffee was very disappointing. I have been drinking various Highlander Grogg coffees since the early nineties and this is not it. The HG I have come to know has a very recognizable caramel-butterscotch-rum-nutty flavor. The coffee beans are over-roasted and taste like burnt nuts with not a hint of the other before-mentioned flavors. I was also disappointed with Coffee Bean Direct's version of HG. So far, only Grounds For Coffee and Cameron have the right recipe. We would have given it another star had we enjoyed drinking it even a little bit. The search goes on.

review/summary: Delicious coffee
review/text: My husband is the coffee lover in our family, and he ordinarily doesn't care for flavored coffee. I'm just an occasional coffee drinker. When I read the description and other very positive reviews of this coffee, I thought we'd give it a try and am so glad we did. We absolutely love it. The beans as beautiful and glossy when you open the package. The aroma when grinding the beans is fantastic. As other reviewers stated, the flavor holds up to brewing; this is one of the few coffees we've tried that tastes as good as it smells. Guests in our home have raved about this coffee and we have been asked repeatedly where it was purchased. The price with Subscribe & Save is close to what we'd pay in the grocery store for beans of lesser quality. We are repeat customers, and I suspect we will be for a very long time.

review/text: These are awesome!  It's a challenge to not tear open a 2nd pouch!  Each serving/pouch is 120 calories & worth every one!  Contains 9 grams of sugar and they taste very sweet. I've never done Weight Watchers, but the box says they are 2 points.  They remind me of 100 Grand candy bar because of the crispies & caramel -  but not as "dense". So far, Skinny Cow items are impressive (I've tried the ice cream cones in mint & chocolate - awesome too).  And Skinny Cow items supposedly contain fiber - these dreamy clusters contain 3 grams of fiber.

review/text: The clusters are my favorite treat.  I have been counting calories for close to a year and these are my savior.  I love candy bars but average sized ones are usually 300-400 calories or more.  These satisfy that same craving at 120 calories.  They are sweet, crunchy, chewy and even a little salty.  The portion is just right. One of these a day keeps me on track- totally worth $3.50 a week any way you look at it.

review/summary: Great Tasting, Low Calorie Treat!
review/text: I'm a chocoholic, but am very picky when it comes to my sweets.  I love these SKINNY COW CLUSTERS, which were created to be similar to a turtle without the nuts.  Since I'm not a fan of nuts in my candy, the crisped rice that is used as a substitute for pecans, is a welcome addition.  The candy is sweet, without being overly sugary and the milk chocolate has a nice smooth flavor to it.  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of five is that I wish there were more than 6 packages in each box.  While one package is meant to be one serving, it's not unreasonable to eat two packages at a time, which means there are only 3 servings per box.  Making different sizes available (may an "economy" 10 package box?) would be a welcome addition.  Other than that, these are a big hit and come highly recommended for the candy lover or fellow chocoholics out there!

review/text: When the cashew butter arrived, I was pleased to note that it was made from roasted cashews, because I think roasted nut butters have more flavor.<br /><br />I had looked for nut butters without a lot of additives, so I was concerned to note the additon of corn oil.  But then I realized that without it, the butter would have been so dense I would have had to spread it with a trowel.<br /><br />My first taste dispelled all concerns.  Spread on a rice cake or some toast, this is going to make some late, sleepless nights almost enjoyable.

review/summary: Very Tasty!!!
review/text: The cashew butter arrived very quickly and was super delicious. We ate half of the container in sandwiches and smoothies, and by the spoonful. The rest was used to make delicious flourless cashew cookies. They turned out so yummy, and here is the recipe I made up.  One cup Fastachi Roasted Cashew Butter, one cup organic coconut sugar, one large egg slightly beaten and one teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix well with a mixer or spoon, and place clumps of large walnut size batter on a dark ungreased cookie sheet, leaving a little space between each clump of dough.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 350 degrees (no longer or the bottoms will burn) Remove cookies with a spatula and place on foil or a dinner plate to cool. They are soft and chewy and what a yummy treat they make. The recipe makes about 18 to 20 cookies. You don't have to flatten them to cook them, it's better if they are clumpy. This cashew butter does have little bits of cashew nuts in the butter and is not entirely smooth. It is not real oily and has a "freshly made" taste. It's a little pricey, but I will definitely order again! You can use this recipe with other nut butters and if you like can use regular sugar instead of the coconut sugar (coconut sugar is metabolized slowly, and Amazon sells it too!)

review/text: These are a great gummy candy because their consistency is just right: pleasantly soft, but still chewy. But I'd say they're on the softer end of the gummy spectrum, eg: softer than then those two layer gummy frogs (which I also enjoy). I'd describe the taste, but I can't place it myself. The most specific I can be is to say they have a light fruity sweetness.<br /><br />A fun surprise is that these ones are quite a bit larger than those found in retail stores. I'd estimate the normal ones between one and two inches, but these are a full three and half inches in length.

review/text: This is a product with a lot of promise - low sodium, no fat, shakes on anything... But it ultimately fallls short. It just does not have  flavor that evokes real bacon. It is a halfway decent general purpose seasoning (think of another take on traditional seasoned salt) but it's a far, far cry from real bacon flavor. I would rank this at about 20% accurate bacon flavor, the venerable artifical bac-o-bits we've all had over the years are just about as authentic tasting, maybe even slightly more. If you can manage to use real bacon bits, there is no comparison. Still, I applaud them for trying, and I'll give any revised formula a try if and when they come out with it.

review/summary: Bacon Salt Review
review/text: I have wanted to try Bacon Salt for years.<br /><br />It does not taste like bacon.<br /><br />The tastes are hickory and garlic. The people who created it thought giving it the flavors normally associated with bacon would make it taste like bacon. It doesn't. It makes it taste like bacon seasoning. The flavor is good, it just isn't bacon. The two flavors are ingredients right on the label. Imitation Bacon-Bits have more of a bacon flavor. If they had just added the flavoring from them (even if it made it no longer vegetarian) it would have worked much better.<br /><br />It works better wet. Dry, you can barely taste it. It might make a good steak rub, I didn't try. $5 for the small container isn't bad, however the prices going for the large container are just a ripoff. There is definite salt in this. It's the first ingredient, sea salt, so bear this in mind if you are using it to season something.<br /><br />The flavor is good, I just cannot rate it higher as it does not taste like bacon, what it claims to and is named after.
