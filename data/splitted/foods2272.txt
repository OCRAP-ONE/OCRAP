review/summary: Good starter set for yerba mate
review/text: This starter set provides a lot of the yerba mate tea. The gourd needs to be "seasoned" - filled with boiling water once or twice before use. The bombilla is pretty good quality, but the holes are large enough to let some of the leaves come through. It's a good deal for the yerba mate starter.

review/summary: Broken gourd
review/text: I had been looking for a replacement gourd, but there isn't much Argentine influence in Reno. I turned to Amazon, and found this reasonably priced gourd/bombilla/mate combo. I was soooo excited, couldn't wait for it to arrive.<br /><br />Once it finally arrived, I went to cure the gourd, and it starts leaking all over me. It was cracked down the side. Since I already put mate in it, I couldn't return it. Had it not been broken, I'm sure it would have made a great mate. The bombilla is nice, seems to work perfectly. The gourd is a bit smaller than what I was expecting, but still would have held a decent amount of mate.<br /><br />Basically, I'm stuck with a broken gourd when all I wanted was a new one. It was a sad moment for me, but I guess that's what you get when you try to drink out of dried plant matter. The actual mate is still quite delicious, if you're into that sort of thing.

review/summary: Gourd is trash
review/text: The picture shows a gourd that would likely hold somewhere around 12 oz of fluid roughly, maybe more. The gourd that I received is no bigger than a pool cue. The bombilla straw looks good on the other hand. It's made of metal. I haven't tried the yerba mate yet but it is fresh for another year according to the exp date.

review/summary: great tea bad Mate
review/text: the tea is everything your want in your Yerba Mate.. but the picture shown has the mate almost as big as the bag of tea.. however its a pound of tea the mate is way too small.. i know that gourds come in all sizes so maybe i just got an unlucky one with a small mate but and it was so small it rolled around in the box and was cracked when i opened it.. and to add to the issue there is no returns on this item so i am stuck with a $100.00 bag of yerba mate i payed 20 bucks for and i still have to go buy another mate gourde

review/summary: mate for decoration, not use
review/text: The actual mate should be placed in a place for decoration. The border of where the metal rim meets the gourd is faulty, and hot water seeps out of it, and onto your hand. The bombilla is fine, and the yerba was as well. However I prefer Rosamonte Yerba.

review/summary: Great mate (yerba), awful mate (gourd)
review/text: Taragui is a great yerba mate. It has a good mix of palitos (little wood bits, or stems like they say) and the actual mate. Seems to be the same stuff that's exported to Chile (where I got to know it.)<br /><br />The bombilla (straw) gives me mixed feelings...<br />Negative: can't open it to clean the inside<br />It seems to let more tea up through the straw than I'm used to (I've mostly used those spirely ones, not  the spoon type ones)<br />Positive: It's sturdy, and I'm not afraid of it getting loose after a couple of washings (as often happens with the openable ones)<br />It's spoon shaped, making it great for cleaning out the yerba (tea) after you're done!<br /><br />The gourd is awful. It seems quite unsanitary (bits of mate get up into the metal rim, where I can imagine stays wet for quite long and just seems like a hot-bed of gross things growing. It's also tiny and quite tipsy... you can't really leave the gourd with the spoon inside of it unattended. I don't know if I'll continue using this in the meantime, or switching to a mug... but definitely having my boyfriend bring up a legit gourd from Chile!!!!<br /><br />But... I wish Taragui sold individual bags of the mate con palitos here on Amazon... or even 2 packs... My boyfriend and I definitely don't go through 10 pounds of the stuff in a year...

review/summary: Fabulous Pumpkin Bread Mix (Yes, it needs canned pumpkin.)
review/text: Dassant is one of my favorite brands for baking mixes, and the pumpkin bread is no exception. This mix has a delicious flavor with just the right amount of cinnamon and nutmeg. Yes, the mix does require canned pumpkin, but there really isn't any way to have authentic pumpkin flavor without adding the real thing.<br /><br />Besides adding the pumpkin, the mix requires water, eggs and oil. Good additions to the mix include 1/2  to 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans and/or 1/2 to 1 cup of chocolate chips (mini-chips do not sink to the bottom of the pan.)  The finished bread freezes well which is helpful if baking in advance. The pumpkin icing recipe on the box is quite good. It requires some of the canned pumpkin (the entire can isn't needed for the mix), butter, milk, vanilla, cinnamon and powdered sugar.<br /><br />When I can find Dassant mixes I buy them and here's why. The Dassant ingredient list includes six items - enriched bleached flour, sugar, spices, salt, leavening and either soybean or canola oil. The list on a name brand spice cake mix I had in my pantry has 18 ingredients including partially hydrogenated soybean oil, corn syrup, artificial color and a number of unpronounceable items. I love to bake from scratch but sometimes I don't have time. Using a mix is a time saver but I still want it to taste free of chemicals and be as natural as possible. This brand makes that possible.

review/summary: AMAZINGLY GOOD PUMPKIN SPICE BREAD MIX
review/text: This is the BEST Pumpkin Spice Bread Mix that I have found. Short of starting from scratch, I do not think that you can do better.<br />This Mix asks you to add some simple ingredients, which do include Pumpkin. I love to take a mix and "mix it up" with the things I like. I add nuts/lots of nuts. I add dried fruit/lots of dried fruit. (I think you could add whatever you have a yen for...chocolate chips do not sound good to me, but maybe to YOU!). Then just add a bit more liquid ad a bit more self rising flour, and even spices...whatever it takes to even out the taste so it comes out the way you want this to! You can really "do your own thing" with this bread and it will still come out and taste great.<br />I have even gone right down the list and made it just like the box said! Scrumptious!<br />I always cook this in a stoneware pan and it comes out evenly cooked throughout...just add more lenghth to your cook time.<br />Well, you can tell by my comments that I simply use this as a base to make multiple different kinds of Pumpkin Breads. My friends love all the varieties. I have already ordered extra boxes and will be giving Dassant Pumpkin Bread as one of my Christmas gifts this year to my neighbors and frieds.<br />So, I definitely recommend this. It is easy to make. It is easy to make different "kinds" of you own Personal Pumpkin Bread using this as the basis. It is a dream come true. Dassant does all the basics and puts it in a box. You add extras, or not, to make your own creation. Everbody thinks I am a great baker, but it is Dassant who does the basic baking for me. I love this and think you will also!

review/summary: Delcious pumpkin mix! Yes, it needs canned pumpkin!
review/text: I received a box of dassant pumpkin spice mix in a goodie bag for a fall wedding last year.  I decided to give it a try once I arrived back from the wedding.  I am sure glad that I did!  I am not much of a baker and this one falls into the "quick and easy" category.  It does call for canned pumpkin which really isn't that big a deal for me.  Otherwise, it needs two eggs, oil and water.  The mix produces very delicious pumpkin bread with hints of nutmeg and spice.  Excellent for fall baking! I plan to order another six-pack this fall for sure!

review/summary: add pumpkin?
review/text: I started to make this last night, I ordered it awhile back, and I read the instructions. Add pumpkin? This is a mix. I bought a mix so I could make pumpkin bread without having to have pumpkin. If I'm going to add pumpkin I may as well use plain flour and make it from scratch. Waste of money for me. If you're the kind of person who hires a maid and then cleans up yourself, or if you buy a dog and then do your own barking, you might like it. I'd rather have a mix that's ready to go with the usual mix-liike ingredients of egg, oil and water.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: Artificially flavored, and it is obvious by the taste.  This stuff is horrible.  It's like the imitation vanilla extract vs the real thing, no contest.  Blech.  It's not as bad as the cherry, which tastes like cough syrup, but this is pretty bad as well.

review/summary: Good price, but ancient product.
review/text: I bought these because of the price per volume... however, do note, the 'manufacture date' on the bottle dates these as having been produced 5/03/2001.  That's over 10 years ago.  I used McCormick's own date decoder, btw.  I know imitation vanilla should keep 4-5 years if stored properly... but 10+ years seems to be pushing things.<br /><br />I destroyed my taste buds through years of smoking, so the loss of potency isn't likely to be a big issue for me. YMMV.

review/summary: Organix Organic Adult Dog Food by Castor & Pollux 12.7 oz.
review/text: I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79-2.99 plus $2.31 tax = $37.79--12-12.7 oz cans.<br /><br />There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain-free, and those that have grain products such as flaxseed meal.<br /><br />My two ShihTzus Darby and Hampshire prefer turkey and chicken over beef and lamb so I purchased the following formulas:  chicken & vegetable; turkey, carrot & potato; chicken & organic brown rice; turkey & vegetable, chicken & brown rice; turkey vegetable; turkey & vegetable (grain-free); and chicken & vegetable (grain-free).<br /><br />Darby and Hampshire's typical diet is roast chicken with brown rice and mix vegetables.<br /><br />Their snacks normally consist of non-nitrate hot dogs, pan fried chicken livers, butter fried sweet potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes, turkey meatballs, cheese wedges, Bullies, Merrick sesame sticks, 2-TBS of Haagen-Daz vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, and the occasional non-nitrate cold cut.<br /><br />After tropical storm Debbie swept through Central Florida, I knew I needed to find a nonperishable dog food to stock for the hurricane season in preparation for power outages.<br /><br />I had searched for years for a high quality nontoxic and reasonably priced dog food that Darby and Hampshire would actually eat.  The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years.

review/summary: Extremely delicious-- the best sweet barbecue sauce I've ever had
review/text: (At time of this writing, due to the product's newness, there appear to be multiple product pages for the same product in the same quantity.  Shop around.)<br /><br />I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert. Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores. I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun. We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor. It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce. In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like. (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor. Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue. As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.  Mmmmmm.

review/text: Ordered this as a gift and was surprised by how small it was once it arrived.  All of the items were flattened into the little basket, rather than standing up as shown in the product photo.  The plastic wrap covering the package had a hole in it, which further decreased the attractiveness of the package.  The recipient said that he enjoyed most of the snacks, and he seemed to like that they were unusual, offbeat things, but I don't think I would repeat this gift given the lack of value.

review/summary: A rather boring combination of snacks
review/text: Gluten-free is the new black and for people suffering from celiac disease this can be a nice combination to give as a gift basket.<br /><br />While the snacks were tasty, these are all things sold at the corner grocery store these days.  Each item in this combination were either one or two servings of a product and weren't anything the least bit exotic or hard to get.  Everything except for the ginger snaps were national brands easily found (the ginger snaps were imported from England and did not have nutritional info)<br />Speaking of nutritional info, most of the items were high-fat and/or high sugar and weren't terribly healthy.  All were yummy and the popcorn was my favorite, but I only ate it in small doses since the sugar and fat was way too much for me.<br /><br />The packaging of the products was less than inviting.  A simple ribbon with a chipboard basket and brown paper scraps didn't exactly scream "gift basket".  I think the packing material the basket was packed it was more attractive than the bedding in this basket.<br /><br />If you are desperate to give a quick and easy gift to someone with gluten intolerance (congrats on the baby?), this fills the bill.  However, you'll save money and provide a more balancing and attractive alternative if you can do it yourself.

review/text: After reading the reviews from others here I was expecting my package to arrive looking like a flattened crushed mess - but it didn't!  My package was very well protected, double boxed and arrived looking perfect.  I had never tried gluten free products before and didn't know what to expect.  I found the items in this basket to be good, maybe a bit dry and bland but they were snickerdoodle cookies, nuts and crackers.  Good for a gift for someone who eats gluten free, looks nice and a nice variety of snacks. I did think the price was a bit high for what you receive but maybe all gluten free products are expensive. I would buy this again as a gift but not for myself.

review/summary: Very Good, for anyone with Expensive Taste
review/text: Please pardon my lousy attempt at a pun in the title of this review. But the reason for my 3-star rating of this product had to do with the cost. VERY expensive for the amount of product you receive.<br /><br />Now, besides the cost, I enjoyed everything about this snack basket. Such as:<br /><br />--It is nicely packaged, and if you click on "other views", and look at photo #2, you'll see how it arrived. Presented well, if you are giving it as a gift.<br /><br />--Black Truffle & White Cheddar popcorn had an unusual, peppery flavor, and the cheddar flavor came through after a few chews. The smell of the popcorn (from the truffle oil) was also appetizing.<br /><br />--Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper Potato Chips had great crunch, were salty in a good way, and the pepper flavor was there, but not overwhelming.<br /><br />--Garden Select Vegetable Crisps had a cheesy flavor, nice crunch, and were not too salty.<br /><br />--Lazy Day Ginger Snaps. Eight cookies total, with two being enough to satisfy thanks to the "snap" of the ginger, and also the crispness of the cookies. Not too sweet. Great with coffee.<br /><br />--Almond Crunch and Valdosta Pecans: Both of these had a nice sweet-to-salty flavor ratio, and were nice and crunchy. The pecans had the added fruity flavor boost of cranberries.<br /><br />All in all, these were delicious snacks, but unfortunately they are a bit too expensive for my "champagne taste on a beer budget" life.

review/text: OK I know when you order gift baskets you are paying in large part for the convenience of someone else purchasing, arranging, boxing and shipping  your gift.  But almost $35 for six small snack items that could be bought almost anywhere??? No way.  The six products you can see in the picture are exactly what you get - two one serving size bags of Boulder Canyon Chips that here in Boulder at least you can get out of almost any vending machine, some ginger snap cookies, a snack size bag of fancy popcorn and two small packages of nut based snacks that are nothing special.  The basket I got isn't even a basket but just a cardboard container shaped like one.  The bow looked nice and the whole thing was well packaged which is why I am giving it two stars instead of the one it probably deserves.

review/summary: Not Gift Quality
review/text: I'd rather send flowers to a friend who is following a gluten-free diet than send this overpriced snack basket.  The price is not my only qualm, however.  The basket's presentation is lacking as well as most of the food itself.  The basket is neither sturdy nor attractive and was full of wadded and shredded paper with the snacks resting on top.  The measly portions only offer 1300 calories or so of food.  One of the snack bags is only 70 calories!  $34.99 is an awful lot to spend on around 1300 calories of gluten-free food.  The snacking nuts were tasty, in my opinion, but it went downhill from there with the poor cookies resting at the bottom.  Their flavor was ok, but the texture was so sandy and gritty that they really weren't enjoyable fare. Save your money and shop elsewhere for your gluten-free friends.

review/summary: PICTURES CAN BE DECEIVING
review/text: The gift basket arrived this morning.  In usual Amazon style, the basket was packaged very well for shipping (double boxed).  However, when I opened the inner box, I was immediately disappointed.  The basket looked nothing like the main picture on Amazon.  All SIX (6) sample-sized gluten free treats were packaged flatly inside the crocodile leather-LOOKING cardboard basket.  NOTE: If you click on 'other views' there is a picture of how the basket actually appears upon arrival.<br /><br />The basket contained (SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION):<br />Almond Crunch<br />Black Truffle + White Cheddar Popcorn<br />Garden Select Vegetable Chips<br />Ginger Snaps<br />Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper Kettle Chips<br />Valdosta Pecans<br /><br />I found the overall dimensions to be only 11.5L x 7.5D x 4.5H at the WIDEST points.  The basket is still moderately attractive, but not nearly as attractive as pictured.<br /><br />I had ordered the basket as a birthday gift for a dear friend with Celiac Disease.  She was very touched I had found a basket of treats which were specifically suitable for her condition.  However, as she opened the basket, I was somewhat embarrassed at how little each package contained.  Each product realistically offered nothing more than a generous handful of the snack.<br /><br />I would estimate the retail value of each of the six snacks included to be between $1 and $2.  As stated, the basket itself is nothing more than embossed cardboard of low-end dollar store quality.  The ribbon, shrink wrap and shredded paper filler might add another dollar or two to the cost.  And, of course, we have to take into consideration that as a "free shipping" item through Amazon, the shipping cost is most likely around $10.  With shipping making up nearly half of the cost, I estimate the value of the basket to be roughly $25 SHIPPED.  I believe the basket and contents itself to be worth more like $15.<br /><br />At $34.99, I do NOT believe the basket is a good value.  If you look carefully, you will note beside the price it states ($26.92/lb).  You should use that notation as your 'value indicator.'<br /><br />In conclusion, the basket DOES make an impression as a THOUGHTFUL gift for someone who has a special condition.  However, you could make a basket of your own gluten free treats for a far better value.

review/text: There is no question that with gourmet food, you would expect it to be a great buy at a exquisite price. for Wine.com, they have made some really great products over the past several years. For me though, I would expect them to make a great gift basket for exciting and luxurious lovers of food. Well, they have tried with their gluten free snack basket. The idea isn't such a bad one. Yet you do get what you pay for. The only problem is that you would expect more. While I do enjoy the taste of the pecans and the cracked pepper potato chips. You really would expect it to be less in price for what it is worth, but there could have been much more in the way of food. Still, if you are looking for a nice present for a loved one or a moment of joy, that try Wine.com's gift basket.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: My new favorite snack--and it is GF!!
review/text: We happened to be buying lunch "to go" at a vegetarian coffee shop, and decided we wanted munchies.  They had this brand in two flavors (the other was cheddar), so we took one of each.  It would be hard to decide if these are more cracker or chip, but they were phenomenal!  And, best thing about them--they will serve the gluten-free eaters (two of which I have at home).  I could only get the small packages, so came online to see if I could find large packages.<br /><br />After having these, you won't have that greasy, stuffed-from-junk-food feeling.  I cannot imagine ANYbody of ANY age not liking these!  I hope they become more readily available.  I wish my health-food store sold them by the case, as we are not able to get there often due to distance.  YUMMY--and I am not a junk-food junkie.

review/summary: Best Widely Available Enchilada Sauce in Existence
review/text: Yes.  Enchilada sauce varies WIDELY from manufacturer to manufacturer.  Las Palmas is god awful.  your "store brand" generic is, undoubtedly, also awful.<br /><br />Hatch, New Mexico is widely known as being the source of either THE BEST or at least places in the top 5 of the THE BEST CHILIS IN THE WORLD.<br /><br />Hatch enchilada sauce is absolutely the best enchilada sauce you can buy.  it is used at thousands of restaurants across the country.<br /><br />little known secret:<br /><br />it is used at real mexican restaurants (not like la salsa or baja fresh, but REAL restaurants) across the southwest for their enchiladas (no, they dont make it themselves).<br /><br />buy this if you want to make good food.<br /><br />but GOD I feel terrible for you guys.  I looked up the prices on a few websites, and good lord, this stuff is horrendously expensive wherever you are from.<br /><br />it is $2 a can (1 can) in southern california (albertsons).  it is 3.80 before shipping on amazon.<br /><br />it almost makes it too expensive...<br /><br />but it is absolutely worth it, even at that price (although a can is about what it would take to make 6 enchiladas)

I will continue to purchase them but I prefer the glass bottles as opposed to the plastic packaging. To me, they taste better. In fact, if they come to me in plastic bottles, I will send them back. Similarly, if I find them in a store, I will not buy the ones in plastic bottles.

review/summary: Worst sugar free vanilla syrup I've tried
review/text: I've tried all of the sugar free vanilla syrups that I can get my hands on, and this was the most chemical tasting of all of them. I also didn't care for the small bottles. I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GYJUHO">Torani Syrup, Sugar Free, FRENCH Vanilla, 33.8 Ounce (Pack of 3)</a>. You get 8.5 extra oz. per bottle, which ends up being A LOT more syrup. Also, Torani is sweeter so you can use less. Skip this, I've bought them all, this just isn't as good as other options.

review/text: I've been using DaVinci Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup for almost 6 months now. The vanilla flavor of this brand is far preferable to Torani (or any of the other brands I've tasted, for that matter.) You can use this stuff to add flavor to just about anything, but my personal favorites are 0% greek yogurt and skim milk.<br /><br />Pretty much the only drawback of this product is the price, as it can get pretty expensive if you use it everyday. If you can afford it, though, there's no better way to get that vanilla taste without the excess calories.

review/summary: Yummy-licious
review/text: Well, I purchased the extra large bag at Costco and when I first bit into the Sea Salt flavor one, it tasted so healthy, filled with a hearty grain,  These chips have been beyond sufficient and so delicious for dips and just if you are craving a hearty, full grain chip.  So, I had a feeling they would be great.  After reading some reviews, I was just a tinnnnnnny bit cautious since a few said they couldn't even taste the 'ranch"...I was hesitant to spend the money for inexpensive ones I would be able to buy at Costco since there had been reports that the ranch wasn't even noticeable.  HOWEVER, I got these today and tasted them....the 'ranch' flavoring is so yummy-licious.  It is definitely apparent that the seasoning is there and you still gt that hearty grain taste.  I could not stop eating them. I love the taste and texture of chips, but really wanted and needed organic, healthy ingredients as well as a trusted brand.  Although the Sea Salt flavor is great, having more of a fun flavor such as ranch is so addictive. II would only say that if you get these ranch flavored, tortilla chips, be warned, they are absolutely divine and you might not be able to stop.  Top ten purchases for organic food products.  BTW, Late July Products are well trusted and I love their products.

review/text: Amazing.  I used to make my own pasta sauce from fresh tomatoes constantly, and I hate to admit to being lazy, but this stuff is so good that it makes it unnecessary to go to the trouble.  The company is also very nice.  They have several other incredible flavors, but Amazon is unfortunately unreliable about offering them consistently.  I probably order about four boxes of their sauces per month, including this flavor.  They are quite good for use as sauce bases, even though they are very tasty on their own - "eat right of the jar" tasty.  If you start eating out of the jar, be careful because you may not be able to stop yourself.<br /><br />The little jars the sauces come packed in are very useful for storage - I bring my lunch to work in them, as they are exactly the right size for a healthy meal.<br /><br />Warning - some people have reported receiving broken jars when ordering these and having them shipped via ground.  I have Amazon Prime, so they come two-day, and the box is always in flawless condition.

review/text: I love this sauce. I've eaten it by itself, and periodically I add Trader Joe's turkey or beef meatballs, and it's always delicious. I keep it in my freezer, and I can have a "home cooked" sauce in minutes. Better than any jar sauce, and better than a lot of homemade and restaurant sauces I've had. Natural ingredients with just the right blend of flavors and no sugar added.<br /><br />The Barely Bolognese and the Vodka sauces are my favorites in the Scarpetta line. I purchased a sampler for my first purchase, and all of them were excellent, but I've repurchased Barely Bolgnese, Vodka, and the Puttanseca sauces again.<br /><br />I understand that they use to have some shipping quality control issues, but I think they have resolved the problems. I have never had any damaged shipments. The four heavy-duty plastic containers are packed in a very heavy cardboard box and is stabilized with a styrofoam sheet. Each container lid has a seal, and all of mine have been in tact upon arrival. This box is then put in an outer shipping box, and cushioned with air pillows.

Absolutely fabulous!  Scarpetta actually did not send me what I ordered -- I had ordered a four-pack of Vodka sauce, and a four-pack of marinara.  They accidentally sent one four-pack assortment.  I am so glad, because now I have tried the Arrabiatta and the marinara, and they are also fantastic.

Adding hamburger to this makes an absolutely FANTASTIC meat sauce and I'm sad that it's out of stock so often.<br />I haven't had any problems with jars showing up leaking but I had most of them shipped 2 day with Prime so everything tends to show up less smashed up compared to letting the shipping companies play kickball with your package for a week.  And I like the little plastic jars that you can use to store stuff and bring lunch and whatnot.<br />Just remember to keep and eye on the expiration date, and if it's about to expire throw it in the freezer for storage or it'll go bad and grow weird dark stuff on the bottom (none of my bolognese expired because they were so delicious I ate them the quickest but some of the other flavors expired on me).

review/text: I have tried 4 of the Scarpetta brand sauces and a spread.  They are all excellent.  On par or better than other premium sauces.  Nice big chucks of tomatos, well spiced and natural ingredients.  That said: I have experienced the same problem as other reviewers whose package arrives with leaking or swollen bottles.  Amazon provided a quick replacement but the replacement had a leaking container too.  If you're feeling lucky, buy this sauce.  Inspect each container immediately upon receipt.  Open the lid and make sure the seal is intact.  If the container is swollen, don't open it unless you want to clean sauce off your ceiling.  My personal odds are 4 good batches to 2 leaking batches.

review/summary: Scarpetta is top notch
review/text: Really excellent pasta sauce with really excellent packaging.  Not only is the pasta sauce awesome, fresh and free of weird wonder words but the containers are wonderful to reuse.  I like to make my own sauce and I use this containers to freeze mine for later use.  The come packaged in a box with extra cushion and I have never had a leaking one yet.  Highly recommended for so many reasons!  I have tried this one and the tuscon vodka and really could speak highly about both.  I am actually building a pasta basket for a christmas present this year and including both sauces.

review/summary: Absolutely horrible off artificial taste!
review/text: This product has an absolutely horrible taste!  It doesn't taste anything like lemonade or like lime.  There is just this completely off horrible artificial tart/bitter taste.  After a couple tastes, my mother and I decided to dump all that we'd mixed down the drain and throw out the rest of the mix.

review/summary: Product Great, Not Packed Well Before Shipment
review/text: This grapeseed oil is great!  I heartily recommend it as a nutritious alternative to olive oil -- the taste is much lighter. ;o) This brand is packaged in a metal, light-proof container, so the nutrients aren't destroyed by light.  I have purchased it locally and decided to save the trip to the store by buying it at Amazon for about the same price.<br /><br />  The three-pack wasn't wrapped together, but was three separate cans.  They appeared to have several dents caused by rolling around in the insufficient packaging.  That might have been acceptable (well, not really), but the cans also had dirt all over the tops of them.  The dirt and dents made them look like something from the dollar-store discount bin!  Initially I received an email from Amazon stating that they were non-returnable as grocery items, but in the end they did pay for return shipping and reimbursement of the order.  I would rate the product 5 stars, but knocked it down to 4 on the review due to the shipping and dirt (more than just a little 'dust') on the product.

review/summary: I fell in love with my hot sauce.
review/text: Trappeys, Hot Red Devil is a great hot sauce if you like it hot but not so hot.  It has a great taste.  I put on chips, mangoes, vegetables, meats or anything you can think of.  My mom loves it on saltine crackers.  Enjoy Hot Red Devil.  I couldn't find it in stores, so stock up.
