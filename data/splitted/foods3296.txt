review/summary: Poor quality beans.
review/text: I purchased this product on the off chance that zero reviews but first page listing on the "bestselling" decaf whole bean page meant that it was decent coffee.  I was wrong.<br /><br />First, the bag looked like it had been on a shelf for several years.  The plastic was severely scuffed and the label was very worn, as if it had been shifted around in a bin for a very long amount of time.  There was no roasting date or expiration date, so it's impossible to ascertain how old the beans really are.  Isn't that illegal these days?<br /><br />Secondly, the beans have almost no smell and are not even slightly oily.  Compared to a really good bean, such as the Java Trading Company's Espresso Jet City, these are an utter failure.  Even when finely ground, these Organic Camano Island Peru Decaf. have almost no aroma, and what little they do have is not appealing.  It literally smells like caked dirt, not like coffee should smell.  Sure, it's dark roasted, but even the inside of the bag is suspiciously missing even a hint of the oils prevalent on top quality beans.<br /><br />Lastly, when brewed in either a pump espresso maker, a French press, or a drip coffee machine, the brew's complete lack of crema, body, or aroma is the final nail in the coffin.  Starbucks is better than this stuff.  This Camano Islands Peru Decaf isn't just slightly bad; it isn't even worthy of being placed in a Folger's can.<br /><br />Please look elsewhere for a good decaf organic bean, and don't make the same mistake I did.

review/summary: The Tastiest Peach Drink
review/text: Originally I stumbled across this product at Sam's Club it was on closeout and I decided to try it because the price was right.  I had it for while before I decided to taste it. I am a big fan of the drink fuzzy navels, however I do not drink alcohol anymore.  Well let me tell you, if you take Orchard Peach and just add a little to orange juice over ice it is better then any fuzzy navel I have ever had and it is so delicious.<br /><br />After searching and searching for this product I finally found it and it is still a wonderful product.  Without a doubt I will be ordering lots more of the Orchard Peach.  Please do not blame me when you pour it over orange juice and you become hooked too.

review/summary: Best Peach Syrup Anywhere!
review/text: I buy this same product (same size) at Sam's Club for $4.98/bottle.  I pour just a small amount (1/2 oz?) into the bottom of my 16-oz. tea glass then fill it up with brewed plain unsweetened tea from the pitcher in the refrigerator.  It's GREAT!  And keeps you from having to add sugar to the tea (of course, this syrup has plenty of sugar).  Also good with iced water to make a cool peach drink, and I'm going to try the virgin fuzzy navel someone else mentioned by adding it to my fresh-squeezed orange juice tomorrow morning.  I guess if you don't have a Sam's Club the $11 price here isn't awful since a few 32 oz. bottles would be a pretty bulky shipment, and you're getting free shipping.

review/text: I was trying to figure out where I may have purchased this smoothie mix and just cannot remember.  So I decided to go to the trusty Amazon.com.  You can find most anything here.<br />The Smoothie mix itself is phenomenal.  Very good taste for peach lovers.  Just add ice, pour, blend, and enjoy.  That's IT!  Zero effort required.  It can be sweet if you add too much mixture, so follow the directions and all should be well.  The only gripe that I have is I'm SURE 100% SURE that I did not pay $18.00 for this mix as this seller is advertising it.  So if you can find it in your local supermarket, purchase it there.  This is just too expensive. ENJOY!

review/summary: Delicious and most versatile snack ever!
review/text: When I first saw this product, I thought "yeah right, my daughter would never go for this". I thought the texture would be funny and I thought that the spinach taste would probably be overpowering. Boy was I wrong! My 2 year old song inhaled it. My daughter wasn't too sure about the texture at first but then it grew on her. I tried it myself and it was delicious! I also love that you can just grab it and go. I have some in my trunk's "emergency kit", in case the kids get hungry and don't have a snack. I just throw one in my daughter's lunchbox and I'm done as far as her recess snack. Here's what I love most about it though, you can use this puree as a dipping sauce for pancakes or waffles. You can add it to the egg coating for french toast, you can use it instead of jelly in their pb&j sandwiches, you can add it to chocolate milk and blend it. I've even made chocolate frozen pops by combining this with chocolate milk and freezing it. So any product that will make my children eat spinach, is good in my book. It is AWESOME!!!!! I recommend it to all my mom friends.

review/summary: Tastes good, good for you
review/text: This rice tastes great. The price is right, and you get a good taste with great texture. We ate it all in just a few months (we're voracious rice eaters, I guess!) and I'll be ordering some more once I get through some other rice I have.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />- Although it fills my house with a delicious smell or cooking rice, it doesn't have a jasmine fragrance or taste. No biggie if you're looking for a regular brown rice, but might not be your best bet if you're hoping for a strong jasmine taste. This could have been just my bag, so I'd be curious to see others' experiences.<br /><br />- Make sure to rinse and drain your rice. This removes some starch, especially on brown rices, and may slightly reduce cook times.<br /><br />- I cook my rice in a Zojorushi rice maker, and always cook brown rice with less water than the markings on the machine. I use the same rule for this brown rice as for other browns - I pour in the drained rice first, then fill it up to just below the fill line for white rice.

review/text: This product is very good, but my wife and I agreed that it was impossible to tell you were eating sweet potatoes, rather than regular potatoes.  I expected the flavor to be distinguishable.  Oh well.  The only other caution is to not overcook this product.  It will start to get mushy.  That may be characteristic of any gnochhi, but I thought I would include this point as well.

Took other's advice and didn't overcook the gnocchi and it turned out quite tasty, all in under 5 minutes.  My husband licked the bowl and we'd both recommend it for an easy entree.  Definitely cannot tell the sweet potato is there though, so if you are looking for sweet potato flavor, look elsewhere.

review/summary: I didn't like these....at first
review/text: I bought these at a retail store because I try to eat as healthy as I can.  The combination of whole wheat and sweet potato sounded irresistible.  I cooked about half of the pack and I did not like them much when I first ate them.  I could detect no sweet potato taste and they were a bit mushy...I guess I overcooked them.  They are quite flavorless too.  So, I added a littled salt to the water when I cooked the rest of them and cooked them a little less...added some spaghetti sauce and parmesan cheese.  Delicious!  When these are cooked properly and doctored up with some extras they are absolutely scrumptious little dumplings.  If you plan to eat them plain, prepare to be disappointed.

Add just enough water to cover.  Heat on medium until water boils; immediately reduce to simmer; test for tenderness with the tip of a knife after 2 to 3 min.  Gnocchi will absorb water and increase in size.  As soon as they are tender, remove from heat and drain in collander.  Return to pan and add sauce, seasonings, and grated cheese if desired.  Just heat through, then serve.

review/summary: only okay
review/text: For those who aren't familiar with gnocchi, as I wasn't, don't expect a sweet potato taste.  This is pretty disappointing, but I'm giving the product three stars because there was no problem with freshness or air-tightness, as some negative comments indicate, and I plan to follow up this tentative review when I figure out the best way to prepare this product.  I like the health benefits of a sweet-potato/whole-wheat combination, and now that I have six packages of these things, I can experiment with different recipes.  The consistency is like a dumpling, but the taste is pretty bland.  Of course, the taste of any pasta without sauce is going to be bland, so the problem is to figure out the best combination of sauce, spices, vegetables, whatever, to add.  I anticipate chopping the gnocchi into smaller pieces to garnish a dish with a different main ingredient. (?) Any suggestions out there from real chefs?<br /><br />Addendum:  It looks like most of the internet recipes for recommended gnocchi sauce are pretty traditional pasta sauces:  tomato, cheese, etc.  My instinct is that some of the hardier sauces, for instance those that include meat or sausage in particular, might be the best bet.  My own thinking is that stews or thick soups might benefit from adding gnocchi.  I don't think, preliminarily, I'm going to develop a taste for gnocchi if it's too naked.  I also wonder how much tastier they would be if I simply made them myself.  I'll report back if I find anything that works (at least for me)!

They cook in no time at all... three minutes. The sauce needs to have some zing as they do not have much flavor on their own. I make a spicy sauce with cayenne, hot pepper seeds, tomato sauce, and creamy goat cheese. Dinner can be prepared and ready to be eaten in 10-15 minutes. The best "fast food" that you are going to find.

I imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude/pressure.  I cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as I did not eat them.  The silver lining: Amazon has GREAT customer service.

review/text: I love this gnocchi.  I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I'm trying to eat healthier.  I figured I would try it and I thought it was delicious. I added a little marinara and it was perfect. I will definitely buy this on a regular basis. I agree with some of the other comments that it does not have a strong sweet potato flavor, but that's probably why I liked it so much.

review/text: I really liked these gnocchi, they were delicious Though it's true what the other reviews said about not a strong sweet potato flavor. So I microwaved a sweet potato and addded it to the gnocchi. It made a nice meal. I gave a couple of packages to friends and they liked the taste as well. You just have to not overcook. I bought the Gia Russo whole wheat spaghetti and liked that as well. I am now going to order Gia Russo mini gnocchi.

review/summary: Very good & consistent Columbian coffee
review/text: I have been drinking this coffee for more than 20 years.  It is a consistently roasted and good quality Columbian coffee. The value is excellent as it tastes rich but not bitter, slightly acidic - but a typical arabica Columbian coffee. I prefer Seattle's Best balanced blends but they are more expensive and harder to find. 8 o'clock coffee is available, less expensive, and always a pleasant taste & finish. Generally, I grind whole beans and brew in a french press. Drip brewers and 8 o'clock coffees work fine too. Most of the other 8 o'clock blends are good quality and consistent. They are a better choice than the canned brands, in my opinion.

review/summary: Bean Quality Has Dropped
review/text: These Colombian coffee beans used to be a good everyday/nothing fancy coffee.  I've bought them 2 times in the last 6 months (& many times in the past years); they are not as good as they used to be.  They claim the beans are the same even though the packaging changed but I don't believe it.  The beans are now more bitter & have less flavor.  I also found more quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.  My most recent bag had 9.<br /><br />I've stopped buying this coffee.  Having a good cup of coffee in the morning is one of life's little pleasures for me & so it's worth paying more for good coffee.  So far, I've bought these 3 coffees from Amazon & they are excellent:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027Z8VES">Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Pouch</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041QIIYY">Weaver's Coffee and Tea, French Roast Organic Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>

review/summary: unbeatable price, quality of product OK
review/text: I bought this item at the grocery store a week before I bought this package deal expecting the exact same product, but at lower price.  The seal for these packs of coffee was melted open so they were not air tight.  It could of happened in transport but the beans were much drier than the coffee I bought from the grocery store.<br /><br />The beans from the grocery were much darker and shiny.  These are dry and lighter because of the broken seal.  I payed about 6 dollars at the store which would of made this deal 24 dollars total instead of 19.<br /><br />Against my better judgement, I've been drinking this coffee for the past week.  The coffee is fine and it's hard to tell the difference but I swear it is less flavorful than the product from the grocery store.

review/text: I was looking for a weekday bean so I could drink something decent while on-the-go and differentiate from my high quality weekend coffee. This option was less expensive and had great reviews on Amazon but this coffee is gross and not good, people! Honestly, Folgers is better tasting and less bitter. I grind my beans for each pot so I worked a little with each pot and zero change, still bitter/acidic and with a slightly bad aftertaste--this IS better than Dunkin Donuts brand take home beans. So, my hunt goes on for an inexpensive weekday coffee. Until I find something, I'll stick with my Alakef brand weekend brew all week long!<br />Good: Price, free home delivery with Prime<br />Bad: aftertaste

review/summary: Good Coffee.  Excellent Price.  But French Roast if Far Better
review/text: While the Eight O'Clock Coffee Columbian Roast produced a decent brew, it is not nearly as good as the Eight O'Clock Coffee French Roast.  I was actually surprised by this because most of the Eight O'Clock Roasts are REALLY good.  This one happened to be standard - and a little disappointing.  I tried it because the price of the French Roast has gone sky high on Amazon over the last month or so.<br /><br />I do very much like the 11-ounce bags delivered in a package of four - as this keeps the coffee beans fresher in a vacuum sealed package for a longer period of time.  One disappointment though is that these coffee beans seem drier than they should be.  I like to open the bag to a fresh-smelling and looking roasted bean.  That was not the case with these beans.<br /><br />On the whole, the coffee was really good for excellent price, but definitely not what I expect from the Eight O'Clock label as I've experienced it with other roasts in the past.  I may have to switch back the French Roast (hopefully the price will go down again), or find another brand next time.

review/summary: Really excellent coffee (for my taste)
review/text: This coffee (in the bean format) has become hard to find at my local (Dallas area) supermarkets. Don't know why? Consumers Report had a "taste-off" some time ago and this was the winner - and I concur. I do grind my beans and like a 100% Columbian variety so this was ideal - until it started to disappear from store shelves. I've complained to no avail, so I've resorted to buying on the Internet. It stores well in a cool, dark place so it's unlikely that there will be any negative effect from buying four bags at a time. Anyway, for my tastes, this is the best that I've tried and believe me, I've tried a bunch when this coffee became difficult (and later impossible) to find.

review/summary: the foundation upon which to build the perfect cup of morning brew
review/text: Ever since reading about Consumer Reports selection of 8 O'Clock Columbian (not their other offerings), me and my extended family have been delighted with this affordable performer. It is utterly mellow and caramelly. I'm a firm believer in grinding my beans right before use, using fresh, filtered not-quite-boiling water, stirring that beautiful mixture up in a stainless steel French press (better than constantly replacing broken glass decanters!), waiting about 3 minutes to steep, and then pressing and pouring that frothy love into a waiting mug. It's surely the only way to make it through this crazy days--starting off with a perfect, fortifying cup of 8 O'Clock Columbian. Sometimes, if I'm feeling the need for a little extra smokiness, I'll add just a tablespoon of French Roast beans to the mix (I prefer Peet's and their glistening, almost fishy-smelling charcoal-colored beans). But make no mistake, it's the 8 O'Clock Columbian that makes it work.

review/text: I lived in Sweden for about a year and became accustomed to their various high quality coffees as well as the concentration of their coffees.  Having thoroughly enjoyed the likes of Zoegas, Gevalia, Arvid Nordquist and so on; I have high standards.<br /><br />I came back to the US with 9 packages of coffee in hand knowing that they would soon run out.. and they did.  I tried many many brands but found nothing that I liked.  In Sweden the "scoop to water" ratio is much higher than in the US.  Unfortunately most coffee brands in the US taste even worse when you scale them to Swedish standards.<br /><br />This brand and flavor I have found does the best job in my opinion.  It's still a far stretch from the likes of Zoegas but it's far better than Starbucks etc..

Those who are the real purists usually feel the whole bean is the best way to ensure freshness.<br /><br />Especially if you drink your coffee black, this is a fantastic choice that I have found to be totally satisfying; I encourage you to try it for yourself!

review/summary: So far - so goooooood
review/text: Although I have been drinking coffee for years, I am a newbie at grinding my own coffee. Based on some better than average reviews and readings, I opted for Eight O'Clock coffee for my first coffee bean purchase. I ordered the 4-pack of 11 oz coffee and upon opening the box I noticed that one appeared to be vacuum packed and the other bags were not. Also, one of the bags was not sealed. So quality control appears to be an issue here. Now for the good stuff. When opening the first bag to use for my morning coffee, the wonderful aroma from the beans was very pleasant and inviting to the senses. The beans ground very well to my liking and my first cup was very balanced and smooth. So far I have used two bags of this coffee and have not been disappointed. I do think, however, that after reading more of the negative reviews I will experiment with other coffees for comparison purposes to find that "perfect" cup. Not that this coffee was lacking in taste because I did give it four stars, but being a newbie I realize there are many brands and varieties to choose from and I plan to sample many more.

review/summary: The King is Dead; Long Live the King
review/text: We've been drinking coffee for some time - it's a demanded morning ritual, now.  My wife is an excellent cook with very discerning taste buds.  I use a highly rated Rancilio Silva coffee maker and Rancilio Rocky bean grinder to make the coffee.  And after much trial and error, I've learned how to make a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />Several years ago, we learned about the EIGHT O'CLOCK 100% Columbian Bean coffee and loved it!<br /><br />But, in the last year, it has changed from outstanding to "also ran" - the King is dead!<br /><br />Then, after much exploration, we've settled on GREEN MOUNTIAN COFFEE Mocha Java that cost about the same as the late, great 100% Columbian Bean - Long Live the King.

review/text: freshness is my #1 priority in making coffee. the smaller bags allow for a fresher product than the large bags. we also grind the coffee fresh every morning and store the beans in an airtight OXO pop top container. great everyday coffee that could only be improved by more depth of flavor.

review/text: The product comes very well packaged and the beans are really fresh. The value for the 4-Pack 11 oz. bags are the better than the six pack subscription. Not much better, but a little. Just a few dimes difference. I opted for the subscription because I know I will use them and if I want to skip a particular scheduled delivery, because of vacation or whatever, I just click on the "skip next delivery" option which in my opinion was a really smart thing for the consumer to choose from.<br />Thanks Amazon for providing subscriptions!

Poorly sealed bags, dry stale beans, poor aroma gives me bad coffee in the morning. I'm not sure what has happened with the 8 O'clock folks, but their quality and beans has gone into the trash.

review/text: of several coffee brands that I like, this is one of the least expensive ones. I'd prefer a bit more aroma, kick and oil in it, but that is just *my* preference - this is really good coffee for more mainstream coffee lovers. It's aromatic, dark but does not taste or smell burnt. Very nice. It is also good for those living alone or who do not drink coffee very often - this one is packed in relatively smaller packages, not into 2.2 lb bigger bags some other beans come in.

Though I'm not sure I'm convinced about the new packaging. Liked the old<br />(original?) package fine.

review/summary: I love this coffee!
review/text: I have been a serious coffee drinker for many years and I have been accused of being a bit of a coffee snob - I prefer to say I am just a little particular. I absolutely love this coffee! I have tried pretty much every brand of coffee I can get my hands on from the big coffee chains, restaurant brands, classic names you see advertised on TV all of the time, and a 3 or 4 different online specialty vendors. This is the coffee that stays in my kitchen. It's a wonderfully blended coffee with a nice sweet aftertaste and great overall flavor. It is consistently good and I have never gotten a bag that wasn't as good as the previous one. The best part is that the coffee is reasonably priced and is easily found at pretty much every grocery store in my area (sometimes I get lucky and they offer a buy one, get one free deal). I purchase these as whole beans and grind them in-store, but I have had the pre-ground product and it was good as well.<br /><br />This coffee beat a couple of big name coffee shops in a taste test a couple of years ago, and for good reason. Give this a try and you'll see why.

review/text: These are really high quality beans.  I was looking for a "real" medium roast coffee, something that's not over roasted.  These are perfect.  They look like little morsels of milk chocolate.  The aroma when you open the bag is wonderful.  The flavor rivals ANY other coffee I've had.  I've tried a lot more expensive beans, and for about $8 a pound this stuff is really the best for the money that I've tried so far.  Even though the roast is medium, the flavor profile is very robust, and has absolutely none of the smokey, slightly bitter flavors of the over-roasted stuff.  The best way to describe it is like the coffee you would get at a good donut shop, only a lot more flavorful.<br />Don't get me wrong, dark roast coffee has it's place.  I love dark roasts for espresso, but for an everyday brew of good old joe, this is really good stuff.  It's good black and also with cream and sugar.  And I love the 11 ounce 4 pack because I can keep the beans fresh til the very end!

That said, for the price this was a good buy--4 x 11oz bags for about $5.50 per bag...enjoy

review/summary: Perfect Morning Tea (Caffeinated)
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf."<br /><br />Although this tea says "orange pekoe", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the "old stuff"!<br /><br />*****

review/summary: I am an adult with GERD
review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

I think I could do the same in a blender, but it was just convenient especially when we were travelling. She would not create any fuss and actually showed excitement when I would open up the packet.

review/summary: He loves sweet potatos, but this one is runny
review/text: I don't know if its the corn, but this sweet potato is runny.  The other ones from Gerber with sweet potato's are not.  I prefer the solid food to be thicker.
