review/summary: Great balance
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob. If I was, I doubt I'd own a Keurig. I just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup.<br /><br />I've tried many of the flavored coffees, but they're too gimmicky for me. Starbucks brand tastes burnt to me, even their blonde roast -- in stores I mean, I have not tried the Starbucks brand kcups.<br /><br />I like this breakfast blend because it's not too dark, not too light. It tastes like what no-frills coffee should taste like. I order the biggest size to get the best value.<br /><br />Update: I just tried to create a review for the "Jamaica Me Crazy" coconut flavor, which I thought was terrible. (And I *love* coconut.) I should specify that the original review was for "Breakfast in Bed."

review/summary: Disappointed, this is not BOLD coffee
review/text: I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.

review/summary: Good stuff, but overpriced
review/text: I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.  I wish Amazon would price their coffees more competitively - I'd buy here exclusively if they did.  But this is good, medium roast coffee.  Not quite as strong as I'd like, but a little stronger than the Breakfast in Bed version.  I may need to try Sorrento and see if it's a little bolder.

review/summary: Average offering from Wolfgang Puck
review/text: So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought "untested".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatra's bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.<br /><br />So, this is utterly average in all departments.  It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WP's that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time I'll be more discerning.

review/summary: Average quality French roast
review/text: I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.

review/summary: Great mild cup of coffee
review/text: My favorite K-Cup so far. Absolutely NO aftertaste, which in my book is a huge plus. It's not acidic, not bitter, just a great MILD cup of coffee, which is exactly what it purports to be! I wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own stupidity. Don't buy a MEDIUM roast coffee and complain because it's not bold! Also, as a general rule the ones with "Breakfast" in the name are milder. I don't care for bold, dark roast, slap you awake coffee so I wouldn't buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold.

review/summary: Well-rounded but weak
review/text: I've read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of K-cups... coffee preferences are so subjective.  I did like the flavor of this coffee -- bold but not bitter.  As to "strength" I wish that there was more coffee in each K-cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium-cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost-effective as -- say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)<br />If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K-cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me.

review/text: We have been enjoying our order of W.Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya dark roast coffee K-cups for the last week.  We find the delicious flavor very satisfying...not so strong to be bitter, and not so weak as to taste like colored water.  The coffee is perfect. There is just the right amount of heartiness to make it an enjoyable coffee experience, and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma.  It is not as strong as an espresso, but maybe one step below.  Like we said, "pleasant, smooth, and flavorful!"

review/text: I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee "regular and black" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack.

review/summary: My Favorite K-Cup
review/text: My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.<br /><br />Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!

review/summary: Unremarkable
review/text: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

review/summary: Jamaica Me Happy!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office - I'd have it made ;0)

review/text: After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.  It's OK coffee.  I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones.  To gauge my review for others, my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, and Tully's Kona Blend.

review/text: For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.

review/text: Our Keurig coffee maker was a great Christmas gift last year. One of the pleasures of this device is the experimentation with various coffee blends. Some have worked well; others have not. Some are too mild; some are a bit "off" on taste.<br /><br />This Wolfgang Puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the Keurig machine. It has a rich taste and still remains smooth. Not too strong a flavor, but it does have flavor.<br /><br />So, the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew.

review/summary: Great, but not perfect
review/text: I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.

review/summary: Spicy sweetness!
review/text: I've always been drawn to K-Cup varieties with out there names (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger) and distinctive flavors (Golden French Toast, Spicy Mayan Chocolate). This offering melds those two features into something I'm happy to wake up to!<br /><br />To me, Jamaica Me Crazy's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to Dunkin' Donuts coconut flavored coffee, but it's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics I've come to expect from K-Cup chocolate brews. Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties. Sure, the name's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated, but that's what makes this cup of joe so fun!

review/summary: Finally!  ..A Gluten Free "Soda Cracker"!!
review/text: I had been craving a soda cracker/saltine for a long time, but because have a gluten sensitivity, I can't.  I saw these at the local health food store a couple of months ago (on sale I might add), and couldn't resist!  These are very much like their gluten counterparts (without the salt topping)!  If you've ever tried Glutino's GF pretzels, these taste similar.<br /><br />  They come in one large "board" (like graham crackers do), not in individual squares like "Zesta", etc.  (So, one board is about equal to 4 regular saltines).  They also come in 2 sets (about 6 or so in each), encased in plastic.  They're very sturdy too.  I put chilled nut butter on mine, and as long as I don't press to hard with my knife, and spread a little at a time, I have no problems with it breaking.<br /><br />  ..I haven't tried the Enger-G brand yet, but I'd like to see if the 2 brands are similar in taste.<br /><br />  I'm hoping that Amazon will start selling this ("Subscribe & Save" would be even better)!! *hint, hint*

review/summary: a good replacement for saltines
review/text: I've tried making my own gluten free saltines, but couldn't get the texture or taste correctly.  Glutino Table crackers are an amazing replacement.  They help me when I've been glutenized, but also are worthy to take the saltine replacement with salads and soups that were missing.  I just wish they had a little more of the salty flavor I miss so much.

review/text: I'm eating one right now.  They are light and crisp, yet not quite as flaky as a saltine.  The flavor is delicious, yet neutral.  The mouthfeel is good - I liked the Schar table crackers just fine but they had a bit of an oily feeling in my mouth.  Another plus: ounce for ounce, these are generally cheaper than the round crackers from Glutino.  We've eaten them plain and they stand up well to peanut butter and cheese.  I did NOT find them to crumble any more readily than a saltine.  My kids made S'mores with them yesterday - scrumptious.  Only thing I would change: add a score mark to break each one cleanly in two squares.  That would really help with the S'mores as well as packing them in lunches.

review/text: I was born and raised in Germany and we always used these gelatin sheets for baking. Since moving to the US, I have converted my recipes to the powdered kind, but I find that the sheets make it a lot easier to not get clumps. Just let it sit in cold water for 10-20 minutes, then press out the excess water, return to a clean pot, and dissolve on low heat). If you have trouble getting smooth results with Knox, I highly recommend you try these - and Dr. Oetker is hands down the best brand for gelatin around!!

review/text: If you're craving restaurant quality Thai Tea, this'll do it for you.  Add cream or condensed milk and some brown sugar, and the taste is pretty much what you'd get at the average Thai place. HOWEVER... if you have any kind of chemical sensitivity, you may want to avoid this mix. I came down with a raging migraine within a half hour of drinking it--the kind I usually get after eating MSG.  I think the excessive amount of dye is the culprit.  It'll stain if you're not careful.<br /><br />In other news, I bet this would be a great thing to use as a yarn or craft dye.  It smells nice, anyway!

Expensive enough that we don't chow them down, but make a nice flavor explosion if chopped up into a simple salad, and they make an excellent side with cheese and crackers, etc.  Definitely an earthy taste, in addition to the vinegar, but not at all hot or lobotomizing (as with, say, sushi experiences of wasabi) -- somehow more balanced.  Highly recommend!

review/text: Mmmmm ... very delicious!  I could only find this flavour at Target, which sells it for $3.79 so, if you use this often, Amazon is the way to go.  Making it with low-fat milk makes it taste infinitely better than with water.  POSTSCRIPT: Oh dear!  I just read the ingredients list and this product contains 'Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil', which IS trans fat.  I have informed Amazon that its Product Features had erroneously listed this as having 'No trans fat'.  Well, I suppose I've just enjoyed my last cup ...

It would have been even cheaper had I signed up for the coffee club.<br /><br />At $34.95 plus $10.51 shipping, FORGET IT!!  Check out your local Walmart.  It has been running $3.00 - $3.25 there.  Limited selection of flavors, but the French Vanilla has always been there.

The new blend tastes a lot differently from the original blend. I ordered the product from Amazon.com because it gave the impression they had the original blend.

review/summary: PRICE RIPOFF!
review/text: Amazon offers no bargain.  The french vanilla cafe pack of 6 is offered for $34.95 plus $10.51 shipping and handling.  Total equals $45.46, which is approximately $7.57 per can.  This is exorbitant.  If you can find the product in a store it is usually in the $5.00 to $5.50 range, which in itself is rather high.  Maxwell House has not only changed the formula, they have made the product harder to find, and they have jacked up the price.  We have gone online and found many recipes to make our own french vanilla cafe at a much cheaper price and with a better flavor.  One can make a large batch of instant coffee done to your exact taste and safely store it in a tightly capped plastic storage bin for months.  Please try it and save yourself a fortune.  Also it sends a message to Maxwell House that we will not tolerate being manipulated.  May your last hot cup be as pleasing as the first cup of the day.

I love tea, but I've practically given up drinking tea to drink this delicious beverage because to me, it tastes much better.  I'm a person who doesn't like very many things yet I love this coffee.  It's soothing and tasty and warms me up from head to toe.  It's a relaxing drink, especially when you're cuddled up under a blanket reading a good book or watching a good movie on TV.  It goes great with cookies, crackers, toast or a piece of cake.  Amazon.com has a great deal on six cans of this soothing, delicious, hot elixir.  I just ordered six cans since my mother, a regular coffee lover, is as big a fan of this great drink as I am.

This is my favorite flavor of them all, although they're all pretty good.  General Foods International came out with a new one, Mocha Latte, which is very good too.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because it contains trans fat.  Even though the nutritional label says 0% trans fat, the ingredients has partially hydrogenated listed within the non-dairy creamer ingredient.  I imagine it's negligible, but it can add up.  Otherwise, this would be a 5 star product for sure!

review/text: Leave it to the Swiss to make great tasting chocolates, cheese, and watches. These assorted minis are the perfect size for an afternoon treat or a late night craving for great tasting imported chocolates. When it comes to great tasting imported chocolate, two countries come to mind Switzerland and the Netherlands. Both countries are large dairy producers so it comes as no surprise that their chocolates especially milk chocolates have excellent flavor. I love the variety in this collection of chocolates. If you have had enough of one selection, just go to the next variety and dig in. All flavors have excellent taste although I tend to lean towards dark chocolate as my personal favorite. Try them you will not be disappointed and the price is cheaper than a trip to Switzerland.

I normally don't care that much for milk chocolate but the honey and nougat make the milk chocolate to die for and the dark chocolate is great without being too bitter.  I've had better white chocolate but it is still very good and the finish on all the chocolates is light and clean.  The singles are a treat since you don't have to worry about how to preserve the rest and you get the right amount of candy. Highly recommended for households with different tastes in chocolate. The taste is pleasant despite having an artificial flavor.

review/summary: Good taste, nice sauce, but contains "vegetable oil".
review/text: I tried these after I tried the same brand in mustard and hot tomato sauce (see my review of those in my list of reviews). I liked the taste of these kippers here (just as I liked the other ones). The sauce is probably the best here, kind of creamy and mild. There's a lot of it.<br /><br />One warning though: ingredients include "vegetable oil". Google on this expression to find out why it's not good food (a "vegetable oil" most likely is some or combination of highly processed soybean oil, or cottonseed oil, or something similar -- these, nutritionally, are bad for you. Cotton isn't even a food crop, so you can imagine what you end up eating, it's completely unregulated).<br /><br />Other than that I saw nothing evil or unnatural in the ingredients section.<br /><br />It's a nice product that still I hesitate to recommend because of the "vegetable oil" in it. The best option remains the no-frills unflavoured version that contains more fish and nothing but water and salt in addition.<br /><br />------<br /><br />05/04/2012: I'd like to thank poster "MW Polar" (who claims to represent the company) for his informative comment below. I will research the info he provided and update this review accordingly. He said, "[...] our "vegetable oil" is neither soybean oil nor cottonseed oil. In fact, our suppliers pride themselves in using only rapeseed oil. [...]" -- this is good news indeed (if true; btw., wouldn't it be good to simply state that on the tin?).<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken, "rapeseed oil" is what is more colloquially known as "Canola". It is a food crop and it certainly is better than cottonseed or soy. It has a decent fat profile with a lot of ALA in it (not as much as in flax, but next best). One thing still remains (and I'll have to research that): only a cold-pressed, unprocessed canola oil can be considered healthy (that is due to all the chemical nastiness involved in oil processing: hexane, etc.; high temeperatures themselves cause harm, especially with polyunsaturates, which is what we have here). I wonder if we could get more info on that (what kind of canola oil is used here). Once again, thanks to poster "MW Polar" for supplying additional information.

review/summary: Good anytime snack, but cheaper elsewhere
review/text: I like these Herring Fillets a lot, and also the ones in mustard sauce. They are less salty and more tasty than kippered snacks. They are soft and easy to eat and the sauce is tasty. I think it would be nice if there was more fish in there and less sauce, but I end up eating all of the sauce, too. I disagree with the reviewer who said that one tin of these would serve three people. There are only six ounces in the tin and that's including the sauce, just enough for a single portion. I like to keep some in my car along with some Wasa and other healthy snacks because I hate fast food. Great source of tasty protein. But after I ordered the case for about $2 each, I found out that [big name] store carries them for $1.38 each. If they come down in price here, I will order more because I like the convenience of having them delivered to my door.

review/text: As another reviewer mentioned, this coconut oil has no tase or smell. This is great if you think about it. What if someone in your household doesn't like the smell or taste of coconut? This is a great alternative because it really does not have any smell or taste. Compared to the Now coconut oil I purchased with this,they both have the same clean smooth look and texture. You can also use this topically without having the smell as I have so i don't smell like coconut. I just purchased this product today from a reputable local nutrition store, this brand and the Now brand. This is the first time I have purchased any coconut oil and I'm still going to try other brands to get a feel for the difference in brands but I'm sure both brands that I purchased are great. This brand has it all, no smell or tase for those that don't like coconut but would like the benefits, it's organic, cold pressed, and the business is out of Oregon.

review/summary: It's Raw
review/text: I've tried a lot of other coconut oil brands before trying this one and I wasn't used to how it had almost no discernable coconut scent. Unless you are using this to lightly steam or bake something, it really doesn't compare to other regular coconut oil brands in terms of that fresh and sweet taste.<br /><br />If this is your first time using coconut oil, you probably won't care since there is no basis for comparison. But, if you are used to using other brands like Barlean's, Nature's Way, or Vitacost's brands of coconut oil, you may or may not like how this has barely any scent. This is probably due to the fact that this oil is raw! It hasn't been treated with heat, so the oil's untoasted coconut scents won't carry over as strongly as one that has been heated to ~200 degrees F that can carry the toasted coconut scent into the oil more strongly. Barleans, Natures Way, and Aunt Pattys are all organic, cold pressed, and extra virigin. Only Aunt Patty's is raw -thus, the lack of that fresh sweet coconut taste that is amazing just on its own as a spread or sauce.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this brand for light stir frys, steaming, light baking, since the faint tasted will still carry over a bit, or as part of a raw diet. I would not recommend raw coconut oil for using as a sweet paste, melted gravy/ syrup for desserts/ waffles, for heavy coconut scent sauces, or if you want the heavier coconut scents for any recipe or skincare since raw coconut oil just doesn't have that strong sweet coconut taste that you'd want in, say a spread.<br /><br />So if you hate the smell and want something bland (or are on a raw diet) this will be great for you. If you love the addictive coconut scent and taste, you are better off buying one that isn't raw(Aunt Patty's Coconut Oil or Tropical Traditions -both raw). However, Aunt Patty's comes in a glass jar. Barlean's, Nature's Way, and Vitacost's brands do not. Five stars if you are looking for something raw, not packaged in plastic, and light or bland in taste. Three stars if you are looking for a strong tasting coconut oil that you would buy over and over again (well, three stars plus one for packing it in a glass jar).

review/text: I love my chedder cheese and when you go to a grocery store to buy it you have to settle for what ever they happen to have at the time witch usually isn't much to pick from also I like the aged cheddar as well and can never find it over one year old I definitely plan on getting all my cheese from Wisconsin Cheese Mart P.S.Remember if you want the best cheese you don't go to Frank's grocery store to get it. Also if you check the price its almost the same as the grocery store but the quality and flaver isn't.<br />Thanks Chuck.

review/summary: Tastes like cough medicine to me
review/text: Didn't like this at all.  I have always used McCormick raspberry extract and love it.  The store I shop at regularly stopped carrying McCormick, so after reading the review I went for it and took a chance. This one tastes nothing like McCormick and to me has a medicinal  after taste to it.  It also has a funky brownish color.  This does not contain any alcohol just extract and glycerine.  I thought maybe alcohol would help reduce the medicinal taste.  I added Ciroc Berry flavored vodka to lighten the color and improve the flavor.  That didn't help either.  Won't be buying this one again.
