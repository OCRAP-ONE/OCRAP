review/text: My puppy LOVES this product. I've been using this for training rewards, and he listens and expedites an order I have given hime EVERYTIME to recieve one! He even goes straight to the counter where the treats are when he is finished with something he's done that I've trained him on. :) He never gets tired of it. Also, filet's are flakey enough where you can break apart to give in pieces. They also make pilets, which I find solid and not as 'brittle' as the flakes. Either way, your dog will LOVE this product and love you for it!

review/text: It seemed like a good idea. Buy in bulk and save some cash, but as it were being shipped it must have warmed up and cooled down. Many of them were stuck together, and colors rubbed off on each other. There was a 2lb mass of beans in the box! Also, beware and don't freak out because the package consists of a cardboard box and jelly beans. No plastic inside the box, no paper lining, nothing. Kind of creepy, but I'm not dead yet, so it must be okay.

review/text: Really liked the 10 flavor sour mix from Jelly Belly, but couldn't seem to find them locally anymore.  Now they are selling the sour mix as a 5 flavor mix.  Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together.

I don't often buy mixes, but I have never found a recipe that we like as well as this, so this is one of the exceptions I make. I like it enough to have it on auto refill and sometimes need to have it sent early.  We also like the plain and blueberry mixes by Golden Malt, but this is our favorite.  It has a nice pumpkin flavor, but is not too strong tasting.

review/summary: Great For Portion Control
review/text: I'm new to ordering food items through Amazon, but I'm already an advocate.  Prices are reasonable and the convenience is awesome - also, I'm able to order some items from home that I used to have to go to separate grocers to purchase therefore this is saving me time and money!  The only negative for me is that Amazon does not yet make nutrition information available on the food pages.  As a mom who is always striving to give her family well balanced meals, I am an avid nurtrition label reader.  This specific item was great - I read other reviews regarding the unhealthy sugar content of some of the cereals Kellogg's makes - this is where I laugh.  Cocoa Krispies are NOT a health food - they're a special treat that we as a family enjoy, what I love about these is the portion control.  It took me a while to track down the exact nutrition information for this specific size portion before purchasing, so to save you all that extra step I've listed that information for you:<br /><br />The serving size for these is 3/4 cup (1 package/bowl)<br />Calories - 130<br /> Calories from Fat - 10<br />Total Fat - 1g (2%)<br /> Saturated Fat - 0.5g (3%)<br /> Trans Fat - 0g<br />Cholesterol - 0mg<br />Sodium 200mg (8%)<br />Total Carb. 28g (9%)<br /> Fiber - 1g (3%)<br /> Sugars - 15g<br />Protein - 1g

review/summary: Used To Do Peanut Butter, Then Sun Butter, Now the WOW!
review/text: Before our son was born and we discovered his peanut allergy, we were peanut lovers.  We would buy huge bags of them and make messes cracking them all over the house.  It was like one of those restaurants where people get to feel like foraging animals by throwing their shells on the floor.  OK, so I exaggerate a bit.  You get the point.<br /><br />Then, we learned of my son's peanut allergy at a young age.  Funny how an ambulance ride will get the peanuts out of the house quickly.  We first tried Sun Butter, and we were instantly hooked.  We ate it like there was no tomorrow.  We quit our jobs and just ate Sun Butter in front of the TV.  OK, so I exaggerate a bit.  You get the point.<br /><br />Then, we learned of my son's SUNFLOWER allergy.  Yes, he was allergic to sunflower, for crying out loud.  What next?!?  Well, we love the little bugger, and we decided it was time to clear out the house of anything with sunflower in it.  Soon, I decided it was time to try these soy butter concoctions.  WOWBUTTER seemed like one of the top brands, and the price was right.  Plus, the jars are a tad bigger than those of their competitors.  To our surprise, we found ourselves in a soy butter frenzy after eating a few jars of WOWBUTTER.  It truly tastes like peanut butter to us.  How do they do this with soybeans?  Beats me, but we are believers.  We are more than believers.  We are cult members.  OK, so I exaggerate a bit.<br /><br />Try the stuff.  You'll love it.

At the beginning of the year, they were willing to eat this Wowbutter, but by the middle of the school year, they were saying it tastes bad. It doesn't really taste like peanut butter; it's kind of a smokey taste. I think the smokiness was overpowering for the kids. It's not bad, so it still gets 3 stars, but I think adults would enjoy this more than kids. Try Sunbutter instead for kids.

Reading from the label, this product is manufactured in a peanut and tree nut facility.

The texture, sweetness, and taste that I remembered from before I developed this ridiculous nut allergy is what this product delivered.<br /><br /> Maybe it doesn't taste EXACTLY like peanut butter but I've missed PB&J for 15 years and actually tried peanuts to see if I was REALLY allergic (only to discover that I am-OUCH!). I have been waiting to order a case because the cost is pricey to me..it's just so GOOD. I just wish it was sold in the commissary.

review/summary: NOT a healthy choice!
review/text: Although the intention may be good, unfortunately since this product is made from soy it hazardous to long term health.  Contrary to what many companies would have you believe soy is NOT a health food unless it is fermented (which is common in many asian cultures).  Once fermented it has many health benefits, but unfermented it can cause many health issues, can have negative hormonal effects and has been linked to cancer. I won't list all the research here, but there is a recent article mercola.com called "The Truth about Soy Foods" outlining the research.

review/summary: wowbutter is truly wow wonderful
review/text: My daughter is in a peanut free classroom and loves peanut butter.  I heard about wow butter and thought I would try it, I was a bit skeptical as my 6 yr old is quite fussy, and that 6 jars of something she wouldn't like would be a lot.  But it was much cheaper to buy six and I would give it away if she didn't like it.  well it arrived and we tried it and knew why it was called WOW butter because as we tasted it we said WOW it tastes just like peanut butter. it was delicious.  The only down side is that it is a bit creamier and thinner than real peanut butter.  It also includes small stickers under the jar label so you can  label the sandwich and tell the school it is peanut free. I would highly recommend this product if your child likes peanut butter and is in a peanut free classroom or school.

review/text: I participated in a fundraising walk for children with food allergies today and WowButter was one of the samples that was available to try. I tried it when I got home and I really liked it! I thought it was just slightly less sweet than PB, and my boyfriend couldn't tell the difference when he tried it straight up. I went to the website to check out pricing and nutrition infomation and I was even more impressed; calories and fat are about the same, sugar is WAY lower, but it has more minerals and Omega-3 fatty acids than PB. I found out it's available at my local grocery store that I regularly shop at and I'm going to make the switch, even though no one in my house has a nut allergy!<br />Check them out at [...]

review/summary: I've died and gone to heaven!
review/text: Two years ago I was diagnosed with a mild peanut allergy and told to avoid all peanuts. Unfortunately I happened to love peanut butter sandwiches and peanut butter cups so I was thrilled when I found this. I haven't had a peanut in two years and this stuff is INCREDIBLE! I had to keep myself from eating half the jar when I first got it.<br /><br />For the reviewers who said that this doesn't taste like peanut butter, I'd say the only difference I can detect is a consistency that's slightly more chalky than what I remember peanut butter having. It also maybe has a barely (barely!) smoky flavor. But since I have a life-threatening tree nut allergy and almond butter isn't an option for me, I'll stick with this. Home made 'peanut' butter cups, here I come!

review/summary: Pretty good-just have to give it a chance.
review/text: No one in my family is allergic but I have a friend whose child has a peanut/treenut allergy.  We were discussing the pros and cons of a peanut ban at schools-although ours hasn't yet, I said well then what would my child eat. I understand the true and serious risk to an allergic person, but I still worry about what I would serve as an alternative, as I had heard that many substitutes were just not very good. Our doctor had even told us to have my son eat peanut butter to help boost his protein intake as has sensitivities to most meat products.  Ny friend suggested we try WOWButter, just even a couple times to see if he liked it.  I purchased one container of the creamy version at a local walmart. I have very open tastes and never hesitate to try anything new, so I figured I might like the flavor well enough; but I was a little leery of what the consistency and texture would be like.  And of course the real test was whether my son would eat it!  Well I was very pleasantly surprised.  I tried it first-the taste definitely has a little of the 'roast' flavor, but I think its quite good, and it's a rich flavor.  It definitely has a nutty taste-in my opinion more like a different nut than peanut-but not bad at all.  I was very pleased with the texture as well.  It doesn't need stirred or get greasy, and to me I could not tell a difference in the consistency when spreading it on bread or crackers or when eating it.  I think it tastes just fine by itself and on bread with or without jelly.  I haven't tried to cook or bake with it, but I never did that with peanut butter either, so I can't compare it on for those purposes.  Now that I have used it several times myself, I find that I like the richness of the taste better than peanut butter.  The real test of course is whether my son would eat it.  The first couple times I gave it to him I made a sandwich with regular PB and this swirled together, he ate it fine. For the next few sandwiches I did the same thing only reducing the regular PB each time.  He ate it fine and didn't say anything to me about it, so I switched to just WOWbutter. He has been eating it fine. One time he saw the jar and noticed it was different that what we had had.  I said I had just gotten a different brand because they were out of the other.  He said, oh, I thought it tasted a little different.  I asked if it was ok and he said yes he liked it fine.  So...can you tell a difference?  Yes.  Is it 'exactly' like peanut butter? No. But, in my mind it is a perfectly reasonable substitute and really quite good-if you don't expect a perfect peanut butter taste.  I thought the texture and consistency was fine, and it was not either dry or greasy.  I told my friend she was right, and am now using this in his lunches all the time.  Our school hasn't done a ban, but I'm happy to use it anyway...and this way he'll already be used to it if they do!

review/summary: Best Nut/Seed Butter Alternative
review/text: My daughter is allergic to peanuts, tree nuts and sunflower seeds. We have tried other soy nut butters but found them pretty much disgusting in flavor and texture.  This one is by far the best and my daughter actually requests eating it on apples, bananas, and bread.  The texture is creamy, not at all chalky or dry.  It has a roasted flavor which is what makes it taste the most similar to peanuts.  While I wouldn't say it tastes exactly like peanut butter, it has a nice flavor.  I also like sunflower seed nut butters but unfortunately we found out the hard way that my daughter was allergic to those too.

review/text: This may not taste exactly like peanut butter, but it's as close as you're going to get. I was almost scared to give it to my allergic son because it was so similar. Not only is it tasty on it's own, it works well in most peanut butter recipes. I used it to make chocolate soy butter cups at Easter, and got several comments from friends that they were the best "peanut butter" cups they had tasted. I've tried other soy butters, and my peanut loving husband turned his nose up at them. This he eats- on sandwiches or right out of the jar. And I finally have a shelf stable option for lunches that is safe for my son.

review/summary: the best peanut butter alternative!
review/text: I have 2 sons, both picky and never like the same things.  To complicate matters, the younger one, 4, has life threatening allergies, including peanuts and tree nuts, therefore, our home is free of all products containing peanuts and tree nuts.  Prior to discovering my son's allergies, I lived off of peanut butter as my 'go-to' quick protein source.  We have tried numerous seed butters and other soy butters, but haven't been able to find one that all of us would eat, until now! This has more of a roasted flavor and a more peanutty texture than the others. We devoured 1/2 of a jar of wowbutter in one day.  I have ordered this 6 pack because the price is right and shipping indicates it will be here super fast.  Give it a whirl if your family is anything like ours - with a love for peanut butter but a need to eliminate it.

review/summary: Tastes good
review/text: I have a home daycare and have a child allergic to nuts. I ordered this because we couldn't fool the kids with our local alternative (Sunbutter). I had two toddlers that would go without before they would eat sunbutter because they could tell it wasn't peanut butter. I ordered this without putting much hope into it as I've tried several and could never trick the pickiest kiddos. I was pleasantly suprized when I served this and not a one kid could tell it wasn't the real thing. I'm glad I ordered such a large quantity. I will be using this from now one. It is by far the best alternative out there.  A HUGE bonus is the fact that there aren't a bunch of additives.  Anything that uses Cane Sugar and Sea Salt always sit better with me anyway. Great product!

review/text: Soynut butter is never going to taste like peanut butter.  It has a certain sunflower seed quality to it.  But, if you cannot eat nuts, this is the best option we have found.  My girls and I like it just fine.  But, my oldest child and husband adamantly refuse to accept it.  It's all a matter of mindset, I believe.  If you love peanuts and compare this to them, you will be sorely disappointed.  If you rate this on it's own, you may decide that it tastes good.  We mostly eat it with Jam and bread.

review/text: My three year old son has a "severe" peanut allergy and I've tried different spreads in place of traditional Peanut Butter and WOWBUTTER has been our favorite. WOWBUTTER's consistency is not grainy, as I have found in some store brands, and the taste isn't as "nutty" as other tree nut spreads. We have used it for all of our favorites: Soy Butter sandwiches, cookies, playdough, apple dippers... We have tried other brands of Soy Butter and I have not been as impressed. I have used it to make cookies and snacks for family functions and no one can tell the difference! The biggest problem for us is that the closet store that sells WOWBUTTER is over an hour away! Although the store price is slightly lower it isn't that much different - it is worth it for us to buy it online.

review/summary: not peanut butter but not bad
review/text: bought some at Walmart which was cheaper than on Amazon.com. Not bad but certainly not just like peanut butter and it does have a soy taste. If you are allergic to peanut butter or in a peanut butter free school, then this probably would be acceptable but I probably won't buy another jar. Just wanted to see what it tasted like. I also give pure peanut butter like Krema brand or the pure kind available at Giant Eagle in Pa the a higher rating for the nutritional value and I like that Krema and the other have no salt or anything but pure ground peanuts. How they get the consistent sweet peanutty flavor is amazing. Of course,you must stir those. The Wowbutter does not need to be stirred and might be better to put on crackers for a lunch(the stir kind can become messy on crackers for a lunch).It also might be better nutritionally than the non stir traditional peanut butters. I certainly would try buying one jar before going for a six pack to see if you like it. Again, peanut butter it isn't but would make a good alternative.

My kids haven't liked any of them until we found this brand.  We LOVE this soybutter.  We go through a jar about every 2 weeks (which gets a bit expensive...).  We love it on sandwiches and crackers and also love cooking with it to replace peanut butter in various recipes.  My extended family says they can taste a difference when it's on a sandwich, but my nieces and nephews have eaten it and not even noticed that it wasn't real peanut butter.  The texture is the same as Jif, which was our favorite PB.  I just wish that I could purchase this in local stores.

The difference is bigger than switching from Jiff to no brand peanut butter. In fact, everyone in my extended family reacted negatively at first. My wife and I are not the picky sort. We Eat Morning star vegan sandwich patties and like them but we would never call them like hamburger. Your first taste of Wow Butter will draw a negative reaction from you --at first. Each of us tried a second teaspoon and were undecided whether we liked it or not. By the third taste, we decided we liked it or could learn to like it.<br /><br />Expect peanut butter and you may hate this stuff. It does taste close but there is a brief side taste that is off putting, but it doesn't last. After we ate Wow Butter on bagels a few time, we began to find we actually preferred the taste and texture of Wowbutter over peanut butter. Wowbutter has a pleasant taste but be warned that for many people it will take getting used to. Approach it as you would any new food and you will likely find you like it.

review/text: It does indeed taste just like peanut butter, although a bit sweet for my taste. My alergy-prone 4 year old does not like it, but he has never tasted peanut- he does like toasted soybeans, from which it is made! The only other reason I would not buy it is the price - I paid $3.99 for 17.5 ounces. I am eager to see what it will sell for here ...

Growing up, I never liked honey - even though it was in a cute bear-shaped package.  So, I doubted I would like it 30 years later.  Boy was I wrong.  The Really Raw honey is wonderful - great texture, smell, and taste.  This is the "dip your spoon straight into the jar" kind of good.

review/summary: Tastes good, but disfunctional pump
review/text: I love this creamer in my coffee.  However, reviewers are correct about the pump, and many many reviewers comment on its poor quality.  I can't imagine why the folks at the company don't get the hint.  Executives...what do you have to do to make them come to their senses?  Anyway, it will work for a while, but soon stops pumping all together.  It just gets gradually harder and harder to push the pump down, until you are leaning all your weight on it just to get the pump to depress.  I finally sawed through the top with a serrated knife and poured it into an empty water bottle so I can easily unscrew it and use.  I plan to buy a nice (empty) soap dispenser to pour the creamer into, and use it that way.  The above reviewers advice to freeze the extra creamer is a good tip that I will use.  I will just thaw it out when I need to refill the dispenser!

review/text: The taste is good - the packaging however - not the best.  The pump sticks and there is virtually no way to take it off once it's screwed on - as it prevents the cap from being reversed - unscrewed once you put the pump on......  I had to keep pushing on the thing to get it to finally work.  I think I'd rather buy this stuff in the refrigerated section rather than having to worry about the pump not working and having to saw the thing off in order to use it!

review/text: Oh these are sublime. Small, intensely flavored cherries in a fantastic, just slightly sweet, alcohol.<br /><br />The cherries are very small, about a half to three quarters of an inch in diameter. They are seedless, and have no stems attached. The picture is very accurate; they are dark Bordeaux red cherries. The Kirsch or liquor these are packed in is just slightly sweet and just the right amount of alcohol, so there is an initial alcohol sharpness (like vodka) and then an intense cherry and sweet finish. The package lists 10% alcohol content.<br /><br />These are not grocery store Maraschino cherries. They are not radioactive red with all the cherry flavor removed with sugar and food coloring in its place. No these are natural cherries.<br /><br />For a drink that calls for a Maraschino cherry, like a Manhattan, use a pick and two cherries. These are fabulous on vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />I love these cherries. Although expensive, they are worth every single penny.

Aside from that, it's quite delicious.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I'm surprised how much it tastes like coffee. To be completely accurate, it tastes like a watered down coffee (like the kind you get at hotels) with hazelnut flavor -- and a *very slight* earthy undertone. If someone gave me a sip and didn't tell me what it was, I'd think it were coffee, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's not all that much root per teabag though, and since I like strong coffee I only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. Then with some cream and sugar it's quite good.<br /><br />As for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. I don't know about that yet, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from drinking this. I feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that's as far as I can confirm the effects.<br /><br />And with even decaf coffee containing 5-15 mg caffeine per serving, this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine. Anyone who needs a coffee substitute, do give this a try.

review/summary: GOOD FOR YOU, BUT WORST TASTING TEA EEEVVVEEERRR
review/text: As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? I'd rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better.

While it is definitely mild, this is one of the most flavorful sauces you can find by Dave's Gourmet.

It's good on fries and with potato chips, and I would offer this to any visiting friends or relatives that want to feel included when you're using hot sauces, but who can't really stand the burn of something that's actually hot.<br /><br />If you're looking for a garlic flavor in a sauce, try this one.

review/summary: Very Good Flavor
review/text: If your looking for very hot this is not it but if you are looking for a sauce with a little warmth and garlic flavor give it a try. It's hard to find in stores so I order two or three at a time. Enjoy!
