review/summary: Best plain crispy rice cereal
review/text: Barbara's Brown Rice Crisps cereal is good for many uses in addition to being a very good breakfast cereal.  I crush the crisps for use as a breading.  I also find the cereal to be a fine dry snack.  The flavor is good and the crunchiness is just right.  I very much apprciate the simplicity of the ingredients as I have multiple food allergies and have to avoid wheat and corn which are found in some competing brands.

review/summary: great!
review/text: I bought these at the recommendation of a friend who is also gluten intolerant. OMG, i love this cereal. It's JUST sweet enough to not taste like a bowl of brown rice, and the texture is great. I love this cereal so much I end up eating it for snack or dinner sometimes too. Try the cereal with sliced bananas and raspberries. :)

review/summary: Healthy Brown Rice Krispies
review/text: I'm allergic to wheat and don't eat refined sugar.  Barbara's was one of the few cereal makers that had whole brown rice crispies sweetened with something better than table sugar or evaporated cane juice.  And, they taste better than the Erewhon ones.  Now that I'm pregnant, I've found my wheat allergy, which was mild before, to have worsened.  I rely on these and corn flakes now, instead of the wheat cereals I used to eat.  Amazon has BY FAR the best price on these that I could find.  I would otherwise expect Trader Joe's to have the best prices, as they did on my former two favorite (wheat) cereals, which were also Barbara's brands, but Trader Joe's in my area doesn't sell the Brown Rice Crispies.

review/text: Recently, I tried these for the first time. I was in Wal-greens, going up and down the aisles, and got a hankering for some chocolates. I saw a bag of these and thought, how good could these be? Was I pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />These truffles are so delicious! I'm scarfing some right now. Each truffle is individually wrapped, like a perfect little present. Quickly discard that paper, and you have a smooth, chocolate ball. Inside the outer shell are small pieces of hazelnut, and in the middle of the ball is a creamy milk chocolate filling. Once you bite into it, all that sweet filling melts on your tongue and you almost think it's liquid, it's that soft and creamy.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size  3 Balls (36g)<br />Servings per bag  4<br />Calories  220<br />Total Fat  18g<br />Cholesterol  5mg<br />Sodium  20mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 15g<br />Protein  2g<br /><br />As you can see, these chocolates aren't low-calorie.

It has a homemade taste; it's smoky, meaty (not watery) and the heat is not overpowering.<br />Alas, I have not seen it on the shelves because the store told me people complained about it.  I can't believe it!  But I suppose everyone has their own taste.  Maybe those people like processed, watery, bland salsas.

review/summary: Watered Down Salsa - Not Worth Buying At All
review/text: I just got this 3-jar set today and tried the salsa. I was excited because I had been reading reviews from other Amazon buyers that said the salsa was excellent! Normally, Amazon's reviewers are quite accurate in their recommendations but this time they were just flat out wrong. The salsa is very watery - right away as you tip the jar back and forth, the salsa runs around very quickly and I was suspicious that it would not have enough chunky goodness that makes a salsa tasty. I was absolutely right. The salsa has a thin watered down flavor. There is a muted spiciness that is not worth spending money for. The fire-roasted detail was worthless - it just meant that you would see black flakes from the grilled vegetables swimming around in the watered down salsa. You can get a better salsa at any supermarket - just tip the jar around to make sure that its contents move slowly and look for salsa that markets itself as having won awards at salsa fairs or by chefs. Even boring Pace makes a better salsa than Arriba!

review/text: Being a tea lover, I found that the Cranberry Hibiscus Herbal Tea, truly is a 5 star tea.  The aroma alone is wonderful, and the deep rose color of the tea, makes of promise of the wonderful taste to come.  At a luncheon, my tea cup got passed around, and the oohs and aaahs after the sip test...well, most wanted to order the Cranberry Hibiscus tea right after that. It is hard to find a herbal tea which doesn't fade after the first cup, the White Lion Brand gave me two wonderful cups of tea, and the second was just as flavorful as the first.  I definitely will order more of this flavor, as it is a delight!

It's so great to have found this a year ago.<br />I've used it to make spaghetti, sukiyaki, pesto, alfredo, it's a good ramen substitute and substituted it for yakisoba dishes as well.<br />I like these so much more than the Tofu Shirataki noodles that I actually find more often.<br />JFC texture is more like pasta than the other.<br />I'm planning to try the brown shirataki as well.<br /><br />Great Product<br />Priced Well<br />Amazingly Low Calorie<br />Completely Versatile<br /><br />FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND WASH THE NOODLES FIRST TO GET RID OF THE LIME SMELL AND PAR-BOIL THEM.

review/text: I was confused by the previous two reviews (1 five star and 1 one star), so I bought a can at the grocery store to try.  First, let's be clear that this is not homemade sausage gravy and shouldn't be compared to it.  With that said, I heated this up, added a little black pepper and a little bit of milk (too thick for me).  Poured over biscuits and fed to my two picky kids.  Neither of them raved about it, but both said it was good and that we should add a couple of cans to the pantry.  I agree.  Since I have never tried another brand of canned gravy, I can't say how this compares, but it is certainly worth having around if you want a hot breakfast and don't have time to make from scratch.

review/text: First, I bought this gravy at my local grocer, so I could try it before committing to buying it in volume from Amazon.<br /><br />Everyone in my family thought it tasted horrible. There is an overpowering seasoning, that I can't quite place my finger on that left a bitter aftertaste in our mouths. The one thing that comes to mind is "black licorice".<br /><br />My dog wouldn't even try it, he sniffed it once and turned away repulsed by it.<br /><br />I actually had bought two cans of the gravy and my neighbor said they would like to have the second can to try and I agreed. The neighbor came over the next day with a grimace on their face, saying that they had just tasted the gravy and it was unbearable.<br /><br />I would suggest buying a can of this first to sample it, I don't know how it has such high reviews as this is by far one of the worst products I have ever eaten.

review/summary: Nice tasting corn.
review/text: I decided to try this corn with no other reviews written for it... so here is my opinion. First off, the 12 pack of corn is on the higher price side of cans of corn. When I can go to my local grocer and pick up a can of normal corn for $.79 or so, this is very expensive comparatively. It is organic and I feel it's worth a premium, but maybe not ~3x the amount.<br />As far as taste and quality... very, very good. I haven't found any garbage pieces or stems in the cans yet and the corn seems to be of high quality. The taste is excellent and is as good and maybe a little better than Green Giant or the like.<br />All in all this is an excellent product, it is organic and it's convenient. So, if the price doesn't scare you away, try it.

I tend to eat more for supper than other meals so will have two with a roll and a glass of milk but it is an enjoyable meal.

review/text: My cats really love this food (we also mix it about 3:1:1 with Innova and Innova low-fat dry food for nutrient variety - yes, my cats are very spoiled).  It's a very healthy product for my kitties (I couldn't find any evidence of Felidae foods ever having been recalled), but it doesn't break my budget as much as some of the other high-end foods.

review/summary: cats don't like it
review/text: Tried it as one of my cats has a yeast on skin problem and needed grain free and Soy free diet. This filled the bill.  The problem is that my cats don't like it. 1 cat will eat it  but only because that is all there is for her to eat.  She has lost a considerable amount of weight.  SHe was overweight so I didn't mind it much.  THe 2nd cat however hates it.  She even started eating the dogs food, something she never did before. I now have to keep the dog food locked up.  SHe too has lost weight, but she didn't need too. The yeast growth didn't go away, so there must be something else in the ingredients that is not good for her.  I am now switching to another brand of cat food.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: We switched from a grocery store brand cat food when we got a new kitten, since the pet adoption person recommended it. This is all my kitten (now 2 yrs) has ever eaten and LOVES it (we actually started with regular felidae and switched to the pure elements variety about 6 months ago, they didn't notice a change). My older cat had no problem at all switching over and even seems to like it better. She gets less hairballs with this food too. We got a third cat recently and had no idea what he was used to eating but he gobbles this stuff up with no problem. It's hard to know what the healthiest food out there is for your cats but for now this seems to make me and my kitties happy. It isn't too expensive and it has a better ingredients line up than most brands. I recommend giving it a try!

review/summary: Excellent Cat food
review/text: The grain and gluten free cat foods are better tolerated, as Felines are "carnivores" primarily, moreso than "herbivores".<br />Most available dry, and for that matter, wet, cat foods available in the grocery store contain grain products.  I am not a DVM; however, in my experience with 9 cats, I notice less "regurgitation" of food (independent of hairballs), using the more 'natural' or appropriate, grain free foods. This dry food is well tolerated by my kids, so I am able to recommend this brand, as well as, or better than, others I have tried.

review/summary: Ignorance is Bliss
review/text: The highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about. This is directed at SalVetUSMC. As Albert Einstein said ", Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance." It is painfully obvious that SalVetUSMC has some form of an agenda against Brown.<br /><br />I was introduced to Brown Coffee Company by a friend who new what a coffee geek I am. I currently have a La Sapaziale Mini Vivaldi II and an older Bezzera BZ 99. Previously I owned a La Pavoni PPG-16, Pasquini Liva 90 and an Isomac Tea so while not an expert, I am certainly not a novice. I have tried coffee from all over, Illy, Intelligentsia, Lavazza and others. For quite awhile I roasted my own with beans from Sweet Maria's and CmeBrew Coffee. I was quite sceptical, but decide to investigate Brown Coffee Co. What a pleasant surprise! The cappa I had was the best I have ever tasted including Intelligentsia in Chicago. I was hooked. Now I make a weekly trip to the other side of town to pick up my beans. I'm finally done with roasting, yeah! My espresso is the best it has ever been and my family and friends love it. Now, when I am too lazy, I can have coffe delivered to the door.<br /><br />As far as SalVetUSMC goes... I'm leery of people who won't use their real names. Semper Fi Mac!

review/text: This isn't exactly scientific, but I consider my sense of taste experienced and particular enough to judge water based on the following criteria:<br />  1. Free of chemical leeching from the plastic bottle.<br />  2. Balanced mineral content (i.e. no excessive fluoride, not to "wet" and not too "dry")<br />  3. No excessive purification agents (i.e. chlorine, etc.)<br /><br />Fiji is, by far, the best I have ever tasted.<br /><br />By the way, at the time of this writing, Amazon is selling the water with FREE delivery to retail consumers for less than the manufacturer is.

review/text: I have been a fan of Fiji water for a long time due to its unbelievable taste. So when I saw it for $17.44/case in November, I had to order a year supply, 22 cases to be exact!!!<br /><br />Although the price is now $22.52 it is still a steal compared to Fiji water's website and the price at Wally World for a 6-pack. It is a bit more expensive than Zephryhills but it is DEFINITELY worth the money. It is also the only water I drink.<br /><br />Btw, Amazon shipped it very nicely in another box with the case inside. So if you want it for a special occasion or for business, you  dont have to worry about your name and address on the Fiji box, nor any scuff marks from the package being handled.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!

This is her favorite bottled water, she says it just tastes better than the other brand.  So from a product perspective this water is great, as is the price, and I give it five stars!<br /><br />One thing to note.  There is a three case limit on this item and once you purchase three you evidently can't purchase more?  When I tried to purchase more it said it is a limited quantity purchase item.  I had no idea as it did not explicitly state this on the product page that I could see.  I am disappointed with Amazon and I hope in the next few weeks when we run out I can purchase more as we are trying to save money due to having twins.

The reason she buys the water just to loss weight.<br /><br />The price of the water still high to me, I buy them when they are on sale, I use it as vitamines, since my bottles of vitamine always forgot to take and got all expired. Fiji is a better way to go. You will never forget to drink water.

review/summary: The truth about FIJI
review/text: Fiji water is noticeably an excellent quality water.  I've been drinking water for over 21 years, ever since I was a child. So as you can see I have tons of experience with water.  My family tells an old story of how when I was a young man infatuated with water that I almost drowned myself trying to drink 3 glasses of water at one time, using a series of straws!  Needless to say, I consider water an expertise of mine.<br /><br />I conducted a 3 week study of FIJI water. I used FIJI for almost everything, excluding bathing because of the obvious expense.  I cooked pasta with FIJI water, I washed my face every now and then with FIJI water, I diluted my liquid soap with FIJI water, and I drank exclusively FIJI water.  What I noticed over these 3 weeks will shock you!<br /><br />Week 1.  My toe and finger nails grew much faster than usual, with a nice shine to them.  I also noticed a loss in body fat.<br />Week 2.  My nails continued to grow and I noticed noticeably thicker leg hair.<br />Week 3.  The improvements continue to increase, my current nail length is approximately 3/4 of an inch.  I had to trim my leg hair because it was getting out of control.<br /><br />I will not buy FIJI again, but only because I do not necessarily want thicker leg hair.<br />I do recommend this product though!

I also like how they don't have as many calories as the yogurt/peanut butter type treats that you can often find for dogs in the summer, and they're easy to make at home.

review/text: This is a perfect product for my little morkie who gets tear stains easily and icky eye boogers.  I try to use a pad on him everyday.  I'm sure he'd wipe his own eyes if he could, but I have to do it for him.  The pads do the job right without leaving a greasy residue or a weird smell.  Clean and textured for a slight scrubbing effect. The dog seems to enjoy it.

review/text: Our cat love this food and is very healthy and doing well on it.  We also give him a dry food during the day.  We add a little water to this and mix it in to help prevent urinary crystals which he hasn't had since we switched him over to this wet food.  For us, it's great to get out a can of cat food that doesn't stink you out of the kitchen.  It's real food!  Highly recommended.

review/text: I finally feel good about what I'm feeding our cats.  I used to open the cans of regular cat food for them and try not to think about the animal by-products and all the ingredients in there that are not suitable for human food, yet we feed it to our pets.  No more!<br /><br />We have four cats and all are on this diet now.  As with any time you are transitioning your pets from one food to another, my vet always says to do it gradually.  So over two weeks, we slowly started adding a little of the Vegetable Stew moist cat food to their regular food.  Weening them off the regular food and on to the Vegetable Stew.  They come running when they hear the can opening!

review/text: If you like wint-o-green lifesavers, and if you don't, why are you here anyway, then this is two big bags of something you like. As an Amazon Prime user, shipping is free, which makes this the cheap way to get your methyl salicylate fix.<br /><br />I would not recommend consuming the bag's contents in one sitting. It's 40+ ounces of sugar, for one thing; and that much wintergreen is not good for you. In light of the possible risk of over-consumption, if you should happen to lack the self control to resist, I recommend this very simple procedure:<br /><br />Give Them To Me.

review/text: I love these mints, especially the Wint-O-Green flavor. I always keep them around the house and often enjoy a mint after a meal; it seems like the perfect way to wrap up a nice meal. They're also great for mid-afternoon snacks when one has a case of the hungries and wants to minimize the calories.<br /><br />The nutrition facts on the package give the serving size as four mints although I usually eat one at a time after a meal. Four pieces have 60 calories so one would only have 15 calories, not bad for a snack substitute. As is usual with many candies there is no fat and no sodium. Also of interest to me was the fact they're made in Canada, not China.<br /><br />My wife and our guests seem to like them too and I'm always pleased when guests help themselves to a mint when they're over for a visit. We keep a bowl of them out on the kitchen counter.<br /><br />I've noticed that not all stores carry the Wint-O-Green flavor and some stores that do seem to be out when I drop by to re-stock; they must be popular because the Wint-O-Green display will be empty and the Pep-O-Mint display will be full. I suppose I can understand that because they do taste better to me too.<br /><br />I like the idea of the large bag since that requires fewer trips to the store, and I particularly like the idea that I can order them now from Amazon on my computer and save the gas money. The price also is better than the sale price at most stores.

review/text: I take a medication for my Rheumatoid arthritis which leaves a nasty aftertaste in my mouth. I also have dry mouth from Sj&ouml;grens's. I have been using Life Savers for a while now to help with these problems. I seem to go through a roll in fairly short time. I like the rolls because they seem to cause less trash. However these bags were too good a bargain to pass up. I had been out when the package arrived so I opened the bag right away. The mints were nice and fresh. They tasted great. Later I am going to try to see if they really will spark when I chew them. But even if they don't I am really pleased with this order. Thanks. I will order more in a few months when these are gone.

review/text: The bags are big! I think it's worth the price. But did you know that these life savers have an effect/illusion thing called triboluminescence? It's when light is generated without the sun. So for a cool experiment, give one life saver to you and your friend IN THE DARK. (I recommend in the dark because you can see the light clearly then.) Face each other, ready to see the light. Then on the count of three, you and your buddy will pop the life savers in your mouth (still facing each other) and chomp on it as HARD AS YOU CAN. Not like chewing, like chomping. You will see the light in your friend's mouth. Cool, right?

review/summary: my pup enjoys these
review/text: I first bought one of these paragon hedgehogs for my puppy at a local pet food store when he was about 5 months old .  He was teething at the time and it took him over a month to finish a single hedgehog.  Now that's he's 11 months old, 15 lbs and has a mouth full of adult teeth, he'll finish a hedgehog in under two days if I don't take it away from him (he likes to hide it when he's not working on it).  My dog loves these, but i would say, only let your dog have a hedgehog for a bit at a time otherwise they will eat too much of it.  My dog didn't get sick from eating that much, but his stool was a little looser and after he ate the green hedgehog his poo looked shockingly like guacamole!  The price of the bag of 4 is much better than I was paying at the pet store - I was paying 7 dollars a piece there which is way too much.<br /><br />I think these are great natural chew for dogs.  They have low oder - smell sort of like potatoes, so it doesn't stink my home like a bully stick. In the future, i will probably buy the paragon bags of toothbrushes or alligator shapes which are smaller so that i don't have to worry about my pup eating too much.

review/text: My dog loves these treats.  They are the only chew he will eat, and they have really made a difference with his teeth.<br /><br />My boy is 47 lbs, and gets one or two per day.  It's true that they aren't great for having too much at once.  You do need to buy the right size for the dog, because they love them so much and will eat them till they're gone.  I once let him have three one day (hey, if one is good three must be better, right? NOT), and they did make his stool loose, and colorful..<br /><br />However the color does not bleed onto carpets or furniture, and the treats are hard enough to help with teething or keeping teeth clean.  Just watch how much you give them.  They eventually do get used to them, and now he can have two per day without a problem, but I try to limit him to that.<br /><br />I still think these are the BEST dog treats I have ever found, and are fun shapes too!

review/text: My beagle has a very sensitive stomach but loves to chew. Gave her one of these thinking it would be like a greenie and last only a few minutes because she can really do some damage when she chews.  She works with me and there are times I need her to just lay down and relax, so a good chew toy is always a great find for me.<br /><br />One day I had her out and gave her one of these not knowing if it would be enough to keep her occupied for the entire time I needed her to lay quiet.  An hour later I took the half that was left away from her, and saved it for another day.  I went straight out and bought a bunch of them. I am so glad my local pet store carries them!  They work wonderfully and don't upset her stomach at all.  Of course, I have not given her "too much candy" all at once, but considering how sensitive she is I always expect the worst until I am proven wrong, and this product did just that!

The jelly is clear as a jewel and tastes as good as homemade.<br /><br />I tried another brand of cherry jelly, and it was on the sour side.  It wasn't at all what you would like to spread on a hot piece of toast.  It is so nice to find a product that excels like Grama's does.  Next time, I'll order several jars.
