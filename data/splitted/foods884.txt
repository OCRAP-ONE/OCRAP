review/summary: "No added sugar"  NOT!!!!
review/text: I bought this because the description said "No added sugar".  This is a blatant falsehood.  The second ingredient is 'evaporated cane juice', which is a fancy way of saying 'sugar'.<br />If what you're looking for is a peanut butter made from peanuts and nothing else (like Smucker's Natural) then don't buy this.  I am amazed that Amazon allows such blatantly false advertising.

review/summary: Contains Palm Fruit Oil !
review/text: Please do not buy into this product being a pure back-to-nature good for you...good for the environment product.  IT IS NOT.  It contains palm fruit oil.  Cutting down of these forests could spell the complete demise of the orangutans as this is their habitat.  Palm fruit oil is used in soaps, cosmetics, and lots of other things - but who thought it was in this high-end peanut butter???  Amazon needs to put this information in the product listing so at least people will know what they're getting.

review/text: My parents only eat this now because it doesn't give them heart burn like Kraft PB. Also this is completely free of trans/saturated fats. Sometimes it's added in PB as a preservative (like in all Kraft PB) didn't know that till I tried these! It's a bit pricey but worth it in the long run. Quality over quantity :)

review/summary: Excellent chocolate bar...
review/text: This bar is unbelievably good. The flavor and texture share no relation to the original 3 Musketeers bar. The blurb on the wrapper does not lead one to believe it would taste like a modified original bar. The airy, crisp wafer tastes like the meringue wafer in a German chocolate truffle cookie I used to be addicted to - in fact, the bar itself tastes very similar. The truffle cream is rich but not too sweet and the combined textures just make the bar. Love it!

review/text: I tried these candy bars today and I love them.  Most "crisp" bars have some form of flour, which is bad for me. So I hesitantly tried one and at first, I thought the crisp part was like freeze-dried ice cream.  After reading the ingredients, I realized it is a meringue.  Even better for me!!  So for anyone who can't tolerate flour but likes a crisp bite, these are fantastic.  I highly recommend giving this a try.

review/text: I bought one of these bars at Walmart last year. I'm not a chocolate lover, but when I taste this bar, I couldn't wait to buy some more. The taste and whole make-up of this product is great. The texture is indescribably great. Walmart no longer had these on hand so I went looking for them. Literally, I visited 4 different stores looking for this bar; that's just how great they are. I couldn't find them anywhere. So, of course, I looked online and found a box of them. I have feel in love with this product. I do not like the regular 3 musketeers; but I love this crisp one. I will be ordering some every month.

review/summary: Truffle Crisp
review/text: I have not bought this product from Amazon, but I will this late fall after we get through the hundred plus degree HEAT! I want to enjoy this product without meltdown. I can only find this amazing treat at the place I work. It is sad! I would describe this as a malted smooth and creamy bar with a crisp crunch. I adore this bar. I usually can take or leave candy and like another reviewer, I am now hooked and want this treat whenever I can find it! It is well worth the calorie count as long as you know YOUR limit. YUM!  UPDATE! 09/14/2010  Ordered this product and it shipped from NY to Iowa in PERFECT condition. I am SO impressed. The shipping wasn't really high and was only a couple dollars more when I got brave and decided to purchase two boxes instead of one. The seller was EXCELLENT! The boxes were bubble wrapped and taped securely, also perishible stickers were applied. Shipped Fed X and FAST. Couldn't be happier! The expiration date is late summer next year, but I know they won't be around that long. I intend on freezing some, wish this was available where I live, but until then, I will be happy with this seller and the great job they do!

review/summary: Did you ever try a fling bar? This is just like it!!!!
review/text: One day at the supermarket a pink box caught my eye. The milk chocolate "fling" bar. Sure, it looked a little crazy with its pink shimmer on the chocolaty top... but it was HEAVEN. absolute heaven. I can't even describe how amazing the little crunchy layer on the bottom was.. it's so light and airy and so delicious and crunchy. Then the light whipped chocolate on top... and then its dipped in more chocolate. So to my disappointment a month or so after I fell in love, it was discontinued. Im sure it is due to the candy being new and looking a little weird. Well to my relief the 3 musketeers truffle crisp bar is exactly the same thing, with a well known label. Id buy this by the ton if I could but my weight would sky rocket. I wish i had never tried these. No other candy will stand up to it now and I would eat one with every meal hahaha. Luckily I care about my girlish figure and wouldnt actually do that... but i still want to ;)

review/summary: T W I X........D E L U X E
review/text: THREE MUSKETEERS has A L W A Y S been my favourite candy-bar.  No nugat or caramel to stick to your teeth, no peanuts to have to chew through, (or be endangered by, in case you are alleric to peanuts.)  No sticky, gooey mess, anywhere!  Just plain, fluffy, yumminess -- unless the bar is a bit too old, in which case the fluffiness turns to hard-to-chew crunchiness, or it gets too warm outside, in which case, the chocolate outer-shell begins, sadly, to melt.  But a fresh, new bar of traditonal Three Musketeers?  A preview of what Heaven must really be like, for sure!<br /><br />So, I am naturally interested in any new version of this product.  Shopping at a well-known chain store today, I happened to run across this product -- 3 MUSKETEERS TRUFLE CRISP BARS -- for the first time.<br />Hmmmm....I had never even heard of them before -- but at 3 for $2, I naturally had to try them.<br /><br />"Truffles", in whatever form, do, of course, betwoken "gourmet".  Truffle-type mushrooms are expensive gourmet treats, often added to "pate de foie gras" (goose-liver paste), a French delicacy -- or sold in tins by themselves for (deservedly?) exhorbitant amounts of money.  Believe it or not, mushroom truffles can ONLY be found in the wilds...by specially-trained pigs!  This is part of the reason why they're so expensive, I guess.<br /><br />Chocolate truffles are made of chocolate, praline, and ground hazelnuts.  They are also a gourmet treat, (for desert, this time) but are not quite as expensive as mushroom truffles. Although I have never had the pleasure of eating muschoom truffles, I HAVE enjoyed chocolate truffles on occasion -- and can attest that they are totally scrumptions!<br /><br />So, if chocolate trufles belong in ANY widely-sold candy bar, I was sure that 3 MUSKETEERS would be about the only one to do them justice.<br />Sadly, however, this is NOT the case.<br /><br />The new, 3 MUSKETEERS Truffle Crisp bar is ar more "crisp" than it is "truffle".  The picture on the outside wrapper shows the "crisp"<br />layer on the bottom, and the "truffle" layer on the top to be about 50% of the bar's filling, each.  However, opening up the bar and biting into it, one can see that the edges of the top, "truffle" layer have been ever-so-slightly indented, and taken off, and what should be "truffle" filling in this top-most, indented area, is instead a continuation of the chocolate which coats the entire bar.  Not that this chocolate coating isn't delicious -- but when one sees, on the wrapper, an illustration of an approximately 50-50 distribution of top and bottom fillings inside, that is what should be seen when exploring the candy-bar itself.  As it is, the distribution of filling in the REAL bar is about 45% truffle on top, and 55% crisp bar on the bottom.<br /><br />This new confection from "3 MUSKETEERS" comes with 2 bars per package.<br />This may be good for those watching their weight, because only one complete bar can be had, (if one has the will-power), per snack.  Or, it's easy to share the one package with two bars in it, with a friend.<br />However, it should be noted that the new, "Truffle Crisp" bar lists<br />only 1.10 ounces, (or 31.2 grams) as its net weight, (for both bars within), whilst the "old, reliable", traditonal "3 Musketeers" bar lists 2.13 ounces, (or 60.4 grams), as its net weight.  At the store I bought them out, both candies cost the same amount of money....<br /><br />On the back of the 3 MUSKETEERS TRUFFLE CRISP wrapper is listed the ingredients, (Milk Chocolate, (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milk fat, soy lechithin, PGPR, ((which is probably an abbreviation for an unpronoucable chemical product)), artificial flavour, vegetable oil, (palm kernel oil, palm oil, and/or hydrogenated palm oil), Less than 2% - corn syrup, egg whites, cocoa powder, salt. ALLERGY INFORMATION: May contain peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat,<br /><br />Under this, the "Daily Values", which, along with ingredient listing, is now mandatory to be put on all products, is highlighted.  In big lettering, under the rubric: "What's Inside", are the daily values of:<br />Calories: 170, (9%DV), Total Fat: 9 Grams, (14% DV), Saturated Fat:6 grams, (30% DV), Sugars: 18 grams, (No DV defined), Sodium: 30 mgs, (1% DV).  As usual, these values are based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet.  Listed also is the helpful(?)  To learn more, visit:www....com, (a Mars Company website.)<br /><br />When eating this candy bar, it tastes as if the truffle content of the bar was far LESS than approximately 45% of the filling.  The "crisp" part of the bar overwhelms, and only a very, very slight flavour of the truffle part seems to reach the taste-buds.  The nearest thing it tastes like, in my mouth, is TWIX.  TWIX is a nice candy bar...but nowhere near as good as original 3 MUSKETEERS.  At least to my own taste.<br /><br />My recommendation?  Unless you totally adore crispy wafers wrapped in chocolate, go for the traditional "3 MUSKETEERS" bar, instead of the "3 MUSKETEERS TRUFFLE CRISP" bar.  The "Truffle Crisp" bar has a nice, undulating chocolate design on the top of each crisp bar -- but very little real chocolate taste -- and even less, real chocolate truffle taste -- inside.  For truffle taste, go for LINDT'S chocolate truffles.  For whipped, fluffy filling, go to the original 3 MUSKETEERS bar. For crispy bars, go to "TWIX" candy.<br /><br />I am looking forward to 3 MUSKETEERS next new product, however.  Perhaps this will be a whipped, dark chocolate version of the original bar(?)  At any rate, I have a feeling that this new, "Truffle Crisp" bar won't be on the market too long.  I could be wrong here...but if I'm not, then the "Truffle Crisp" bar may become a highly-prised collectible -- like the 80s cereal, "Quisp", which went out of major production many years ago.  However, the makers of "Quisp" DO make a very limited number of cereal boxes each year, for affictionados of "Quisp" cereal.  Maybe the same will, eventually, be done with the "Truffle Crisp" bar.  If MARS does, now, want to see sales rise on this new item, however, I suggest they keep the "crisp" part to the minimum, and add more and more of the "truffle" filling.  If this is done, it may be a nice adjunct to the original 3 Musketeers Bar -- which, in my opinion, is presently,<br />"Winner...And Still Champion!"  : )

review/text: I don't recall where I purchased my first bottle, but we enjoyed the flavors of this marinade so much with grilled foods I found it offered here and bought the 6 pack!  So far my use of the marinade has been with grilled items, shrimp (delicious), summer squash, onions, bellpeppers, and mushrooms.  I especially liked using it on shish kabobs because of the nooks and cranneys trapping the flavors of the marinade.  I haven't tried it with fish, but my next experiment will be on a white fish baked in the oven.  I'll have to watch the amount used so as not to overpower a mild fish.  I gave a bottle to my neighbor when she went camping last summer and her family also loved the flavor of this marinade paired with the smokey flavors of campfire cooking.

review/text: I had this in my cart from other sellers for some time, kept checking, but wouldn't purchase because of the high shipping cost.  I happened to check again and loved what I saw! Not only was the bottle twice as big, but the shipping was absolutely great!! I jumped at this!! I had been wanting to try for some time because the reviews were good. I got to taste it at my brothers' house and it is delicious!! Makes food taste too good!! I will definitely use this seller again; I just hope that he has what I'm looking for!!! Excellent service!!

review/text: If you are looking for a sauce to go with anything--beef, chicken, seafood, this is it.  It's not just a boring steak sauce or bbq sauce, or a sauce that's so hot you won't taste the rest of your meal!  We use it on everything to add a kick.  You can also combine it with other sauces to add a distinct flavor to burgers, etc.<br /><br />It's hard to find in groceries, so we were glad to see it on Amazon.

review/text: My wife WILL NOT eat pizza unless we have Tiger Sauce. It's great on lots of different food. Eggs, Chicken, Steak, asian food. My wife likes to use Tiger Sauce and seasonings instead of ramen flavor packets. I love that its got great flavor but its not excessively hot. It's perfect for dipping just about anything. I like to dip my pizza crust in the sauce. The big downside is that it's hard to find. That is why today I'm gonna order this 6 pack of 10 ounce bottles.

review/summary: Best Peanut Better Ever, Kids Will Love!
review/text: *****<br />This is a peanut butter you can feel truly good about eating AND about giving to your children. Look up "palm fruit oil" on the Internet...google it...it is extremely healthy...the base of this peanut butter. Note that there IS added sugar, but it is relatively little.<br /><br />I normally eat unsweetened peanut butter as well as other nut butters and find this lightly sweetened peanut butter a fantastic treat. Put a little of this on a whole grain cracker and you'll be in heaven! In my case, it satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't want more--say a rich dessert--and so I am thrilled to tolerate the slight amount of sugar for the huge amount of benefit.<br /><br />No matter if you are a commercial peanut butter consumer or a purist who loves unsweetened raw nut butters--you will find much to love here--ESPECIALLY after you research all of the benefits of palm fruit oil. My husband is a junk food and fast food man and he also loves this...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: Yes, there is a little gritty texture, but it reminds me of the texture of oatmeal cookie dough or some sort of dough where the sugar is granulated.  This is delicious.  Yes, some of the raisins have sunk to the bottom.  Buy some raisins and put them on your spoon.<br /><br />This is a good product, a good company, and Amazon has a good price.  If you are unsure if you want six jars, spend the extra money at the grocery store (walmart even carries a couple of flavors and even some of the single serve packets) and see if it is your bag.  It is my bag.  Try it on some apples or pears.... Yum.  :)

review/summary: A Nice Change of Pace
review/text: I like this peanut butter because it is a little different without losing the classic roasted peanut taste like some flavored peanut butters. My family eats a lot of peanut butter in various dishes and this one makes a nice change of pace from a plain creamy peanut butter for certain uses like on toast or in a sandwich. The texture might be off-putting for some who prefer creamy peanut butter because the raisins and sugar granules actually give it some crunch, but if you are alright with crunch then the flavor will keep you coming back for more! The cinnamon complements the roasted peanut flavor perfectly while the raisins add little bursts of sweetness. This is a favorite in my house for spreading on sprouted grain bagels or warm toast. It also, because of the raisins, makes a nice jelly-free peanut butter sandwich for my son when he needs an eat-on-the-go sandwich; no jelly means less of a mess on his face/hands/clothes!

review/text: It is so great between meals! I put it on organic apples and it's so delicious, healthy and filling. I am amazed. I am working on losing weight and lowering my blood sugar and cholesterol. (I don't want to develop diabetes and heart disease.)<br /><br />I have a terrible sweet tooth and am trying to avoid sugar as much as I can. However the sugar in these peanut butter spreads is reasonably low.<br /><br />So this is my go to treat.<br /><br />I just sent 3 six packs to my brother and sister in law of three different flavor varieties.<br /><br />They have been through some tough times. They are runners - however they were involved in a car accident recently so they are in the process of healing.<br /><br />I know they will love this to help get them through the healing process and back to running. It's also great for running.<br /><br />I also think the prices on Amazon are very reasonable. I paid $70.00 for 18 jars of pb. And I received free shipping. Better deal than the stores and better than the official website.<br /><br />They are all delicious. All of them.

review/summary: Unique, healthy, and decadent
review/text: Despite the mass appeal of Peanut Butter & Co's dark chocolate flavor, I'd much prefer a jar of this cinnamon raisin stuff any day. It is SIGNIFICANTLY sweeter than the chocolate, but it's lower in calories than regular p.b. and it has way less sugar than what I'd expect from a product like this. I imagine it would taste fantastic in oatmeal or with fruit, but somehow I always end up eating it straight from the jar. I love peanut butter, and I use so much of it that I typically go for whatever's cheapest at the store. I'm willing to pay more for this stuff because it's so unique and a real treat.

review/text: PB&Co makes the best flavored peanut butters, really taking PB to the next level. They do this while still keeping the product free of sugar, corn syrup or anything else unhealthy. It wouldn't be going too far to say PB&Co peanut butters are addictive, especially the Dark Chocolate Dreams and Cinnamon Raisin Swirl. The Cinnamon Raisin Swirl is excellent when mixed with yogurt or oatmeal as well as eaten straight out of the jar. The Amazon deal is great because these peanut butters retail for $5.99 per jar.

review/summary: Delicious- but it IS sort of sandy
review/text: I don't mind the crunchy, sand-like texture, in fact I kind of like it- but I can understand why someone might be put off by it.  I took my first cinnamon raisin swirl sandiwch to work today, and although it IS gritty, I love the taste.  To me it tastes quite a bit like a cinnamon roll- even if it does have a different texture.  I put some extra raisins on my sandwich, because I didn't think there were enough in the peanut butter- but since it would be hard to dig them out, it's probably better they erred on the side of caution.  If you, like me, would like more raisins- add some.  I think tomorrow I may mix this one with the chocolate.  I like cinnamon and chocolate together, so I'm going to try spreading one side of the sandwich with a thin layer of cinnamon peanut butter, and spreading the other with the dark chocolate.  At any rate, I'm very satisfied, and I'm looking forward to trying this on apples (which the jar recommeneded)

I know I will never find one that will totally be all of those things...but I will continue to try.  In the meantime, I read about this peanut butter brand and then looked it up online.  When I saw this flavor (cinnamon, peanut butter and raisins)...I thought yum!  I ordered and I was right.  It is soooo good!  I only allow myself to have it on weekends as it is a "trigger food" for me.  I have turned my friends onto this brand and flavor and they all love it!  Definitely more economical to order it through Amazon and split the order with friends.  I have found it in the stores, but for more money plus sales tax...is not worth me purchasing it!  You will not be sorry for trying this product and Amazon is definitely the way to get it!  :)

I don't even know what prompted me to buy this; however, this is the best tasting and most additive food I have ever eaten.  This is a great tasting product.  I have researched peanut butter and it actually has many health benefits: it is full of antioxidants and apparently is a heart healthy food.  Hey, do your own research.  Regardless, this is just one great tasting product.  And I warn you now that you may find yourself spooning this into your mouth and discovering you have an empty jar sitting in front of you.

review/text: My family has been eating Peanut Butter & Co's Cinnamon Raisin Swirl for years.  It has no trans fat, no cholesterol and no high fructose corn syrup.  I can pronounce all of the ingredients and could find them in a well-stocked store (no strange chemical mixtures in this product), which makes me feel comfortable feeding it to young kids. I typically eat it on bananas or on raisin bread.<br /><br />I've included this variety in baskets for Christmas gifts.  People are always really happy to get something that is tasty and an alternative to a popcorn tin.  I've also put together party favors at parties and bridal showers that incorporate this flavor (and other Peanut Butter & Co flavors).  Guests love taking home something that is unique.<br /><br />The only negative thing about this peanut butter is that sometimes the raisins are concentrated on the bottom of the jar so I have to stir in my own raisins.  The peanut butter is soft enough to incorporate additional raisins through stirring.<br /><br />I like this flavor and would recommend it to those looking for an alternative to the standard chunky and creamy peanut butters out there.

The one thing about this product is you have to mix it because the raisins get stuck on the bottom; my other complaint is the raisins seem very tiny and dry - some plumper bigger raisins would be better.<br /><br />Try asking your local grocery to order this - Walmart carries carries this brand in my area but not this variety - they just carry the dark chocolate or honey.  But usually the Walmart price is under 4 bucks while the local grocery prices are under 5 bucks and I think if you order from the company's website , the price is six bucks...all of them are cheaper than Amazon 10 bucks a jar price.<br /><br />I wish they wouldnt have to add so much sugar to make it a little bit healthier.  Id like to get the protein without added sugars and palm oil...but I guess theyre worried about taste more than health

review/summary: Peanut butter flavored sand.
review/text: Today I received my package and was excited to try out the new peanut butter, as I had previous ordered a different flavor from Peanut Butter & Co. (The dark chocolate variety, and it was delicious!) through amazon a few months ago.  However I was extremely disappointed in this batch.<br /><br />When I first looked at the jars there were quite a lot of raisins on the bottom of the jars, which was not a problem.. I thought perhaps there was just a great deal of raisins in them!  However upon opening the first jar, I was quite wrong.  It seems that all the raisins had settled to the bottom, making me dig through the entire jar to the very bottom where they had all settled and smashed.<br /><br />Though I would have expected better mixing from a premium product like this, it was not the worst part.  Once I decided to try the peanut butter itself it had a VERY gritty texture, so bad that I had to spit it out afterward.  It was like a mouth full of peanut butter flavored sand.  Every bite was like chewing on a mouth full of sugar crystals.  All of the jars seemed to have the problem with the raisins being settled to the bottom, however I did not take a taste from each of them as well.<br /><br />I would have given one star, but Amazon was very quick and easy in resolving the matter for me, so they get an extra one for that!  I can only assume this was a defective batch, as the other ratings seem to be quite high... but it is a possibility you may received a bad order.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z1WS">Planters Peanut Butter Cookie Crisps 100 Calorie Packs, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  These cookies are so tasty!  I love the peanut taste and the crispness.  A one-hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them, but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on.  Probably the most important part of weight control is portion control.<br /><br />The cookies have 3 grams fat, 0 mg Cholesterol, and 2 Weight Watchers points.

review/summary: 3.5* snack for a non-chocophile
review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

review/summary: not as good as the 100-calorie Oreos
review/text: With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.

review/summary: THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --
review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.

One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

review/summary: I'm a fan...
review/text: Dude, these things are pretty good... as long as you're not bent on them being just like Oreos. I mean, they're not. But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. The lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies, like peanut butter, cream cheese, icing, pudding, melted chocolate...

review/summary: Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling
review/text: These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!"  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.

review/summary: CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND CHOCOLATEY
review/text: Who doesn't love Oreo cookies?  Many of us well remember after school snacks of Oreo cookies and milk.  However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br /> No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.<br /><br /> A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!
review/text: I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

My honest view on these "thin crisps" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.

review/summary: Favorite Flavor & Great Soda Alternative
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when a co-worker let me taste a new flavored water drink he had discovered. I expected it to be overly sweet with and artificial flavor and aftertaste. Instead, it tasted like the real thing, wasn't too sweet, had a mild carbonation, had mostly natural ingredients and vitamins, and no calories or carbs. There is even some green tea extract! Since then I've tried the other flavors, but go back to the Pink Grapefruit as my favorite.<br /><br />Too good to be true? Almost. Ice includes Sucralose, an artificial sweetener with questionable effects on the body. If they could use an natural sweetener like Stevia and keep it from making the drink bitter, then I'd be totally sold. Another factor that leads me to take away a star is that they use artificial colors. Not a deal breaker, but I'd rather they didn't. However, if you want a healthier (and even slightly nutritious) alternative to sweet sodas and something a bit more flavorful that water, Sparking Ice might be the drink for you.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/text: Had this for the first time in NYC and went back to the bagel shop to get it for the rest of the week. It is calorie free, and includes 3% juice. Great strong Grapefruit flavor. Sweetened with Splenda (wish it were Stevia, but hey, nothing's perfect). Nice alternative to a Diet Coke/Pepsi. It reminded me of limonata soda in Italy or Orangina, but with a Grapefruit flavor. I haven't tried the other varieties.

review/summary: Too tart for me
review/text: I am an occasional fan of grapefruit, whether it be the fruit or the juice, and I found that this was a bit too tart for my tastes. Granted, grapefruit itself is tart and so the flavor makes sense but when I had every flavor of the Sparkling ICE line in my fridge, I found myself always reaching for one of the others (especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P00PGQ">Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FUL4AE">TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>) instead.<br /><br />If you really enjoy grapefruit than I think that you will love this. It's just mild enough to mix well with the carbonation and like all of the Sparkling ICE line, it's calorie free so you can't go wrong with that.<br /><br />If you occasionally drink grapefruit juice but find it too tart sometimes, I'm not sure buying a 12 pack right away would be the best bet. I would try to find it in a local store first and buy just one to try as this is very dependent on personal tastes.<br /><br />Again, the ONLY reason this is rated four stars instead of five is simply due to personal taste. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they enjoy grapefruit :)

review/text: This grapefruit flavored variety of Sparkling Ice is probably the best of this line of drinks. The pink grapefruit taste came right through, without being overly tart or sickly sweet. The carbonation level, as with all of these drinks, was just right. This is a very refreshing and thirst quenching beverage, and I hope that they never stop producing it. This one comes highly recommended!

review/summary: Sparkling Ice Pink Grapefruit
review/text: Ok, so I'm always on the lookout for substitute drinks for soda.  Because I just can't give up that fizziness, or the caffeine, or something.  And while these Sparkling Ice drinks may not have caffeine, they definitely have the fizz that I so enjoy in my drinks.  And the flavors aren't half bad either.  In fact, this Pink Grapefruit one is one of the better ones.<br /><br />I don't like grapefruit.  So why did I buy a flavored drink with that then?  Well there's something about this grapefruit taste that I like.  It's not too sour, but not too sweet either.  And considering I avoid the real fruit I can't say whether or not that it tastes like the real thing, I would think it's probably pretty close.  But it's just good, easy to drink, and definitely refreshing.  And there isn't an overabundance of flavors to get crazy with.<br /><br />The ingredients; they actually aren't too bad.  The list isn't very long, and the flavorings are natural.  There's actual grapefruit in this bottle.  There's even green tea extract.  The problems come in the form of color.  There is a type of red dye in this drink.  And I'm not too impressed with that.  I'd rather they have made it a healthier drink and it be some other color or clear.  Honestly, I think I'd even pay more if they made it that way.  But this low list of ingredients has some other positives that come with it too.  There are 0 calories and 0 sugars in this drink.  Which is incredible.  And there's even some B vitamins thrown in too.<br /><br />So while the dye makes it a tad less than healthy, this is still a pretty good soda substitute.  It's healthy, still has the fizz, and tastes good.  I definitely will keep buying it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012
