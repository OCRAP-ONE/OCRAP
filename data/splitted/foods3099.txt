review/summary: Very, very good
review/text: I had a bit of this soup mix laying around the house for years, so I thought I might as well use it.<br /><br />I was entirely surprised how good it was.  In fact, I ate the whole amount.  It has a lot of protein. I cooked it in my rice cooker and it went fine.<br /><br />I was going to get a lot of it at Safeway when I discovered it was $2.75 per package, which simply does not fit into today's budget.  I am tickled to find it relatively inexpensive on Amazon.<br /><br />As I say, I was taken by surprise by how good this product really is.

review/summary: really really expensive
review/text: We have two large dogs and are always looking for high quality treats.  The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.  The chews were not long lasting (about five minutes).  I have purchased other high quality chews for a lower price so I can't really justify the high price of these treats.  We spend a lot of money on our pets but this is the first treat/chew that I felt like they might as well have been chewing on my wallet! (I think my wallet would have lasted longer)

review/summary: Best I Have Tried So Far
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH3M">Zoe Anti-Oxidant 8-1/2-Ounce Dental Chew Treats, Medium</a> actually worked really well. We have a medium-sized lab + something mix and she really enjoyed these. I'm generally not a big fan of dog treats, because they stink,, they don't help her breath/teeth much, they have funky things inside, and she has powerful jaws that enable her to go through just about any treat in a short amount of time.<br /><br />ODOR<br />As far as the smell goes, this wasn't bad at all. In fact, not only did it improve her breath, but there was a noticeable reduction in plaque. I didn't expect the treats to actually accomplish this, and was glad to see how well they worked.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />All natural and healthy.<br /><br />LONGEVITY<br />Unfortunately, the treats didn't last long. She finished each one in just a few minutes. I suppose I shouldn't expect treats like this to last too long (hence, the five stars), but it would be nice if they did.

review/summary: My Dogs Were Not Very Enthused
review/text: I tested these treats out on three dogs, a schnauzer mix, poodle mix, and a terrier mix.  They all got very excited when I opened the bag, but the terrier was the only one who seemed very enthused about the treat itself.  The other two kind of chewed on the treats for a minute or two, then just kind of stared at them.<br /><br />The treats are a little messy, especially near the end.  My dogs left tiny crumbs on the floor, so that's something to watch out for.  They're a good size, perfect for medium build dogs.

review/summary: Quite the hit!!
review/text: When I first received Haley's (my dog) package of Zoe Anti-Oxidant Dental Chew Treats (medium size), I took Haley and 3 of the treats to my neighbor's house to visit and share with her dogs. All 3 dogs LOVED the treats and got very possessive of their own. The dogs range from about 15 pounds to 30 pounds.  It took the boston terrier the longest to eat.  There were no crumbs leftover at all.  Haley normally carries bones around for awhile to protect and guard.  She started eating her Zoe bone right away.<br /><br />These bones are similar to Denta Bones in style, but they have much better ingredients.  I've given Haley natural dental bones before, and these have a similar smell.  I'm not sure if it's the rosemary or what other ingredient.<br /><br />I am very impressed and pleased with these bones.  They seem to keep the dogs busy for a while longer than denta bones, so that is definitely a good thing!  I will be purchasing these for Haley in the future.  I doubt I would give her one every day because of the calories, but maybe she will get them as a special treat a couple times a week.

review/summary: Short life, strong odor
review/text: On arrival, I distributed a chew to each of three dogs under 20 pounds who do like chews.  They each went at their chew with a will, and in 15 minutes the chews were gone.  As the chewing was in progress, and lingering, was a distinct odor similar to horse weeds and other strong herbs.  I cannot say how "dental" the experience was, for such a quick gulp.  If one of the purposes of the chew is to occupy a pet for any extended time, this choice is a flop--but it must have been tasty.

review/summary: Dog Loves It and Perfect Size
review/text: My dog has been using Check-ups and Greenies for a while and he loves this new addition to his dental chewies routine. The medium size is perfect for my 25 lb. cocker spaniel. The bone is roughly the size of a large chicken drumstick bone. When I was opening the bag, my dog followed me around. I suspected he knew this bag of bones was for him. He grabbed the chew bone immediately after I offered it to him found a nice corner and went about his chewing. It lasted a good minute or two. This stuff is made of quinoa, gluten free, and touts anti-oxidant benefits. And I assume it tastes good because it actually smells pretty good. 5 stars for Zoe Anti-Oxidant Chew Bones and I would buy again and recommend to others. When my dog is happy... I'm happy.

Mea culpa, I didn't read the package until three days and three half-bones later.

review/text: These are the kind of dog treats that take the dog a few minutes to chew up.  They break into safe pieces so they won't get lodged in the throat or further down, but they still take a few minutes to eat as they are kind of hard.  I thought they smelled sort of medicinal, but my dog seemed to like them a lot.

review/summary: Benny likes it. But why Nutraceuticals in Dog Treats?
review/text: My cocker spaniel enjoyed these treats. They do not contain corn or wheat, which is good because he seems to get itchy when he eats those grains.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not give them to our other dog, a beagle mix. He tends to get seizures after he consumes chicken, and since these contain natural chicken flavor, I did not risk giving him these.<br /><br />I received these treats as a sample. I would not bother to purchase them because of the cost plus the fact that only one of my pets can eat them.<br /><br />I wonder if the price would be lower if designer nutrients were left out. I mean, do dogs naturally want green tea extract? I realize that studies are being done on possible benefits of this substance, but throwing some in dog treats is not the same as having a vet prescribe it. When I searched the web for research on canine green tea extract, one of the first that came up reported that some beagles died in a study using high doses of the extract, so now I feel that caution may be advisable. Of course, your dog would have to eat an awful lot of these treats to get enough of it to suffer any harm; a single treat is almost certainly okay.<br /><br />Nutraceuticals have become trendy because marketers know that people are aware that certain nutrients have impressive health benefits. And including these nutrients give manufacturers a reason to charge more. You may want to ask your vet's opinion before paying extra for designer treats.

review/summary: 4 of 5 Dogs Approve
review/text: Upon opening the package, the two young Jack Russell Terriers began bouncing up and down --they could tell from the smell that this was a treat they were going to like.  I was not at all off put by the vaguely minty, grainy smell but my wife did not care for the smell at all.  The two youngsters ran to their crates where they immediately devoured the chews in less than 2 minutes.  The treats were also given to a geriatric JRT, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an Australian Cattle Dog.  The old JRT also polished his chew off in a matter of minutes, it took the CKCS about 10 minutes and the ACD turned her nose up at the chew -- she literally pushed it into a corner of her crate and sat in the opposite corner as far away as possible from the treat.  The ACD is admittedly very picky about food and treats, but she absolutely loves bully sticks (as do all of the other dogs) which also last many times longer than these chews and cost less when one considers their staying power.<br /><br />In summary:<br />+4: Number of dogs liked<br />+0: Smell (some humans and dogs liked, others didn't)<br />-1: Cost<br />-1: Duration<br /><br />So, these chews get a score of two (2) given that all dogs in the house love bully sticks which provide much longer chewing enjoyment  at a lower cost.

review/summary: Nice Dog Treat - The Dog Liked It
review/text: What else can I say except the dog really liked these treats?  I didn't taste them, but after sniffing the something new for him treat and being a little skeptical he ran off with it and sat down to gnaw for a long time.  A good benefit is there wasn't a nasty smell to the treat before or after the dog eating it like there is with other dental-type pet treats.<br /><br />One thing I want to point out is the size of these treats - they are a lot bigger than a greenie and other similar pet dental treats, as well as a lot tougher which will take them longer to chew.  I have a small dog that weighs a little over ten pounds, so I broke this one in half which seemed like enough for him.<br /><br />See my tongue-in-cheek comment above about not tasting them, but I do believe there is a bit of salt in these, as a few hours after eating them he was extremely thirsty.<br /><br />Overall, this appears to be a good treat for your dog - time will tell if it helps his teeth!

review/text: 2 of my lab mixes really enjoyed these chews. We have a shepherd/lab mix that is really picky with his treats and he wasn't interested in them, but we weren't surprised. These were not too messy-mine always lick any crumbs off the floor anyway. They don't have a really strong smell which is nice since I have a sensitive smeller these days.

Our gal just turned eleven and has arthritis, so we have to really watch her diet since she can't exercise like she use to. She really loves them.

review/summary: Too Big for the Chihuahua but Perfect for My Medium Sized Dog
review/text: I have two dogs, a medium mixed breed and a small Chihuahua who has had a few rotted teeth pulled.  I gave both one each and the mixed breed ate it right up and finished it off in a couple of minutes.  The Chihuahua on the other hand chewed the end for a couple seconds before going into guard mode.  The broke it in half in hopes that he could chew from the middle which is smaller than the ends.  He was able to crew off a half an inch from the middle before giving up again.  At the end of the day, I figured it was too big for him and tossed what was left to my other dog that was more than happy to finish it off.

review/summary: These chew treats last but not one of our pup's favorites.
review/text: If our pup's opinion of these small dental chew treats changes, I will update this review.  I like these puppy dental chew treats because they keep her busy for a longer period of time than most chew treats.  She chews on them but she is not that crazy about them because she will quit chewing and leave it while she does something else.  I think it may be the mint flavor that is not her favorite because she has other mint flavored chew bones that she will chew on and then leave unfinished.  However, I am keeping these chew treats for back-up and am not sorry I bought them.

Hard to say if they have a good line to good Dental Health. Brushing your Dog's teeth is a good road to go for good dental hygene. They do have a bit of a stronger smell than some of the Dental Chew treats I have dealt with and a positive is that they don't contain gluten.

review/text: My chiweenie didn't think twice about making mince meat out of these chew treats. Once she got a hold of one, she didn't stop gnawing on it until there was only a knobby end left. It didn't take her too long to do it either. As for helping with her bad breath - meh. It became minty bad breath, but it was still icky breath.<br /><br />My yorkie, on the other hand, didn't really care too much for these treats. He'd tried them only because the other dog was enjoying it so much, but never cared for them much.<br /><br />From an owner's point of view, I do like the good ingredients these chew treats have. They don't get sticky, they are not messy, and they smell ok. I would gladly buy these again seeing how much my chiweenie enjoyed them.

review/text: My 21 lb Cockapoo loved these treats. He's only 1 1/2 yrs old and I brush his teeth regularly, so his teeth still look great and he does not have bad mouth odor. If the treats helped to clean his teeth it was not noticeable to me. I do wonder how effective the treats are at teeth cleaning and mouth odor because my dog was able to consume them very quickly- within just a few minutes. Perhaps the treats leave some sort of residue in the dog's mouth and on their teeth to prolong the effectiveness. I thought the treats smelled rather strongly of beef stock, though the ingredients list natural chicken flavor, rosemary, parsley, and vanilla among other things. The ingredient list is not too long and are all natural. I've found my Cockapoo to have a rather sensitive stomach and these treats do not upset his digestive tract. I try to buy only natural, limited ingredient foods and treats. Unlike other reviewers, I have had no issues with crumbs or staining from these dark brown treats. My dog tends to eat the treats on our beige leather couches and there has been no residue.

review/summary: The dog loves them and they probably help his teeth
review/text: These treats are a huge hit with the dog; it's the only item he takes to another room to enjoy and be certain that we won't change our minds about it. They've got a tough exterior that he works hard at, but he likes it so well he never gives up. It's about 15 minutes from start to finish. That's a lot of good jaw and tooth exercise.<br /><br />Of course, when we ask him if his teeth feel cleaner, he doesn't say a lot, and a visual inspection doesn't tell us a lot. But with the way he works at these, we're certain it's doing something worthwhile.<br /><br />We've had other rawhide-like treats, and the dog abandons them after a while. Not so with these.<br /><br />We also liked the packaging, which was attractive, reseals nicely, and isn't extravagant or wasteful.<br /><br />The only thing we recommend you watch out for is to get a large enough treat size. We had a package of the "medium" size and for our dog, about 60 pounds, a larger size would have been better.<br /><br />Highly recommended --- by the dog as well as us.

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats!  There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes.  As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />Teeth cleaning ability? We were only able to sample 1 bag up front, so I can not comment on how well they would do over time, but can say that they did appear to be soft and chewy and looked like they would clean teeth over a period of weeks.  As for her breath?  Again, not enough quantity to make a call one way or another, but she did not have what I would consider bad breath.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per...  If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them.  However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them.  In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/summary: Slowly approached, but definitely enjoyed
review/text: My pups (aged 6 & 5) both enjoyed these, but since they talk I couldn't get their "official" position on them.  That said, having trained them extensively I'm pretty good at watching their body language.  When presented with these both pups were eager for a 'treat,' but after getting these in their mouths they both were slightly tentative to dig in.  Perhaps its because my pups normally get high-protein snacks like dried chicken breast, and they're not used to brown rice flour, quinoa flour, pea flour, & tapioca starch. Or perhaps it was the vanilla/mint flavor. Either way, it sort of reminded me of kids acting with trepidation about eating a new vegetable. But, after a few fleeting moments the question marks popping out of their heads went away and both pups earnestly chewed up their treats.<br /><br />The package says "Dental Chews" which normally speaks to an ability to remove tartar or freshen breath. The package states that the product "freshens breath naturally,"  so I assume the mint serves as a breath freshener, thus earning the title "dental chew" instead of "treat."<br /><br />That said, I'm pleased to know the product is wheat-free and corn-free, as I'm not a fan of feeding my pups either one of those all-too-common ingredients.  I was going to give the product four stars because the dogs didn't jump on them like white on rice, but then I realized that this is a very healthy treat that is a whole lot better for them than most of the stuff that's out there, and after the slight hesitation, both dogs seemed to enjoy these very much ... so five stars it is.

review/summary: My dog loved them - good for a special treat.
review/text: I'm not someone who gives their dog all-natural or organic food and treats as a regular thing, but I'm always willing to try something new. I swear my dog could tell by the crinkle of the package that they were for her, and she was at my feet the entire time I was opening the bag. I handed it to her, she grabbed it, and off she went. She devoured it, so I guess it was a success. They are quite a bit more expensive than her daily treats that I buy, but these are great for a now and again treat.

review/summary: A treat fit for man's best friend.
review/text: I got these for my parents dog Mya. I thought that they would be a nice treat for my kids to give Mya when they went to visit. As expected, they were eaten very quickly. This was a nice surprise, as Mya can sometimes be picky with treats.<br /><br />Whether these are healthier, I don't know. While Mya can be picky, most dogs will eat any treat you put in front of them. So it is tough to say how good these are vs other options.<br /><br />I suppose the best thing to do is see if your four-legged friend enjoys them.

review/summary: My boy just loves these smelly things.
review/text: This is not the first doggie treat that Amazon offered me to review.  I do not offer many treats to my Pug so he doesn't get too fat.<br />But I liked that these are more healthy than the usual ones, and the price was even better than the average chew treats.<br />Personally I did not like the smell but he did,and that is all that matters. I had  just got the package in the house when he started to drive me crazy, he actually smelled it through the packaging.<br />He jumped up on my lap and wanted me to open it, and I did, the packaged was easy to open and it comes in a resalable bag.<br />He really loved these, my boy does not always eat treats and has been known to leave them on the floor.  He likes raw fruit and vegetables but he went at these hungrily<br />and finished them in no time. They are the right size for him but they did go down very quickly but he did not pester me for more so I can only assume they filled him up.<br />Now when I give him one he is very attentive and he sits politely so I will let him have it.<br />I would buy these again, I chose the medium size and that was perfect for my boy.

review/text: I love that these chews aren't artificially flavored and colored and don't have any of those odd animal body parts (pig ear, cow toe whatever) that are kind of repulsive to think about. Even better, shaggy dog seems to like them, too.  I do have to admit that even after chewing this he has doggy breath, but there's no saying it wouldn't have been worse without these chews.

review/summary: Great dental treat
review/text: These dental chews are both a great treat for your dog as well supposedly helping with tartar buildup.  My dog, who is normally picky with treats, devoured these.  Being a fifty pound dog, it's also the perfect size for her -- not bulky like some rawhides (which she detests) and not too small like some treats.  One per evening was sufficient for her.<br /><br />My only knock on these is they are a bit pricey.  There are comparable products available priced a few dollars less.  If the price is reasonable to the consumer, I'd definitely recommend trying them as a healthy treat for your dog.

review/text: I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.

review/summary: love these
review/text: I get a lot of stuff from the Amazon Vine program but this is the first item that I liked so much that I added a subscription to my account for them. Freakin' LOVE these things. My golden retriever is 3 years old. She sees the vet every six months (ongoing medical issue) and each time the vet checks her teeth. She has never had to have a vet cleaning because I'm a bit compulsive about keeping her teeth clean. She normally gets a Greenie a day along with an additive in her water and regular teeth brushing. Yet there always seems to be a bit of tarter build up on her back teeth that I end up scrapping off with a scaler. After chomping down just two of these, that tartar was completely gone. The nice part is that they are much harder for her to chew than the Greenies. Even though I gave her size medium, it still took her several minutes to chew it up. (Greenies are gone within a matter of seconds) And she LOVES them. I'm pretty sure she would save a baby from a blazing inferno if she thought that is what it would take to get one. When she sees me going for the bag, she starts in with doing all the tricks she can think of. Hilarious to watch. They smell...interesting. Like mint and beef jerky? I can't put my finger on the smell exactly. It's not bad or anything. I am now getting a bag of mediums sent each month and will make it a part of her weekly dental hygiene. Very glad to have found these!

review/summary: Great for bad dog breath!
review/text: The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a really strong minty, doggy smell. I still can't decide what it is beneath the mint, but it is potent! Whatever it is, my little Maltese had no problem with it. She quickly buried the first one in the backyard, which she only does with things she really likes. She'll recover it later, I'm sure. The next day I gave her another one which she worked on for several hours before it was gone. When she jumped in my lap later, I immediately noticed that her bad breath problem was gone...wow! And it seems to last for hours. For us this is a big plus since doggy halitosis is a big problem with her.<br /><br />Another big pro for me is that these chews contain no wheat or corn products which cause allergy problems for my dog. Treats that she actually likes that don't contain these products are hard to find.<br /><br />One other con besides the strong odor is the gassiness that occurs later. I might not have put two and two together on this had several other reviewers not mentioned it. This is not normally a problem with her, however, and since nothing else in her diet has changed, I would have to attribute it to the Zoe chews.<br /><br />Since bad breath is such a problem with our dog, I might be tempted to purchase them regularly, even if the price works out to $2 per chew (5 in a bag @ $10 per bag). I might shop around first to see if I can find a better price, though. Maybe I could make them a weekly treat instead of a daily one.

He doesn't even like those popular greenies or any other dental chew we have tried.<br /><br />At least, we found these. He absolutely love them. Our other dog likes them too, but he likes everything.<br /><br />They do have a mild smell but it isn't unpleasant to me. The first ingredients are brown rice and quinoa so I like that these aren't made out of junk fillers like so many dog treats and chews. on the market.

review/summary: Vanilla mint?
review/text: I understand that it says vanilla mint flavor, but I also expected it to smell something like that.  To be blunt, it is funky!  All three of my dogs (two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier)seemed to think that they smelled great, so who am I to judge.  I am careful about the treats that they get because the cocker spaniels try to inhale most of them.  These actually took them a while to annihilate.  Some treats leave a sticky residue on them and the carpet, but these weren't messy.  Although they smelled funky, the smell didn't linger on their breath.  The size was excellent for my dogs.  A lot of treats that are recommended for their size tend to be much smaller.  Six came in the pack, so I waited a while before giving them the second round.  They are a bit too expensive for me to buy regularly.  If they ever go on sale I would probably stock up.  Overall a pretty good product.

review/text: My dogs (a 20-lb. and 32-lb. terrier mixes) showed their approval by enthusiastically accepting these chews and wagged their tales eagerly for more. To be fair, they love nearly all treats, but I approve of these, as well, because of the healthful ingredients, neutral odor (at least I couldn't smell them without getting down on hands and knees to sniff), and lack of slobber-staining as the dogs (as usual) chose out area rugs to enjoy their treats. I noticed no sharp points as they chewed, and the dogs are chew-savvy enough not to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />With high quality ingredients and a high terrier approval rating, I highly recommend Zoe Anti-Oxident Dental Chew Treats.

review/text: At last, a dental chew that my one dog doesn't inhale in one bite. Altho, it does smell pretty gross -- doggie chew on steroids, proteiny smell. I didn't detect any of the vanilla mint they were talking about in the description.<br />I was pleased to see Maggie the Inhaler actually working little pieces off of these. Her chomping down entire Greenies has worried me in the past. Because if it's in her stomach whole then it's doing nothing for her teeth.<br />The smell, like many dog treats, is a little overpowering. But I'll put up with it, if it's actually helping get her teeth a little cleaner.

review/summary: 6 out of 6 Dogs love these chew bones
review/text: We have 6 big dogs here, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Walker Treeing Coonhound. These dogs go through a bunch of snacks, treats, bones and toys to say the least. I am always on the lookout for healthier snacks - especially since the Ridgebacks tend to be sensitive to corn and wheat. (oddly enough, the random squirrel doesn't phase them)I like these Zoe Dental Chew Bones - no corn, no wheat and no soy.<br /><br /> When the bag was first opened, the smell of roasted chicken wafted out - good first impression! They don't feel particularly greasy to the touch, yet clearly have a flavored coating. I passed one out to each dog and they went to their respective beds to knaw away. The Ridgebacks can burn through other brands of similar type chews within a few bites, so I expected the same thing here. They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better. That was astonishing - these are hounds and they always assume someone else has something better than they were given. Meanwhile, that smell of roasted chicken has permeated the kitchen - so much so that now I want chicken for lunch! I will buy these in the future for our Heathens.

review/text: My pups like these chews and can down one in just a few minutes, however, they seem to give my girls a bit of a gas problem.  Now, the pups have always farted but these treats seem to stimulated their little gas makers to go full tilt.<br /><br />As instructed, I haven't given more than one treat a day and I've skipped days and now I also know better than to give them the treats in the evening.  All I need is to have a bedroom filled with a bunch of dogs pootering all night long.<br /><br />As for the treats themselves they smell like mint and molasses to me.  They're somewhat glossy and you get 6 medium-sized 5" bones to a bag.  Pricy.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll buy any of these "Lifestyle Treats for Dogs" in the future due to the costs and the farts but the dogs like them well enough.<br /><br />Is being a dog really a lifestyle?

review/text: (These are the medium anti-oxidant ones)<br /><br />Our dog likes these well enough.  She's not "crazy" about them, though.  She'll chew on one for a few minutes, but she won't go to town on it like she will other chews (raw hide, pig ears, etc.  So I don't think she "loves" them.<br /><br />Anyway, I broke it down a little further, as I'm sure every dog is different and some dogs might really love these.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Really nice and hard, will last a long time, take a long time for the dog to chew up.<br />- Made of quality ingredients, no corn, wheat or soy or other junk.<br />- package is nice and neat, not excessive, hard to get open, or anything like that.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- They smell really odd.  Almost like... breakfast sausage, but less appealing.  Our dog keeps her toys and 1 or 2 chews she's working on in the living room.  All the other kinds/brands she has, I can never smell them later.  But even after two days, I can still smell the thing when I walk into the living room.  Not really crazy about that, especially since she doesn't look like she'll finish one sooner than a week.<br /><br />- The price.  To me, the price seems a little high for what you get, even with the subscribe and save.<br /><br />If the smell wasn't so strong, I would probably give these 5 stars.  And our dog is still technically a puppy (lab) so perhaps she'll like them better as she gets a little older.

review/text: My beagles really loved these. The bones are approx. 4 inches long and kind of shaped like a real chicken bone.  When I opened the bag, I could really smell them - not really a good smell, but I guess it's something dogs like. Once they started eating them, I could smell the mint. I can't really say they are long lasting. I timed my dogs eating them and it took one 3 minutes and the other one 4 minutes.<br /><br />What I like is that these seem to be pretty good for our dogs. There are apples, carrots, chia seeds and parsley, among other natural ingredients in the bones.  There is no meat, just chicken flavor.  The price is definitely not out of line with other treats that are similar to this, such as Greenies and Healthy Edibles.  I'll probably continue to buy these.

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: I have 4 miniature dachshunds and one is very picky about his treats. Usually he snubs treats. I usually don't buy treats like these bones, but thought they might be a good change for my pooches (especially their breath). I was completely surprised when all the dogs LOVED them. In fact, the picky one ate his and then tried stalking the girls to get their bones, too. He never does that! While I might not have bought these bones again because they are a little pricey (about $10 for 6 bones), I think now I am going to have to invest in some more seeing as they made the dogs so happy! I can't say much about the breath enhancement- it still smells pretty foul in there- but maybe they need to experience the bones a bit more before there is any breath improvement. I guess these will become a regular treat in my house since it is the first thing short of a juicy steak I have seen the dogs so excited about!

We have a 2-yo golden/Labrador retriever mix, the best dog we've ever had, and while the unusual makeup of these goodies gave him brief pause to consider, he was chowing down heartily before too long.  And the best news is, as a breath mint they affirmatively do the job!  No more doggie breath!  And it's a pleasant coincidence that Zoe (a Greek word for "life") is a family name shared by my mom and HER mom, so that's a nice touch that you don't care about but I wanted to mention to pad out this review.  Let your dog enjoy a package of these and I bet you'll be back for more!

When I opened the can, I can smell something that was a bit off; it was not particularly unpleasant but it was distinct enough to be detected.  And when I brewed the coffee, I could taste whatever it was that was causing the off smell.  It's hard to describe this taste and smell; the best I can come up with to describe the smell is that it reminds me of either paper or plastic; maybe both.  And the coffee flavor/taste is muted.<br /><br />I will not purchase this product again.  I was very optimistic about this product when I ordered it as I had recently purchased and enjoyed another coffee product (regular, not decaffeinated) by Melitta.  Since this item may not be returned, I guess I'm out of luck.  I'll think twice about ordering groceries from Amazon again; especially if untried and when it comes in bulk like this one did.

review/text: Best decaffeinated coffee !!  Never bitter, does not have that tin taste so much decafe coffee has.  Use less coffee so lasts longer.  I have bought this coffee for many years and do not intend to change.  Hard to find the decafe in the stores and Amazon price is a good buy.

review/summary: Decaf Melitta
review/text: Melitta coffee is great.  I couldn't find it in the major grocery stores in my area and was pleased to find it here.  Both the regular and decaf are excellent.  The decaf doesn't taste like decaf, even my die hard coffee drinking friends agree.  I used to drink only regular, now I'm a Melittiack.

review/text: I picked up a few cases of this Decaffeinated Coffee based on the "great" reviews.  Well, at first try, I didn't find it that refreshing or robust.  It tastes like dirty water but the Grounds smell great.  Too bad there's no taste when I brew it.<br /><br />Dallmayr Decaffeinated Gourmet Coffee, is far superior.

review/summary: One Fabulous Coffee!
review/text: I've been on the lookout for a decaf coffee to use with my Melitta One Cup Cone.  I tried the grocery store and was drinking one particular brand, but I wanted to try out something else.  So then I thought why not try Melitta's own brand?  I did and it is so good.  It has a smooth flavour, clean taste and no bitter or sour afternotes.  The grind is very fine and is much more suited for use with the One Cup Cone than the other brand of coffee I was using.  However, one oddity: the cans of coffee didn't have an expiry date, just a code number.  I called Melitta who interpreted the code as October 18 2007 and told me I had 18 months from the date of manufacture to drink all four cans.  Fortunately, that won't be very difficult.

review/text: This is an excellent decaf coffee - rich flavor, not bitter, a real treat! It is ground very fine, which makes it work especially well in a Senseo coffee maker. I use this instead of the far more expensive pods (just put a tablespoon or so in a small coffee filter, and use the two pod attachment). You get a great cup of coffee and still get the foam layer on top just like with the pods.<br /><br />Highly recommend!

review/text: I had enjoyed Melitta's de-caf for some time, then my access was cut off. Little did I know how lucky I was. Finding Melitta coffees at Amazon solved my problems. During the interim I tried several brands available in the supermarket. All except the $15 dollar-a-pound beans were unsatisfactory. If you are looking for a rich cup of coffee in the evening, this is the best I have found.

review/text: This is pretty decent tasting coffee for the price. The only issue I had was I was using in my reused K-cups and a new my K-cup holder and the small grind cause the water to clog up and overflow. The solution I had to do is first put in normal ground coffee half way up the k_cup and finish with the Melita.

review/text: I like this brand of coffee, & have tried different decaffs; this is a good one. The size is good; not to small or large. I used to grind my own coffee; got tired of that. So I like that it is in a fairly small can & doesn't dry out so much before it gets used. If you are a regular person who wants a good cup of coffee, this fills the bill. If you are a coffee critic (& I mean this in a nice way), it may or may not meet your needs.

review/summary: Fantastic Chocolate Cake
review/text: I have a wheat intolerance, but wanted to have some cake on my birthday.  I tried this cake mix expecting it to be the usual odd-tasting substitute for regular wheat flour products.  Wow, were we ever pleasantly surprised.  This cake had a very chocolate-y flavor - better than any chocolate cake I've ever tasted.  The texture was excellent - moist and dense.  We spread some Nutella between the layers and made some frosting for the top.  My 2 boys and my husband all eat wheat and they raved about this cake.  My son has asked for it for his birthday.  I sliced up the leftover cake, wrapped it, and put it in the freezer.  We let it thaw (covered) on the counter for a couple hours and it tasted just as delicious as the day it was baked.  Thank you, King Arthur - this is a winner!

review/summary: Definitely worth the price
review/text: This product rates ten stars in my opinion. I must cook just about everything from scratch because of celiac disease and multiple food allergies. Another large company sells a chocolate cake mix, but it has soy in it, which I am allergic to, so I was estatic when this product hit the market. I had a slight problem with the mix climbing up the beaters of my hand held mixer....next time I will use my heavy duty stand mixer like I should have the first time around. My cupcakes were better than the "regular" cake mix that I used for my husband who does not have a gluten problem. I live at 4400 ft. above sea level, and these cupcakes were so good I ordered more mix on line, with free shipping since this product is not sold in my home area.I'm sure my local Kroger supermarket would special order it, since they carry the KA flour, but it was faster to do it online.  My first package was purchased while I was traveling and I'm so glad I bought it. Definitely a keeper!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: This is an excellent cake that tastes as good as any other chocolate cake I have ever had. I made cupcakes to freeze and remove individually as needed. They were moist, but not soggy the day after. They also froze very well. The directions are slightly involved. Not difficult at all but it does take a bit longer to mix up than the typical cake mix. The results are definitely worth the extra time though. Tastes great with peanut butter frosting!<br /><br />Many gluten free mixes contain soy; this one doesn't. Nor does it contain any of the other 8 common allergens. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is the cost. Limiting the servings per person helps compensate for the cost of this product.

When we were at the party EVERYONE wanted the Gluten Free King Arthur Cake. It smelled so good. The color was rich. The taste was just wonderful, with a rich chocolate taste, and very moist. I have been Gluten free for 11 years, and i have never seen a reaction like this. After the party, my non-celiac brother said i could have only made the King Arthur Gluten Free Cake, it was so good. My son asked for this cake for his birthday. He doesn't normally like Gluten free items.

review/summary: Best GF mix or recipe I've tried
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this product.  I've used King Arthur flour for all of my wheat baking, and have struggled to find recipes to bake for my GF family members.  I made this cake mix for my niece's b-day last week... paired with Duncan Hines GF frosting... and got rave reviews from everyone (GF and non-GF).  The GF folk were astonished the cake was from a box mix.  The batter is a little challenging to handle due to thickness mid-way through the mixing, but better than many GF batters I've worked with.  Make sure you mix well and aerate the batter so the cake will not deflate after you remove from oven.  The other great thing about this mix is that, unlike other GF mixes, one box will give you two 9 inch rounds.  I will be stocking my kitchen with King Arthur GF products from now on.

review/summary: Yum! Delicious cardamom.
review/text: I couldn't find whole cardamom at 3 of my local supermarkets and the ethnic markets were too far. Luckily, I found whole cardamom here and it was perfect. First time I've ordered a spice online, and I'll admit it felt a bit odd at first... but after my experience, I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

review/summary: Hard to find item at great price
review/text: Our local Indian restaurant always uses cardamom pods in their rice and I LOVE it!  I decided to start using them when I cooked at home but couldn't find anything but ground cardamom.  I was delighted to find the pods here and was happy to find them reasonably priced.  I will order again!

review/text: These cardamom pods were very fresh and aromatic.  I have been keeping them in a ziploc bag to keep them fresh.  The amount and quality of cardamom you get from this seller is excellent.  I would highly recommend, as I could not find green pods in stores!

review/summary: sugar free soy free treaT
review/text: It is difficult to find soy free candy of any kind, much less sugar free and soy free.  This is both.  The taste is mildly sweet with no sugar alchohol side effects.

review/summary: Very flavorful
review/text: This cereal has a very nice taste if you like blueberries.  It has huge blueberries and lots of crunch from the different kinds of cereal. I wasn't sure how I would like it when I ordered originally but I couldn't wait to eat more once I tried it. I actually looked forward to having my cereal in the mornings. This is one I will order again.<br /><br />Update 3-2012<br />I lowered my rating on this cereal because the last couple of times I've gotten it there have been fewer and fewer blueberries.  This time, there might have been 6 blueberries in the whole box.  I'm not sure how they can call it blueberry pomegranate anymore.  I won't be ordering it anymore.

review/summary: Peace Cereal Blueberry Pomegranate
review/text: My family loves this cereal.  I mix it with my generic wheat-o-type cereal; as I like less sweet.  My family loves to eat it for breakfast or a snack with regular milk or almond milk.  It is also a great yogurt topper.<br /><br />We have received several boxes and will continue to purchase this item.

review/text: this is a delicious, and nutritious cereal. Even for me, and I am not a typical cereal eater. the only thing I noticed is that it does seem to be too sweet, but I think that is a personal taste issue. My husband and daughter love it, only wish the boxes were bigger.

review/summary: Wonderful Candy!
review/text: What a great product!! I used to buy them at the store but for some stupid reason they discontinued the candy.  I have a sweet tooth but I can't buy regular candy but this was the best sugarless candy I ever had.  I give it very high marks!!

review/summary: Luscious and full flavored
review/text: I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and this is one of my favorites.  In only 4 minutes you get a cup of black tea that is well balanced with a pronounced flavor and aroma of vanilla beans.  Everytime I make it at home I feel like I am getting high end tea shop tea in my own kitchen.  I love that there is enough natural sweetness (and little natural bitterness) that I can enjoy this without any milk or sweetener, unless I really want to.  It is a fantastic flavor so much so that I have repeatedly bought this tea despite the price.

review/summary: It's vanilla.  It's Mighty Leaf.  It's delicious!
review/text: Of course it's a matter of taste, but I'll join the small chorus in singing the praises of this wonderful tea. To date, I have not been disappointed by Mighty Leaf (the Organic Breakfast is another favorite). However, I should issue a warning: If you serve Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean to guests after dinner, be prepared to pour a second cup!

review/text: I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.

review/text: I loved this tea when I tried it at a restaurant. The tea bag itself is made from a silky, shimmering material not unlike a pair of sexy panties. The flavor of the vanilla is lovely against the black tea. I sent a box to my mother and it arrived quickly and she loved it although she did not mention the tea bags similarities to sexy panties.

review/summary: Lovely tea
review/text: We need some new loose-leaf tea for work and so after a quick search I chose this. It is a lovely tea. The vanilla is a significant component of the flavor of this tea so it is quite different from a traditional Earl Grey, but not in a bad way. I would buy again.

review/text: Really good tea.  It's got a rich set of flavors that are unique from other Earl Grey Cremes I've had.  I thought the amount was a little small, but it does have a really nice taste, so I'd probably get it again.  If the size was a touch larger I'd definitely get it again.

review/summary: Beautiful Plant
review/text: I'm very happy with this plant. After relocating from NYC to SF and not being able to bring my plants with me I was missing them. So, one lonely evening in my new apartment on Amazon.com I ordered this plant not expecting much but when she arrived I was shocked by how big, full and lush this plant is on arrival. She's growing very nicely in my window. Thanks!
