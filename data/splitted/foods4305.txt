review/summary: Beware new formula!
review/text: Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible.

review/summary: Look at the ingredients after chicken meal!
review/text: I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed.

review/summary: My dog lost too much weight on this food.
review/text: I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products.  Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae.

review/summary: Problem Dog Food
review/text: I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.  Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise.  Further feeding resulted in more problems.  We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGZ2L2">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: No Pollen...
review/text: According to FoodSafetyNews.com on 11/07/2011;  77 percent of the honey sampled from big box stores like Costco, Sam's Club, Walmart, Target and H-E-B had the pollen filtered out. Ultra filtering is a high-tech procedure where honey is heated, sometimes watered down and then forced at high pressure through extremely small filters to remove pollen, which is the only foolproof sign identifying the source of the honey. It is a spin-off of a technique refined by the Chinese, who have illegally dumped tons of their honey - some containing illegal antibiotics - on the U.S. market for years.<br /><br />Amazing what corporations do for profit. Pollen is what I consume honey for. Pollen is what helps my body as a medicine, a super food, antioxidants, etc. for my health. Without pollen, I might as well consume sugar. Fancy Grade A, Natural, Pure and even Raw are very misused words. These words are used to fool consumers just like it is done in every sector of the food industry. Conventional honey simply does not even come close to organic since it has many unwanted ingredients like GM plants, pesticides, etc. which harm the environment, the honey bee and my health. I consume Manuka as well as certified 100% organic raw honey from reputable source. That way I get the pollens and the antioxidants in the honey like I am suppose to. You will be surprised what you will find in your neighbourhood organic stores. I purchased one container from Costco but now I know better.

review/summary: Great treat and entertainment for our dog!
review/text: We bought these large size rawhide treats for our German Shepherd (100 lb dog). He absolutely loves them! He will sit and chew them until they are gone.... probably about 30 minutes worth of fun for him. They do crumble a little bit (especially the red meat center), but he usually cleans up most of the big pieces himself. We give the bones to him in his kennel, so we do not have a problem with any sort of staining. A quick vacuum of the kennel and the tiny remnants are gone too. He has never had any sort of digestive upset with consuming these bones either. All in all a great treat... only downside is the price... at $3.33 a piece it is sad that they don't last longer than 30 minutes.

review/text: My dog's normally do not fully eat rawhide bones.  They will play with them and chew on them but never fully finish them.  These bones the will devour in about 30 minutes flat.  It doesn't seem to have any effect of their digestive tract as I would know picking up their waste.  I say these seem to be a great healthy treat for dogs.  They also make smaller versions which are just as good.  I recommend them for smaller dogs.  These are one of the treats I regularly buy.

review/summary: Dingo is the best!
review/text: I have 5 dogs of various size, age, and temperament and all can agree on one thing - Dingo. They love these bones and it is the only brand of rawhide I buy simply because it is the only brand all 5 have shown interest. I buy smaller ones for the little dogs and my Border Collie gets the large. However I often find my Chihuahua steals the larger bones...hilarious to see him try to carry the thing. My one bit of advice is never leave a dog unattended with rawhide type bones, or any chewable treats. Sometimes they can swallow larger pieces than they can handle. I have not had that happen to my dogs, but better to be safe.

Sometimes there would only be a few peices of popcorn that popped and they would be burned anyways!<br /><br />Even the generic grocery store brands of popcorn pop better than this.<br /><br />When I had the best luck with this product, a the unburned popcorn would fill about 1/4 of the bag.  But when i tried to eat it, since it was such a small amount of popcorn, it was soaked in grease and butter and tasted terrible.<br /><br />I'm surprised that such an inferior product is located under a search for "gourmet food" when it doesn't even compare to the cheapest brands of popcorn on the market.

I have an Reverse Osmosis (RO) system, and enjoy making the tea with the RO water. Bottled water from the store also works. I have found it is best to make with water that is not quite boiling, and I let it steep a full five minutes. It is not a strong tea, so I typically leave the bag in the tea as I drink it. In fact, on occasion, I have used two tea bags per cup.

review/text: My yorkie-poo has been getting these bones for about a year now.  They are literally the ONLY thing we've found that completely neutralized his breath when it gets stinky.  I don't like to give him these more than a couple of times a week, even though he could have one a day - partly because they are not cheap, but also because he does seem to get an upset stomach if he has these daily.  My dog absolutely loves these bones and we have to double bag them so he can't catch any scent of them or he pesters us!  Every flavor we've tried has been a hit.  We call them our "stinky breath bones" and have found them to be well worth the expense.

He gets one daily as recommended, and reminds me nightly to have his teeth brushed, and stomach filled with one.Zukes products appear to contain quality ingredients,are of good size, and I feel a reasonably priced. Highly recommended. Ask your dog!

review/summary: Taste test first
review/text: I bought an individual Z-Bone dental chew, Carrot Crunch flavor, from my local pet store before deciding to order the large size.  I wanted to be sure my miniature poodle would like them.  I am so glad I did test it out.  When I gave it to him, he didn't seem too interested in it at first.  He left it for several hours before finally deciding to eat it.  The next morning, bright and early, we awoke to him vomiting in his crate.  Looking at the vomit, I could see small chunks of the Z-Bone dental chew.  I guess I should have watched him closer to see that he was thoroughly chewing the bone (he's never had this problem before).  Since he didn't, he wasn't able to digest it.  So, I recommend buying the individual one first then watching your dog to be sure he chews it well.  They seem like a great product, but just not the right one for my dog.  I will stick to Get Naked dental chews.  He really likes them and digests those just fine.

review/summary: I'll Never Doubt Honest Kitchen Again
review/text: For the first few years we've had our German Shepherd we fed her Honest Kitchen mixed with Canidae.  She was a healthy weight, sleek with a shiny coat.  However, I hate to admit that I complained to my husband about the cost so he switched her to Newman's Own and Alpo.  Within 6 months she's overweight and has horrendous ear problems.  Horrendous!  She walks crooked because her head is tilted, and continually she presses her ear against our hands to massage the base of the ear.  The smell is noxious and whines or yelps out when it obviously pains her.  The vet kept giving us otic washes, but never questioned the source of the chronic ear inflammation.  A friend put me in touch with a breeder and the breeder immediately asked about her food.  She said that Honest Kitchen is a FANTASTIC food choice for dogs if you're not going to feed them a raw diet, and that her ear problems are likely a direct result of her changed diet.  So we're back to Honest Kitchen...and the cost is definitely worth it to have a healthy, happy dog!

He is sleek and shiny, full of energy and life. For 11, he is still very much like a puppy......full of play.  It is not that he wasn't before, but I'm confident that this food has really contributed to more vibrant health.  On top of that, he just loves the stuff! Thanks Honest Kitchen.  So glad we have some healthy food choices for our furry friends.

I must add something to doctor it up such as some canned food, chopped meat, etc.  I don't know if the lack of palatability is a problem with the texture or taste.

review/summary: Our Siberian Huskies love this!
review/text: We have been cooking (with using whole-foods) and home-preparing our sibes meals for several years now. Before we started cooking/preparing foods for them, we tried several holistic brands of foods (kibble, canned, freeze dried, dehydrated).  The Honest Kitchen dehydrated dog food was the only food they loved. This too was the only way we felt comfortable with preparing (as close to) a "raw food" diet (as possible). THK seemed to be the best solution for our concerns, when we tried B.A.R.F. (the popular raw food diet for dogs).<br /><br />Often, we will use any of the varieties of The Honest Kitchen foods for dogs in our recipes (like: meatballs, meatloaf & cookies) or even feed this on the side (as a side dish with their meals) or as a mix in...and the huskies still love it.  Us humans love it for the convenience and those days when we need a quicker meal idea for the sibes.  Force is one of our furry babies' favorite formulas, but they do enjoy all of them.

review/summary: Best thing for my GSD's sensitive GI system
review/text: My dog easily gets colitis flare ups. Even when she was "normal" she was not having good stools - we've tried almost all the medium to excellent brands of kibble. Since adding THK to our dog's diet, she stays regular for a long time, except if an extremely stressful situation happens. No more trips to the vet, no more meds and prednisone. We only have to give one meal a day of the Honest Kitchen, the other is kibble. THK is so fresh and wholesome - this is what was missing from our GSD's diet.<br /><br />This company responds promptly through e-mail or phone if you have questions. They also have sent some nice email promotions to us. Force and Embark is what our dog seems to like. She can eat grains, like in Verve, but does not like the texture so much. To be honest myself, our dog does not really like the taste of this food (but there were many kibbles she did not like either). We do need to add some boiled meats or something tempting for her to eat the whole bowl, but the healthy outcome is worth it. Our vet initially thought our dog had food allergies, I really think she is just sensitive to processed foods. She can eat most proteins; beef and salmon in limited amounts. Also this food is so convenient - we tried prepared raw, but I would often forget to thaw it out. This food is easy to prepare and can be easily transported if you need to travel. Go ahead and try it!

I am returning this food to the store where I bought it and will be ordering the other dehydrated food online. This food "should" be okay, but there is just something in it that did not agree with my dog. If you plan on trying this, buy the small sample first.

Sweet, chewy and easily portable, the Twizz stands alone as a glorious reflection of God's most abundant provision. In the ancient language of the Hebrews, a sacred word - lecheyim - was used to describe food ('lechem') whose taste was so divine that only the great prophets were considered holy enough to even utter its name. The Twizz, for sure, is our modern day manna, a food sent from heaven to supply our every need on the journey of life.

I don't even have to mention that they're a low-fat delicacy, but some healthnuts do need a sugary fix sometimes, and Twizzlers can get the job done without totally throwing off a diet.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who loves life.  These little treasures are the perfect little break from reality.

review/text: These are basically applesauce with a grape twist to the flavor.  They taste a lot like grape fruit bars. We've tried several flavors, and each person has a different favorite, but they're all good. They taste different enough that they would take longer to get boring.<br /><br />The cap twists off, you suck out the applesauce through the tube, and you can put the cap back on if you need to finish later.  These are perfect for lunches or even in the car.  The size is about the same as a snack cup of applesauce.<br /><br />My baby can eat from it easily if I hold it, and it's much less messy than a jar.  The texture is not as pureed as stage 1 babyfood, but not as thick as a regular jar of applesauce.<br /><br />Shelf life is about 1 year on the ones I got.

review/summary: Yummy and convenient - what's not to like?
review/text: I bought these for my son (now 1), so he could try a puree that included organic grapes - traditional baby food doesn't. I liked that the mashups are totally organic and totally natural - it's nice to be able to pronounce everything on the ingredient list. Throughout his introduction to real food, I made sure to try things before giving them to him, to make sure I was feeding him food that was worth eating, so of course, I had to taste this, as well. And now I'm hooked on these myself. YUM! It worked as a food for the baby, but this is definitely not baby food! The texture is basically that of a smooth applesauce, which makes it easy to slurp through the package's straw-like top. But the taste is all grape, like purple Concord grape juice. It's fantastic! And the pouch is SUCH convenient packaging. I keep a few stashed in my diaper bag for easy snacks whenever my little one (or I) get hungry on the go. Perfect.

review/text: My son it almost 2 years old and he loves these! He loves all the flavors but I've never seen the grape in my local Toys R Us so I bought these here.  With the subscribe and save, they were actually a little chaper. They are a great, convenient way to have fruit on the go! I always keep them on hand which is much easier than trying to keep a large variety of fresh fruit on hand because it spoils so fast.  He sucks these things right down and never spills a bit!

I keep them in the fridge and drink them when I am gardening or working around the yard. The crystal rock sugar can be added when you decide to use the brew, not while it is in storage.

review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/summary: Yummy Cookies. Taste just like OR*EOs
review/text: Great stuff. Didn't expect them to taste as good as they do. I bought four different kinds of Murray cookies and these are definitely top of the list (2nd on the list are the Oatmeal). Do not hesitate to purchase. You will not be disappointed unless you have a finicky palate. ENJOY!
