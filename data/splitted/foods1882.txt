review/text: I bought this for my granddaughter's cotton candy machine given to her for Christmas. The flavor is great, and the cotton candy comes out light and lovely. It is easy to use, and the floss begins to develop as soon as it is placed into the machine. She uses it regularly for herself, her family and her friends. A little bit goes a very long way

review/text: This is the best Zwieback in the US or in Germany - Good taste and each single one is a good size - it's a crisp bread that will dissolve quickly in your mouth - with butter and jam it's almost like a desert - alone great, too - not too sweet - it's a baby and toddler food but I would recommend it also for people with digestive disorders since it is so easy to digest - I wish the other versions would be available in this country (like coconut,chocolate, apple cinnamon!)

review/summary: Flavorful Berry Matcha
review/text: This was my first fruity matcha from Red Leaf and I had really been looking forward to trying it because of the great reviews. The delicious aroma of this selection made my mouth water as soon as I opened the packet. I have enjoyed boysenberry syrup on many occasions in the past, back in the days when I used to eat waffles and pancakes. This definitely captures the essence of boysenberry nicely with a great balance between sweet and tart. I did what others have suggested, and mixed it up with 2 oz of hot water , then added  some almond milk, a splash of cream, a small amount of sweetener, and some ice cubes and shook it up to make a chilled latte. I will eventually try it hot, but I have really been in the mood for the chilled lattes lately! So this was the third flavor I've had from Red Leaf, and all have been outstanding. I'm afraid they could be somewhat addictive. If you haven't tried boysenberry, you should! I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/summary: A delicious berry matcha
review/text: When I saw this boysenberry flavor, I knew I had to grab it. I'm not sure if I've ever had boysenberry on its own, but I definitely know I've had it in yogurt form. There are several companies that make boysenberry yogurt, and it's delicious.<br /><br />For all my previous matchas, since they were desert matchas, I had been making them hot the traditional matcha way. Usually, after my first sip, it was a little too intense for me, so I added some milk to help bring out the flavor. But for boysenberry, hot and milk added just didn't sound appealing to me, so I thought I would try something new.<br /><br />I took my water bottle and measured 1/4 teaspoon for matcha. I then filled my bottle with 16oz of water. You can also use a water bottle, but since I want to be environmentally friendly (and I like my filtered water), I decided to just use a regular bottle. I debated whether or not to sift the matcha, but decided I wouldn't the first time around. I shook my bottle vigorously, and then sipped the results...<br /><br />WOW!!! I was really impressed. With all the other matchas, I had a hard time tasting the flavor just straight, but here I can definitely taste both the matcha and the boysenberry. The matcha is not overpowering and overly grassy, and  there are definitely berry undertones. I didn't need to add any sweetener, although I bet if I did it would bring out the flavor even more.<br /><br />I can't believe how easy this is to make. It sure beats using a whisk (no pun intended) and making water on the kettle. Those are good too, but this is better. I'm thinking I need to order some more fruity matchas in the future, since I liked boysenberry so much. I'm not sure how this would taste hot, but it's definitely delicious cold.

review/summary: Deliciously unique flavoured matcha
review/text: This matcha is my first experience with something boysenberry flavoured. I love blackberries, and boysenberries look similar, so I figured I'd give it a go.<br /><br />I'm so glad I took a chance on this flavour! It is really fresh and juicy tasting, with a light berry flavour that is both sweet and tart. It is almost candy-like in both scent and flavour, without being artificial tasting in the slightest.<br /><br />I would urge anyone who enjoys flavoured matcha to branch out a little and try a flavour you wouldn't normally try - I'm betting you'll be pleasantly surprised! All of the varieties that I've tried from Red Leaf so far have been really well done, and pretty much universally enjoyable.

review/summary: Mrs. Knott Would Be Proud!
review/text: As a kid, I practically grew up at Knott's Berry Farm.  I loved everything about that place, and boysenberries hold a very special place in my heart because of the theme park.  So when I saw that Red Leaf Tea carried boysenberry Matcha, I had to try it!<br /><br />And this does the berry - as well as Mrs. Knott - proud!  It tastes very authentically boysenberry... as if I might have plucked a few berries off a vine and pureed them and then stirred the puree into the Matcha - except that this is so much smoother.  The Matcha tastes rich and vegetative, with notes of butter in the background.  Deliciously creamy... this would make a great dessert substitute!<br /><br />Another exceptional Matcha from Red Leaf Tea.

review/summary: Delightful!
review/text: So when I first smelled the dry powder I thought, oh tart, crisp, light, berry!<br />My daughter's first impression was "Mom this smells like Red Bull energy drink."<br />I was like OMG you are SO right!<br />It does! I have to admit. I do love Red Bull. Actually I had a bit of a Red Bull problem not too long ago, before tea! Thank you tea!<br />Nonetheless it has that exact same tart smell to it!<br />Don't worry though this is totally healthy!<br />Plus after preparing my matcha, adding some ice and milk, it tastes NOTHING like a red bull!<br />Okay maybe a little something like it in the sense that it is light, crisp, refreshing, not too tart but just a slight berry tartness but nothing that is going to make you pucker!<br />I love this!<br />I feel bad and I owe an apology to summer. Here I was craving autumn and forgot all about berries, fruits, juicy ripe tasting delights and had went totally for heavier, richer, creamier, flavors. But you know what ... it is still summer and I am going to totally enjoy drinking this and many other light matchas to come!<br />As I am sitting here in delight sipping away I am noticing this almost earthy flavor to it - no not the normal earthy grassy flavor of a matcha or green tea, but something else. The prominent flavors are still the same, tart, juicy, etc, not to be redundant, but there is something more, its one of those flavors you swish around in your mouth, tap tap tap your tongue around, make those smacking sounds trying so hard to pin point it but it is eluding me! I want someone else to get some of this so they can help me figure it out.<br />Yes this one is a delight and to think I almost passed it up I mean I was not too sure what to expect and didn't want something too overly tart but thank goodness I went for it!

review/summary: Not enough glucosamine and chondroitin
review/text: My dogs like these treats well enough.  My question is regarding the amounts of glucosamine and chondroitin that they incorporate.<br /><br />According to what I'm looking at, you need around 300-500mg of each per 25lbs of dog, per day.  The bag ingredients says 2000mg/kg of glucosamine and 1000mg/kg of chondroitin.  So that means my 100lb dog would need to eat 2lbs of this treat every day to get a satisfactory dose, since a kg is 2.2lbs.<br /><br />Reading the reviews of the various versions of this treat, I'm also wondering how much of the perceived results are scientifically due to the supplements.  I see a lot of people noting improvements and results in a week or two, yet glucosamine and chondroitin are supposed to take 4-6 weeks before they produce a noticeable benefit.<br /><br />For our big, fat, old dogs, we've had good luck with the vetrin chewable aspirin for dogs.  They like them, they're inexpensive, and they do a nice job of taking the squeak and creak out of the dogs.

review/text: The candy is shown in a sealed zip bag with a label sating what it is. It was shipped in a plain baggy taped shut.

The pecans inside the chocolate were stale. The peanuts are Spanish peanuts with the skins still on them. Who dips Spanish peanuts in chocolate? The skins make them taste bitter. I had intended to give some of them as gifts, but since I had to open each bag to figure out which was which I wasn't going to give an opened bag, especially after tasting them!  I contacted Bayside Candy and requested a refund. The response was to tell me not to rely on what the advertisment showed, but to pay better attention to what their seller page states regarding their bulk products. They also stated they would not give a refund unless I shipped the chocolates back to them.  You are not supposed to send opened food products through the mail.

review/text: I can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy, low calorie, low sodium soup that tastes good.<br /><br />Calories for this soup are OK, and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition. However, the taste was totally bland. It is commendable that they used less salt. However, they could have added a little rosemary and/or garlic, for example, and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium. I also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery, as were the pasta curls that they think are "noodles".<br /><br />Yesterday I had a can of Progresso Classics Vegatable that was the same calories, more nutricious, and full of flavor. Even the old fashioned small can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle is a better bowl of soup than this. No more "Healthy Choice" in our pantry.

review/summary: Love Healthy Choice, but Too Many Dented Cans
review/text: I really love Healthy Choice products because they are very low in sodium. I ordered the Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle Soup from Amazon.com several months ago, because I have not been able to find the "can" soup in stores. The grocery stores only have the microwavable bowls which makes the soup taste like plastic. Therefore, I was happy to see that I could order the can soup from Amazon.com. My first order of the Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle "can" Soup was great. I enjoyed every can.<br /><br />However, my second order of the Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle Soup was very disappointing. Out of the 12 cans, there were 7 cans that were severly dented. I knew that there was something wrong before I opended the Amazon package/box, becaused the box was soiled. Some of the dents were so deep that it resulted in seepage. There were too many leaks, dents, and the box was so damaged that I could not return the product even if I tried. This was a waste and loss of money. Because of the location of the dents on the cans, I truly believe that they were packaged that way. My order was "packed" with dented cans.  The dents were not the result of shipping or handling. I will never order this product again unless Amazon.com can ensure that my order will not be packaged with dented cans.

review/text: We wouldn't survive without these mixes!  We chose them because they're vegan, but the fact that they're nut free is a bonus after a friend's son developed a nut allergy.  When I need to make cupcakes last minute, it's great  to have an easy mix to use in my busy schedule.  They come out perfect EVERY time.  I made 2 batches (one vanilla, one chocolate) for a bake sale recently and they were the first things that sold out.  Non-vegan nor allergic folks declared them delicious.  I've even 'doctored' the mixes to add flavors for more 'gourmet' cupcakes...like a little strong coffee in the chocolate mix makes a great mocha cupcake.  Lemon juice and rind in the vanilla makes a delicious lemon cupcake.  I highly recommend these mixes to anyone who's got a nut allergy or can't/doesn't eat eggs or dairy (or soy).  Cherrybrook Kitchen is this vegan working mom's hero!

People are impressed when they find out it is an allergy-friendly cake. I say it taste better then any brand of traditional cake you can name. We also freeze batches of cupcakes for parties we go to. Thank you Cherrybrook Kitchen. This will be an even better find once he starts school where so many kids have so many differnt allergies. Hard to find one product that addresses multiple common allergies and be something kids will go for.

review/summary: YUMMY--best allergen-free baking mix on market
review/text: We recommend this product to anyone who has allergies.  Excellent product, yummy results!  The cupcakes taste better than ones made from a regular mix--when's the last time you could say that about an allergen free product!  Company has fun graphics, fun rewards program, and is great for kids with allergies.  Would also work for people who are vegan.  They test every batch, so you know it's safe!

review/summary: Gummy and overly sweet.
review/text: My 3 year old son is allergic to all nuts and soy.  When I saw this in the store I thought it would be a great way to make a fast dessert the whole family could eat.  The 3 year old told me it was yucky, ate the frosting off his slice and then threw the cake itself away.  As stated in the title it is gummy and way too sweet.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  There are other mixes that have much better results and making a cake from scratch is not that difficult.

review/text: This stuff is great for those of us with allergies. I can finally have birthday cake.  Usually egg free cake is virtually ineatable.  This stuff is so good people without allergies actually ask for seconds.  That sounds like a ringing endorsement to me!!!  (Note - stay away from the gluten free products - unless you must - they tend to taste like chalk.)

review/text: Whilst in Canada the family dog ate the very large box of Maltesers that had been taken across from the UK.  Amazon Canada could not offer the very large box and so I ordered from Amazon UK; the shipping costs from UK to Quebec far outweighed the cost of the Maltesers, but not the joy of the recipient.

review/summary: Exotic Sounding
review/text: My primary reason for looking at unconventional salts was not for any kind of magical healing powers, but because I've learned how bad chemically processed salts are for you.<br /><br />I'm all for marketing even if it makes your product sound like it came right from the heavens... but I'm also for doing your own research.<br /><br />"Himalayan Salts" don't come from the mountains themselves... instead it typically comes from Pakistan a few hundred miles away.  That's not to necessarily say the mineral deposits wouldn't have come from the mountains, but it sounds a lot less exotic when you find it's the same stuff that's used to salt the roads over there.<br /><br />There are a lot of varying reports on Himalayan salt... many suggesting that it is indeed high in lots of great minerals, but any balanced report seems to suggest it's also be high in other stuff you don't want too much of, such as fluoride....  The supposed ancient lake this salt came from is from the dinosaur age, but just look what happened to them ;).<br /><br />I'm not sure what to believe now, but when I realized I was wasting way too much time I decided I'd just switch to French Gray Sea Salt also sold by the Spice Lab... If you check The Spice Lab's website, they've actually got a link to their supplier in France who seems to have been around for hundreds of years harvesting salt the old fashioned way free of any chemical/artificial processing... Many of their workers have even been in the salt harvesting industry for many generations.  Sounds good to me, much less fairy tail like.  In comparison, I watched a video online about Himalayan salts and the lady said it was important that Himalayan Salts be removed by hand to preserve it's good vibrations....<br /><br />I'm positive that this Himalayan salt is many times better than ordinary table salt, and it tastes great too!  But to best accomplish what I set out to do, I think the French Gray Salt sounds like a no-nonsense quality product that fits the bill.

review/summary: Really Does Make a Difference
review/text: Up until now, I had only ever used koshering salt in my cooking. I really felt kind of silly making what felt like an extravagant salt purchase. I added the item to my shopping cart and then removed it several times. Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I pulled the trigger and bought this salt.<br /><br />It truly does taste wonderful, especially as a 'finishing salt' added right before serving. On really ripe tomatoes, it is AWESOME! I have also learned that this salt is not really an extravagance when it comes to yeast bread baking. Apparently, yeast LOVES trace minerals! This salt has elevated my breads (both literally and figuratively) from pretty good to outstanding! And just like "that," I no longer felt silly buying expensive salt, because, I have spent a LOT of money on natural additives to enhance my yeast bread baking. (This one was cheap in comparison and can be used for other things!)<br /><br />I held back one star because I am very finicky about textures, and in very few applications with this salt, you can experience a very slight grittiness (from the undissolved minerals, I guess).

review/text: Until now I have always considered salt something that came in a shaker and was used as needed. Now I know better! First off, this salt is saltier than what you buy in a box at the grocery store. Just a pinch is enough to flavor almost anything. The taste is fantastic and it is great to know that it has many minerals in it. The price is a plus too. If you have not tried this salt for yourself yet, try it - you will thank yourself.

review/summary: Amazing Salt; You'll Use Less of It
review/text: This salt is very savory, but not overwhelmingly so. I'm a huge salt freak, and the first thing I noticed was that I needed way less of this salt when cooking. A tiny pinch is enough for an omelette or most single-serve dishes. I bought the 2lb bag back in January and still have most of it less. It may be attributed to me eating healthier overall, but I have also found that I can actually eat a meal without the use of salt, which is HUGE for me since I used to put salt even on my toast and my ideal snack is/was anchovy paste on cream cheese with Ritz crackers.

review/text: Himalayan natural salt is the absolute best salt in the world in my opinion. If all you've ever had is processed white table salt then you owe it to yourself to try this wonderful elixir from the earth.  Unlike processed table salt Himalayan salt is a pinkish color with natural minerals available as the Creator intended his creation to consume. The taste is extraordinary and you will find that all foods you prepare will taste better with the addition of this salt. Although more expensive than common salt the taste is well worth the added expense and the packaging by the Spice Labs is more than adequate to protect this worthwhile investment.  Not only good tasting but much healthier for you and your family.

review/text: Re: Himalayan sea salt: This salt is wonderful. Tastes great. For my family & me it does have a saltier taste than regular table salt. We just use less. My family was hesitant about using it because it is pink but once they tasted it they were on board. It is nice to know we are getting the benefits of the minerals that this salt is known to have.<br />This is the fine grain which we prefer since it does work well with a regular salt shaker. No salt mill needed.<br /> We prefer the Himalayan sea salt but at times I like the French Gray. It tends to be very moist making it unusable in a salt mill. I just use a salt box and spoon. I do love to put a pinch in my coffee. Takes away any bitterness. Yummy.<br />One more thing to add, I have NOT had fluid retention since using this salt. Low sodium. &#128523;

Personally, I think they have made this confusing on purpose to gain more business.  I still don't know what they mean by "double bag."

review/text: I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review/text: Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.

review/summary: Not minced
review/text: I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Good Price For Popular Gift
review/text: I bought this for my parents as a Christmas gift.  It was a big hit and immediately brought with it reactions of, "look at this one" and "I'd forgot about them".  One thing that shouldn't be forgotten is that after all the trips down memory lane, you actually get to eat the candy.<br /><br />My strongest reaction to the box when it arrived was shock over its size and weight.  It is huge. I expected to pay 15 dollars for the candy and 15 dollars for novelty.  But I honestly think it has close to $30 worth of candy in it, if not more.  Usually, when items are created to tug on the sentimentality of buyers, something is lost in the actual product.  That isn't the case here.  It is both an exciting gift and a practical one.

review/summary: Fun Product but total cost (with cheapest shipping) exceeded $51.00!
review/text: The 60's decade box was well received and everyone enjoyed a trip down memory lane although a good portion of the products were unfamiliar not only to those raised in the 60's, but those older and younger.  Many were wondering if they were east coast products.  The price of the product for what was received was quite excessive, and the cost of the cheapest shipping was astronomical (almost as much as the product).  The box is cute, but some of the individual candy packages arrived opened with contents spilled and broken because it wasn't packaged for shipping.  Luckily I opened the box before presenting it as everything was piled together into a big heap.  I was quite surprised that there wasn't any box filler (stryofoam peanuts, bubble wrap or shredded colored paper) or that the items weren't arranged for giving.  I added my own shredded colored paper and arranged the items, but really felt for the price that it should have been professionally presented.<br /><br />Although a neat idea, I will not purchase any more of these decade boxes from this company for the reasons stated above.  I recently saw a similar item by another company that had just as many candies and was priced less than $15.

review/text: If you want a fun trip down memory lane, this is a great item to purchase and share while watching old 60's era movies (Born Free, Herbie the Love Bug, Thomasina, Mary Poppins, etc.).  Pick out a piece and flash back to the first time you ate it (or the last time!). Sadly, some of the items appear the same but do not taste so (i.e. wax lips, Pixy Sticks). There are some omissions (Jolly Ranchers, Sugar Babies, JuJuBes, JuJy Fruit) which were a staple of Saturday Afternoon Matinees. Now, if only someone would bring back the Bonomo Turkish Taffy!

review/summary: About half the claimed weight!
review/text: While the variety was interesting, the description was highly deceptive. The weight was listed as 5 pounds, but adding the weights from the candy included yielded only slightly more than half of that, at 2.8 pounds. There were, as claimed, more than 30 pieces (35), but only six were full-price/size chocolate bars. Much of the rest was cheap filler, not the full-sized pieces touted in the description. For example, there were several types of gum included, as well as small pieces of taffy, and many items weighed less than half an ounce (in one case, a tenth of an ounce). The actual value of the candy appeared to be $10 to $12, at most, and the presentation--thrown in a printed carton with a single sheet of crumpled paper--was certainly not worth the rest of the price. Many items looked shopworn due to this poor packing, and all brittle items (such as Necco wafers) arrived in fragments. Anyone receiving this as a gift would assume that the giver spent about $15 on it, not $40. I feel cheated.

review/summary: A good gift if your willing to pay the price....
review/text: After all the reviews i read and the experience i went through after buying this as a gift for my mom i had to come back and leave some proper feedback which i felt went against some of the more "negative experiences" others went through when buying this product. it seems like a few people before me had a decent response when it came to the quality of the gift in some of the areas such as delivery time, pricing, and even the assortment of the treats inside the box so i decided i would tackle each of those areas and explain my experience....<br /><br />-Delivery<br />out of everything that surprised me about this gift it was the amount of time it took to arrive that really made me satisfied. i was expecting the gift to arrive no sooner than Dec. 28 but it arrived on the 24th which was perfect timing on my part seeing how it was the only gift i could think about getting for my mom at the time (i ordered this on the 18th).<br /><br />The package itself was in good shape i guess....its just a cardboard box containing 20 or more pieces of candy. in terms of it not being packaged properly, it really wasn't that big of a deal as someone else made it out to be. every piece of candy was wrapped securely and placed in the box with little to no damage done (if i sound like someone who works at the company, i'm not.... i'm just an overall satisfied customer =D )<br /><br />-Price<br />Overall i think this would have to be the weakest area of the entire gift. while the box did contain a large amount of candy, i really don't think its worth $35. if the price was in the area of 18-25 dollars (at the most) then i would have gladly bought another one for my dad but at the time of purchase i was willing to take a chance just to see how good this box really was.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what one person was talking about when they said the total cost of their order including s/h was $51.  i managed to buy this for $35 with free s/h arriving 6 days later so.....i really don't understand how it managed to cost that much money in the end.<br /><br />-Selection<br />since i'm technically a 90's kid, there was only a handful of items i actually recognized. the few that i tried were just as i remembered tasting them years ago but i haven't really gotten into more of the older candies my parents were so fond of...<br /><br />-Overall<br />In the end it was a neat gift. it was interesting to see my parents go through the candy and talk about how the pieces they remembered and the ones that were new to them. if your looking for a gift that will bring back memories of a time long ago, you cant do much wrong by buying this as a gift though it will pinch a bit more at your wallet than its really worth. in total worth i would give it a 4/5 but in terms of packaging (which i originally thought was going to be abysmal), the free shipping & handling (must be only for the holidays?) and the "just in time" delivery it rounds up to a 5/5<br /><br />-Final Thoughts<br />if there was anything they could have improved on for there page here on amazon it would been a more descriptive list of what all came with the box including pictures of each of the candies inside......just for the consumers sake. sometimes i would like to know a little bit more about what i'm buying. either that or take a bigger picture of the entire product (i would have done it but i wasn't thinking about it at the time i received it)

Just a warning to anyone that orders this product, when delivered make sure that you bring it in immediately, open the box and seal all the candy in plastic bags for safe keeping till time to give the gift.

review/summary: Great condition, only fair selection
review/text: The 60s decade box I ordered arrived in tact, and all the candy inside the box was in fine shape, (nothing was smashed or cracked), each item was full sized and fine.<br />I only gave 3 stars for the selection. Allthough the pieces were indeed items enjoyed in the 60s, I felt the inclusion of candy that is still sold commonly today somewhat took away from the nostalgia, ( an O Henry Bar as one example). The variety of candies may differ for others as stated in the item description, so my minor dissapointment in the selction I recieved will not be everyone's experience. I also recieved a duplicate of one of the candies. For the price I felt it should overall have been a better variety of 60s candies.<br />On a final note, and it bears repeating, the candies were all in fine shape so the quality of each item in the box was not compromised. I only feel the nostalgic value of the items would be at say 60% for what I recieved. I feel it is worth perhaps half the price I paid. (not including s&h).

There may have been issues in the past, but people, if amazon does not sell or fulfill the item and if it is NOT covered under the "prime" then do NOT buy. If you only buy things that are labeled "prime" available you have absolutely no worries! Pay the 70.00 a year, get free movies all year and free 2 day shipping on every purchase. The Amazon Prime has served me well for over 1000 transactions and I never had a bad transaction yet! I had no issue at all with this item or the transaction in any way! Two days to get here and free ship, perfect. And heck yeah it was not a great deal if you base it on the candy you receive. If you base it on the nostalgia factor it is well worth it, heck I want one from each decade and dont even want to eat the candy! If you have time to track down all these different candies an package them up yourself like this go for it. I don't have that kind of time, nor could I even get all these types of candy.

review/summary: Cost to much for what you get
review/text: These do make great gifts, my parents loved them. The only problem is the amount of money that you spend for these and the fact that half the candy in there you can still buy at the super market.  Now don't get me wrong, there are some candies that no youngster has ever heard of.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good gift<br />- It's candy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price<br />- Not well presented in the box. (Some candy was crushed).<br />- Price

review/summary: This Candy Brings Back Happy Childhood Memories!
review/text: I bought several of the Hometown Favorites Nostalgic Candy Boxes to give away as Christmas gifts. I was born in the 60's, so I decided to buy myself one as well. I've always been a candy addict!<br /><br />There was a lot of candy in the box, more than I expected. The box was filled to the top with awesome old-fashioned candy. It was so much fun going through all of the candy and remembering all of my childhood favorites. I think this is a perfect gift for anyone who loves candy. I bought several of the 40's, 50's, and 60's boxes to give to family members. I can't wait to see their faces when they open them! I even bought a 40's candy box for my Grandmother!<br /><br />Everything was fresh and arrived in perfect condition. Everyone is going to love these great gift boxes.

review/summary: Great Idea
review/text: I brought this as a gift for my parents. They were amazed and loved the idea. I would give it a 6 star if it were available. The other ratings that rated it lower were because of the delivery of the package, presentation, or pricing. I did not get to see how the contents look when delivered. However, I was pleased with the response I was given. I paid $40 with shipping. That averages about a dollar a bar. That is a great deal. My mother could not stop talking about it. She did not recognize some of the candy, but it gave some fact of the sixties such as the average salary and minimum wage. She loved it. I think this box would fit anyone that was born or raised in the 60's. This is a great gift for that person that has everything or hard to shop for. I was skeptical because my parents are not big sweet eaters. However, I am sure my parents were pleased with the thought. It is definitely an attention grabber. She says she could not wait to show her friends the candy lips. I will definitely order again as a gift for that person that is hard to shop.

review/text: I got this for my mom's 50th birthday and it was a big hit.  Her and my dad dove into the box and began discussing all the candies.  My mom remembered getting some of this candy at Halloween as a kid.  They both remembered everything but were a little disappointed the cigerettes were bubble gum and not the candy type like they remembered.  This is a great gift and definately worth the price to make someone smile.

review/summary: '60's box a hit!
review/text: I took this box to a family Christmas exchange, where you played a trading game to get the gift you want.  I thought the "60's" people would love it. I had looked through the candy and it had brought back so many memories. However, the ones who wanted it were the "tweens," and the "teens"! They had so much fun with it and the adults enjoyed sharing their memories. All of the candy was in tact and boxed well. This is a great gift!

review/text: it was cute seeing all of these candies together in one package, but most of it can easily be bought at local mass market stores.  Also - many of the candies were simply stale - and inedible.  Not really worth the money unless you have money to throw away.

review/text: This is the box of candy I bought (along with the one from the 50's) for my recent 60th birthday party,<br />so that I could bring back some of the era to my party, along with the music from those past decades.<br /><br />I must say that by putting it out on the dessert buffet in a big open decorative carton (not theirs, my own)<br />everyone had to pass it and they flipped!!! Everyone had THEIR favorite old candy bar or gum from that era,<br />and found it within this collection. It really was alot of fun for my guests!

review/summary: fun product, nostalgia shouldnt be so costly
review/text: I ordered all the nostalgic candy boxes and it was fun to reminise about the days when all this candy was "penny" candy that we ran to the corner store to spend our allowance on. The good ol' days. For the most part the candy was okay although a lot of it was stale tasting and many pieces had outdated codes on them. Sugar doesnt normally go bad so this was not impressive. When you compare the price of yester year and what I paid in todays market, I think I'll try making my own from an old candy cookbook nextime. It was very overpriced for what it was. I hadhoped it would come in some kind of old time tin instead of a cardboard display box. Then the price would have been worth it.

review/summary: Stale candy
review/text: This was a gift for my husband who grew up in the 60's.  The candy was stale when it arrived.  Also- as another review stated, the violet candy made everything else in the box taste and smell violet.  It probably should have been packaged separately and not just tossed in the box.

review/summary: Selection Not Good For Price!!!
review/text: By the time I was done reading so many colorful reviews for this product, I purchased it out of curiosity. I like to be as honest as I can in my review of a product. I found that much of what reviewers had to say was indeed true. This is a very steep price to pay for the amount and selection of candy included. I did my best to consider every aspect, but still it came up lacking. Any time we can get a variety to choose from in one package, it is fun. Like a grab bag type of thing. But if the majority of the things in the grab bag are cheap, it takes away from it.<br />  It makes me think about shopping for music c.d.'s with a variety of different artist on it. Yes, the idea is nice, but if the majority of the songs don't sound good, I would much rather skip it!!!

review/summary: Something is just wrong with the candy?
review/text: Amazon gets 5 stars for handling the box problems, and this was a replacement to the first shipment that came in moldy.  The replacement was permeated with a cigar type smell all the way through the candy.  I remember this smell from bars in the 80's and it actually had the smell in the candy! Since this and the 40's boxes had the same issue.  I offered to send the boxes back on my own dime just so Amazon could get a whiff of the contents and taste a piece for themselves.  After a week in the Car-less Garage to air out, still no change.  In fact the kitchen pantry wreaks of that box smell now?  It's like a the smell of a wet camel in the form of a taste in the candy.

review/text: The 60's Decade Box was bought to give to our son-in-love for his birthday.  He was taken by surprise by it, because it is something he had never seen before.  And he LOVED it!<br /><br />He spent quite a bit of time going through the box, remembering when he bought those same things and sharing memories with us.  It was the highlight of his day.<br /><br />He loved it so much, that he got one in an earlier decade for his father's birthday.  It was a huge hit with his dad too.<br /><br />We highly recommend these as gifts for anyone, for any occasion, or even just for fun, simply because it tastes good and brings back so many good memories of times past~

review/summary: wow! retro candy
review/text: i grew up in the sixties, and me and candy had a love affair for at least twenty years. i loved all of that "retro candy" and i tried just about every chocolate and candy bar on the market, including the "zero" and the "seven up." as time went on alot of that candy disappeared, though it was subtle. it wasn't until one day when i saw an old fashion type candy store that the memories started flooding back. those little "dots" on paper, if i wasn't careful i would be eating bits of paper. but i didn't care. i just liked that candy. it was wonderful. i am definitley looking forward to buying myself one of these "retro candy gifts."
