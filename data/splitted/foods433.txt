review/summary: Good for cats - Loved by cats
review/text: Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet.  Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food.

review/summary: great cat food!
review/text: I bought Newman's Own after the cat chow scare as well but was surprised at the change in my cat's behavior and activity level within the first month of the switch. I wish it were available nearby but I'm signing up for the auto ship which gives you free shipping and a lower price. My cats love the flavor and respond well to the nutrition and absence of processing in their food. I know how lethargic I feel when I get busy and eat too much processed food-why would they react any differently? It's well worth the money-I've tried cat chow naturals and while it is better than regular it does not produce the level of improvement that PN does so I'm sticking with the good stuff!

review/summary: My cat actually loves it......
review/text: ...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Amazon. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class.

review/summary: Great for cats with corn allergies--meat #1 ingredient
review/text: I have 2 cats.  One is fluffy and finicky and won't eat anything but wet food and human meat.  The other one is athletic, lively and will eat only dried "crap" food.<br /><br />Well, the athletic one started having terrible eye problems (red and weepy) and she constantly scratched at them.  We tried oral Lysine, Terramycin antibiotics, and swapping out the plastic dish for ceramic.  Still she had eye problems.  So, guessing it might be a food allergy, I bought her Newman's because it doesn't have corn gluten, the primary ingredient of almost all dry cat foods. Newman's #1 and #2 ingredients are MEAT.<br /><br />She ate it immediately. Within 2 days her eye problems disappeared, so I am assuming she had developed allergies to the corn product in the dry food (and by the way, what felines eat corn in the wild?).<br /><br />But what really amazed me is that fluffy and finicky passed over her usual wet food and went right for the dry Newman's.  I just about wet my knickers!<br /><br />There you have it, 5 stars.

She was shoveling up the food with her mouth wide open, spilling food everywhere. It was hilarious. It passes the taste test for sure. Very expensive though. I'll buy it when I can find an affordable price. (Five stars for ingredients and taste, one star docked for affordability.)

review/text: I purchased this food because I have 6 cats, and they were throwing up a lot.  I went from Purina, to Purina One to Whiskas to Iams and I knew there was something bad in the food.  After buying Newman's the throwing up stopped.  GOOD NEWS!  Except they don't like the food. I had 2 different flavors and they didn't like either one. I had a leftover bag of Iams and they broke into it.  I mixed it with Newmans and they picked it out.  I have now switched to California Natural and they don't throw up and they love the taste. I went to the natural pet store and got some free samples of different foods and my cats told me what they wanted.

review/summary: Good stuff, cat loves it.
review/text: I recently purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FK60LM">Petmate Le Bistro Portion-Control Automatic Pet Feeder, 5-Pound Capacity, Black</a> automatic cat feeder and I have been looking for a good large bag of organic dry food to fill it with. After reading some reviews about Newman's Own Organic pet food, and spending a few minutes on their website checking out the ingredients I was confident the quality was high.<br /><br />The bag is a great size for the 10lb automatic feeder, fills about half the tub. I have one medium sized cat so this lasts for a couple of months. I placed the cat food on subscription, using amazon prime, so I got it for a great price as well.<br /><br />My cat seems to be enjoying it and eating her two potions a day. I'm never quite sure what people mean when they say their cat won't eat the food. Perhaps I'm a little more stern with my cat, if she doesn't eat it, she doesn't eat. Trust me, sooner or later they will learn to love it. I think this policy has meant she is pretty good at trying new food and enjoying it.<br /><br />As much as I can review cat food without eating it, I'd say this is a good buy. I checked out the price of some bags of organic cat food at my supermarket and its competitively priced.

review/summary: My cats seem to love it.
review/text: I've got two cats.  One is about 8 years old, grey shorthair domestic, and very calm by nature.  The other is about 4 years old, abyssinian, and a loud pain in the butt by nature.<br /><br />I've been feeding them the Nutro for fat cats, and they eat it up, but never all at once.  I decided against IAMS a long time ago because of their issues with animal cruelty while doing their nutrition/diet tests on animals.<br /><br />Today I decided to buy them Newman's Own Adult Cat.  I didn't give them too much since it's not a weight control formula (which, frankly, both my cats need).  They both practically inhaled this stuff.  Later on the abyssinian even went back to lick the dish some more.<br /><br />After they ate it they both instantly became very calm and went to sleep.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye on how much they keep on liking this food.  If all goes well, I'll keep buying it despite the slightly higher price.  (The price at Whole Foods was similar to the price here on Amazon... where can I get this for the other price people have seen?  That's like half the price... are you guys sure you're getting the same size bags?)  But it's Newman's Own and they give money to animal charities, so that takes some edge off the price.<br /><br />My only wish is they also made a weight control cat food as well.

review/summary: Switched to Newman's Own Organic and all 3 cats stopped vomiting
review/text: Our three cats throw up every day and have been doing this for years. I am not talking about hairballs but vomiting up undigested food. The vet says they are very healthy but "cats do this".<br /><br />Last week we switched from "Purina One" to "Newman's Own Organics Adult Formula Dry Cat Food" and low and behold the vomiting completely stopped -OVERNIGHT!<br /><br />Prior to "Purina One - Urinary Track Health Formula" we fed them "Prescription Diet c/d" with the same vomiting.<br /><br />One caveat -the chicken in this Newman's Organic dry cat food is "Natural" and not "Organic" so I contacted Newman's Own to ask them what they feed their "Natural" chickens. We received a quick response from L.Phillips Brown, DVM, confirmed that even though they are not Organic chickens, they do NOT feed these free-range chickens GMO grains.<br /><br />We recently learned that since the mid-90s, food companies have been slipping GMOs into human and animal food, without our knowledge or approval, even though studies say these are quite harmful (causing damage to internal organs). The Europeans are smart enough to ban GMOs but not us "dumb Americans". So unless it is organic you are best to avoid all non-Organic meat, poultry, and "farm raised" fish (they are all fed GMOs) and non-Organic corn, soy, cottonseed, Canola products (these are GMO).<br /><br />Perhaps this cat food stopped the vomiting issue because Newman's Own has no GMOs or perhaps it is because there are no grains. In either event, it works. And this is nothing short of a miracle! We are astonished that the change was so immediate.<br /><br />All three cats love this food. The cats have not vomited once since we switched. Also, the cats seem calmer and their food cravings - to have their bowls constantly filled - have gone away.<br /><br />We really lucked on to something here. What a great cat food!

review/summary: Better Than Prescription Food
review/text: I rescued two cats, and the female cat had urinary infections...she had to be put on a very expensive prescription cat food. When the manfacturer quit making the food, I had to search for another food, and every one of them gave her problems. I tried one prescription that made both her and the healthy male sick. I never even knew Paul Newman had cat food. Well, since I have put both cats on Paul's cat food, it has been wonderful. She is healthy now, and we aren't taking her to the vet frequently, as we were before. Our little male cat, Boots, has a shinier coat now too, which the vet noticed when he got his yearly shots. I highly recommend this food.<br /><br />Sadly, Paul and Joanne are now deceased. I admired them both. All of the money from their products went to charity. Yes, 100 per-cent. I don't know if things will continue the same when both Paul and Joanne were alive, but hopefully it will.

review/text: Wow, I was surprised to read the other reviews here.  After doing extensive research on this and other dry and wet foods, I found Newman's Organic to be one of the highest quality available.<br /><br />I was disturbed over the number of cancer deaths in both dogs and cats occurring each year.  The numbers keep going up and I figured it must be related to their diets.  This food uses human grade natural chicken (no hormones, antibiotics, pesticides) in both their canned and dry food.<br /><br />I wish this listing had the Nutrition Facts, but if you go to newmansownorganics dot com and read the FAQs you will learn a great deal about pet nutrition.  My cat loves this stuff and had no trouble with the transition from its old food.  She also loves the canned food.

We simply leave food out for him at all times, and this food makes up 99% of his diet (outside of a few bites of bacon here and there).  Once he reached adulthood, his weight has not varied more than a few ounces either way from a very healthy (for his overall size) 10lbs.  Our vet says that the long-term maintenance of a healthy weight is one of the surest signs of a good diet in adult cats.  He has a VERY healthy and shiny looking coat, is very energetic, and has very few gastrointestinal issues.  Plus, you get the added bonus of all the good the Newman's Own Foundation does.  Couldn't be happier!!

review/summary: Saved a lot of $$$ at the vet--be patient, though, it might take some time!
review/text: I bought this food based upon other reviews from people who said that it helped their cats who had been licking off their fur. For a long time our cat had been licking the fur off of her back legs. The vet said it was possibly an allergy and that we could spend all the money for allergy testing but might not find anything. She also said that we could consider giving the cat Benadryl to see if that helped (but didn't necessarily see the need to do either at that point).<br /><br />Eventually, though, the cat got to the point where she was pretty much licking off all of the fur she could reach--we literally had a half naked cat! She also had lots of small "scabs" (which she'd gotten before, but not to this extent), which was probably at least partly why she was licking the fur off. We figured the vet, if she saw the cat at that point, would recommend allergy testing. I decided to give this food a try first.<br /><br />I'm very happy to report that it worked! Some other reviewers said that it worked for their cats in a couple of weeks. With our cat it took at least 4-6 weeks. At this point she's grown all of her fur back and the scabs are gone, too.<br /><br />And she has loved the food from the very beginning--no problems eating it (as at least one reviewer mentioned), even though it is in very small pieces.<br /><br />So if your cat is licking off his or her fur, consider trying this before spending all of the money for allergy testing (unless, of course, your cat is having other medical issues, too, that you're worried about). Great stuff!

review/summary: Your Cat Deserves This Food
review/text: I've been feeding my six cats Newman's Own organic food for years. Their coats are sleek and healthy. They are healthy. This is certified organic food, not that phony 'all natural' stuff. Terms like 'all natural' and 'human quality' are meaningless. Take a look at what is in regular pet food--google '4 D meat.'<br />This is the one food I really trust.

review/summary: Yummy food that fills the feline belly...
review/text: Our two 7 y/o female Scotish-Fold Ear and 5 y/o male Selkirk Rex really seem to love this food. They all have sensitive stomachs, and can get diarrhea quite easily, but this food has never caused them any distress. They get dry food cafeteria style and, while they really like this food, the bowl contents don't evaporate as quickly...it must be more filling than other brands they've eaten. Moreover, the two girls harvested the hair on their bellies for years...the vet told us they were neurotic...within days of starting Newmans Dry Cat Food they stopped chewing at their stomachs. This food is hard to find locally now, and I'm glad, as I would have never discovered Amazon had it available for subscription at a fair price. Our cat masters and I thank you!

review/text: i had always feed my two cats purina brand without any problems, but as the younger one got older he developed acne. looking for a product without fillers or by-products, i switched to newman's own.<br /><br />the older cat (usually picky in tastes) had no problems switching, but acne-cat practically starved himself. now he won't eat anything else (call it acquired taste?)<br /><br />the acne is totally gone & both cats are more healthy than ever, although keeping their weight in check can be problematic.

review/text: The 2 cats that didn't like it are older and I think it is because the smaller round shape is harder to hold in their mouths to chew as a piece would drop out of their mouth and they wouldn't try to retrieve it. The other 3 eat it fine without hesitation. When it goes on sale again I will purchase it again. One improvement to the bag would be for it to self seal like so many other products are now doing.

review/text: I have two cats - one of which will eat dry cat food. (The other has had some teeth issues and simply won't eat anything crunchy.) The one the does eat dry cat food though - who seemingly will eat any dry food wouldn't eat this one and I ended up donating it to a local cat rescue center hoping that it would at least feed some cat somewhere.<br /><br />I need to emphasize that my cat is not a fussy eater by anyone's standard and that she would not consume this says something about the product. So I guess it doesn't matter how healthy it may be if your animal won't consume it.

review/text: We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle.  Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian.  Newman's Own is up front about their ingredients.  For an organic food it is affordable.  Also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control.  Lastly Newman's Own is listed as a "More Responsible Pet Food Company".

review/text: I tried this in place of Iams.  My hefty maine coon won't touch it.  He is not a picky eater either (he was adopted at 5 and his previous family fed him some grocery store brands).  He eats around it and would rather sit at the pantry door meowing for new food then to go eat a full bowl of this.  The feral cats outside won't eat it either!  The only ones who seem to like it are the raccoons and possums and I try to not feed them.  We give this a two, two thumbs down.

review/summary: Kitty does not like it...
review/text: What a wonderful thought that Newman's Own makes cat food. Organic cat food. I would love to support this product and feed it to my big fluffy girl... she's really not a kitty anymore, and she's usually not picky with her dry food. However, she hates this food and literally turns her nose up at it. I've tried fooling her by mixing it in with her other dry food... since I had to go out and buy a bag of her old stuff, that is. She's good at leaving this stuff in the bowl and sorting out the food she likes. So I am about to toss this food in the garbage, and I hate to waste food. I wonder if there are too many veggies in this food? Cats and dogs are carnivores after all. Carrots and oats and peas are not really good for them. I'm at my computer right now, away from the ingredients list, but I recall this food is heavy on the veggie, non-meat ingredients. Sadly, I will not be buying this great-sounding product again. I think it would benefit from some steak juice at least... or some really stinky fish bi-product.

review/summary: Cats Won't Eat It.
review/text: Did the company that makes this product bother offering it to cats first to see if they would even eat it?  My cat won't eat it.  Pixie gives it two paws down. I tried offering it to the starving feral cats outside, and they won't eat it either.  I bought two bags of it for nothing.  My cat actually did try it once, and promptly threw up.  No fur balls came up any time after that, either, so I know she wasn't sick at the time.  She still refuses to eat any more of it.  It might be great from both nutritional analysis and organic points of view, but it's not any good if cats won't actually want to eat it.  I'm going back to Purina when I feed kibbles to the cat because I know from information that I've seen on TV that Purina actually taste-tests their products.  My same cat will eat the Newman's Own canned cat food with the same degree of enthusiasm that she eats Purina, but the same is not true for the kibble.

review/text: I am buying this product because my cat has health issues. While I lived in Indiana I was able to buy it at Walmart for around 11.00 for the same size bag. Since I have moved to the south there are no stores in this state that carry it so I had to pay a little over 20.00 per bag. This is really very over priced. You can bet when I go back to Indiana this fall I will be shipping several bags home so I don't have to pay this horrible price for a while.

review/summary: A surprisingly good "box meal"
review/text: In an effort to have something "quick and easy" on hand and as one who basically lives on white meat chicken, I tried this box mix not expecting much more than some flavored rice to accompany my otherwise boring white meat chicken.  Since I often buy bulk boneless skinless chicken, frozen, it seems that I never have the forethought to defrost the chicken for a meal.  However, I've found that while I cook the frozen chicken in a frying pan, just a tiny drop of oil, on low, it's like steaming the chicken...no additives, just plain chicken. While the chicken is "cooking" I prepare the box mix (without adding the chicken like the box says) - the simmer time on the mix is just about the same time it takes for the chicken to cook - I cube the chicken still in the cooking pan (to ensure it's fully cooked post freezer), toss it into the now finished box mix - saves lots of time as I never have anything defrosted when I need it :)<br /><br />Like others, I have experimented and added frozen corn (much better than canned I've found) - now my staple in this "mix", plus I sometimes add shredded cheese atop it before serving. I've tried the diced tomatoes and peppers...not a big fan.  I always top with a dab of sour cream.<br /><br />The mix freezes very well and reheats with ease.  I tend to add a sprinkling of water when microwaving for some extra moisture in the rice.  A leftover favorite is a flour tortilla with the mix, sour cream and a dash of taco sauce.<br /><br />Friends to whom I've served this mix have been shocked it was indeed a "mix" (that is, when I've confessed!)...not your typical flavorless or overpriced "helper mix"!

Keys to making this meal great: putting a little extra work into cooking/seasoning the chicken (I season with cajun seasoning, then cook in some teriyaki) and letting it stand the 3-5 minutes after completion (this gives the sauce a real thick consistency that makes consumption easier).

I don't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th.

review/summary: poor quality
review/text: The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.  It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted.

review/summary: Perfect treat for my pup
review/text: I have a 12lb mutt that i give one greenie roughly every day.  He loves the fact that he is getting a special treat, and i love the fact that it is good for him and helps fight bad breath.  I have heard some people complain that they think Greenies upset their dog's stomach, but i have not had that problem with my guy at all.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you order Greenies from Amazon because of price.  They can be a little expensive so i have shopped around and found them to be A LOT cheaper to buy from one of the sellers on this site instead of getting them from PetCo or PetSmart.

review/summary: Doggie Crack
review/text: I bought a single Greenies Tennie for my puppy, just to see if she likes it. Surprisingly enough, she loves it. At first she just licks it curiously, then she started to grab it and take it to a corner and start licking and chewing on it. It keeps her busy for a long time. It's good for her teeth and make her have a better chewing habbit than chewing table legs and my fingers. I went out to my local pet stores to get this big pack. They price is actually the same as Amazon, I wish amazon would have this product for cheaper though.<br />But if you want your dog to be busy, help them to have better teeth, curing chewing habbit and ease seperation anxiety, you need to give this a try.<br /><br />But of course you need to becareful choosing the right size. If the treat is too small, when they woof it down, they might get chocked. The teenie is right size for my Mini American Eskimo puppy because she is really small now. When she is older I will switch to a size bigger.

I did not send them back. They apparently still tasted good to my 4 canines, but as far as a dental aid, they were just too soft and spongy.

review/summary: Great way to prevent "dog breath"
review/text: Within days of starting a routine of one petite Greenie each day (my dog is 20 pounds), dog breath is gone.  It did not upset his GI tract, and he loves the taste.  The price is much more reasonable if you buy a Mega Treat Pak from a vendor online compared to a smaller amount in a pet store, although a trial with the individually wrapped ones is a good way to start out.  They arrive in slide-zipper lock bags, which helps to keep them fresh.  I recommend this product highly.

review/text: One of my favorite aisles in the grocery store is the pet aisle. Shopping for healthy treats for my pets is something I do almost every trip to the store.<br /><br />Recently I've been giving these healthier treats to my Shih-Tzu puppy. He takes off with them, usually to his bed where he can relish them all by himself. And he does relish them.<br /><br />When I sniffed one, they smell minty and meaty at the same time. I worried at first that he might get confused by the smell and not like them. I was wrong, he loves them!<br /><br />They help scrape off tartar build up too. So why not make fewer vet appointments for teeth cleaning?<br /><br />I recommend this nutritious treat highly.

I think they eat them like a treat rather than chewing on them and then they block their digestive tract.  Whatever is going on, I wouldn't purchase them unless you don't mind dog vomit.

review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

While I received my order quickly I was immediately disappointed when I saw the date on the box read "BEST BY: APR 2010" - it is now February 2011. There is no way that is acceptable to send to customers EXPIRED products and I will not be giving these to my dogs now as it's a safety issue. I requested a full refund from this seller but have yet to get any response whatsoever. How disappointing! Hoping Amazon will help with this. Awful buying experience. Beware you may be getting an expired box if you buy these.

review/text: There is not much one can actually take the time to say about Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies, due to the fact that they are so very good, I just cant stop eating them, and so advise trying some for yourself.<br /><br /> I certainly hope you have more time to write a review, as I prefer eating them rather than reviewing them. No disappointment here. MMMMMMMMMMM Good

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Can't go wrong with Chips Ahoy. Great cookie. I just wish they were larger, like when I was a kid. Seems like the packaging stays the same size, but the cookie shrinks. Oh well, still tastes yummy!

review/summary: Good reliable cookies to have on hand
review/text: Reliable and delicious chocolate chip cookies to have on hand when you have the munchies and chocolate cravings. I do prefer the Keebler Chocolate Lovers Chocolate Chip  variety better , however.

review/summary: Holiday Favorite - albertengo apricot panettone
review/text: A friend mentioned this bread to me a few years ago and then found it and shared it with me.  Shipped from Italy, but freshening the air along the way no doubt, comes a food treasure to share at holiday times.  The aroma, the texture, the color, the taste of Albertengo Apricot Panettone (and probably the other flavors) is the epitome of what good sweet bread should be.  You will not forget this bread, I promise.  If clouds were edible they would taste like this.
