review/summary: Great
review/text: I have a very picky eater for a cat.  Over the last few months he has lost some weight and his hair just was getting kind of rough.  The vet suggested to switch his food.  Oh my, this is a cat I adopted at age 5 and had to break him into cat food because his previous people had him on a diet of McDonalds!! So here we are 2 years later, he finally eats dry and wet food now I have to change the brand?! So since my dog already eats Blue Buffalo (which duh, I dont know why I never started my cat on this) I decided to let him try it.  The first 2 days he went on a hunger strike just because he hates change. Finally on the 3rd day he gave it a go and loved it.  Now we are almost 2 months later and his hair is the best Ive ever seen, he picked back up his weight and he is even being more playfull and entergetic.  I do have to say all my animals love this brand.

review/summary: Excellent - Hard To Find
review/text: Until recently, Johnnie Walker Double Black was only available in duty free airport stores. About a year ago I purchased my first bottle in duty free. Johnnie Walker has now released this to select liquor stores.<br /><br />This is very similar to Black Label, but with an added punch of more smoke and stronger more pronounced flavors. It has a much sharper edge than Black Label. This stands up to ice rather well.<br /><br />Because it was so rare, Double Black developed a mystique. This is a good blended Scotch, but it isn't worth trekking all over to find. If your local liquor store carries it, it is well worth a try.<br /><br />I happen to like Double Black a bit better than straight Black Label. I'm a big fan of the smokier Scotches, Lagavulin, Scapa, Laphroaig, and others from Islay. I like Green Label a lot more than either Black Label. Of all the Johnnie Walkers, I dislike Gold Label, and, of course, Blue Label is my favorite. One of the primary single malts used in Johnnie Walker blends is Cardhu.<br /><br />If you can find it, this is a lovely Scotch.

review/summary: Nice Smoky Flavor
review/text: Johnnie Walker Black Label is a good solid Scotch for drinking all by itself.<br /><br />This blended Scotch with all Scotches over twelve years old, is an interesting character. All alone in a nice glass, the first flavor is a lot of smoke. After a little time in my mouth other flavors develop, pepper, vanilla, and a little bit of honey. Add a little bit of water to the Scotch and most of the smoky flavor goes away, and that aftertaste comes out - the vanilla, pepper, honey flavors. But then add an ice cube to just the Scotch and things change up over time. At first the smoke flavor is around. As the ice melts and water gets in the Scotch, the smoke goes away and the other flavors are left. Once the ice gets the Scotch cold, all that smoke comes back. It's fun to play the disappearing smoke game. I'm not sure I'd mix this Scotch - it takes plenty good enough on its own.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the smokier Scotches, Lagavulin, Scapa, Laphroaig, and others from Islay. I like Green Label a lot more than Black Label. Of all the Johnnie Walkers, I dislike Gold Label, and, of course, Blue Label is my favorite. One of the primary single malts used in Johnnie Walker blends is Cardhu.<br /><br />The Double Black is worth a try. Everything is just amped up a couple of levels.<br /><br />There is a strange Johnnie Walker Scotch that is worth trying - Swing. It's not in the smoky zone, but it is one very nice Scotch.<br /><br />Johnnie Walker Double Black Scotch Whisky 750 ml<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HQTEYU">Johnnie Walker Scotch Swing 750ML</a>

review/text: I wanted to try my hand at making my own bread, so I purchased a bread machine.  The King Arthur Flour Baking Companion says according to their tests, the bread machine did the best job kneading bread.<br /><br />The standard recipe for my machine called for using dry milk powder, so I used SACO.  The bread is out of this world!!  Once you open a can, then it has to be refrigerated.  But the crust and crumb of this bread is so much better than what I expected.  I will always keep this product on hand.  It is truly a superior product!!

review/summary: I'm Cultured
review/text: I just in the past two years have gotten interested in the science of baking.  I find comfort in the precision that is required to create biscuits, scones and bread.  I kept running across recipes that asked for buttermilk.  I'd go out and buy the buttermilk, use what I needed and eventually have to throw out the rest.  Every time I had to throw out this wonderful ingredient I cringed.  One day I noticed Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend on the shelf.  I picked up the container and read the label and much to my pleasure I saw that it just isn't a milk copy like a creamer for coffee, it is actually buttermilk.  I bought it and took it home to try not knowing what to expect. The first thing I made with it was buttermilk waffles and they were perfect.  Next biscuits they came out perfectly.  Then corn bread it was great too.  Since then I've made scones and bread with Saco Buttermilk. I've never been disappointed with the results.<br />So here is the deal.  When you use this product pay very close attention to how to mix water with your current use.  Sometimes it pays to just Saco buttermilk as one of the dry ingredients and others mix it as a liquid.  Once you master that, you will never have to throw out buttermilk again.

review/text: As several others have noted, this item works well, tastes good, but is packaged poorly. It's partially Amazon's fault for not providing additional padding "between" the three containers, but I'm taking off the star because mostly it's Saco's fault. The containers are made of flimsy cardboard, and are likely to become dented and burst even with additional shipping packaging. Amazon replaces the item promptly - but it's still a shame and a waste to throw out new containers of product due to poor packaging. So, if you're cooking for a large group and need a lot of buttermilk ASAP, be aware that even if you do get three containers at once, there is a high probability that at least one will be open upon arrival.

I was directed to this product (in the store) & have used it for the past year. Whether it's reconstituted with water or milk, it works fine. & it saves a lot of buttermilk from going to waste.  Only problem has been the chunks it forms in the "can". I had to pour them in the chopper to turn them back into a powder. The "can" is made from a foil lined cardboard tube & has a plastic lid. Since it's not airtight, the product turns into chunks. Loses one star for packaging.

review/summary: Excellent product for baking, but,...
review/text: First, I love this brand of powdered buttermilk and I have been baking with it for over 17 years. That being said,...Saco needs to make a better container that will stand up to shipping this item via Amazon.com. The first shipment I received arrived dented so badly that all of the seals were broken and part of the buttermilk powder had escaped into the packing material. The replacement wasn't in much better shape except that thankfully the seals were in tact and none of product had leaked out.<br /><br />Saco powdered buttermilk will harden over time in its original container and so it is best immediately transferred into a sealed glass or plastic container once opened to keep freshest and easiest to work with. I bake a lot of bread and baked goods each week and this brand of buttermilk is always my go-to ingredient that makes a superior tasting loaf/muffins/croissants with a slightly sourdough aroma due to the subtle tartness of the buttermilk.<br /><br />Definitely worth keeping stocked up in the pantry for all of your baking needs!

review/text: I have been using this product mostly in bread and pancakes for a while and it works well. I like that the shelf life is much longer than what is stated on the package. Also, it is convenient to add the powder to the flour and then I add more or less water to the batter depending on desired thickness. Another nice thing about using buttermilk in pancakes, rather than milk, is that I can then use just baking soda rather than baking powder (due to the acidity in the buttermilk). Oh, and my shipment was delivered without incident.

review/text: I make a fabulous sourdough buttermilk waffles that can not be made without Saco buttermilk powder. I've used Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend for several years. It gives a nice, extra richness when added to baked goods. I usually add the dry powder with the flour and add water as  the wet ingredient measurement as called for in the recipe. If you don't use buttermilk often, Saco's buttermilk powder is great to have around for the times the baking mood hits. It really makes sourdough bread special too. Try adding 3 to 4 tablespoons as part of the flour measurement in making bread or rolls - whether they are plain, sweet or savory. Really delicious!

review/text: I love keeping this on hand at all times because I never seem to get through a half gallon of buttermilk before it goes bad, but I like to have it for use in biscuits, breads, and to brine chicken before frying. This stuff is very economical and super convenient. It does require refrigeration once opened, but that's no big deal to me. I mix up batches of biscuit mix and pancake mix in advance, then just add the liquid ingredients when I need it. I can store large quantities in the freezer and whip up buttermilk pancakes for breakfast in a flash. Love it. This is a pantry staple for me.

review/summary: Saco Cultured Buttermilk
review/text: I have used this product for a long time.  Really handy for baking that uses buttermilk.  The local grocery wasn't getting the ROI from the shelf space required for marketing this product and discontinued carrying it.  This is my first purchase of this product from Amazon. The shipping was prompt, but did arrive with dents in two of the cartons.  Not damaging to the enclosed product. It comes as a three pack product.  I will have to 1) make more biscuits, 2) give some away, 3) try is as 'drinking' buttermilk.  The use by date is 05/19/2015.<br />If you do a lot of baking, I believe you will enjoy and appreciate the convenience of this product.

review/summary: Great for Recipes calling for Dried Milk!
review/text: Arrived with one canister broken open.  Salvaged the order.  Thoughtless packing  and a flimsy canister makes breakage during shipping a common occurrence with this particular product.<br /><br />I'm using this to make bread, pancakes, and the like and have been pleased with the product.  Would have been thrilled but for the broken canister.<br /><br />I called amazon customer service and they offered me two options:  1.  Receive another shipment at no cost or  2.  A refund.<br /><br />Since I need the buttermilk powder I had them ship me a new order.  Though another canister was broken open, I did get two that were good.  The expiration date is good until 2015!  Suspect I can store it in the freezer until I use it.<br /><br />Customer service was incredibly good and they gave 1 day shipping on the replacement order.<br /><br />I would make sure that this is ordered separately from anything else you might need on amazon so it doesn't make a mess on anything but itself!<br /><br />Thanks amazon for the awesome customer service!

review/text: After having to modify yet another recipe because I didn't have buttermilk on hand I decided to give this a try.  Since that time I have ordered it several times from Amazon who consistently has it for the best price.  I mix the powder with my dry ingredients and then combine it with the wet for less lumps. I love this product and use it weekly in my waffle recipe. It does have a good taste. My last order arrived with no issues or defects in packaging.

It adds a nice flavor to yeast breads, and it's acidic enough that in cakes and quick breads you get a lot of lift using it with baking powder or baking soda. It also works very well in pancakes.<br />I haven't yet tried it to culture cream to make creme fraiche with.

review/text: I love buttermilk and use it in all sorts of things - oven-fried chicken, biscuits, pancakes, cake, you name it - if the recipe calls for milk you can bet I've tried substituting buttermilk on a whim.  Thing is the local stuff around here, while excellent, is pricey and I always forget about the half a bottle left over in the back of my fridge until after it's gone bad.<br /><br />I got a canister of this buttermilk powder as backup for when I don't have fresh and I really like it.  It adds a lovely flavor and is so convenient!  I don't use water, however, I use milk to give the recipe a little more substance.  I make sure to always have some on-hand in my pantry and recommend it to others.

review/text: Although I have not tried baking with this product yet, I have gone through 2 replacement orders and found the canisters leaking both times.  I think the manufacturer has a bad packaging design for this product that is definitely not mail-friendly.  It is a shame that I cannot find this product in my local grocery store.  But I believe Saco can do something to make the canisters more durable - plastic construction instead of flimsy cardboard and a tighter seal (maybe metal) instead of paper.

review/summary: Great tool for the home cook
review/text: Repeatedly, I buy buttermilk for a recipe only to throw it out after having used it just once. I saw the powdered buttermilk used on "America's Test Kitchen" during the preparation of pancake batter. Since one of my favorite recipes for dumplings calls for buttermilk, I thought the powdered would be a good substitute. When it arrived, I feared I would never be able to use all three containers before I or they expired. However, the dumplings proved so superior that I have used the powdered buttermilk in many other preparations. The biscuit recipe on the container is superb. They expand so beautifully and are so delicious as to promote bitter fighting over who gets how many.<br />My pancakes are just as tasty as the biscuits. I now think I will have to order more of Saco powdered buttermilk rather than waste any at all.<br />You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Can Flow through  your kitchen often if you learn to use it correctly.
review/text: It has been a while, but I bought this product in the high-end grocery store in my local area-that being publix.  I like drinkiing buttermilk, and hoped it could be a replacement for always having to buy fresh. Well, it didn't meet that expectation. On the canister, I believe, it tells you what it's purpose is, and that is to add to baked goods in place  of having to buy fresh each time to cook with.<br />There was a recipe on the back of the canister, for buttermilk biscuits. I made them several times. They were great!  I would not go back to using fresh buttermilk, if I could find this product regularly. Unfortunately-at least in my close local area in tampa bay Fla, I don't see that publix is carryng the product widely, if at all, anymore.  Great product. I'm still looking to find a way to use it to make a substitute for fresh buttermilk to drink. But if not, then I will use it in biscuits, and see whatever else it does well. Guess pancakes should be next since I love buttermilk pancakes. Whoo hoo!!

I made cornbread with it last night and I had to use a container that was pretty outdated...it was mostly dried out and hard lumps.  I figured I had nothing to lose so tried it and it worked great!  I think I have gotten mine at the grocery store each time before and have had no problem.  I am going to place an order online now.<br />I hope this product stays around and that the company doesn't change the formula (by "improving" it in the wrong direction!).

review/summary: Outstanding product - as good as fresh buttermilk and much more convenient
review/text: I have baked with Sacco buttermilk powder for years with complete satisfaction. In any recipe that calls for buttermilk, just measure the powder into the dry ingredients, and add water to the liquid ones. Buttermilk adds tang and tenderness to waffles, muffins, quick breads and cakes. Sacco's website offers dozens of recipes, many of them prize winners at state and county fairs. For those of us who bake with buttermilk, but don't drink it, powdered buttermilk is the perfect product: unopened cans have an indefinite shelf life, and opened cans stay fresh in the refrigerator for months. Amazon's three-pack is good value - about 5�/oz below my local supermarket price.

review/summary: Dehydrated tangy buttermilk good for cooking, baking. Natural but convenient.
review/text: Unlike many convenience foods, this does not have un-natural ingredients; the listed ingredients are all real food.  Merely dehydrated.<br /><br />After opening, it must be stored in the refrigerator; but it keeps for months in the fridge, if kept dry.<br /><br />The container is paperboard or thin cardboard and seems recyclable, or biodegradable (except for the plastic lid).  I imagine that water could eventually soak through the bottom, if this container were left sitting in a puddle, which seems an unlikely scenario, unless your family is like mine -- frequent spills and inadequate cleanup.  When storing in the fridge, we nest this buttermilk "canister" inside a plastic container (e.g. Tupperware or Rubbermaid); just in case someone spills anything liquid or messy inside the fridge.<br /><br />Has worked well for baking recipes that calls for buttermilk, for example cornbread.  We have begun experimenting by substituting in other mixes and recipes, in place of plain milk.  The buttermilk adds a tangy taste,  not really sour.  I even like it in mac and cheese (stovetop method).<br /><br />I have never attempted to make a beverage with this.  As a beverage, buttermilk has never appealed to me.  I'm guessing it might be OK, in small amounts, added to a smoothie in the blender.<br /><br />We got this at a local chain grocery store; thus I am unable to provide comment on the seller(s) here.<br />By the way, on that same aisle, I learned of some other dehydrated items for the pantry:  powdered eggs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ESJRB6">Deb-El Powdered Whole Eggs, 8-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>; and powdered egg whites (without the yokes) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055FWZSA">Deb El Just Whites Dried Egg Whites - 1 Canister (3 oz ea)</a>,  and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPOBYC">Deb-El Just Whites, 3-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />At first, I thought we would use this powdered buttermilk only in a pinch, like when snowed in.  However, we now prefer it.<br />More convenient than the alternative:  If we were to buy a carton of regular, fresh, liquid buttermilk, for a recipe, most of it would spoil before we got around to using it all.<br /><br />Also see other package sizes, some of which are Prime eligible now:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1L3Y">Saco Powdered Buttermilk, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>,  and  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AXZEW2">Saco Powdered Buttermilk, 12-ounce Can</a>.

review/summary: Adds Flavor, But...
review/text: Buttermilk is essential to many recipes.  But, keeping a supply handy in the refrigerator invariably leads to throwing the majority of it away due to spoilage.  I had high hopes for this Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend as a means of avoiding that problem.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the product doesn't meet my expectations.  I agree that it adds a certain flavor and a bit of loft to a recipe.  But, I don't think it's quite the same flavor or loft I get from real buttermilk (or what passes for real buttermilk, these days).  The flavor is OK:  it's just different.  Also, I think the loft is more from the fact that the batters it produces are runnier (or maybe looser) than I get from buttermilk.  That's probably because today's buttermilk has some form of gum added which thicken things up.  Since the end result of recipes made with this differ from that of using buttermilk, it's probably just as good to use the old standby of adding a tablespoon of white vinegar to a cup of milk.  The result will be different from real buttermilk, but just as equivalent as using this powdered buttermilk.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend trying this product for yourself to see if it meets your needs.  It's certainly not bad, and could be just fine for you.  But, in my case, I guess I'll just have to accept the spoilage of buttermilk in the refrigerator.  I rate this at an OK 3 stars out of 5.

The nice thing about this kind of bone is that you can freshen it up in lots of ways - stuff in a piece of cheese, spritz some spray butter (or even Pam) on it, pour the dregs of your vegetable soup on it, etc., and the dog will fall in love with it again and again. :)

review/summary: Better (and WAY cheaper) than Starbucks Frappuccino.
review/text: I've been buying these for some time now from another distributor, so I'm THRILLED to find them available now on Amazon with Subscribe-n-Save.<br /><br />This is a very versatile frappe blend. Just some ice and milk and it's a wonderfully flavorful coffee frappe. Or, with just the plain coffee base, you can add chocolate sauce to make a mocha frappe, syrups to make a vanilla/caramel/peppermint mocha--the flavor possibilities are endless.<br /><br />I make mine in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WAKFDY">Magic Bullet</a> and bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BU5KFY">Long Handled Coffee Scoop</a> that had the perfect sized handle to reach the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />A fantastically delicious and money-saving alternative to making the daily (or more frequent) trip to Starbucks to satisfy your Frappuccino cravings!

review/text: Sometimes my work schedule gets crazy, and I miss family dinner quite a bit, which besides being a drag interpersonally, often means I might miss a full plate, which you wouldn't guess to look at me, but I digress.<br /><br />I have lately taken to having a bowl of Raisin Nut Bran when I come in late, or even if I don't and get late night munchies. It is just sweet enough to hit the sweet tooth, and bulky and filling enough that it calms the hunger until the morning.<br /><br />Good stuff with reasonable caloric intake for what you get

Then Big G realized the only Raisin Bran they needed was Raisin Nut Bran as it essentially was the former cereals; just with almonds and nut covered raisins.<br /><br />Flakes stay crispy in milk, just the right amount of raisins, and the almond slivers are a nice touch.

The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic Chinese ginger, organic green cardamom, and organic Turkish anise. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Throughout India, chai stalls are a meeting place for provocative tea and conversation. From its homeland in China, chai has journeyed as chai, th&eacute;, and tea, recreating itself in every land. Numi's golden brewed, organic Chai fuses rich cultures in a complex and hearty Assam black tea. Indian cinnamon and mild green cardamom evoke a warm balance with the vitality of Chinese ginger. The peaked, sweet aroma of Turkish anise exhilarates memories. Reminisce in aged tradition with an inspiring cup of Golden Chai."<br /><br />Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, and the anise gives a certain type of mild sweetness, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is. Golden Chai is also caffeinated; if you want a caffeine-free chai, try Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan instead.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

I love to cook, and have had to convert so many of my favorite recipes, like sesame chicken, and orange chicken - where you coat the chicken and fry up for a crispy coating.. These breadcrumbs are very versatile, and work like a dream. I use them with a little gf flour, and cornstarch, and can always add my own seasoning if I need. I have tried making my own gluten free breadcrumbs, but it is such a pain, and they don't have the consistency I like. You will not be disappointed with Gillians. Well worth every penny too!

They looked great for the autumn themed candy buffet we had going on.

review/summary: Tasty, but for a diet?
review/text: The cookie industry has learned a new trick.  Set up a package of cookies that have 100 calories and people will buy them.  In fact, they are.  Health conscious Americans are gobbling these cookies down enthusiastically.  Unfortunately, these cookies remain cookies, though if you can limit yourself to one pack, you could be doing yourself, and your diet, a favor.<br /><br />These cookies taste reasonably good.  They have a satisfying crunch and a mild flavor.  Perhaps the only problem with them is that it is easy to be tempted into a second package; and then a third.  Stop at one package and at least your calorie intake will be reasonable for a snack.<br /><br />If you must have a cookie and you can limit yourself to a single package, by which I do not mean the entire box, then these cookies are a good choice.  Fruits and vegetables remain even better choices, but sometimes you just hear sugar calling your name.<br /><br />Enjoy!

One of these small bags of cookies is a favorite treat of mine.<br /><br />I was able to buy this item where I lived before but they are not carried in the area where I now live.

I only got one box with six bags of cookies in it.<br /><br />This is a royal rip-off.  Do not buy these cookies on-line.  These cost only a few bucks in the grocery store.

It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.

Batali's Tomato Basil has become my in-a-pinch jarred sauce for my family: it tastes fresh, light, not overly basilish, and balanced between salty and sweet. (Too sweet and icky for me would be something like Newman's Sockarooni.) My kid loves it, too. He calls it "yummy." I actually love this sauce much more than the better known Rao's version, so I definitely recommend it -- when you are in a rush and need to feed family, this sauce is perfect.

You can see bits of garlic, onion and (minimal) spices in the sauce but the flavor has been completely boiled out of it to point that all that's left the bitter part of the garlic and the acidic part of the tomatoes. To say the flavors don't blend is an understatement. There are any flavors to blend in the first place.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to be Mario Batali right now. Obviously he has traded his expertise and food quality for the money making machine.<br /><br />I severed this to good friends and they all agreed it wasn't a good sauce and that they would prefer not to have it again. I'll be writing a similar review for the pink vodka sauce which was also a disappointment.

review/summary: Romantic, Natural, Unique Tea Experience
review/text: *****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: "Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair." I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Plain Old Cereal
review/text: I bought this cereal thinking I was buying an amazing product for my child...gotta try and be that supermom ya know :). I took it into her pediatrition to make sure that there was nothing too crazy in this cereal and she said basically it is just playing up all of the things that these cereals normally have in them. She said it may have a little bit different of percentages when comparing it to say a Gerber cereal but its practically the same thing. Now I personally love that this is organic and the Happy Bellies brand is one that I really like for my daughter. She doesnt however seem to like the taste of this cereal unless mixed with applesauce and/or added to a large quantity of formula or breastmilk. Overall I think this product is average for an organic cereal, however the price point is reasonable enough. I would say you dont need to go out of your way to purchase this but if your in the market for a higher end brand of cereal for your little one, you could give this a try.

review/summary: Not so good Diet Root Beer
review/text: I wasn't at all impressed with Boylan Diet Root Beer! With the great reviews it had I thought it was worth the price. The Root Beer had a strange aftertaste and it was very flat. I'll stick to Stewarts Diet Root Beer.

review/summary: Best tasting diet soda I've had!!!!
review/text: Discovered this soda at a friend's party and I've been buying it ever since. Boylan's doesn't have a strange aftertaste that I have experienced with many other brands of diet soda. It has a great root beer flavor and when blended with vanilla sorbet - you'll get great frozen drink!

review/summary: absolute best for diet pop
review/text: If you are looking for a good diet soda without a litany of strange ingredients or chemical flavors, this is the one to get. It has the added benefit of being in a glass bottle: easy to recycle and no leeching of contaminants. Tops though is the taste... absolutely delicious! Just watch out, guests will want seconds, thirds and some to go.
