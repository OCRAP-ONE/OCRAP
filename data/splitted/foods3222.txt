review/summary: Pure vanilla powder made of maltodextrin
review/text: I deducted one star for the "pure vanilla powder" name, and another for not being as aromatic as pure vanilla, so 3 stars.  I read the description above and thought I scrutinized the wording well enough to detect any misdirection, so unfortunately I didn't get to the ingredients list.  I have some Rodelle vanilla pods and the fragrance is amazing.  Compared to any vanilla essence I've ever tried, it's like the difference between freshly roasted coffee beans and folgers.  So I thought this "pure vanilla powder" would be the closest thing ([...] bucks for a little jar!), and easier to use than vanilla pods.  Well it turns out it's a jar of essentially corn syrup solids laced with vanilla extract.<br /><br />It's hard to avoid maltodextrin in pre-processed foods from the supermarket, but I'd rather not have it in my homemade foods too.  It's a good thing that there's a powder version on the market, because it has its own kind of convenience, but it doesn't seem to me any more fragrant than regular extract,  and unlike other reviewers' experience it seem like I do have to use more than liquid extract (also it cakes up terribly). Might be worth $3.50+shipping for the added convenience of the powder, but otherwise it's a pretty pedestrian product.  Win some, learn some...

review/summary: More than 50% is Maltodextrin -- That's "Pure"?
review/text: I should have read the reviewers' comments before making this purchase.  When the label states "Pure Vanilla Powder", to me that means just that.  Nope.  As you will see after your purchase when you look at the jar, it has 2 ingredients.  The first is Maltodextrin, and the second is Vanilla Bean Extractives.  It tastes very good but you have to use a fair amount since it's been cut rather severely.  The manufactures of this product should be honest and indicate that Maltodextrin is the primary ingredient.

review/summary: Pure GMO (genetically modified organism) Vanilla Powder
review/text: I bought this vanilla powder in Whole Foods, I assumed that Whole Foods sell best products. Unfortunately WH also sell GMO, but they pay me money back even for empty bottles of this vanilla powder.<br />I do not recommend to buy this vanilla powder, especially for children and young adults, because maltodextrin is made from GMO (genetically modified organism).<br />Nielsen-Massey company also give me false info over the phone that they do not use GMO.<br />Here is part of document I received from Nielsen-Massey company by email:<br /><br />"To whom it might concern:<br />Regarding MALTRIN M100 and M510 maltodextrin, these products are processed from some GMO raw materials. These products will typically test negative for GMOs by PCR method. Those products will not meet EU labeling regulations as a non-GMO...."

review/text: I have tried several brands of Vanilla Powder to add to my Chai Lattes at home, and this is by far THE BEST! I cannot speak for its use in baking, but for beverages, it definitely adds a wonderfully strong vanilla flavor. FYI, the worst Vanilla Powder brand I tried was "Cooks."

review/text: I wanted something similar to the vanilla powder that they have in coffee shops for my morning coffee.<br /><br />This powder does taste and smell like vanilla, but doesn't seem to have a strong flavor. Maybe the coffee shop powder uses artificial flavoring to make it more intense? Or maybe this one is 'watered down' too much with maltodextrin?<br /><br />In any case, it's not bad, but still not quite what I'm looking for.

review/text: This is basically misleading advertising. They label it pure, but have a genetically modified ingredient within. Maltodextrin is genetically modified corn sugar. GMO corn is one of the worst things you can put into your body according to my research, along with Canola Oil(no matter how they claim it's healthy), Aspartame, high fructose corn syrum, and other hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />Shame on them for labeling this "Pure".

review/summary: Toasted Cardboard with Nutrasweet sprinkled on top
review/text: From crazzeto's wife:<br /><br />My 5 month old preemie baby (born 2 months early due to preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome) needs special formulas for her feeding problems and they taste HORRIBLE. So, we've been adding a 1/4 teaspoon vanilla powder to each bottle so she'll eat it. We've tried several different brands but this is the absolute worst! When I opened it, it didn't even smell like vanilla - it smelled like they had sprinkled artificial sweetener onto some cardboard, toatsted it until it was burnt, then crumbled it into a very coarse powder and bottled it. Then I tried to scoop some out and found that it was ROCK HARD! It had all clumped together in the bottle like brown sugar does when it gets dry. I managed to scrape a few clumps out and taste it and the good news is that it doesn't taste like cardboard. The bad news, though, is that it doesn't taste like anything at all! And to top it all off, the seller doesn't allow returns! I'm stuck with this overpriced junk so bad I can't even put it in coffee much less my baby's formula! PLEASE do yourself a favor and save your money rather than buy this. The best powdered vanilla is the Cook's brand, also available on amazon. It's not the greatest either, but it's the best I've found so far and 1,000 times better than this stuff.

review/text: I love this stuff!  I am always looking for ways to add healthful fiber to my diet and as a devoted fan of agave nectar I thought I would give this a try.  I use it in my morning oatmeal; it leaves no discernable taste or texture and each teaspoonful adds 10 grams of healthful soluble fiber. One note of advice: as with all fiber if you are not used to it in your diet be prepared for excess gas. Simply start with small amounts and slowly increase it over time to minimize this effect.

review/summary: Great source of fiber
review/text: We use agave as a sweetener in our coffee and tea so I figured I would give this a try as we want to increase our fiber intake.  I add a tablespoon of the powder to a glass of water and mix it together using a "milk frother" to try to mix it evenly.  Unfortunately, it doesn't mix in very well and there are little bits, but it's not really an issue.  I didn't take a star off for that.  The powder has a sweet taste that is very similar to cotton candy, but when mixed in with a glass of water I can hardly taste anything.  My wife even added it to her coffee this morning to try it out and she said it didn't negatively impact the drink.

review/summary: Nothing but a flop
review/text: I have eaten these candies for years, and usually the Jelly Belly brand. But after reading all the great reviews, and the low price, I ordered a five pound bag, and looked forward to their arrival. When I opened the box, the flimsy bag had split open and the candies spread everywhere. The outside of the candy is supposed to be crunchy, but they were about as crunchy as a jelly donut. The jelly inside was tough, and the overall taste, well the only word that comes to mind is yucky. Now, I am stuck with five pounds of candy that won't be eaten, and I can't mail it back, because it will cost as much as the product, to mail it. After reading this, and you still decide you want to order a bag, at least get the smaller three pound bag. That way, if you don't like it, you won't be out so much money.

I didn't taste a whole lot of raspberry flavor either; maybe I'd had better ones.  Originally, I thought there were the same gummies I received at Christmas from a friend who's living in Europe; but boy, was I disappointed.  My husband and kids didn't like them; my husband then brought the candies to work - they weren't a hit either.  I tried to give the candies away and nobody wanted them.  I read the other reviews before I bought these and except for 1 review, all the other customers seemed to love these.  Well, good for you if you love them; we definitely don't enjoy them at all.

review/text: This is my sixth or seventh Haribo bulk item purchased at Amazon, and so far, perhaps my favorite. The peaches and the cherry gummies would be a close second. I would hardly call the flavor anything like actual raspberries, but like most Haribo confections, it's still very fragrant and pleasant---not at all chemical/noxious/phony. The main problem with these raspberries is their small size and interesting chewy/crunchy texture tempts you to come back for more. Before you know it, you've finished the bag, ordered three more, and are seeing an endocrinologist regularly for acute pancreatic failure---basically the highest compliment you can pay to a confectionery company. Way to go, Haribo!

review/summary: Everybody wants some!
review/text: When I found these soft, chewy candies covered with sugary beads, all in red and deep purple raspberry colors at a grocery outlet five years ago, I ended up purchasing 25 bags.  I generously shared them with almost all my close friends and they loved them.  Then they seemed to disappear from all the stores I scoured; my friends accused me of hoarding and not sharing.  I carefully rationed the three bags I had saved, but they finally ran out and I spent a year trying not to accept that they may have been discontinued by the manufacturer. I eventually succumbed to temptation and searched the internet for the manufacturer; and Eureka! there they were and for sale on Amazon.  Thinking everybody else had forgotten about the existence of these little gems of raspberry candy, I only ordered 2 5-pound bags. I immediately gave a jarful to my brother and a neighbor who wasn't feeling well and so on until it is almost time for me to order another 10 pounds.  If you like mouth-watering raspberry flavor in a bite sized jewel that melts gradually until you surrender to the urge to chew up the last bit, you'll love these.  Just be sure you don't order the whole supply; that you leave some more for me.

review/text: Haribo makes an astonishing variety of candies. Gummi Raspberrys are an excellent candy that demonstrates the inspired imagination that sets Haribo apart from run of the mill candy makers. There are two flavors in the bag, Red Raspberry and Black Raspberry, and their tastes are believable, if maybe a tad sweet. The real inventiveness of this candy is the texture. They feel like a real raspberry when you bite into them, thanks to a coating of flavored carnauba wax "seeds" (it tastes better than it sounds!) that crunches when you chew, just like the seeds on a real raspberry.  Habit forming.

review/text: 5lbs of Raspberries is a large amount. For comparison's sake, think of a 5 lbs baby. Now imagine that baby filled with Haribo Raspberries. This is the amount of candy you'll get. Can you handle it?<br /><br />I've given some to friends and family and still have a lot left over for myself. As soon as the product arrived, I stored the majority of the candy in a large air tight jar, and a smaller supply in a more accessible jar on my desk. It's been 10 months since I've ordered it, back in June 06', and the candy in the large jar is still chewy and fresh. I would say the shelf life on this candy is very long, given it's properly stored.<br /><br />Superb product with nice texture and in my opinion, just the right amount of sweetness. The interior is gummy but it's not sticky and won't cling to your teeth.

review/summary: a frighterning quantity (but only because they are so (good)
review/text: This review is of the Haribo <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVMNP0">Haribo Gummi Candy, Raspberries, 5-Pound Bag</a> flavor gummies (it looks like all of the flavors are listed together).  these differ from all of the others in that they are covered with nonpareils.<br /><br />This was a favorite of my youth, and one which is hard to find and expensive in Hawaii.  I would say something like "Amazon saves the day again" as this 5 pound bag cost a little more than half a pound costs in local stores, but 5 pounds is a lot of candy!  it is nice if you have self control ;) and can keep them in good condition.  We have issues with humidity, and so packed them up in snapware  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063SSI">Snapware 60002BXS Square Grip 10-Piece Airtight Dry-Food Canister Set</a> containers upon arrival.<br /><br />The candy itself is a little different than I remember.  i am quite sure that what I got back when was not made by Haribo.  They rae however very very close to the original.  These are rasberry and blackberry flavor.  Mu husband thinks the  2 flavors are indistinguishable, my son doesn't like the blackberry (which are my favorite).  No they do not taste like fresh fruit, but, that said they are much closer then the artificial flavors found in many fruit candies.  As candy goes, this is one of the better ones nutritionally, made with real sugar and fruit juices and containing no fat.  *most* of the ingrdients are natural; overall better than most in that regard and one I do not worry about giving my kids....except for the quantity ;)  If you have not ordered these before, 5 lbs is a lot of candy.  You might want to consider getting yourself a good airtight storage container (maybe even one with a lock ) ;)

review/text: These are really cute candies. Each drop is wrapped into hundred of crunchy round bits, just like a real berry. Oozing with flavor and enticing aroma. The gummi part is found inside. Although the Haribo bears are my ultimate favorite, I find this one a bit too sweet for the taste.

review/summary: Not fresh, color and taste faded compared to when bought in store
review/text: My family fell in love with Haribo Raspberries this fall when we tried our first bag from a local store-they were an instant hit.  Fresh, vibrant colors, the non-pareils (sugar balls) on the outside burst in your mouth as you tasted them.  Yum!<br /><br />However, I was instantly disappointed when the box I ordereed from Amazon arrived, instead of a fresh, vibrant red, the berries that should have been red were a faded, dingy tan-peach color.  The black ones were still black, but when you handled them it left a brown residue on your fingers as if the color was leaching out of them.<br /><br />The color wasn't the only problem-the non-pareils didn't have that "burst" quality, they were rather bland and tasted old.  I think the candy was old, or perhaps improperly stored, because it was still within the expiration date by a few months.  Whatever the case, the large bag was nowhere near the quality or flavor that the locally purchased Haribo Raspberries were, and I'll not make that mistake again.

review/summary: Too Sweet, Fresh, Fast Delivery
review/text: I purchased *five pounds* of raspberries and blackberries because I've had Haribo gummi bears before and really enjoyed them, plus the price can't be beat (usually just five ounces is two to three dollars, imagine getting five whole pounds for fifteen dollars!).<br /><br />I DID NOT ENJOY these.  Buy the gold gummi bears instead.<br />These raspberries blackberries are too sweet and have a weird consistency.<br />They are nothing like the Jelly Belly raspberries blackberries (which are lovely little drops of heaven).<br /><br />I was very uncertain buying raspberries blackberries online, because I wasn't sure if I would get cruddy old stale raspberries blackberries that endanger your teeth and taste of old wax.<br /><br />That was not the case with me.<br /><br />These raspberries blackberries seem fresh, and were well packaged and delivered promptly.<br /><br />I purchased the raspberries blackberries on Jan 27 2009.  I received them on Jan 30 2009.  They were fresh and squishy, and well packaged.  They shipped from Indianapolis and arrived in DC three days later.  Terrific.<br /><br />Too bad you have to buy two bags to get free shipping, now I have 10 pounds of candy lying around!  Five pounds of which I really hate.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.  Go for the Haribo standard bearer, the gold gummi bear instead.

review/summary: Yummy gummi berries!
review/text: I've loved gummy raspberries for years, and was delighted to find packs of the Haribos in my local Wal-Mart. Then I thought, "Amazon may have these...cheaper!" I was so happy to find this 5-pound bulk bag, and I've bought it twice. It'll be three times soon! I have not had any of the problems others mention. They always arrive tightly sealed in the original package, and the candy inside is fresh. The black raspberries are a bit stronger in flavor than the red ones, but not bitter to me. My dad actually prefers them. I grew up in the country and have picked many many blackberries and raspberries in thorny thickets. The black raspberries actually taste very similar to real ones (although much sweeter!), because the real ones have that tiny bit of bite from the seeds.<br /><br />I will continue to buy these, especially at Christmastime when they are gobbled up quickly. Thank you, Haribo and Amazon! Keep up the good work!

Maybe we should try planting some :-)

review/summary: Not Just a Substitute!
review/text: If you're a gummy candy aficionado like me, you probably know that these raspberry/blackberry candies are generally considered a "lesser" version of the Jelly Belly gummies--at less than half the price of the iconic Jelly Belly candy. JB gummies have very tiny, crunchy nonpareils and distinctive, tart berry flavors.<br /><br />But wait! Having purchased a 5-pound bag of the Haribo variety, I now know it's not just a cheaper substitute for the JB candies. Their larger nonpareils actually have an interesting, less crunchy texture and provide a pleasant introduction to the gumdrop inside. The Haribo flavors, while not as distinctly berry-like as their JB counterparts, are very tasty. The gummy portion is somewhat chewier than the JB brand, and it's also less cloyingly sweet.<br /><br />In short, I really prefer the Haribo gummy berries to the Jelly Belly version...and the lower price is sweet, too!

review/text: I bought this as a gift for my sister who likes this candy.<br /><br />Although this version of the candy isn't as good as the ones found in local stores it's definitely on par.<br /><br />One thing though is that the black ones taste semi-bitter. Which I don't remember in the originals. It's more of an acquired taste. Also, there are some comments about the balls surrounding the jelly being too sweet. They are indeed very sweet but I like that since I only eat a few at a time instead of gorging myself on candy.<br /><br />One thing I would say, is that 5 pounds is a lot. Great price for content but you have to put it in a zip lock to preserve the freshness and even then... phew. Try going through five pounds of this stuff. Hope you have a family of 12!<br /><br />I read reviews and pretty much got what I was expecting. If you want exactly what you buy locally this probably wont do it for you.

Jelly Belly and a few others also make similar shapped and colored candies but they are nothing like these. The imitators are basically cheap sprinkle covered gummy bears- avoid them!

review/summary: Great Flavor - The Perfect Choice
review/text: Great raspberry flavor! We used these at our wedding and guests were fighting over the left overs to take home.<br /><br />They are dangerously tasty, I have to hide them so I don't eat the whole bag.<br /><br />My husband is a raspberry addict and he doesn't like a lot of candy, but he loved these.<br /><br />To my taste buds, the red ones taste better than the black because of the knobley coating on the outside. Good thing is that there are always a lot more red than black in each bag. I have ordered 5 bags in total and they have all been like that.

review/text: These Haribo Raspberries are good but not as good as the<br />Haribo regular gummies.  These have a very good raspberry<br />flavor but I don't care for the tiny sugar-ball<br />coating on them; it makes them way too sweet and gives<br />a kind of funky feeling when you're chewing them, too<br />crunchy for a gummi.  I had to try them as I like most<br />all the other Haribo candies, but I won't buy these again.

review/summary: chemical taste -- ewww!
review/text: I'm a big fan of many gummi candies -- especially the Jelly Belly version of this product, but it can be expensive and harder to find. I thought I would give this brand a try -- BUT WHAT A MISTAKE!!! The candy is giant, the "seeds" are waxy balls, and the gel inside has no flavor at all. The red ones especially have a chemical taste. Amazon issued a refund and I'm throwing these away. Save your $$$ for the real thing!

review/summary: Ever tried to eat five pounds of candy?
review/text: So. . . .<br /><br />I work at a place where I spend a lot of time online.  Because I live in a college town and I'm at that tender age where it's obvious that college was a catastrophic failure for me, but I've not yet found the "real" job that will keep me busy until it's time to put me in the ground, I work with a lot of friends that found themselves in the same situation.<br /><br />I was surfing around and found these Haribo Raspberries listed.  I remembered getting these in a little pack that looked like it was from a farmer's market as a kid -- a little waxed cardboard basket with these vacuum packed in the middle.  I LOVED THESE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN.<br /><br />Being a little older, and having the ability to make orders online, I sent a link to this item to a friend and was rambling about how I'd ordered these.  I told them that I was really excited to have found them again.<br /><br />Because we're all trying to reach out to oblivion in our own ways. . . and we don't fear the consequences of any types of self-destructive behaviour, we started talking about having a contest to see who could eat the most candy -- I'd alluded to how I could likely eat all five pounds in one sitting.  A candy eating contest was born.  The rules were going to be that everyone that wished to participate would bring five pounds of their chosen candy.  For me, it was easy -- this came in a five pound bag.<br /><br />Long story short. . . . These are so good you can get through about 2.3 pounds in a sitting. . . .<br /><br />Can't say that for many other types of candy.

It was evident that whoever packed the box knew the bag was slit and tried to conceal it by putting it upside down and thus guaranteeing that all the candy was contaminated.

review/text: i didn't like this product at all and ended up tossing it. the soft inner part of the candy tasted really good but the hard, beady outer part was a headache. i ended up having to peel/scrape all the outer beady thingies off the candies just to get to the soft, jelly/gummy part of the candy. in the end it was just not worth the effort so i took it as a loss and threw it all away. since every person is an individual and has their own tastes, if you want to give it a try go for it. as for me and my opinion, i didn't like these candies at all as long as those outer beady thingies were on them. by-the-way, the beady thingies had no raspberry fruity taste to them, only the inner gummy part had flavor. the beady parts just had a sweet, flavorless taste.

review/summary: The lentils make a GREAT base for quick, nutricious, and inexpensive homemade meals!
review/text: I have been buying these lentils at my local grocery store for a long while now, but was delighted to find them on Amazon for so much less, no taxes and free to my door delivery!<br /><br />Now, why lentils, and why these particular lentils?<br />1) Lentils are high in protein, vit B1, iron, and fiber!<br />2) Lentils are low in fat, and are also low on the glycemic index!<br />3) Lentils are a great base for many dishes: within 20 minutes you can have a tasty homemade dinner. Here is my favourite (start the clock): put on some basmati rice. In a separate pot, steam a large chopped onion for a few minutes. Add one can of lentils (always with the liquid!). Add dried garlic bits, chili powder, ginger powder, curry powder, all to taste. Stew for a few minutes. Add garam masala (a spice that can be purchased in most grocery stores) and cook for another few minutes. Serve over the basmati rice. There! Stop the clock! This should not have taken more then 20 minutes. Makes two servings (unless you are very hungry). This can be also prepared using oil (you'd fry the onion, instead of steaming it). The taste of the dish can be manipulated by using other spices (turmeric, cumin, etc.) and adding other vegetables (peas, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.). You can also try adding some sliced almonds and a few raisins. You can prepare this a day ahead and take to work with you for an inexpensive, but tasty and healthy work lunch! The cost of the meal, including rice and the entire can of lentils, comes to less then four dollars (or thereabout).<br />4) These lentils are organic, vegetarian, and kosher, for those who are interested.<br /><br />PS: Do not be put off by the "funny" look of the lentil liquid once you have opened the can. It is supposed to look like this. DO NOT drain the lentils!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious pantry staple
review/text: These lentils are an amazing staple in my kitchen!  I love lentils for vegetarian meals, though I've made a few spectacular non-vegetarian meals with them as well, including one with diced carrot and celery, turkey bacon, and thyme, sauteed together, then combined with the lentils and a little chicken or veg stock.  I also dump a can into a quick soup, usually with canned tomatoes and some kind of green, like kale.  They are possibly good enough to be eaten straight from the can, but I have yet to be in that much of a hurry.  They're an amazing convenience, and really healthy, so that makes me happy.  I love lentils spicy, savory, in soups and stews, in salads, as side dishes, I've even made a sauce with lentils.  I used to occasionally buy these vacuum-sealed refrigerated lentils from Trader Joe's and they were great, but a little dry and also perishable.  These cans are the perfect solution, especially via subscribe and save, with which I can have a case in my pantry for both planned and impromptu meals.  Good flavor, good value, and they're organic!

review/summary: Excellent coffee, price is too high
review/text: This is my favorite coffee - strong, delicious and bold. However, the price here is way too high, you can buy it much cheaper elsewhere. I usually buy it at Costco - 80 cups for $33.

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: I love a bold, strong coffee without a bitter taste, and this has proven to be my favorite. Strong and flavorful, even the decaf version is excellent. My second favorites are Green Mountain's French Roast and Timothy's espresso blend, if that's any help. If you like strong coffee, definitely give this a try!
