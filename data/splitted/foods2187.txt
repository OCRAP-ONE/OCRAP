review/summary: A Heathier Alternative
review/text: My wife swears by Alterna BBQ Sauce because it tastes great. I like it because it doesn't have added sugars, just 5g for a two tablespoon serving which I guess would come directly from tomatoes. Looks to me like a great product for everyone and even more so for those who are pre-diabetic or diabetic. Nice to see these products finally hitting the national market.

review/summary: Bowl is fine, but sticker packaging is crap
review/text: This Stainless Steel MIRROR PET DISH 1QT 144 is exactly what it says it is, and is fine in and of itself. However, the huge advertisement sticker that covers the entire inner bottom of the bowl is impossible to remove without spending a good hour or so scrubbing it off. I actually had to soak it in nail polish remover, then scrub it no less than 12 times to fully remove the sticky residue. What a pain!

review/summary: thin wall bowls
review/text: These bowls are a good price but as the old saying goes "You get what you pay for."<br />My new bowls are already denting and they don't dry unless you wipe them (some kind of residue on them from stamping them out I would guess.)<br />My older bowls are thicker and though I've had them for over 12 years - they have no dents and dry on their own.<br /><br />It's like I said - if you want bowls cheap and don't care what they look like - these are fine for you.<br />But if you want something that's going to last and doesn't look like it's been dragged behind your car, get something with a higher thickness.<br />It's your choice.

review/text: A friend brought some of these over & I LOVE them. Normally with mints I tend to be wary because most mints have no flavor & the mint it way too strong, but these arent like that at all. They are sweet but not overly so, & you can actually taste flavor because the mint isnt beyond strong. I really like these, would recommend these, & will buy these in the future :).

review/text: One other reviewer commented that the pepper burned their mouth, but I love that! The competing brand is Oregon Chai, and theirs is much sweeter and with less spice. I personally love the spice and peppery taste of this one, and the reduced sweetness. Now if they only had a sugar-free version, it would be perfect!<br /><br />But I agree with others - Amazon's price is way too high. There should be a powdered form of this that is easier to ship, IMHO. Maybe powdered and sugar-free - now that would be perfect.

review/summary: Overpriced
review/text: I am very dissapointed in Amazon on this one. Anything that I buy on a consistent basis I buy through Amazon, whether it is electronics, books, toys, diapers, etc., Amazon always comes through with an unbelievable deal. On this product they have missed the boat badly. I can understand 10% higher than the store, I can live with that. I'll buy in bulk through Amazon just for convienence. However, this product can be purchased an any Target or major grocery chain (mine at least - Kroger) for $3.89 or 4.29. If I were to buy 6 of these 32oz concetrates at Target with tax it would run me close to $26. This is 33% less than the sale price that Amazon is offering. This is the same concentrate used by starbucks, this is why I use it, to save money by making it on my own. Unfortunately with the price point I would be better off having someone make it for me.

review/summary: Heavy on the Pepper!  3 1/2 stars
review/text: I didn't hate this but it is almost undrinkable because the pepper burned my mouth and throat a bit. It may be because I used skim milk and I will try it again as soon as I get some Fat-Free Half & Half. It also left a strange chalky after taste in my mouth, once again it could be the skim milk. The sweet factor wasn't too cloying so that was a plus. I think I am used to using tea bags and my favorite right now is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG5IXW">Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. I need decaf from now on anyway and each company is wildly different from their Chai teas esp. in the decaf and Caffeinated. All-in-all 3 1/2 stars.

Seeing how I live in the burbs and cant stop at the coffee shop every day, not to mention it can get a bit costly..So when I saw this at wal-mart last week I was very excited!! And at wal-mart it is priced under 4$ !!! It tasted AWESOME! All you have to do is add add milk no sugar or any other sweeteners. I used non-fat milk . Directions call for equal parts milk and concentrate but I used a bit more milk  ...but its all up to personal tastes .Give it a try I don't think you will be sorry.

No way.<br /><br />Delicious, delicious stuff, though.  So easy to keep in the fridge to have a quick cup of chai without having to boil water, steep the tea, add the sweetener, etc.  Each box will make about 8 cups when you go half and half with milk.  Sweet and just a little bit spicy.  Warms the tummy and clears the sinuses a bit when you have a cold.  Make it with 1% milk for that hint of creaminess.  Great with gingerbread.  OK, now I'm hungry.............

Amazon was wonderful about processing a re-order and giving me a partial credit on the somewhat damaged items. The re-order was again damaged during delivery. I just called Amazon and they will re-order this product for me again. and update the shipping time. I really do love the product. I am hoping that it makes it this time.

My cats love it (even the finicky one) and I'm happy there is at least one cat food company out there that provides nutritious pet food. Thank you Wellness! Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you  need a can opener to open these cans.

review/summary: The Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised for Turkey
review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/summary: Very high quality food, and cat likes it
review/text: I recently did a bunch of research on Cat nutrition, and my conclusion was that the Wellness cat foods offered the best combination of excellent nutrition, good variety, and affordability.  So I bought some for my crotchety, picky, 16+ year old cat who had been eating Nutro.  To my great relief, she accepted the switch without complaint!<br /><br />Although I haven't had a long history with this cat food yet, I've been pleased with the results so far, and based on my research I'm convinced I'm doing right by my furry friend.  I certainly recommend it.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

review/text: My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats...

review/summary: Cat loves this and it's a high quality food
review/text: I have a 1 1/2 year old cat and started feeding him canned food after reading about how cats don't naturally have a strong thirst drive and need most of their water to come from their food like in nature. Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that "Science Diet" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

review/summary: Thie Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised
review/text: I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.  If you hit create review, THEN hit Edit review, apparently it takes.

review/summary: Good Cat Food
review/text: My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.

review/summary: My Cats Health Improved with This Food
review/text: I rescued three cats that were suffering from malnutrition.  I started feeding them wellness canned chicken cat food in small portions mixed with organic chicken broth.  I fed them a  few times a day, and within  a week they had more energy, and were putting on weight.  Within a month their coat was soft and shinny.  These cats did a total turn around and I believe that this fine food saved their lives.  I continued feeding the cats this food  because I am confident that the high protein and natural antioxidants will keep my cats healthy and it will also keep the cats hydrated.  I am very pleased with this food.  It is the next best thing to a raw diet.<br />Wellness Complete Health Canned Cat Food, Chicken Recipe (Pack of 12 12.5-Ounce Cans)

review/summary: Purr-fect!
review/text: I haven't bought Wellness through Amazon yet, but the prices are very competitive and will do so.  After discovering they carried Wellness, wanted to comment on the product.  When I adopted my cat, she came with unrevealed health problems.  She was on a nebulizer every day, no energy, vomiting and more.  As one reviewer stated, I did some internet research.  I tried some of the top of the line natural foods.  Once I got her on the Wellness wet food, her health was a complete turnaround.  She's twelve and acts like four or five years of age.  No more health problems.  The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.  The dry, is very small pieces and she's slow to eat it, but I keep it as a 'treat' food.  The wet is perfect in every way.

This flavor is much juicer, has more 'gravy' in it than all the other flavors we've tried. I've even been able to put some liquid antibiotic in the gravy and it gets gobbled up.  That was a real treat for me-not having to bother with the syringe dosing!

review/summary: My cat Nigel does not throw up anymore !!
review/text: After my vet recommended switching from the basic Petsmart variety lo quality dry food, I tried Wellness canned cat food (even though the price was at least 3 times more expensive than the old Pro Plan).  My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!

review/summary: Terrible Delivery from Amazon
review/text: We usually order this from Petco because our cat has health problems and can only eat specific types of cat food. Ordering online at Amazon is easier and cheaper. But This time I noticed that this item, ordered FROM Amazon, was being promoted as a 2 day shipping item, despite having Prime Membership, and I needed it as soon as possible. After about a week of ordering this '2 day shipping item' i received notification that it had not yet shipped and was expected to be delivered a month later! The reasoning I was given was that if I order from Amazon.com directly I should expect a month wait time and they were out of stock. 1-I received no notification that the item was out of stock. 2-Don't promote something as a special with 2 day shipping when you don't mean it. People order things based on delivery time for a reason. I'm angry that I wasted my time and was relying for the food to get here in a timely manner. I will not order directly from Amazon again.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Healthy Canned Diet
review/text: Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up "health food" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets.

review/summary: The best in the U.S. market today.
review/text: About the only thing wrong I can find with Wellness canned is the number of people who complain that their cats won't eat it -- even cats that were eating Wellness for awhile, suddenly they seem to lose interest.  People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it ("they've been eating Wellness for years!"), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation.

review/summary: Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.
review/text: We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.

review/text: We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat.

We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.

review/text: My 14 year old feline - Archie - was diagnosed with diabetes 2 weeks ago.  His diet for the previous 6 years consisted solely of Science Diet (adult/senior/light/age defying)kibble and a small amount of Friskie's canned at dinner time.  Per his veterinarians instructions to feed only high quality canned (wet) foods, I purchased Science Diet MD for diabetic cats.  Over the course of the following 3 days, there was no significant change in Archie's blood glucose which prompted me to start investigating cat foods a little more thoroughly.<br /><br />As stated on the Science Diet MD label, their carbohydrate content tested at 13%.  This seemed very high to me as diabetes maintenance is nearly ALL about carbohydrates.<br /><br />I discovered that Wellness brand Chicken tested at 4% carbohydrates. The fat content, at 60%, is higher than I'd like, but I'm okay with that, at least for the time being.  Archie's blood glucose plummeted 100 points within 24 hours of his first meal of Wellness Chicken.<br /><br />At less than $3.00 per 12.5 oz. (Amazon price PLUS free shipping)compared to Science Diet MD at $2.75 per 5.5 oz., Wellness also wins in the cost category. A double win X2 as I live in Alaska which is prone to unnecessary and outrageous shipping fees from unscrupulous/lazy vendors.<br /><br />Wellness Chicken is not vegetable free - it does contain peas and potato fillers (among others) but it is grain free which is also in it's favor.  Cats, after all, are carnivores.  It makes sense to me that their diet reflect this as much as possible/affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: My 6 month old kittens won't touch Wellness Kitten canned food.  I'm sure it's good for them but I can't get them to eat it.  I've tried on 2 separate occasions without any success.  One of my kittens is very finicky but the other one eats almost anything so I've given up on this brand.

review/summary: Wellness Rocks...!!!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Wellness, as well as a few other holistic brands of animal food. I am new to this product, as we have just been adopted by a brother and sister pair. This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more. But, my family has had many, many, animals over the last 25 years, and we have seen the difference that a GOOD diet makes. And in the long run, it can help save an awful lot in vet bills.

review/text: I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!

review/summary: Healthy, and kittens dig it
review/text: I recently took home two bengal kittens, and wanted to do everything "right", learning from past mistakes, and one of the mistakes I had made in the past was not researching cat nutrition enough.  So this time I did.  There are quite a few top quality foods out there that aren't full of grain and "meat-meal", but I chose wellness because it is a bit more affordable, and is popular enough to be available at local pet stores as well as online.<br /><br />Now the big hurdle...do the kittens accept it?  Well, mine sure did.  I was a bit worried because they had been eating mostly Royal Canin dry food at the breeders house, but they took to it immediately and now are very passionate about dinner time.  Excellent!  I couldn't be happier.  Expensive?  Yes, unfortunately it is, but it is actually cheaper than Royal Canin and several of the others and in the case of Royal Canin, it has *much* better ingredients!  Do the research yourself and see, don't take my word for it!

review/summary: It's pricey, but our picky cats like it.
review/text: Our kittens will eat anything, even styrofoam & rubber bands if they can find it. but our older cats are very picky & spoiled. It used to be that we could only get them to eat Fancy Feast, then after they tried Fancy Feast Medlies, they wouldn't eat the regular Fancy Feast anymore. Now the only thing they'll eat is Natural Balance & Wellness, which are even more expencive, though they're not at all picky about cereal or treats. So we're spending about $80 a month on wet cat food, $100 if you include cereal & litter, & this is with a Petco discount.<br /><br />I'm not really pleased with the inclusion of vegetables though; our vet told us that cats cannot digest plant matter & that it only serves to make them poop more. Alos either Natural Balance or Wellness is giving our kittens random boughts of diarrhea.

review/summary: Cats Love This; Doesn't Smell Like Bad Cat Food
review/text: Our cats love this.  We switched to this for half of their meals from regular dry food to help with urinary problems with one of the cats and to get them away from carb-rich food.  The cats really, really like this and have lost some weight over using Iams dry, weight-loss, hairball formula, which was one of the goals of changing their food.  Also, with it being moist food I can easily add a joint supplement to our older cat's food.  The only downside, like most moist food, is that the cats started having hairballs again.  This is why we give them this for only half of their meals and use dry food for the other half.  I switched their dry food also, but to a brand that isn't sold here, so I won't mention the brand.<br /><br />We love that this doesn't smell bad or give our cats digestive problems.  Cheaper moist cat food smells horrible and upsets our cats' digestive systems (which also smells horrible ;)).  I like that this is made with "human grade" ingredients.  I think this must account for the smell.  It smells pretty much like tinned meat a human would eat, like tinned chicken or fish.

review/summary: Best quality cat food I've seen
review/text: We moved our two Bengals from canned Fancy Feast chicken and turkey to Wellness Chicken.  It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.<br /><br />This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.  We think it is worth it.

review/text: My two cats love this food!  I normally buy the chicken and the beef/chicken formulas and have been using it ~ 2 yrs now.  High quality ingredients with no corn or preservatives are a priority for me since my cats previously had issues with allergies and dander.  My cats no longer have dry skin and now only have some seasonal allergies instead of year round problems.<br /><br />The negative is that Wellness food is expensive.  I'm always on the lookout for coupons and I buy larger quantities in wet and dry food to save.  I only give my cats wet food once a day and use a feeder with a timer to ration out dry food for the rest of the day.

In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans.

review/summary: Dented Cans AGAIN!
review/text: I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account.

review/summary: Canned Kitty food
review/text: One of my cats developed a urinary tract infection that caused both of us great suffering.  Kitty was two years old and I had only ever fed her dry food.  After getting things under control with the vet meds and UTI foods I added Wellness Adult Chicken Canned Cat Food to kitties diet.  She eats about 2 oz of this a day and some dry food, a combination of Royal Canin Urinary SO33, which she doesn't like very well and Purina One Salmon & Brown Rice formula which both cats love.  Kitty does prefer this wet food over the dry and will eat the wet if it is available.<br /><br />So far the UTI cat is still UTI free and my other kitty who only eats the Purina One is also UTI free.  My finicky kitty will only eat the dry food.

The product was packaged with no padding at all in a box that was a good deal larger than the item. I saved no money at all on free shipping as I had to discard 5 cans of an already expensive cat food.

She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef.  I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer.  It's too thick and sticky.  Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle.  She's put on at least a pound in 3 weeks (she eats an entire 5.5 oz can plus dry food every day--no more pushing the food around and not really eating), no more straining on the litter box, and she hasn't barfed in over a week!  I'm really impressed at what a difference this food has made for my cat's health.

review/summary: Wellness Cat Food
review/text: Since cats are obligate carnivores, high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy. When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain, useless fillers and by-products from their formulas.My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more. Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new. This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago.

review/summary: Crack for Cats
review/text: I started feeding my over-weight cat Wellness canned and stopped all other foods including any dry.  No more vomiting, no more shedding like crazy, no more begging for food all day long and waking me up in the night.  She's lost a little bit (not much), but she looks great and I have not stepped in a pile of vomit in months.<br />Love this food!!

review/summary: The recipe or ingredient quality has changed (?)
review/text: I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own.  We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food.  We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food.  The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them!  I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients.  It makes no sense.  More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either.  The hunt is on to find the next "great food"...

review/text: My cats ADORE this cat food, they cannot eat it quick enough. And, I hate to admit it, but the pleasant smell and lack of by-products tickled my curious side as well. I have eaten this cat food on more than one occasion, and it is actually pretty good. I find myself nibbling whenever I run out of people food or just feel like sharing a meal with my cats.

review/summary: So Far, So Good.....
review/text: Since I got this for my elderly, frail cat who turns up her nose at a lot of canned food, I guess I'll rely on her judgment for the review.  She thinks it's pretty good.  I bought a case without her even trying it (didn't have at my local pet store) by reading testimonials about it on different sites and because she'll usually eat something with chicken.  I like that nutritionally, it looked like a very high quality, digestible cat food. It worked out, as she's eating it.  Hopefully, it will even help her put on a little weight, but just the fact she likes it and isn't throwing it up is a big plus.  I think getting it on Amazon is the way to go because cheaper AND got delivered quickly and free shipping.

review/summary: No more inisulin
review/text: Our cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  Our vet prescribed 5 units of insulin.  He was supposed to have his blood checked at the vet's once a month and we were to buy their expensive high protein, high fiber kibbles.  I went on the net and found a book here on Amazon written by Elizabeth M. Hodgkins (she is a vet and an attorney) called Your Cat: New Secrets to a Longer Stronger life.  She recommended home testing, which we did morning and night for about a month, and only fed him Wellness cat food because she said a diabetic cat needs a canned high protein food with no grains and absolutely no kibbles.  We are now testing him once a week and only feeding him Wellness Adult Chicken Canned Cat Food  He has been off insulin with normal blood sugar readings for a little over two months!

review/summary: Wellness is a great grain-free option
review/text: I agree with Lizzie.  :)<br /><br />I purchase cases of the 12.5 ounce cans for my cats at the local mom and pop pet supply store.  It is the only brand that they consistently will eat that is grain free.  I have two cats that only eat wet food and use one 12.5 ounce can per day.  It's a great bargain compared to the smaller cans.  I would purchase it online if the cost with shipping was closer to what I pay at the local store.<br /><br />If you're trying to go GRAIN FREE or at least ALL WET FOOD for your kitties, do try Wellness.  I have tried nearly every type of grain free or lower grain or organic/natural canned cat food there is available; while my cats will eat some of the other stuff sometimes, they like Wellness the best.  I only feed them the plain Turkey and Chicken flavors, since they usually don't do too well with beef or seafood.<br /><br />(Note:  by grain free I mean no corn, wheat, or soy.  If you look at the ingredient list, there are sweet potatoes and other vegetables/fruits, so it is not just protein.)<br /><br />GO GRAIN FREE!  It's better for the kitties.<br />My 12 and 13 year old cats are shinier, healthier, and more active now that they've changed to this diet over the last year.  My fat cat lost weight and no longer has flaky skin.  They only throw up hairballs now instead of the frequent "other" vomits before.  And the diarrhea that was plaguing one cat for the previous two years has completely ended.  Solid, regular poops - believe me, it's a relief (yes, I know it's gross to talk about, but it's true!).<br /><br />I may take the final step to RAW DIET for them... haven't decided yet.  But at least I know on this food they are thriving.

Although the risk for thiamine deficiency is remote, the company is taking the extra precaution of voluntarily removing these products from store shelves and asking customers to return any of the affected lots. The company has also taken additional steps in their manufacturing process to ensure that this does not happen again.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have been feeding Wellness for years.

review/summary: Objective & Subjective (from a particular buyer)
review/text: This review is for the 24 pack of 3 Oz. cans of the Wellness Brand Cat Food.<br /><br />Objectively speaking...<br />The cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />Subjectively speaking...<br />I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.  Be good to yourself and your pets!

review/summary: Worth Every Penny - Wellness CORE dry and Wellness Grain Free canned
review/text: Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to "getting older" or her "hairball sensitivity" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br /><br />I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man.

review/summary: Kittens go nuts for this!
review/text: I recently adopted two 8 week old kittens.  Their "foster mother" had been feeding them Wellness Canned for Kittens, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CE77Q">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Flavor, 6 Pound Bag</a>, so I decided to keep this consistent.  Also, the information the foster mother gave me on what I had thought was high quality cat food (Iams, Purina One, Science Diet) completely changed my outlook.  There is no way I would ever feed that garbage to any of my pets again.<br /><br />My kittens go crazy when I feed them the Wellness twice a day.  Their desperate meows almost sound like gasps - so cute.  I don't want them to become solely dependent on canned, so I will continue to provide them with dry food, too.  (Although, I plan to replace Chicken Soup with a higher quality, grain-free dry brand, like Orijen or Evo.)  And when the kittens are old enough, I will transition them to Wellness canned for adults.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, there's probably a good chance you already know all about cat nutrition (the issues with by-products, brewers rice, corn, some grains, etc.)  For anyone else, I would encourage you to read the nutritional information on various brands at Pet Food Ratings dot Net.  You will never look at cat food the same.<br /><br />***Update October 2012***: Since my original review, I have tried two other kinds of Wellness canned foods - sliced chicken (in the 3 oz. can) and turkey (12.5 oz. cans).  They love both.  Because the 12 oz. cans are much more economical on a per ounce basis, I am going to stick with this size.  (Tip - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ARWTA">Ethical 3-1/2-Inch Pet Food Can Covers, 3-Pack</a> fit perfectly on the 12.5 oz. cans, and other reviewers have stated that they fit on the 5.5 oz can.  They are too large for the 3 oz. cans, however.)<br /><br />I continue to feed a combination of both wet and dry food.  As I mentioned above, I wanted to switch to a grain-free dry food.  I selected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BOVE54">Wellness Grain-Free Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats & Kittens, CORE Original Fish & Fowl Recipe, 12 lb. Bag</a>, and my cats love it.

review/summary: The best cat food on the planet
review/text: I have a seven year old gray tabby named Buddy.  I got him when he was three.  He is a very large cat, as the vet has a target weight for him at 18 pounds.  Unfortunately, he has been over 20 pounds since I got him.  While he is not fat, he is definitely in need of shedding a couple of pounds.<br /><br />I had always fed him dry cat food.  He was regularly eating Hill's Science Diet when I got him, and I was reluctant to change.  I thought that some of his minor health problems were just a part of having a cat around.  He tended to cough up massive hairballs, he would vomit stomach bile if he wasn't fed for more than a few hours, and his shedding was ridiculously constant.<br /><br />About six months ago, my vet recommended that I switch to canned food in an effor to keep his weight under control.  I quickly went out and bought a bunch of Hills Science Diet canned food, and he didn't like it very much. So I started to do a bit of research on what was the best food available for cats, and I was amazed at what I found.<br /><br />My research led me to Wellness, and I haven't looked back.  My cat has been eating mostly Wellness now for about three months.  No more hairballs.  No more stomach bile.  His shedding has been reduced drastically.  I have also noticed that his litter box doesn't smell nearly as bad, which I assume is the result of him not being chornically dehydrated from the dry food.  I've also noticed that he doesn't strain as hard to pass stool, which I'm sure he'd appreciate if he understood why.  But the most obvious change is my lethargic and overweight cat now jumps and runs around the house like he's lost three years in age, and he has indeed lost three pounds.  He was at the vet's target weight within a month of starting to eat Wellness, and he has maintained that weight for the past two months.<br /><br />The most important question, though, is how does he feel about it?  He loves it.  When I was feeding him Hill's, I would have to clean his bowl every time I fed him because he would leave pieces stuck to the side that would dry out like oatmeal.  With Wellness, he licks his bowl completely clean purring very loudly while he does it.  His favorite flavor is the chicken and salmon, but I can't stand the smell of the seafood.  So he gets his second favorite, chicken and beef.  He's not a big fan of the poultry only flavors, but he still likes them better than the Hill's he used to have to eat.<br /><br />A few days ago, I actually ran out of Wellness, and I fed him a can of Hill's to get by for the night until I could go buy more.  At 5:00 AM, I would up to the sound of my cat puking up stomach bile.<br /><br />From now on, it's Wellness or nothing.

review/summary: cats love it, and it's good for them.
review/text: Our little monster, Gary, had problems when he was a kitten. When we rescued him he had flea anemia so bad that he had to have a blood transfusion. His intestines never fully developed and he alternated diarrhea and severe constipation his entire life. We were giving him laxatone and lactulose 2x a day. When he recently had a severe bout of diarrhea and a possible UTI, the vet prescribed Hills Science diet c/d. What a crock that stuff is! I did my own research (and I encourage you to do the same) and found that cats should get their water from their food. The Wellness canned food I feed my cats now has 78% water. After feeding them Wellness for three weeks, little Gary is off the meds he's been taking for three years, and our other cat Sugar has lost weight and is much more active. Neither of them drink hardly any water from their bowls anymore, which scared me a little at first, but is apparently normal and good. Gary has only had a few problems since the switch. Yes, the food is expensive, but we're saving money on vet bills and not having to buy prescriptions anymore. I am more than thrilled with the Wellness canned chicken cat food!

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: My Cats Love It
review/text: I alternate between buying this and Newman's Own brand cat food.  I appreciate that the primary ingredients in Wellness are actually meat rather than filler like "Chicken Meal" or other ingredients that are not as good for cats.<br /><br />I have one cat who eats anything and another that is very picky -- both love this food.  However, I have never fed either of them especially junky foods so they may just not know what they are missing.

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: I recently purchased 5 cases of Wellness cat food and the cans arrived at my home in their securely wrapped cases all dented up.  One of my cats is turning her nose up at this food - she pigged-out on this food when I brought it home from the local pet food store.  These cans, if they were sitting on a store shelf, would not be purchased and I feel that National Pet Pharmacy is taking advantage of online orders to get rid of canned food that would otherwise not sell.

review/summary: great for food allergies
review/text: I used to feed my two cats Meow Mix dry food and give them a can of Fancy Feast as a treat when I came home from work.  My male cat started throwing up after he'd eat... it was nasty!  I took him to the vet and she said most likely a food allergy and to put him on Wellness single protein canned food.  It's worked great... he loves it and rarely throws up anymore aside from the occasional hairball.  His sister will only eat dry food so I switched her to Wellness dry and she loves it as well.
