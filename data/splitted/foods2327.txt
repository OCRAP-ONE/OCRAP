review/summary: Heavenly...
review/text: Mildly jasmine, the overall taste is similar to silky honey, if that makes sense.<br />Following the directions, I brewed two cups in my trusty French press.  I drank the first cup hot, and found it to be rather relaxing.  The jasmine notes were not overpowering, but just enough.  And it smells wonderful.  I found it to be quiet calming.  (This, in itself is a feat as I was in the office, surrounded by stupidity.)  By the time I'd gotten to the second cup, the tea has cooled somewhat.  I expected it to be a little bitter, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not.  And the second cup was just as clear as the first.<br /><br />This jasmine lends a mild sweetness to the tea.  If you are one to add sweeteners, you may find that you don't need as much as you are accustomed to, it any at all.<br /><br />Additionally, the packaging provides more than adequate protection for transit and storage.

review/text: The tea is of excellent quality and is packaged with great care.  I like it but I prefer the more bitter black or even green tea.  I adore the scent of jasmine in the air when I'm out walking and pass a flowering plant so I thought I might enjoy it in my tea too.  I don't dislike it, I just prefer unflavored green or black tea.

review/summary: Very mellow , very nice
review/text: When I saw this white organic tea, I had to try it. The tea is smoother and a bit sweeter than green or black tea, which is a plus for because I do not put sugar or milk in my tea.  The tea has organic lavender which adds a floral note to the tea. I probably would have preferred this tea without the lavender since, after one cup the lavender starts to become too much for my taste. Still, I highly recommend you try this tea.  Remember, this is loose tea, no bags. Tea bags are usually just  powdered tea leaves. When you enter the world of loose tea, you are entering another dimension of tea drinking. If you are just starting to drink loose tea or want to start. This tea might be a good option or you can try some of the other Rishi teas. They are all pretty good. Also, pick up a good tea pot like  the Copco Ceramic Tea Pot With Stainless-Steel Lid and Infuser available on AZ.<br /><br />Update: I have been brewing this white tea with some Rishi black tea. I put just a pinch of white tea with a teaspoon of black tea. The combination is most excellent.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I would prefer if they didn't include the Jasmine flowers, the slightly flowery aroma doesn't appeal to me.  Otherwise this is an excellent tea.  The taste is good and as it says, it is not bitter.  The flavor is not really "mild". (some teas have tasted like warm water, this tea definitely has flavor and brews surprisingly dark)<br /><br />With this type of high quality tea, I do recommend following the brewing directions exactly (185 degree water, 4 to 5 minutes steep time).<br /><br />I use purified water to make this, and add some honey, a half dozen drops of lemon juice and a quarter teaspoon of vitamin C.  The result is excellent.

I was really looking forward to trying this tea but found it disappointing.<br /><br />The jasmine is so strong that I found it overpowering.

review/summary: Still not sure why they add Jasmine...
review/text: First, the positives:<br /><br />- Very well packaged, with two caps to keep air and light out.<br />- Seems like a high quality white tea from its appearance.<br />- A pleansant, enjoyable tea<br /><br />But, after all that, I'm not sure why they add Jasmine to this.<br /><br />The point of a high quality single source tea, is to enjoy the unique flavor of that tea.<br /><br />Instead, it is totally drowned out by the strong flavor of Jasmine.  I don't mind Jasmine, in fact I sometimes order Jasmine tea at Chinese restaurants.  But that is always added to a relatively average oolong tea base.<br /><br />So, there is no point to using a very expensive and unusual white tea, if you are going to drown it in Jasmine.<br /><br />Yes, white tea has health benefits, but so does green tea, oolong tea, and black tea.<br /><br />White tea has a very nice flavor, so don't drown it out.<br /><br />While I love strawberries, I would not want the juice of fresh strawberries added to 1982 Lafite Rothschild wine.  That is what this is like.  I don't know how marketing guys come up with these ideas...

review/summary: I'm a tea snob, and this tea is just subpar.
review/text: When I had this tea I was just coming off of a bad case of food poisoning, so basically all bad flavors were inhanced and all good flavors were down played.<br /><br />  The key thing about any good tea is the grade of the tea.  Most bagged teas have dust in them, which is the lowest grade of tea possible, and explains why most bagged tea is bitter and is akin to having manure in a cup.  Of course over steeping your tea will also account for a bitter taste, but all you need to know is that most green teas are about 3 minutes, black teas are about 3 and a 1/2, white is about 3, and herbals really can be just about any legnth of time depending on the potency you want for your herbal.  Although, usually I steep herbals for 4 minutes.  This is of course measuring by the teaspoon, and you measure a teaspoon per cup (of tea, not water).  A cup is measure by a traditional tea cup which is somewhere near six ounces usually.<br /><br />  White teas are meant to be subtle, if you want a strong tea, drink black, probably along the lines of assam, or maybe a nice darjeeling.  So, kep this is mind with this tea, the point is a nice subtle flavor that is almost like drinking a lightly flavored water.  So you may ask, why am I drinking a subtle tea when I can't taste well?  Because I know that if it is bad quality tea, the bad quality will truly show, since I could only really taste bad flavors at te time.<br /><br />  When I drank the tea, I thought the bitter taste was just me until my friend (female) told me that hers was just as bitter, and then we deduced that the grade of the tea was very low.  This is pretty common with companies that mass produce tea in stores.  There are a lot of companies that mass produce tea and they taste great, but most of the companies are mail order or online ordering only, companies like Mark T. Wendel or The Cultured Cup, which has one of the most delightful teas ever, Wedding Imperial.<br /><br />  I love white tea and Jasmine so this tea was a huge disapointment, although not entirely unexpected.  The Jasmine taste was lovely, but was lost because of the overall bitterness of the white tea, a great shame when it comes to white tea.  Organic does not always mean great because it is all about quality when it comes to tea.  Organic usually means better, but not in this case.  And no, I did not burn the tea, I brought my water to a steam and only steaped it for 3 minutes rather then the reccomended 4.  However, this tea was very delicious with peach tea.  A combination another one of my friends (male) who hates white tea came up with.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

review/text: I really enjoyed this fresh fragrant Jasmine White tea for what it was, but I would never personally spend so much for it.<br /><br />Perhaps I am not enough of a connoisseur to fully appreciate the subtle differences between this and other Jasmine teas I have also enjoyed.  Maybe I am just a cheapskate, but I can't justify buying something 4-5 times more expensive for a moderate increase in (discernible) quality.  My star rating is based on cost averaged against taste. Cost= 2stars taste= 4stars

review/text: I have Crohn's disease and eat an almost entirely starch- and sugar-free diet (which does wonders for the Crohn's). As my gut healed I began reading about how the sprouting of flours breaks down the starches in the flours. I decided to see if I could tolerate it. That was a year-and-a-half ago. I now regularly use this flour from this company (usually with a sourdough starter, and often with almond flour added) for pancakes, waffles, pizza crusts and sourdough bread, periodically. It tastes great and IS much easier to digest than normal wheat flour, which I simply can't eat anymore. Spelt, not incidentally, is somewhat lower in gluten than regular wheat flour also.

review/summary: Decent taste - 5 servings per box
review/text: I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says: "10 bars" below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).

review/summary: Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me
review/text: I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.

review/summary: Low. Low. I repeat: Low.
review/text: I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2" wide, 4" long, and 1/4" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very filling
review/text: I am a huge fan of Clif products, and consume them almost daily. My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar. Granted, these are lower in calories than the normal bar, but they just don't seem to cut it if I want a quick snack that will fill me up.<br /><br />Another product I have used that is about the same nutritional content as the Crunch Bar, but seems to satisfy my hunger better, are the standard Nature Valley Granola bars. I will keep buying Clif products, but these Clif Crunch Bars will likely not make it back onto my shopping list anytime soon.

review/summary: Overpriced! Not what you are expecting.
review/text: My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). "10 bars" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is "5 two count packages". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the "Pack of 2" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn.

review/text: These bars come two in a package (and two to a serving size!) and are absolutely delicious.  They are crunchy and rich. The peanut butter bars taste like they are made with actual peanut butter holding the grains together.  The white chocolate macadamia nut bars have little pieces of soy white chocolate in the bars and you can taste them when you bite in.  These bars can keep me full for a while and are a great snack.  Appropriate for a plant based diet.

review/text: I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

Anyway, these are highly recommended if you want a delicious crunchy peanut butter granola bar that just happens to have all the nutrition we've come to expect from CLIF. Yum-O!

review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bars
review/text: My grandson, who is in special forces training in the Air Force requested these.  Needs a lot of protein for his training.  Asked me not to send cookies or junk food.  Wanted these instead.  Lots easier than cooking, packaging, and trips to the post office.<br />He said his favorite is the Blueberry bars.

review/summary: Clif Crunch Bar
review/text: I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut. However, when I bought them I wasn't expecting them to be quite so messy. They are definitely crunchy, and you will get crumbs everywhere - so keep that in mind. Otherwise I love the things! I'm a college student so this is a good breakfast or snack on my walk to class.

review/summary: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.....
review/text: The "healthiness" is great, as are most CLIF products.<br />The price, even with subscribe and save is way too high.<br />There is not much difference from just buying regular granola bars<br />There are only 5 packages in each box (with 2 smaller bars in each)<br />I always wonder why they make such big boxes and only put a few items in the box....who only eats 5 granola bars?

review/text: First off let me say that I've been a fan of Clif bars for a while now. So I saw these at my local grocery store and decided to give them a whirl.<br /><br />WOW! Just wow! These take exactly like crunchy chocolate chip cookies. They are absolutely delicious. I find myself craving these now instead of brownies or a candy bar. I was actually eating them in class one day and a few people tried them and now are also obsessed. Great product and completely yummy!

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

No high fructose corn syrup, a big plus.  They do have "evaporated cane juice" as the sweetener.  I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

review/text: These are great olives.  Wonderful quality.  The flesh is firm and the olives whole with a great subtle flavor.  They are the perfect size for a snack or lunch time. They have very little liquid in the package so there is no mess.  They are also only 100 calories with quite a few olives.  I love the fact they are making more snacks foods in these 100 calorie packs.  Not everyone has a weakness for sweet things.  So these help me with portion control and they are just great to grab on the go.  They might seem a little pricey, but they are very good quality and also very convenient.

For that, I'll stick to packing 15 olives into a small plastic container.

review/summary: RYE IS NOT GLUTEN FREE!
review/text: This bread and its brand may be tasty, but this product should not be advertised on Amazon under the "gluten free" items heading.<br /><br />Rye is a member of the wheat grain family and does contain gluten. Though this gluten ppm (parts per million) is relatively low in comparison to wheat, it is still high enough to cause intestinal damage to a person with celiac disease.<br /><br />Remember: Celiac is not simply an allergy or a food preference. Celiac is a full-blown intolerance and inability to process the compound gluten. When a celiac person ingests gluten, it is going to cause damage to the villi in the small intestine, no matter how small an amount of gluten is present.<br /><br />Amazon, please remove from the GF products category. Advertising this bread as GF poses a health risk for those with celiac.
