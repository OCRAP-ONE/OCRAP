review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: If you are familiar with Lapsang Souchong tea and like it you should consider this one.  It is a little lighter and smoother than some other versions of this type of tea and I like it very much.  If you have never tried Lapsang you should try a cup at a local tea shop before buying.  Lapsang has a smokey rosin sort of favor and is something of an acquired taste.  For those of us who like it, however, there is no substitute.

review/summary: Single Malt and Cigars.
review/text: Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.<br /><br />This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the "single malt and cigars" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it.

review/summary: A good lapsang souchong
review/text: I've had Twinings Lapsang Souchang and now Taylors Lapsang Souchang.  They're both very nice teas and aren't noticeably different (unless you perhaps drink them side by side).  If you've not had Lapsang Souchang before, the concept is a bit like Earl Grey, only instead of that sort of earthy oil flavor it's smokey.  Not some sort of abstract smokiness like smoked salmon, but real "a forest is burning down somewhere nearby" smokey.  It is excellent with milk, and fine on its own.  I haven't had really expensive teas, so I don't know how this would compare to some of the "artisan" tea shops, but my guess is that if those are like great German beer, Taylors or Twinings are like a pretty decent English beer.<br /><br />Lapsang Souchang is also an excellent tea for coffee drinkers -- it has similar flavor characteristics of coffee, but does not have a bitter aftertaste.  Many coffee drinkers stay away from tea because it is either weak tasting or too watery -- this is definitely not weak tea, and a splash of (whole) milk will take care of the wateriness if that's a problem.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy whichever of Twinings or Taylors is cheapest.  Buying the 6-pack is a good idea because it is freakin' impossible to find lapsang souchang in stores.

review/summary: If you like a smokey tea, you'll love this Lapsang Souchong
review/text: In the world of tea, there are a few varieties that stand out like a sore thumb.  They have a very peculiar taste and probably a small subset of tea lovers partake of them.  Lapsang Souchong might very well be at the top of the list.<br /><br />Prior to this tea, I had sampled a few other brands and never really liked Lapsang Souchong.  For those who don't like it, you'd probably be inclined to describe it as a brew of burnt rubber or factory soot, with just a hint of campfire.  Not something you'd be craving to try again.<br /><br />Well, on a lark I decided to try Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong, and I'm very glad I did.  Taylors got it RIGHT.  This tea is very smooth and has a pleasant smokey aroma and taste.  You really have to stretch your imagination to conjure up thoughts of burnt rubber when sipping ANY Lapsang Souchong tea, and why would you want to when you can really enjoy it?  Comparatively, this tea is better than Twinings.  I have both and tried them side by side.  There was no contest--Taylors won.<br /><br />So, if you have already tried Lapsang Souchong and haven't quite found a version that suits you, look no further.  You've found it with Taylors.  :-)

review/text: I like to consider myself a connoisseur in teas and this is by far one of the WORST blends I have ever had the misfortune to try. This blend tastes like an accumulation of old socks and sweaty feet. Lipton tea is leagues better than this garbage. I have tried the Earl Grey blend by Taylors of Harrogate and it was great; one of my favorite purchases ever. However, this blend turned out to be revolting. I bought this 2 pack, brewed one cup, took one sip and dumped out both packages straight into the trash. Awful tea, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.

review/summary: Fresh, Fast, Flavorful
review/text: Slightly disappointed by the flavor sent, it was not the pure strawberry, it was strawberry mix with a mystery flavor. We wanted the Strawberry flavor because it is what the kinds like the best and it can be hard to find in the store. It's not Amazon's fault it's all on Betty Crocker, they come up with these awful mixed flavor sets every so many months. But I do have to say this looks like very new batch of FBTF, no stale packing as one reviewer mentioned. (I only really wrote this review to let everyone know it is fresh)<br /><br />If it had not been for the mystery flavor I would give this 5 stars, we have it on subscription now hopefully the next batch will be as fresh and back to the normal flavor.

A mixture of beer, water and pinch of soap (to film the top layer with something slippery and prevent the beer from evaporating) is most effective ive found.

All because someone can't even look at their own product and determine that "Ooops, guess it should have a lid shipped with it huh?"  It would be like shipping a dvd case without the disc in it. I would strongly recommend that no one purchase any products made by this company unless you want to receive one without a lid, and go through all the trouble of shipping it back for an $8 refund.  Yes I said refund, there is no way I would give them a chance to send me another one.

This 70% chocolate is okay, but doesn't have enough chocolate flavor.  The Choco-love chocolates are milder and our family felt the 70% was too mild -- it also didn't taste as sweet as you might expect for a 70% cocoa chocolate.  We find that the 77% Chocolove has an excellent balance of mild chocolate flavor and sweetness and is our preferred Chocolove product.

review/text: I have bought this locally from a specialty grocery routinely, and compared it to many competing dark chocolate alternatives. If you will search for 'Ghana' or 'African' chocolate (considered the world's finest), most are now out of stock. This one is still available, and comes from a mix of primarily African (just outside Ghana) with some of the less expensive, but far more common, Carribean chocolate mixed in. It is like the difference between Arabica and Robusta coffee.<br /><br />It's worth noting that, although it's a shame a negative reviewer here had a bad shipping experience, these are some of the finest dark chocolate bars available that give you that explosive yet refined African taste for which chocolate lovers worldwide often pay far more.

review/text: This is the best Spanish rice I've found.  It tastes fresh and yummy by itself, or in a casserole.<br />RECIPE:  Arroz con Pollo (Use only Old El Paso Spanish Rice in a box!)<br />Boil 3-4 chicken breasts in water with 2 bay leaves and a few pepper corns.  Prepare 2 boxes of rice according to directions on box, using chicken broth plus water, if needed.  While rice is cooking, debone chicken and shred with fork.  When rice is done, add chicken, and 1/2 to 3/4 c. sour cream to rice.  Mix well.  Layer casserole pan (9 x 13) with refried beans, then add rice mixture. Top with grated cheddar cheese, and heat until cheese is melted. Serve immediately. Put your own twist on it by adding black olives, chopped green onions, jalapenos, etc.  Great with green salad.  This rice is hard to find in our area, so I've ordered it from Amazon the last couple of times I've needed it.  Thanks, Amazon, for making it available to me.

This is the biggest value for me, no lugging and no trash.  I have two extra Soda Stream bottles so I always have 3 liters of cold seltzer in the fridge.  I use the water from my fridge which is filtered so it tastes great and is cold to begin with.  The replacement cost for the CO2 seems high but I was spending about $1/liter at the store so it seems to be a wash. Would prefer the unit was a bit beefier, seems lightweight/cheap, and hopefully not poorly manufactured.  We will see how long it lasts.  I gave it 4 stars because of the high initial cost and cost of replacement CO2.  I will look to find other alternative CO2 locally.

review/summary: Not too sweet and YUMMY
review/text: Unlike many GF cereals, including other mueslis, Brookfarm's product is not sugary sweet nor does it have the taste and consistency of cardboard or bricks. It is perfectly crunchy, tasty, and filling. It's great for breakfast with or without milk or for a snack. And since it doesn't have any added sugar, it doesn't make your hands sticky when eating out of the pouch in front of your computer or in the car :-)<br /><br />There is only one problem with this product which is that Amazon cannot keep it in stock. There is usually one bag available and you need at least two of them for super saver shipping. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. It's on my top 10 list of GF foods, and since I have been a celiac since 1998, I've tasted a lot of them.

review/summary: Great Full Leaf Organic Green Tea
review/text: I've been on a cancer study diet that requires multiple cups of green tea a day ever since 1998.  During the past 11 years I've tasted a tremendous amount of brands and varieties of green tea.  Revolution's Organic Full Leaf Green Tea is by far my favorite.  It is mild, yet has a rich, slightly sweet flavor.  It's never bitter.  My youngest daughter has always told me that whole leaf teas are much more flavorful and just better in every way.  After tasting Revolution's whole leaf green tea, I'd have to agree with her.

review/summary: Best Bag Tea
review/text: Revolution Tea is one of the best bagged teas I've ever found.  The tea doesn't taste like paper and the bags they use allow the tea room to brew, so this is perfect for work or travel.  We've also taken an extreme liking to drinking iced green tea, and until I find a better tea or better way to brew, we're using our tea maker with the Revolution Tea bags.  This is the perfect green tea for this.<br /><br />Perhaps Amazon had this mislabeled at one time, but that doesn't make this an awful product.  It just means Amazon made a mistake.  This is an excellent tea and I would recommend this tea above any other bagged tea without a doubt.  I might even recommend it above most loose leaf teas.

review/summary: nylon non-recyclable tea bag - health and environmental issues
review/text: When I purchased this tea I discovered that the tea bags were not made out of paper. So I wrote the company and received this response:<br /><br />"Our tea infuser bags are made from food-grade nylon. Unfortunately, this is not compostable material. I suggest cutting the bags and releasing only the leaves for composts."<br /><br />Nylon is not biodegradable and cannot be composted. There are also health and environmental concerns related to the use of nylon. See:<br /> [...]<br /><br />I do  not believe that tea packed in a nylon tea bag should be labeled organic

review/text: It's good tea, from a good manufacturer.  However, Amazon REALLY needs to re-label this.  It is ORGANIC GREEN TEA, with no bergamot, meaning, IT IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT EARL GREY green tea.  It's just plain green tea.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back as a return, so now I have 96 bags of plain green tea to go through.<br /><br />So, if you want good organic green tea, go with this.  If you want earl grey, take heed, and don't buy this.  This was my first disappointment with Amazon.

review/text: It lacks the salt that Gorgonzola offers in its alternative version. Eating it by itself was too bland, for me. But if you smear it on a piece of toast, it is more tasty, but still not the taste of the saltier version, that I like better. It spreads well on toast. Perhaps if I ate enough of it, I could learn to appreciate it more, especially if its saltier counterpart is not available, as was the case when I bought this.

review/summary: Amazing Quick Healthy Breakfast, and Vegan!
review/text: Original Mix (I prefer this one because there is no added sugars)<br /><br />Taste:<br />In a green smoothie: Changes the texture of the smoothie just a bit, nothing too noticeable or annoying.  Also adds a different flavor to the overall smoothie that helps enhance the taste when combined with the right greens and fruits.<br /><br />With Almond milk: I am not used to eating sugars and processed foods, so this actually tastes pretty great to me. I saw some earlier reviews complaining about taste and I honestly have no problem slowly sipping on this shake as I drive to work in the morning. I have tasted some horrid protein shakes in the past and this one is delicious!<br /><br />Overall Feeling:<br /><br />I feel fantastic after having Amazing Meal in the morning. Completely clear minded and energized for the day. Even without the accompaniment of a multivitamin, this meal powder stands alone in providing a days worth of energy and clear minded thinking.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I found that I needed to get used to the added probiotic that is apart of the meal. I found myself for the first four or five days, starving only 2 hours after drinking one of these shakes. It was like I couldn't get enough food, I had to eat every two to three hours to stop the hunger. I am unsure whether it has to do with the combo of probiotic or the digestive enzyme that is added. Like I said though, after 5 days that feeling of starving all the time went away. It now fulfills me completely.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is the best meal shake I have come across thus far in my search for the perfect morning/ after workout shake. I have tried many from whole foods and other various health food stores. The fact that I have decided to actually buy another container of Amazing Meal must mean I really like it! I've been taking it for 2 weeks and, this wasn't my initial intention, but have lost 5 pounds. A nice little added bonus :)<br /><br />Highly reccomened if you are looking for a great protein/vitamin/healthy living shake. Oh and did I mention it is Alkaline based? Perfect!<br /><br />x x

review/summary: My Favorite--I LOVE this stuff
review/text: I have multiple food allergies, which makes a grab-and-go breakfast...well...not possible. I wanted a meal replacement shake because I tend not to eat during the day (way too complicated) and not eating actually helps me gain weight. I also have some other health issues--like Hashimoto's--directly related to my allergies. Food is an issue for me, and so is energy and feeling well.<br /><br />I'm not vegan, but I prefer vegan foods for their cleanliness. I can't have soy, but many vegan products are soy-free anyway. I also like whole, organic, Non-GMO foods, and while I prefer Raw, I don't mind non-raw foods, either.<br /><br />I tried several vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free shake mixes: Garden of Life, Vega, Inca Meal, RAW, etc. This is, by far, the best tasting, best "feeling" shake I've tried.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors--Chocolate is my fave, then Pomegranate (sp?) Mango and Vanilla Chai, in that order. I mix mine is a shaker cup with a little mixing ball. I use Vanilla almond milk and a little agave syrup (I hate Stevia, it tastes like saccharine to me) and sometimes I throw a little extra hemp protein in, chia seeds, and flaxseed oil. I haven't bothered with a blender yet. One day, I'll put it into a blender with some fruit.<br /><br />Let's be real: this is a whole food shake with fruits, veggies, grasses, and hemp protein. This is not a mass-market, full-of-stuff-I-can't-pronounce homogenized drink. This is real food, synthesized down to a mixable level. Dunkin Donuts it's not. So?<br /><br />Truthfully, the pure, clean, feel-good energy I get from this, plus the cleansing, tonifying, and gut-health benefits are worth chugging down a slightly earthy drink every morning. Mixed with vanilla almond milk & a little agave, I actually savor the flavor--not too sweet (sweet in the morning makes me gag) chocolatey and, well, nutritious-y.<br /><br />Try a sample packet (you can get them at your local HFS, usually) and see which flavor suits you. I don't ever like this mixed in water--its just too thin. I DO use it on oatmeal, or stirred into yogurt. This is an awesome product. I just saved $12 over what I pay at WF, plus Amazon will deliver it to me every 15 days so I'll never run out...heaven!

review/summary: Amazing Meal ORIGINAL
review/text: The other flavors of Amazing Meal sound rather yummy but they contain "Natural Flavors"  this is the only version that does not.  I even went to their website to make sure.  The addition of natural flavors is the only reason why I chose their Original over the others.<br /><br />I find the flavor is somewhat bland & absolutley is grassy!  Lately I've been mixing it with organic coconut water.  The quality of the coconut water affects just how tasty my "meal" turns out.  Sometimes I will add a few drops of organic liquid Stevia.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about this product that keeps me coming back for more.  I use Amazon's Subscribe & Save for it!  I'm not nuts about it, yet here I am drinking another glass!<br /><br />It is a quick & convenient way to get something nourishing into my body.  I find it is very refreshing.  I have never used it in a smoothie but when I do, I think it will be out of this world!  I have also mixed this with organic almond milk, organic rice milk & organic coconut milk.  The rice milk tasted the best probably because it was the sweetest.  The coconut milk was so so.  For now, I plan on sticking with the coconut water because I think it is the healthiest option & it tastes good enough for me.<br /><br />Overall this is a great way to get your greens & more in one quick "meal" though snack would be more appropriate as I don't find it filling for long.  Usually I pour a small amount of my liquid of choice into a glass, add a scoop of this (scoop is included), use a fork to stir it really good.  Then I add the rest of my liquid of choice & do lots more stirring.  I leave the fork in the glass & stir as needed because the fiber bits tend to settle on the bottom rather quickly.  Thankfully the amount that settles is substantially less than other mixes I've had.  I had a Organic Hemp protein shake that I flat out thought was disgusting & nearly all of it would settle on the bottom of the glass so fast I couldn't help but waste it! I'm sticking to Amazing Meal from now on.  Lesson learned!<br /><br />If you want to do something healthy & want to avoid all sugars & artificial sweeteners this mix is the way to go!  All Organic & GMO free!  If you are one of those sugar junkies who gets those "fast food" smoothies thinking it's healthy when it's just a sugar bomb you will surely hate this stuff.  For the rest of you health nuts lets raise a glass in good health!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised (original flavor amazing meal)
review/text: I ordered this after comparing other natural brands such as Vega as a morning and or after workout shake. Although I am still curious about VEGA, I am very pleased that I chose this product instead. I chose this product because it seemed more simple and had no artificial sweetener (including stevia in that category) --stevia hasn't been well tested and there are other drawbacks to artificial sweetener such as deceiving the body's metabolism. I also read that Vega has a lot of Inulin which is a form of fiber that I have read is Not effective and is more of a filler to make things appear high in fiber.<br />Amazing meal in original flavor--When I got it in the mail I was surprised by the small size of the plastic can, but liked the packaging; It is visually pleasing and hopefully easily recycled. It is nice to see the ingredients are grown in America. The powder itself looks green and finely ground. I smelled it and could not tell if it would be palatable. I tasted a little in water and was pleased by the mild earthy taste. I then shook some in a blender bottle with ice and unsweetened soy milk. I was very relieved to find this expensive powder was not only palatable but tasted GOOD (to me). I am one of those people who are Used to the taste of natural foods. I could see myself adding a little honey to enrich the flavor. There is some granular-ness (not exactly gritty)  to the consistency, it is not all uniform, but this did not bother me. I was expecting a "grassy" taste as cued by other reviewers but I would call it more of a wheat, nutty flavor.  I am very happy with this purchase and will purchase this again if it manages to easily incorporate into my lifestyle. I would like it to be cheaper but I am ok with the quality and price. I bought it on the SUPER SAVER discount for a reduced price for regular shipments. Doing this is easy to cancel if you decide you don't like it.

review/summary: much better ingredients than listed in Amazon's blurb
review/text: This is a review of the pomegranate/mango infusion version.<br /><br />The product ingredients are much better than what appears in Amazon's product blurb.  The blurb makes it sound like it's sugar (cane juice) with pomegranate and mango added.<br /><br />In fact the ingredients are:<br />(1- proteins) Organic rice protein, organic hemp protein: 15,000mg<br />(2- greens) Organic wheat grass, organic kale, organic barley grass, organic alfalfa: 3,100mg<br />(3-antioxidants) Organic acai, organic carrot, organic blueberry, organic goji, Organic rose hips, organic maca, organic banana: 2,800mg<br />(4-other healthy stuff) Organic flax seed powder: 500mg, plus a small amount of probiotics<br />(5-other not-necessarily-healthy stuff) Organic cane juice, organic guar gum, natural flavors<br /><br />This is a good product to try if you want to get some of the benefits of wheat grass, kale, barley grass, etc. but tend to gag on the grass powders.  You won't gag on this.<br /><br />If you want to work up to the wheat grass, just add a little bit of that to a big scoop of this pomegranate/mango infusion and then work your way up.<br /><br />I add this to my dogs' food as a supplement.  They all love this pomegranate/mango taste.  This one lingers on their breath and makes them smell really good for a couple of hours after eating.

review/text: Ordered this item as I am trying to eat more healthy. Was very skeptical at first coz of all  the reviews on the taste but I thought that I would give it a shot. I ordered the Mango Pomegranate Infusion and was not disappointed. It is green alright and looked like swamp water, but it has a good flavor to it ( I mixed it with water to avoid extra calories ). The consistency is not too thick or grainy either. I prefer this more than the other green stuff I had in the past. I think that I will continue drinking it once a day from now on. Hopefully it will do what it claims or your health<br /><br />Update; so today 1/22/12 is my second day drinking this swamp water looking thing and I have to say that I like it even more. It has a flavor, but just a hint..a note of fruit flavor in it which is why I like. It is not heavily sweetened and not over powering. If you are expecting a strong fruit flavor to cover up the green, then look elsewhere. For me, I really like it.<br /><br />One month later,2/20/12, I can feel that I am in a very healthy stage of my life. Not to mention that it makes me not want to drink alcohol (which is good), but I believe that it was the reason why my root canal healed in less than two days after surgery. I had surgery on my front tooth (#25) treating my root canal @ 1pm Monday afternoon. And by Tuesday night, I was off pain Jed's and munching on popcorn! Not to mention that I had no swelling at all. What else can it be if not all the nutrients I am getting in addition if my food onus motion. I have moved on to the chocolate flavor and mix it with almond milk and one banana. It is it so good

review/summary: One busy lady's best breakfast ever
review/text: I can not say enough good stuff about this protein shake.  I scoop it into my blender ball in the morning shake and drink.  The whole process take 1 minute and I'm not hungry again until lunch time!  It tastes great, sort of like gazpacho and It could not be more important to get enough leafy green veggies in anywhere we can! At less than $3.00 a shake, it is also a great price to pay for a quick nutritious no fuss breakfast that leaves you no clean up.

review/summary: Tasty, Filling, Healthy
review/text: I tried all 3 flavors of amazing meal. I didn't like the vanilla chai (unless a big squeeze of chocolate syrup was added). I did like the chocolate and the mango one. I mix them with almond/coconut milk in a shaker cup, and take it in the car for an easy breakfast.  It's a little gritty (I've never tried anything other than w/ a simple shaker cup), but it's not chalky. As long as your expectations are in line with what this is (raw, vegan, etc and NOT a chocolate milk shake from the ice cream shop), it's a good meal replacement shake.

review/summary: Unbelievable Product
review/text: This is my first amazon review - I had to write about this product because I cannot believe how great it really is. Initially it was a little odd to take down - it mixes in green to water and has a "different" taste, but no aftertaste like many of these products. I took it for a few days and I cannot believe how I FEEL on this. Its not just energy, its just a good feeling that comes over me the entire day after downing this stuff in the morning. I was just sitting at work wondering why I was feeling so good and what I was doing that was different, and then it came to me. They have single serving packs they sell at whole foods. I bought them all. I dont know what it is about the combination of ingredients in this product, but its truly amazing. It doesnt just elevate your energy, it elevates your mood and your very being. Try it and see. You get used to the taste and ive had MUCH more offensive stuff. 5 stars all the way

review/summary: Good Breakfast Option
review/text: After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous about how this product would taste, but I found that when mixed with fruit and ice in the food processor it wasn't so bad. That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism. Overall, I like this shake as an option for breakfast it provides nutrients without weighing me down and tends to make me want to eat throughout the day, which is good for me because otherwise I wouldn't.

review/summary: New to Nutrition---Uhh Newtrition?
review/text: So basically I realized about 3 weeks ago that I hadn't eaten anything but sandwiches, burgers, or fast food, for as long as I could actually remember. I'm 22 and absolutely have not been eating my vegetables. I'm not overweight, because I don't really eat very much, maybe 2 meals a day, but I wanted to make sure I was healthy and nutritious. I started taking a Multi-V (GNC Men's Energy) but needed to it with food, and I normally do not eat breakfast, so I found Amazing Meal.<br /><br />This certainly, by no means, tastes like pomegranate or mango. Get that thought out of your head now and you'll be much better off. It tastes like hay/magic mushrooms with an undefinable whiff of fruitiness (not sweet).<br /><br />To get this down easiest, I mix a half scoop of the powder with a small amount of water, maybe 1 cup. I stir it up until it is very dark colored but not sludgy. I chug that down followed by some clean water. Not to bad. Then I take a quarter scoop of the powder and make a smoothie (frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, and 2 teaspoons of coconut oil (I'm working slowly up to 2 tablespoons)).<br /><br />That's my breakfast. I also take 1 Alpha Brain each day and 2 ShroomTech Immune every other day. It is completely night and day from when I ate unhealthy and didn't take any nutrients. Just three weeks ago. Pretty nuts.

review/text: First of all I was very surprised to get this so fast. I just ordered it yesterday and it was at my doorstep before 11 am. ( which never happens) anyway I opened it and had a serving and was shocked that it tasted pretty good. Now for those who have tried vegan drinks you know that they are not always the best tasting thing but this is definitely one of the better drinks I have had. I will be reordering this and I will now try the other flavors and hope they are as good as this one.

I ran out of my amazing grass for a week or so and did not know at to do with myself, I love the stuff. I use it as a meal replacement and I do believe it makes me feel great! I have to eat on the go alot and this fills me up and keeps my energy levels up so i dont feel hypo-glycemic. Lost a few pounds too! cant argue with that! I mix it with half water(mixes better) and vanilla or chocolate almond milk and its a great healthy alternative to a fast food meal, and I'm begining to think food is over-rated anyway.

I LOVE the chocolate flavor. So now that I have a winner, every morning I make a smoothie with plain soy milk, 3 ice cubes, 3 frozen strawberries,throw in some blueberries, half a banana (or whatever fruit I have), some water and a scoop of the chocolate Amazing Grass and drink it during my commute. I feel great, have more energy and honestly, it keeps me regular!

review/summary: Easy on the stomach
review/text: Atleast for me it is. I have tried many meal replacements over the years and so far could not find any that were easy to digest. Eating food is even difficult for me with how my health is and after trying chocolate infusuion a year ago I quickly fell in love.<br />I can honestly say that this does NOT taste like grass. It has a very bold and delicious chocolate flavor. Mix it with some lightly sweetened vanilla almond milk and its more than flavorful! I admit if you just shake up or mix it in a cup it will be a little lumpy or grainy but I love the texture. My husband always puts it in a blender which makes the consistency like a thin milkshake, especially if you add blueberries which I highly recommend.I Drink it every morning and it holds me over for 3-4 hours depending if I eat fruit or something along with it. Dont care much for the other flavors but still need to try the chai vanilla.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I used this in a smoothie and my son and I loved it. It is not just a meal replacement or energy/vitamin drink it is made from whole super foods, which means it is extremely good for you. I wouldn't compare it to something from GNC that isn't superfood based. Buying whole food vitamins is very costly, and this is a good cost for what is delivered, without having to take mounds of large pills to get the same result. We are not completely vegetarian, but we do not eat red meat, and we do not eat fast and junk food. We only eat real food, but even then it is easy to favor certain items over others. I wanted something to balance my diet and hopefully improve my over-all nutrition. Will be buying more, and continuing to improve the health of my family with items like this. Next stop... super mushrooms!

review/summary: It is an amazing meal
review/text: Pros - Good clean energy that does not make me instantly sleepy or wear out after an hour.<br /><br />Cons - The biggest hurdle with this stuff is getting it blended into anything.  It is very stubborn and likes to form chunks.  The taste is weird and texture is like drinking wet sand.<br /><br />The energy boost was enough to drive me into several weeks of experimentation.  My best advice is to put this into a smoothie or milkshake of some sort.  It will be a gritty smoothie but still better than attempting to drink it in water or milk.  I have also baked it into cookies which worked out really well.  Strangely enough it levels off the initial sugar rush you'd get from the cookies and you don't experience a crash afterwards.<br /><br />It is interesting stuff to experiment with for sure.  I'll definitely keep using it for quick meals.

review/summary: Tasty Way to Get Your Veggies and Vegan Protein
review/text: I usually make my own green smoothies at home.  But for work and travel, need a more easy alternative.  I've tried a LOT of commercial "green" powder and most tasty seriously nasty and a few are tolerable but nothing to write home about.  This is by far my most favorable flavor and product.  I get all my serving of greens and also a great source of protein (better than yogurt and equal to some protein bars).  This is what I have for breakfast every morning.  I leave the can in the office and just mix it with water.  When I travel, I take the individual travel packs with me.  I can actually say this product is tasty, but like all protein powder, it does has that gritty protein powder texture.  But if you're used to protein powders, this should be familiar.  Other than the grittiness, it tastes like a light chocolate shake (if you use soy or almond milk, texture will be thicker). I sometimes do juice but usually just water. I've tried the other flavors and they don't taste as good, at least for me.

I have had many other protein drinks but have not found any to be as good as this. If I could give this ten stars, I would.<br /><br />It is September 16, 2012 and I am amending this review. I am buying this Amazing Grass by the truckload, still love it and I am also adding something called Protein<br />Greens by Orac-Energy. I also add a table spoon of Whole Husk Psyllium purchased here on Amazon which works very well and also thickens the drink. The strong chocolate flavor hides the taste from those two products I add. It all makes for a fantastic breakfast.

review/summary: Best Meal Drink Powder Mix I Have Tried
review/text: I have tried several meal replacement products, and make note that Amazing Grass has this Amazing Meal and also a SuperFood drink powder that looks similar and the same flavors, so I am not sure what the difference actually is, but the word "Meal" in the title meant to me that it was more likely what I was looking for than just a supplement powder. Anyway, the whole family got on a health kick after Mom got cancer and we tried to find the healthiest yet easiest to stick with supplements. After learning of the incredible benefits of wheat grass and the other ingredients in this mix (and yes I know you don't get the full benefit of the wheat grass unless it is freshly cut, juiced and immediately ingested), I decided to give this a try.  Although it doesn't keep me from being hungry for more than a few hours, that is with any typical meal that is intended for small portions anyway, it is very satisfying both with substance and taste. My suggested blending one full scoop of the powder with either 10 ounces of Almond, rice, flax or soy milk (or combination), and then one packet of stevia (I personally use Sweet Leaf) and blend with 1/2 cup or so of ice. Any more ice and the consistency is not liquid enough to drink without letting melt or watering down with more milk. I have found the small bit of stevia removes a lot of the in your face grass taste some others have mentioned, and I truly enjoy drinking this rather than having to slam down something I don't enjoy just to get the benefits.

review/text: My doctor recently suggested that I try going Gluten Free to possibly alleviate some of the allergy and sinus issues I have been experiencing the past six months or so. So I've been looking for easier ways to get all the nutrition I need without having to spend a ton of time and money. I found this product and after checking out the ingredients, I decided to give it a try. I know some of the reviews complain about the taste or consistency of the product, but I ordered this knowing that it probably wasn't going to taste like a McDonald's milkshake. I've only been using it for a couple of days now and only with water, but so far I'm enjoying it. Yes, it's a little grainy but I suspect if I mix it with coconut milk or greek yogurt, it wouldn't be as evident. The taste is pretty much what I expected, earthy and wholesome. I've been living without sugar or sweeteners for years so I find it pleasant. I will definitely be reordering this or perhaps one of the other flavors/varieties offered by Amazing Grass.

It made me feel good about eating chocolate flavored food. I got a small packet of it to try first. You might want to do the same if you have a whole foods, or mrs greens around you. I will be purchasing this big tub within the week! It's important to me that this is gluten free too because I'm discovering just how sensitive to it I am by avoiding it for the time being and I can share it with my mother and my gluten sensitive friends!

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: The other flavors are okay, but the chocolate flavor is my favorite.  The taste is much better too.  All I add is milk, 1/2 banana, 3 ice cubes.  Really good!

review/text: I found this in a local health food store and was very pleased with the product.  The ability to save money by setting up repeated delivery was all the incentive I needed.  This is a great way to purchase regularly used health products.

review/summary: Great Meal Replacement Supplement
review/text: We use this in a smoothie mix as a meal replacement. The taste is good and mild, not as strong of an after taste as egg or soy protein and the texture is smooth, not blended.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought a single serving pouch to try (on sale) and liked it enough to buy a tub.  For whatever reason the single serving (pouch) seemed tastier (and gave me some 'pep') while the stuff in the tub didn't seem quite as 'chocolaty' (and I didn't notice much if any 'pep').  Kinda made me wonder if the single servings aren't made a little different but it's possible for different batches to vary in taste and effect.<br /><br />Regardless, I like it a lot. From both a nutritional and taste perspective I don't think Amazing Meal can be beat.  I don't eat nearly as much fruits and vegetables as I'd like so I really appreciate the punch of nutrients Amazing Meal packs.<br /><br />I think Amazing Grass has done an awesome job of taking a huge amount of healthy ingredients and turning them into something that tastes, if not good, at least not bad (try putting a scoop of dried greens in your breakfast drink and see how that tastes - this is WAY better!).  I don't find the taste of Amazing Meal at all bad as some people have said.  Everybody's different - if your not sure you want to commit to a whole tub go to PCC and pick up a single serving.<br /><br />The stuff in the tub wasn't super chocolaty but you can get more chocolate flavor by using chocolate milk (or chocolate almond milk) or varying quantities of whatever milks you like to adjust the sweetness/chocolate to suit your taste (I use 3/4 regular milk to 1/4 chocolate almond milk).  You could always toss in some of your own cocoa powder for that matter.<br /><br />I came up with a breakfast shake that I like a lot that holds me easily for several hours by using a combination of protein powders (Amazing Meal & Whey), 1/4 c raw oats, 1 tbl wheat germ, 1 tbl omega oil (I'm using walnut oil right now), 1/2 c blueberries and sometimes a heaping spoonful of greek yogurt (sometimes I add almond butter which is REALLY good also!).<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make is that you can play around with the ingredients to come up with whatever suits YOUR taste and 'staying power'.  I couldn't make it through to lunch on the Amazing Meal alone but along with the other ingredients I add it plays a huge part in satisfying my hunger for several hours (Whey alone doesn't work for me).<br /><br />Everybody's tastes and needs are different - play around with different combinations of ingredients that you like until you find what works well for YOU.<br /><br />I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because of the difference in taste/effect between the single serve and the tub.  I'm on my second tub of Amazing Meal but trying the 'Vanilla Chai' this time just to change things up a bit.

review/summary: Price is meh but flavour is decent
review/text: I bought the chocolate infusion. I mixed it with organic whole milk, not using the full 10 ounces, and thought it was pretty drink-able. Not amazingly chocolate-y, but enough that I could chug it without feeling too "healthy". Definitely not something I'd savor though.<br /><br />It did mix up pretty smooth, with little of the clumps that just won't die and had a good texture.<br /><br />All the reviews I read said that they felt energized and full for a long time after they drank it. I drank it at about 2pm and didn't feel particularly full afterwards and now at near 4pm I'm feeling positively hungry. Meal replacement? Perhaps not.<br /><br />Also, I'm still feeling really sleepy so that whole energizing thing? Nah.<br /><br />Noting, a lot of the reviews I read were done around 2009 and were done with free samples. I'm wondering how much of their glowing reviews was based off of psychosomatic happy feelings on getting a relatively good tasting drink to experiment with, how much of it was due to them being people who were already pretty healthy to begin with ( also known as the raw/vegan/scary type who CAN easily subsist off of meal replacement shakes) and how much of it was that Amazing Grass had a better product back then and has since declined in quality.<br /><br />Not to be cynical, but I've noticed that the first year or so of a company putting out a product, they tend to have amazing stuff, and then it usually goes downhill after that. And then there are the others that get bought out and just suck after that. Naked Juice, Burt's Bees, I'm looking straight at you.<br /><br />Meh. I guess I'll finish this container since I already paid for it, but I doubt I'll be back for more.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: Thoroughly love this product and used it for the past few years, but incredibly disappointed that they made their packaging larger (and thus more waste) and the quantity within smaller such that servings remained the same but serving size decreased (and thus increasing price). I really respected their product until this shift a few months ago, and have since been looking for a new product.

review/summary: This is nasty..and I LOVE green smoothies.
review/text: I've been drinking Amazing Grass' Chocolate version for months and just ADORE it.  I decided to try the Mango Amazing Meal and was very turned off by the texture and flavor.  I'm sure the texture issue has to do with the dried mango.  I tried it with both almond milk and coconut milk, adding 1/2 frozen banana.  It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!

review/summary: Gross, use GNC light meal instead.
review/text: I bought this and tried it twice. This tastes like someone added cocoa to grass clippings. It is that awful.  GNC has some very good tasting natural products I would recommend first. Optimum nutrition lean shake and Myoplex are good options for tasty protein (whey) fiber, and vitamins.<br /><br />You aren't going to diet long if your meals taste like this. It is torture.  2 stars for healthy content, 0 stars for drinkability (and I have tried some pretty bland health stuff).  Save some money, just eat some grass and raw eggs.

review/summary: Great Sugar Free Candy
review/text: I recently found this candy in a local TJMax store. Unfortunately, they don't always carry the same products. I thought I'd try Amazon. I'm thrilled to find that you carry this!! Being a diabetic, I'm always looking for a "good" treat. Another nice thing about this hard candy is that it takes a while to eat. It doesn't melt too fast and it's very hard so you won't chew it up right away. This is one of the BEST sour hard candies I've ever eaten!! It doesn't taste like a sugarfree candy at all.

review/summary: way too sour
review/text: I was so looking forward to this candy being diabetic and loving a sour flavor but when I got these the sour is so strong I could not leave it in my mouth.  I tried several times and just ended up with sores from the sour acidic flavors.  If you are looking for sour on the level of cry baby tears this is for you but for me I want something a little more mellow.

review/summary: my favorite gum
review/text: I chew a lot of gum. This is one area of expertise for me and I am fairly serious about gum chewing. This flavor/brand is my favorite. If you were a fan of fireballs as a kid then this is the gum for you, this is sugarless though. There are some gums that just fall apart after a few hours. Your jaw will wear out before this gum does. The cinnamon flavor stays with the gum through its "life" but the fire intensity wears off pretty early which is preferable. How much masochism can you stand anyway? Chewing this gum does affect your sense of taste and smell for hours after chewing. I have to chew at least four pieces at a time because these are small pieces.<br /><br />There is a lot of evidence that gum chewing is good for you. First, the process of chewing promotes salivation which is essential to the health of your teeth and aids in digestion. Second, tests have shown that chewing gum promotes insulin release theoretically because your body is expecting food. Third, the Japanese and the English have done studies that show that gum chewing improves your short-term memory 24% and long-term memory recall up to 36%. fMRI scans have proven that gum chewing stimulates the hippocampus. We really should be encouraging people to chew more gum.
