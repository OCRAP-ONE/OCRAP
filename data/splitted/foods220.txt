review/text: I'm not sure why people are giving this such poor reviews. If you dont like the taste, stop buying the healthy version of the product!! That being said, I love this flavor and I dont think it tastes any different from the "original" that everyone is complaining about. This is a great value considering the fact that each box costs around $5 in stores. If you like this oatmeal, buy this bulk pack! Its a great value!

review/summary: My 3 Year Old Loves This Stuff
review/text: This is my 3 year old son's favorite type of oatmeal. We have tried many others but he likes this one best. He gets very insistent that I put honey on top of his oatmeal, so I like the fact that this instant stuff has a little bit less sugar on it than it used to have. I love how easy it is to make, and it is great that my son can help me make it in the morning. In addition to the honey, we also usually add a couple heaping tablespoons of yogurt to it, so that it cools down faster.

review/summary: Gooey Goodness
review/text: As far as instant products go, Quaker Instant Oatmela Maple Brown Sugar flavor is pretty tasty.  It's also pretty instant and fills you up, even if you need to eat two packets at a time to actually feel full.  However, it's not something you have to feel guilty about eating since it's oatmeal and the fat/calories in a serving aren't going to crash your diet.  Unlike all the complainers, I'm not addicted to the "original" flavor and honestly couldn't tell you there was a difference between this and the "old" version.  Basically, if you don't eat it five days a week, you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />Overall I like the texture of this as well.  I tend to make mine straight from the packet and with boiling water from an electric kettle and sometimes I've had products that don't mix well that way and I'm stuck eating crunchy oats instead of, well, the proper gooey kind.  This one does exactly what I want with the texture most of the time and I absolutely love it!  Hard to feel guilty about something that's good for you and tastes pretty darn good too, definitely still solid product from Quaker.

review/summary: Quaker has taken themselves out of the instant oats market
review/text: I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of "value pack" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the "new" improved package at Stop & Shop.<br /><br />The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.<br />How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release "New Coke" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)<br /><br />Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those "We heard you, and we're making it right" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me.

I have to go to store brands now. Please change it back. Oh and if you want to join the movement Hehe...go to FBook and join, 'Change quaker maple and brown sugar oatmeal back' or something like that. There are a few groups on Fbk.

review/text: My kids used to LOVE Quaker Instant Oatmeal. It was a quick way to get them a hot breakfast on a busy morning and still get them to school on time. They started refusing to eat it, and would leave their bowls mostly full and uneaten. They said it tasted "funny". I tried a bite, and sure enough. I thought it had spoiled, so threw out the whole box, and bought a "fresh" box next time I was at the store. Nope, the flavor was terrible in the new box as well. Bad, bad move, Quaker. Go back to the old flavor formulas before you lose this line of business altogether.

It's so tasty that it doesn't need anything to add to the flavor but sliced peaches or blueberries are a nice touch.<br /><br />Since the product comes in handy packets, it's also convenient to bring to work and have a quick, energetic snack, all that's needed is to add milk or boiling water and it's all set.<br /><br />It's also microwavable.

review/summary: Not The Same Product of Years Past, Bust Still Good For A Fast, Hot Breakfast
review/text: In years past, I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick, easy, hot breakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet-ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch.

Regardless, these instant oatmeal packs have been a staple breakfast for numerous camping trips -- just add hot water and it's ready to eat. I tend to stick to the plain quick oats in the cardboard cylinder for most breakfasts, but I occasionally splurge on these instant packs for normal weekday breakfasts as well. It's fast to prepare and keeps me feeling full for a few hours.

One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture.

review/summary: Making Oatmeal Edible
review/text: It's hard to believe that these might actually be healthy, but I love these flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals.<br /><br />And they might actually be healthy! Though sugar is the second ingredient, whole grain rolled oats is the first ingredient in every flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, including this Maple Brown Sugar, which is a favorite of mine. Further, each serving (one packet) contains only four grams of sugar in the low sugar form and nine grams in the regular form, which is one to two teaspoons.<br /><br />Yeah, one or two teaspoons.<br /><br />I went through the rest of the ingredients on the Maple Brown Sugar flavor and on several others, and almost every other ingredient is an ingredient you'd find in a vitamin pill. The Apples & Cinnamon even has dehydrated apples (ahead of sugar, which is the third ingredient in that flavor).<br /><br />I'm recovering from chemotherapy and radiation. I had a bone marrow transplant in January (2012), and my new immune system sometimes goes after my gut when we lower my immunosuppressives. Thus, eating food that is high in fiber and gentle on the stomach and intestines is important for me. It's important for you, too, because the fiber in oats is excellent for your heart.<br /><br />The problem is, it's hard for me to find oatmeal edible without adding a lot more brown sugar than Quaker does! That's always been true, but it's especially true when I'm recovering from leukemia treatments. At first, there was a VERY limited set of food items I could eat without throwing up. (Sorry for being so graphic.) These flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals let me eat gentle, heart-healthy oatmeal without hating the flavor. I love almost every one. They're a go-to food for me when I'm nauseous.<br /><br />I know you probably aren't recovering from a blood cancer, but if you're wanting to eat oatmeal because it's healthy, this is a great way to eat it.<br /><br />And for lazy people, it's a one-bowl cleanup. Pour the packet in the bowl, pour boiling water over it, and wait a minute (or less if you're impatient like me). Eat it, and you have one bowl and no pots to wash (or throw in the dishwasher).

review/summary: Good, but not the best
review/text: This oatmeal is a good choice on very busy, cool mornings. I make it with a little less water than recommended, and it's ready in 60 seconds. The serving size is good, the oatmeal's not overly sweet, and I like the maple/brown sugar flavor.<br /><br />On the con side, the oat size is too small for my preferences. Some other brands have larger pieces. I've found a few pieces of the scratchy part in my bowl, now and then. And the flavor isn't all that well distributed even after I stir well.

review/summary: Great taste, very filling
review/text: I've been eating Quaker brand oatmeal for years, and the Maple & Brown Sugar flavor is my personal favorite.  I usually make it with water rather than milk, and add half a teaspoon of peanut butter when it comes out of the microwave.  It's delicious and nutritious, and keeps me from getting hungry for hours.<br /><br />I've given it four stars mostly because this is oatmeal, not helmet-mounted laser cannons, puppies, or a handy personal teleportation device.  It's oatmeal.  Delicious and good for you, but still just oatmeal.

review/text: I am very excited about the flavor I recieved when eating this oatmeal.  Typically I have found oatmeal, especially instant, to be bland to the point that I had to add brown sugar, honey, apples, or maple syrup to add more flavor.  This was not the case here.  Beautifully sweet and very enjoyable to eat.  Quick to make.  I heated this up in about a minute using milk.  I do feel that an adult needs two packet of this product to feel fulfilled.  One packet is just a breakfast appetizer.  I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys sweet oatmeal.  I would definitely purchase this product.

review/summary: Tasty and mostly healthful, but beware the caramel color
review/text: Oatmeal is said to lower cholesterol and benefit the heart. That's one thing to like about Quaker Instant Oatmeal. This particular brand -- Maple & Brown Sugar -- also claims "whole grains" oats, no trans fats, and no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />That's all good. It also tastes good, heats quickly, and has good consistency whether one uses milk or water.<br /><br />Yet it's not perfect. It's not as healthful as pure oats (of whatever brand), by which I mean no ingredients other than oats.<br /><br />This one contains various "artificial flavors" and chemicals. That includes caramel color. I heard a radio report claiming that some people now believe that caramel color may cause some cancers.<br /><br />So check whatever you buy for caramel color. Lots of bread and cereal products contain it. In this case, I suppose the caramel color is to help create the "brown sugar" look for this product.<br /><br />The ingredients actually list "sugar," but not "brown sugar." Maybe it's all the same, but loses its brown color under certain conditions, hence, the use of caramel color.<br /><br />This is still a mostly healthful, and tasty product. But look for oats with nothing other than oats if you want the oats' maximum health benefits.<br /><br />If you still prefer buying one of Quaker's "flavored" instant oatmeals, I suggest one of the Cinnamon flavored ones. Cinnamon is said to stabilize blood sugar levels and help prevent adult onset diabetes. Cinnamon is more healthful than Brown Sugar.

review/text: Okay, it's just oatmeal. Actually, it's more than that. Firstly, Quaker is a maker of quality products and has been known for quality for generations. Secondly, oatmeal is a very heart-healthy food that can help reduce cholesterol. Thirdly, for all its benefits, it is a very inexpensive choice for a healthy breakfast (or midnight snack!).<br /><br />I like oatmeal and have since childhood. This product (in delicious maple, brown sugar flavor) tastes good and, unlike many of the generic products, you can taste the maple as well as the brown sugar. The flavorings are well distributed throughout the product and every bite provides good taste as well as nutrition.<br /><br />This is a quality product at a good price. What's not to like?

review/text: I've been eating Quaker oatmeal most of my life, and the maple syrup and brown sugar version of their instant oatmeal breakfast is one of my favorites. It's simple to make, either add hot water, or microwave it. I tend to microwave it, which tends to give the oats more body.

Quaker has been no exception. They have made great tasting oatmeal for generations that is still as delightful today, as it was back then. Their classic Maple & Brown Sugar hasn't changed since it was introduced in instant oatmeal for decades. The taste is absolutely a joy to have every morning. It is simple to make with a simple pot of boiling water, and you get a classic treat in your morning breakfast. If you have never tried Quaker's Oatmeal, or even had Maple & Brown Sugar Oatmeal before, you do know what you're missing, especially on those cold winter mornings. I definitely recommend Quaker's oatmeal, and this is a great flavor.<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: What happened???
review/text: When I was younger, I used to eat the Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal all of the time- I was torn between it and Strawberries & Cream as my favorites. I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome.

I am not able to detect a great difference in this flavor from many of the cheap store-brand varieties I have tried.  It is acceptable for an occasional variety in breakfast but nothing that sets it apart from others.

To me the flavor was more similar to maple syrup when I was a kid, but not overly sweet.  Now it seems like the sweetness is still there but it tastes more like just sugar not the maple.  In fact the opening of the packet didn't even smell that much like maple making me think I accidentally picked up the wrong kind.  But overall the healthy side is still there and the taste is plenty good, just wished it reminded me a little more of the Maple & Brown Sugar I remember.  For the money, I really shouldn't complain - and I would use the maple comments to deter me from buying this again.  There aren't very many fast, healthy, cheap foods out there - thank goodness this one is.

For everybody else - 3.<br /><br />I've been eating oatmeal almost every breakfast for 11 years.  Over that time I've gradually used less and less sweetener.  So the sweetness of M&BS is a little much for me - however the maple flavor and smell is strong and pleasant and that goes a long way towards making up for it.<br /><br />Preparation is easy enough.  Add water, nuke it for 90 seconds, done.  Regular oatmeal isn't much harder but these packets are handy if you're going to eat in the office or on the road.

review/text: Instant oatmeal is my go-to breakfast whenever I have to work the very early morning shift.  I just pour the packet into a mug and add hot water from the dispenser on the coffee maker.  Quaker's Maple Brown Sugar is pretty good, but I think the Safeway brand is just a little tastier.  Quaker's version just doesn't have quite enough brown sugar in my opinion.  Since I had a box of Safeway's, I decided to compare.  They're pretty similar with the same calories and grams of fat, but when it comes to nutrients the Safeway version is slightly more nutritious.  For example, Quaker has 15% Vitamin A and 8% Calcium while Safeway has 20% Vitamin A and 10% Calcium.  Going down the list, Safeway is either equal to or better in each category.

review/summary: Slightly artificial flavor, but still eatable.
review/text: As the title states, the main fault with this oatmeal is the artificial maple flavor. It's slight, but leaves an odd taste in my mouth. I mean, oatmeal is healthy and good in itself; why add that extra artificial sugar if it detracts from the overall taste of the food? In this case brown sugar would have been enough. Or at least use real maple syrup.<br /><br />Texture and consistency is up to you, based on how much water you put in and how long you cook it. I put in different amounts of water and I thought the oatmeal tasted best with more water. My guess is that the water diluted the strong sugary taste so that it was more palatable to me. I still give this product 4 stars, because most flavored instant oatmeal have this issue of using artificial ingredients that affect the taste.<br /><br />Ultimately, after trying different kinds of flavored instant oatmeal from various companies, I think I enjoy plain oatmeal with dried or fresh berries the most. Healthy and good, what more can you ask?

review/summary: Never an oatmeal fan, I love this stuff
review/text: I grew up at a time when we had the paper canister of Quaker Oatmeal that could/should have been stuck away for desperation use, such as in a bomb shelter. Although some oatmeal would hit the spot sometimes(especially at summer camp, with some butter, brown sugar, and raisins), I came to loath oatmeal so much that I don't even like oatmeal cookies.<br />Imagine my surprise when on a road trip in Idaho and Montana, my best friend pulled a Tupperware container stuffed with various flavors of Quaker Instant Oatmeal out of her camping box, and when I groaned, she said "Never leave home without it". We pumped up some water, heated it on the Coleman, and voila! Had no milk, sigar, or anything, and it hit the spot, and for a quick and filling snack, it still does. Love the Brown Sugar, and most of the other varieties are good, too. I recently found a Cinnamon Roll flavor at Grocery Outlet that was killer.<br />So, bottom line, like my friend, I'm now in "don't leave home without it" mode, and carry a quart Zip-loc of Quaker Instant Oatmeal in my glove box. You never know when you'll need it.

review/text: I suppose this is a new formula since Quaker is marketing this as 'heart healthy' and whole grain.<br /><br />To me, it tastes as good as any other Quaker Instant Oatmeal that I've tried in the past so I do not hesitate to recommend this one.<br /><br />That said, I am not an oatmeal connoisseur; if you are very picky about your oatmeal, then your mileage may vary so to speak. I do like less fattening and more healthy foods so would probably purchase this one over a less healthy version.

review/summary: Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar
review/text: I think there are very few people who aren't almost always in a rush in today's world - rushing to/from work, to pick up kids/drop them off, to get to different events and activities and such, and often rushing through meals and eating something fast and easy that isn't always healthy for us.  Quaker's instant oatmeals come in handy because you can easily fit it into your busy schedule - at home or on the go.  Not only does it taste really good and is super easy to make, you can feel better about eating this rather than something loaded with suger or grease that you grab simply for the convenience.<br /><br />Loaded with flavor this appeals to kids and adults both, add a little fruit and you've got a fantastic nutricious breakfast (or lunch, dinner or snack!).

review/summary: Not the same oatmeal I grew up with
review/text: As a child Maple brown sugar Quaker Instant Oatmeal was my favorite flavor. In fact it was the only flavor I would eat. So after many years of not eating it I tried it again. I was shocked to discover that it doesn't taste anything like it did when I was a kid. And turns out I am not the only person that noticed this. My girlfriend noticed rigjt away after one bite. So if you are new to this oatmeal, give it a sjot but if you are like me and want to relive childhood memories.....don't!

review/text: I'm biased.  My morning oatmeal is usually mixed in with coffee or near expresso strength coffee.  That way my moring meal can get a nice little jolt.  I didn't think this stuff was bad.  Then again my tastes are like a coyote & I'll munch on near anything.  But Quaker used to make the standard for instant oatmeal.  This stuff is O.K.  I like nearly any instant oatmeal.  So, this stuff is a fair value, it tastes good, and it's not a bad price considering.  I'll buy it again & don't think it's a bad product.

review/summary: Oatmeal and all of its varieties
review/text: Oatmeal has been a simple breakfast meal for centuries, but what brand comes to mind when it comes to one brand of cereal?  Quaker Oats, with its simple preparation of either boiling a pot of hot water or placing a bowl with the contents of oatmeal and water into the microwave, instant oatmeal cereal.  Who can ask for anything more in a breakfast cereal?  For the most part, the cereal provides the necessary dietary needs one may be seeking for to start the day.  Quaker Oats has the essential ingredients, low in saturated fat and well for one's heart health and cholesterol, vitamins and minerals, and it taste good.<br /><br />For example, Quaker Oats carries a variety of flavors, but for consumers wanting to try the cereal beyond the basic oatmeal, the maple and brown sugar flavor may be enticing.  It does not taste as sweet as it sounds, and by adding a few fresh fruits to the mix, sliced bananas, apples, or strawberries or any other variety, one has a meal during the morning hours.  After consuming all 10-packets, most likely, one may want to try other flavors.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I thought this flavor was a little bland, nothing close to my favorite of raisins, dates, and walnuts.  The oats were fine.  I like that these instant oatmeals are great for on the go and are a better fast breakfast option than most cold, sugary cereals.  My biggest problem with this oatmeal is the sugar content.  Although one packet might be fine for a toddler, anyone over 8 years old would probably need two packets for breakfast; however, with 12 grams of sugar in one packet, that means a two-packet breakfast gives you a whopping 24 grams of sugar!  A better option is to make a bowl of oatmeal, not instant, add less sugar or a sugar substitute, then add spices or other ingredients of your choice. It takes a little more time and effort, but the result is a better tasting, healthier oatmeal.

review/summary: What You Expect from a Company with the Last Name "Oats"
review/text: I don't eat eggs, so oatmeal is my warm comfort food of choice for breakfast.  Maple Brown Sugar is one of my "go to" flavors - it disappears from the variety pack first and it's the one I seek out at the store (along with apple).  I'm also big on cutting costs at the grocery store, so I avoid name brands that aren't truly worth the extra money.  So, the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff.<br /><br />There really is no comparison.  The store brands are a real disappointment.  The oats don't absorb the water properly.  The flavoring doesn't dissolve.  The texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra.  The taste is the cloying side.  On the other hand, Quaker absorbs the water, the flavoring dissolves, the texture is nicely bumpy and three-dimensional, and the brown sugar is just enough.<br /><br />Don't go cheap on oatmeal or you'll be sorry.  If you want to save a buck on your oatmeal, buy the real stuff in bulk on Amazon.

review/text: This is such a terrific product.  It's so easy. Pop it in the microwave and since we live on the run it is a great breakfast.  The maple brown sugar flavor is really tasty.  My son likes the apples and cinnamon too, but I prefer this one the best.  Just what you need on a cold day.  Of course hearty eaters will use two packets at a time, but even that won't be a disaster if you are worried about calories.  My father-in-law eats oatmeal to lower cholesterol, but this tastes so good you would never know it is so healthy.

review/summary: Comfort food
review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal isn't new by a long shot, but for those who pass by it in the breakfast food aisle, you might wish to reconsider. Oatmeal is the ultimate in comfort food, and maple conjures up the same type of coziness. Combine both, nuke for two minutes in the microwave, and you have an amazingly quick breakfast or snack.  It isn't the heartiest oatmeal, but the addition of a banana and or raisins bulks it up considerably, and makes it a more complete balanced meal or snack. I actually like to mush up my banana and heated in the microwave as well, then mix it into the oatmeal; the result is terrific.

review/summary: It's a classic; what's not to like?
review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar is an old favorite, and lately it's a new favorite. I like making it in the microwave, but it does tend to boil over, but now I use the Keurig-type coffee maker to make two packets at once. Works like a charm. Maple and brown sugar are definitely on my list of favorites, and when I really want a treat, I put in a dab of butter. Oatmeal is one of my comfort foods, and instant is a lot less work. Of course, if you like the texture of steel-cut oats, this may not be worth it, but it is for me.

review/summary: The good ol' Classic Recipe that I grew up with
review/text: YES!  Quaker went back to the old recipe!  Woohoo!  I do love this stuff.  This Maple Brown Sugar flavor is what I grew up eating.  I am unfortunately a picky eater, nothing else will do, I'm very sensitive to (and grossed-out by) new flavors and textures.<br /><br />A year or two ago Quaker had scrapped the old recipe and came out with a New & Improved recipe which I unwittingly tried and was repulsed, thinking I'd gotten a bad batch until I realized it had been reformulated.  The new version's hearty oats and natural flavor wasn't a hit with me.  I emailed Quaker with my complaint and they nicely sent me a $5 coupon to use on any Quaker product which I used for Life cereal.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I wasn't the only one complaining about the New & Improved recipe because now Quaker has returned to their tried 'n' true Classic Recipe.  Now I have my old Maple Brown Sugar flavor and texture back.  Sure, it's probably not as healthy for me as old-fashioned homecooked oats, but I don't like old-fashioned oats.  =)  The flavor and texture of this instant oatmeal is comfort food to me, and since I have orthodontic braces, it's a good food for me to eat when my teeth are aching.

review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal is such a healthy and filling breakfast.  I like to start my day with a five mile run and when I come home this is my breakfast of choice, especially in the winter.  My favorite way to fix it is by dumping a packet of oatmeal, 1/2 cup of water and I always add 2 tablespoons of Old Fashion Oats too.  Cook it for a minute and then add cinnamon, raisins and milk.  It is sweet and healthy--a great mix!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy foods, yet has a sweet tooth.

review/summary: Tasty, not too sweet, easy to prepare
review/text: Quaker Instant Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal is a hearty dish for breakfast.  It's tasty, filling, and easy to prepare.  The ease of preparation is important for working folks who don't want to rush to work with an empty stomach.  Combined with a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice, the oatmeal will definitely hold and fortify you until lunch.<br /><br />It also makes for a good snack, instead of overly salty and sugar-rich foods.  I know many people put sugar and milk in their oatmeal, but I'm a purest.  I enjoy it just plain.  It's sweet enough to tingle one's taste buds, but not so sweet as to make it feel as if you're eating candy.  Instant foods suffer a generally bad reputation.  When "ease of preparation" is a primary consideration, often flavor suffers.  Not so here.  There was plenty of maple flavor.<br /><br />There are two options for preparing the instant oatmeal, one involving boiling water, the other tap water and the microwave.  I combined the two, because I like really hot oatmeal.  First I added boiling water, as directed, and let the oatmeal stand for a minute or so.  Then I gave it a 15-second nuke in the microwave.  The result was perfect for me.  If this sounds like too much preparation, stick with one of the prescribed methods, listed on the box.<br /><br />I'm not a really devoted oatmeal eater, so I may not be the ultimate authority on this product.  My review is based on the flavor (quite pleasant), preparation time (swift), and texture (just right, not too watery, not lumpy).  As with any food, individual taste is a major factor.

review/text: I have to admit, when I saw this available on vine I thought it may be a new twist on a classic product but it's not. It's the same oatmeal that we have had for many years. This is my favorite flavor of all the varieties. The only issues I have always had with these instant pouches is the amount of sugar in them and the serving size. Way to sweet for my tastes. and not enough. There is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQVBM">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Lower Sugar Maple & Brown Sugar</a> available but even that is a bit to sweet for me. What I usually do is use 1 pouch of flavored oatmeal and 1 pouch of plain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M09BQQ">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Original</a> and that fixes all my problems and it's just perfect. Fills me up and it's not overly sweet. I wish they sold these in bulk without the pouches. If I could get 2 pound cans of each I would be set!<br /><br />I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.<br />Would I spend my own money on this? Yes.

review/text: I microwave it for 70 seconds to cook it then splash it with a little milk to cool it off enough to eat. The taste isn't horrible, but it isn't fantastic, either. I also got the cinnamon spice one and I think that one tastes a tad better (but still not great). I threw some table sugar on it and that made a world of difference in the taste though I had to sacrifice some nutritional value in order to make it so.<br /><br />One thing I did like is that one serving keeps me full, which is actually something I find difficult in most foods. It holds me over for 4-5 hours while I'm usually hungry after eating most meals in a couple of hours. I've lost three pounds since starting this ten days ago without much of a change to my workout routine. I'm thinking it is the oatmeal.<br /><br />If the taste got better, this product would be GOLDEN!!!

review/summary: Tasty, but I wouldn't call it "wholesome".
review/text: Just finishing off a bowl (3 packets) of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar. Its very quick to make, either using fat free milk or water and then microwaving it. Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet-about as sweet as the sweetest breakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.<br /><br />I would not go so far as to call this a "wholesome" breakfast. A cereal bowl serving-an adult serving that is (3 packets), has about 33% (260mg) of your entire daily sodium intake and a ton of sugar. The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be. None-the-less, it is a fairly good alternative to many of the breakfast cereals available and probably healthier than a bacon and eggs breakfast. It is however, no substitute for homemade oatmeal in flavor or sodium/sugar content.

review/summary: artificial flavor, says it all
review/text: Okay, I don't ever buy instant oatmeal like this, we buy bulk organic quick oats and add brown sugar. I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better.  For the most part this oatmeal lived up to my expectations.  I will admit that compared to other maple flavored brands I've tried this one was better, but still, I would not buy this again, and one of my daughters said she didn't like it and won't eat it again, glad I only got one box.  We use genuine maple syrup in our household, and even keep maple sugar for sprinkling on toast, so we are big maple fans, and I guess with genuine maple fans artificial flavor just doesn't cut it.  I even felt like it wasn't quite sweet enough even though it had more sugar in it than the Cinnamon and Spice flavor oatmeal.  Because it has better flavor than other brands of maple flavored oatmeal I've tried, I gave it a 3 stars, saying it was OK is about right.

But every once in awhile I like to splurge on the pre-packaged oatmeal like I used to eat as a kid.  Sure the sugar is a little higher but nutritionally it's a much better option than other snacks. Only 160 calories per packet. Quaker instant oatmeal packets are just as good as you remember them. If there were any way to improve this product it would be to make the oatmeal a little thicker.  More like rolled oats.  Other than that,  Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal is awesome.<br /><br />26JUL12 REVISED RATING: My kids tell me this oatmeal is really bland compared to what they are used too.

review/summary: Colavita Polenta
review/text: GOOD/QUICK/EASY.  This is good polenta, and very/quick to make.  This is pre-cooked cornmeal.<br /><br />NOT A LONER.  Since this is only cornmeal, it does require other things to jazz it up.  It would not be too good by itself.  First, it needs salt or some type of seasoning (unless the other foods you choose to eat with it has salt).  I think it would go good with beans or chili.  I think the same type of foods that go good with cornbread would go good with polenta.  I think iced tea would be the perfect drink for polenta, since (I think) it is the perfect drink with cornbread.<br /><br />MAKES GOOD COMPANY.  I am not complaining that it is not a loner and does best with other foods.  (Anyway, who usually only eats one type of food at a time?)  I think some spicy beans, mashed potatoes, or assorted vegetables (such as green beans, okry, etc) would go great with polenta.<br /><br />MEETS MY NEEDS.  Almost everything I eat is either vegetables, fruits, nuts, or grains.  This is one of those (grains), so it fits right in with the others.<br /><br />YOU HAVE MY WORD FOR IT.  I already tried this (as soon as I got home from the store with it!), and it is really good.<br /><br />QUALITY.  It is good food, and at a really decent price.<br /><br />PASSES MY TOUGH CREDENTIALS.  I love it!!!

review/summary: Very good cereal
review/text: Tastes great, doubt it's very good for you, too much sugar.  But everyone in my family loves it, I can't buy it all the time because they eat too much of it, but it is one of the best tasting cereals ever, IMO.

review/summary: Melitta tea filter review
review/text: I use these tea filters to make iced tea in a medium sized pot.  I just heat the water and clip a filled filter to the edge; the tea is ready in about ten minutes total time.  Real simple.  I use Lipton loose tea I keep in a sealed cannister.<br /><br />About buying the filters.  My grocery store was out of those filters.  I am pretty sure I bought them there when I first tried them.  The store was unaware they sold them, and could not find them anywhere.<br /><br />I am very impressed with Amazon, so tried them for the filters.  They had them, I bought them in about 2 min; and they were delivered in about 2 days.  I got 6 packs of them, cheaper than the store.<br /><br />Anyway, this purchase was easier and quicker than writing this review.  I like Amazon enough to write this review.<br /><br />GatorNorm

review/summary: These filters work well in a teapot
review/text: These filters are an inexpensive alternative to those overpriced contraptions for brewing tea.  Just use your porcelain teapot!  Though they are big for a mug, they can still be used for your loose-leaf concoctions.

review/summary: When done, throw into the compost pile
review/text: The Melitta Tea Filters, 40-Count (Pack of 6) is a wonderful way to create tea bags, spice bags, bath salt bags, or whatever you can think of for a secure and economical system.  I generally place loose tea leaves with herbs and spices inside an unbleached bag, then put it into a teapot.  After adding hot water and waiting for the prescribed time period, I easily remove the bag and have a pot of tea with a minimal amount of residue in the brew.  Because a filled bag will remain open, I've also created some gifts by attaching a cotton string and little hand decorated tag to the bags.  For the unsealed bag, be careful that the longer end does not hang over the edge of a cup, mug or teapot too much or you'll run the risk of the hot water being absorbed all the way to the upper edge, saturating it and possibly dripping onto the table top.  This happened to me once because I forgot to retrieve the bag and the teapot sat for about a half hour.  The bags can also be used for mulling spices because they are rather large.  I love them!

review/summary: Great popcorn, not a great price
review/text: "Real Theater Popcorn" is the easiest way to get the best theater style popcorn at home (especially if you use a whirleypop popper)<br /><br />But you should be aware that most resellers are selling this stuff for more than you would pay if you just buy direct from the source (and yes it is available online popcornpopper dot com)<br /><br />$1.10 to $1.60 per pouch depending on the volume you buy is closer to what you should be paying, not $2 and up.

review/summary: Great tasting and easy-to-make popcorn, but no size choice.
review/text: I have a six-quart whirley pop, and these packs say they make six quarts of popcorn - perfect, right? Not so much - I find that they make too much - by the time it's all popped, the popcorn is crushed a little bit because of how it's being compressed in the popper - if they offered a 4 or 5 quart version, I'd get that instead. Other than that, though - the popcorn tastes awesome, just like the movie theater.<br /><br />Pro tip: at Sam's Club you can buy a big (2 pound) container of Act II buttery popcorn salt for less than $4. It's just like the popcorn salt that comes in these packs - I add a teaspoon to the popper anytime I pop corn without these packs, and it definitely helps. Adds a yellow color too.

review/summary: Awesome!! Order this popcorn!
review/text: Last year I bought a popcorn machine for my son's carnival birthday party and needed some popcorn kits to go along with it.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with Great Northern popcorn because it had a lot more review. WRONG CHOICE!  It was terrible! It's had a chemical-like smell and was EXTREMELY salty -- and I am a person that salts everything and it was way too salty for me to even eat. It was just all around nasty popcorn.<br /><br />This year I decided I'm going to break out the popcorn machine and use it again, but I needed to get different popcorn.  I wanted to allow myself enough time this year that if I didn't like the popcorn I ordered, I would have time to order replacements before the party.  Last week I ordered the Real Theater popcorn kits and OMG! I LOVE it!  It tastes really good like movie theater popcorn or the popcorn you get at the popcorn carts at the zoo or amusement parks.  My house smelled really good like popcorn you just had to have.  I even stepped outside for a little bit and walked back in to see how the smell would hit you if you were just walking in the house.  It was fabulous!

review/summary: Tastes like the movies!
review/text: I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn. Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy. Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet. Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too). You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping. While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl. Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is about $2.40 per pack (or $1.66 per pouch in the 15 pack), which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!

review/summary: BEST POPCORN EVER!
review/text: I have tried so many kinds of popcorn, beginning with those for the microwave.  Then I went to an  electric popcorn maker and tried various popcorns.  When I got the Whirley, the Wabash Valley Farms was the first popcorn I tried for it.  I was immediately amazed. This pops larger than any one I've ever tried.  Much larger.  And the flavor cannot be beat.  It is truly an exceptional popcorn and I will never again use a different one.  I highly recommend it.
