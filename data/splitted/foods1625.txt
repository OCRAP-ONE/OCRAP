review/summary: A rare find
review/text: It's rare to find unsweetened cranberries. I have yet to use them in a recipe, so my comments will be limited to initial impressions: they're pretty dry. I found that I could soak them in a little water, and I add Splenda for sweetening (cranberries are extraordinarily bitter, otherwise) they become palatable and tasty. I bought them because of a dietary malabsorption problem with sugars.

review/summary: not very good
review/text: I grew up eating merguez so it's easy for me to tell good from bad. These merguez were not the worst I ever had but close. Cooking them so much fat came out I had to empty the pan a couple of times. The fat was red meaning that they use artificial colorant which is not good either... I wouldn't recommend this product.

review/summary: Simply not very good
review/text: I have eaten merguez in France all my life until moving to the US, and by the time I purchased those I was getting desperate.  Those sausages are simply not very good.  They are bland, the meat is gamy, there is no heat (there should be anywhere from a little bit to a lot of heat), and they have very little spice in them.  The meat is neither lean nor fatty, but releases a tremendous amount of water.

review/summary: Tasty sausage, questionable delivery practice
review/text: These Merguez were delicious, and immediately transported me back to Paris where I first tasted this North African delight. I was tempted, however, not to actually eat them. They arrived well wrapped, and packed with melted ice packs, and they didn't feel particularly cold to the touch. I was concerned that they may have been in the temperature danger zone for growth of food borne pathogens. . . ie -- I was worried they'd make me sick. But I REALLY like merguez, so I tasted a small sample. . . Didn't get sick, so we ate the whole batch safely.  HOWEVER, they should do a better job packing -- maybe dry ice?

review/text: Merguez is not an easy product to find in the U.S., and although these are quite expensive, they are very good.<br /><br />The product was delivered promptly, it was very fresh and well packaged.  I am used to the quality that I get in North Africa and France, so I was a bit skeptical.  I can truthfully say, this matches that quality.<br /><br />However, the sausages do have some beef as well as lamb.  The impression I had when I ordered is that it was all lamb.  It is not.  Nonetheless, it is excellent.

review/text: Great product. I use this on my show dogs and the Omega Oil also made by same company. Very bummed that the omega oil is discontinued. Very hard to find any if people are selling any but i have managed to even though it was pricey. Totally worth it. I hope they resume making the Omega glo coat oil as it and the powder work wonders. Anyhow back to the powder. Its great and I loved it as usual for my show dogs. I also like that it came in a pouch vs. a canister that they are using now currently for their powder products. I liked that the pouches didnt take up as much room and also included a scoop. The new canister ones they are using dont. Anyhow great service and this brand is really great! :)

review/summary: Candy shell? No. Wax shell? Yes.
review/text: So the first thing I noticed when I tried these was that the candy is covered by a layer of wax that does not melt after being in your mouth for 30 seconds. This is relatively unpleasant. I don't really like to chew chocolate. I like to leave it in my mouth so that it can melt and become all gooey. Well, with this candy I had to chew it first and then let it melt. I would have rather it have no shell at all than a shell of wax. Ick.

My advice would be that if you don't want to get addicted, never try these. You won't be able to stop eating them!<br /><br />One slight complaint. I ordered these one time in the summer where temps were in the 90s. they arrived to me all melted together and then became a solid block once they cooled again. there really should be a disclaimer not to order if temps will cause melting. i had assumed they would be on a truck with some sort of air conditioning. I was wrong!

review/summary: Good Snack-Sized Chocolate Pieces
review/text: I don't usually like white chocolate, but these drops are great!  I ordered them after trying some at the local grocery store.  I like that they are small enough to snack on, but you can eat as many or as few as you'd like, so you don't have to feel guilty afterwards.  :)  They are convenient because the bag zips shut to keep them fresh for a long time.  They don't seem to melt in your hand very quickly, like I expect chocolate to do, so there must be some type of finish on them that protects them from the heat of your hand.<br /><br />If you like the Cookies and Creme candy bars, you will love these drops!

review/summary: Better than a Starbuck Frapp
review/text: I've tried this and the Chocolate Peanut Butter. The Chocolate Peanut butter is too sweet for me, but it's tasty. A friend gave me a couple of packets of each flavor. I made each using skim milk (it's what I had), using a decent ice-crushing blender (Oster, with 6 blades).<br /><br />This one has the same great flavor of a Starbucks Frappuccino, maybe even a little bolder and sweeter; but you don't get that layer of flavorless ice on top when you're half way done. It was more like a milkshake, all the way down! And after drinking one, you can definitely tell there's some caffeine as well. I like the Espresso flavor so much that I subscribed to the 25 packs at 6 month intervals, so I can keep this as a Saturday morning habit.<br /><br />You could probably also use vodka for the liquid, and make a very tasty "Espresso Martini" flavored frozen drink!<br /><br />Note that the nutritional information is for one serving. Each packet makes two servings.

review/text: My dog is 16 now and has always been a finicky eater, it has always been hard to find things she likes, but these are one of her favorites! They are also so healthy. She has also always had itchy skin in the late summer to fall, I found these treats last fall and this past summer her skin was so much better, hardly any itching. I would recommend them. Be sure to read the directions though, the amount you give your dog is recommended by their weight. They are also good for dogs if they tend to eat grass.

review/summary: A Happy Dog is a Green Dog
review/text: My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers: A male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. The Empress is alergic to wheat, (along with corn and soy), so I had my doubts concerning Pet Greens Roasted Chicken Recipe w/ Wheat Grass Dog Treats - wheat grass after all is just "juvenile" wheat. But apparently not to worry! We're half way through our first bag and no allergic reaction, (you haven't lived until you've seen a crazed Scotty in the middle of an allergic frenzy chewing on her tootsies). Now, putting aside her allergies, the Empress will eat almost anything - and so will the Cesky. But the Westie gives new meaning to the term "finicky" - and Asta gives these treats five barks - I mean, stars. So what's up here?<br /><br />The treats are mostly roasted chicken meal, supplemented with dried chicory extract, organic ground wheat grass powder, lecithin, salt, cultured whey and garlic, preserved with "mixed tocopherols," (I'm not a chemist, but I think that's a fancy name for vitamin E, sourced from vegetable oil). The wheat grass doesn't contain any wheat glutten - which I think is the reason it doesn't trigger the Empress' allergies. Wheat grass is an excellent source of any and all of the nutrients contained in fresh vegetables.<br /><br />The treats are small "jerky-like" rectangles - no more than an inch by 3/4s of an inch, and maybe 1/16 of an inch thick, (they may be more appropriate for small to medium size dogs - a large dog would want three or four at a time). They're great for a quick reward and at only about 4 calories a piece, there's not much danger that your dog is going to put on unwanted pounds, (however I wouldn't suggest that you carry them loose in your pocket or purse - they smell strongly of garlic - I keep 'em in a zip lock baggie).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the ingrediants are all natural, but only the wheat grass is organic - if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you check out those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I think that Pet Greens offers both a change of flavor and a change in texture from most common dog treats. The Three Muske-Terriers are scarfing 'em down - your furry buddy probably will too.

review/text: I was looking for a product that is not made in China, contains mostly meat and does without a long list of unhealthy ingredients. Having older rescued dogs with very few teeth, the treats also needed to be soft enough for them to chew. Pet Greens Treats fulfilled all of these requirements.

review/summary: I don't like it only because Son won't eat it.
review/text: It tastes fine to me, but my son will take 1-3 spoonfuls then spits it out.  Green beans and Spinach he can't keep down.  Hot or Cold he doesn't like this.<br /><br />I still try now and then hoping he'll change his mind.  He's 11 months now since we started him at 5 months and still doesn't like this.  He does like steamed green beans I cook, but not this.<br /><br />I've mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because I know its good for him.<br /><br />Good price and value, but not worth it if your child won't eat it.

review/summary: Lot of food for a little one
review/text: I got 3 sets of food for my 6 month old to have some variety.  I didn't realize kids are on stage 1 foods for a very brief period so we had to mix these stage 1 foods in with stage 2 and 3 foods to use them. I'm sure these are great if you have multiple children, but for one child, these packs are too large to get more than one, but one box doesn't provide variety...

review/text: Unfortunately, this seller on the AMAZON website claims the Organic Matcha Green Tea Powder comes from Island Teas -- which I know is a trusted seller of this product. When received tea was NOT from Island Teas and it was a dark green color and more bitter in taste the "correct tea" is ceremony grade (the highest and most expensive and a light green color).  I returned the item and they claimed they would give me a full refund once receiving it. They received according to the tracking for the package and never responded to my email for the refund. Had to file an A-Z claim with Amazon and finally after weeks Amazon refunded my money.

review/summary: Black salt is phenomenal!
review/text: Due to my studies in yoga and Ayurveda I'd heard about the benefits of black salt.  I'm so glad I decided to try it.  It's made a wonderful and interesting addition to my food preparation.  I would recommend that anyone buying it read up on it first because it does have a very unusual odor and flavor (very much like hard boiled eggs, as it is volcanic and contains a lot of sulphur) and the fact that like Himalayan salt you use it as a finishing salt and don't cook it.  Like Himalayan salt, from what I understand, black salt doesn't hold water so it's said it doesn't raise the sodium content in the body.  It's very finely ground so a little goes a long way, and it comes in a really neat little glass jar.  I would definitely purchase again!

review/text: My dog loves them.  He's just a little guy, he's a miniature dachshund but he loves them almost as much as his dog treats. He chews on them for hours, and not the furniture.  They last forever and they make his eyes light up like a five year olds on Christmas morning.  We keep one in the living room and one in the bedroom for ease and convenience of his chewing pleasure, luckily they come in packs of two. It's odd to think of a dog bone as well constructed but is. The knots in the ends are tied tight and it's dried well so it won't unravel no matter how long it remains in his mouth. It has no smell whatsoever, and again I can't stress enough how much he loves them. It's his second best friend besides me of course. Only the best for my best buddy.

review/summary: The quintessential breakfast tea.
review/text: Given this blend's orgin, the name "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.

review/summary: A straight-ahead pleasure
review/text: This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the "fannings" or "dust" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I don't think of it as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)

review/text: Golden Barrel Blackstrap Molasses was all that I anticipated and expected.  I was inspired and encouraged by memories of my father adding it to my oatmeal when I was a child. I was not disappointed!  I still like oatmeal as my Dad made it with raisins, some pecan chunks and a tablespoon of molasses.  No white sugar is needed...it is pretty sweet! I sometimes add almond milk, but not always!  Golden Barrel Blackstrap Molasses is also great in molasses cookies and Ginger Snaps!  You just have to try it to be consumed by the joy jumping on your tongue!  Thank you Golden Barrel!!

review/text: Multiple discrepancies between the product package and the company website make it impossible for me to know what the correct crude protein level and sodium content of this product are. Customer service was less than willing and able to  help. I made all my attempts to find this info before offering it to my cat, who is supremely uninterested in this stuff.

review/summary: Good concept, but my cat hated it.
review/text: I purchased this for my cat who lost a lot of weight after a serious illness. He became a finicky eater and only seemed to want to lick the gravy from his canned foods. I was desperate to get him to eat and to get nutrients in him. I heard of this product and thought a gravy with vitamins in it was a win-win. I paid almost twice the value of the product in shipping, but figured since it was my cat's health, it was worth it (and no local pet store sold it). My cat was not having it. He wouldn't lick it alone on a plate. When he was done eating the gravy from around the canned food bits, I added some of the Vita Gravy to the meat bits and he wasn't even remotely interested. I figured he was still being finicky and he would eat it when he fully recovered and was back to himself. Well, that time came and went, and he still won't eat it. In fact, I tried it with my other cats and every single one of them (even the ones who inhale anything you put in front of them) would not even touch it. They retracted instantly upon smelling it and looked at me with this odd expression. I threw the whole thing away. What a waste!

review/summary: Worked for my cat
review/text: When I had a kitty who was in renal failure he had stopped eating. The vet had prescribed some food that my cat would not eat and vitamin drops that he absolutely hated so not only was he not eating, I also couldn't get him to take the prescribed vitamins. Then I found this product and the Hi-Tor Neo cat food. I mixed them together and my cat started eating again. This combo bought him 10 extra months of being a happy playful cat. I am grateful to this product and will use it again if my current kitty develops kidney disease later in his life (he is very young so got forbid this should happen any time soon!)

review/summary: They won't go near it
review/text: I bought two different flavors of Vita gravy, and I couldn't get either of my cats to even take a lick of them, despite how I served them. I tried to put some on their dry food, they actually didn't eat for hours until I replaced it with just dry food. I tried offering it up solo, to no avail. And I put some on a bit of lettuce, but they still wouldn't take the bait.<br /><br />I imagine it smells like plastic to them, but both my cats don't go near it after smelling Vita Gravy. I can understand Allstar not liking it - he's... special (which is why I call him "Allstar"). He's squeamish and weird and he only eats his regular food in small portions throughout the day; never more than a couple of bites at once. If I offer him wet food, he just licks the gravy from that and leaves the meaty portion to Agnes.<br /><br />Agnes, on the other hand, is a 20 lb vacuum. I've had to pull string out of her anus because she ingested it and couldn't quite push it out of herself. Come to think of it, she doesn't mind chewing on plastic either, so I'm not sure what about Vita Gravy is so unappetizing to her, especially considering what I've shared.<br /><br />I don't know if other cats go for it, but I have two VERY different cats of my own and neither will eat Vita Gravy. My advice: Bad buy.

review/text: Bought two kinds after reading a review hoping it would help my kitty with CRF eat her special diet food.  My cat won't even go near it, and I can't say I can blame her- it really does smell like plastic, not like salmon or chicken like you would expect.  I wish I had my money back and the double amount I paid in shipping costs.  Not what expected at all from this product.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble on occasion, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a while, because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and bacon flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/text: The price seemed good on these, but not in the final analysis.  Many of the quarters have hard layers on the outside that are too tough to chew.  So I cut them off.  There are also fibrous centers that have a very unpleasant texture on the tongue and sometimes seem almost prickly.  So now I have more to cut out.The result is that I have to work hard to cut out almost half the food.  Not only is this a hassle, but it raises the effective price per pound way above other seemingly more expensive alternatives.  Needless to say, I won't buy this brand again.

review/text: DO NOT be freaked out by the ostrich! This tastes exactly like a slim jim- it is shorter and fatter in size, but the flavor and texture are the same. You would never know you weren't eating 100% beef. Gave it to a few friends telling them it was a slim jim and they loved it. They had no idea it was anything but. I wanted a high protien snack that was not as fatty as a slim jim- they leave a gross oily residue in your mouth. This product is low fat, low carb, high in protein and tastes great (seriouly, just like a slim jim). *The Ostrim Natural has no nitrates.

review/text: I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.  I'm not even half down with my first order and I already ordered a second batch.  This is just really good stuff, if you like beef jerky and beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  When you eat it the stick has a snap to it, tastes clean, not oily / greasy or fatty.  You taste just meat and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing and are thing about another.

review/summary: Acquired taste and great when delivered fresh
review/text: This tastes nothing like a slim jim to me so for those that claim it does, either they haven't had one in a long while or their mind is tricking them.  Most of my friends get a whiff of it before they try it and turn it down.  I'm Asian and trust me half of our food doesn't look tasty or smell good, but is often very good.  I love these sticks.  I will admit they are probably going to be an acquired taste for some.  I've only bought the natural from amazon.  I tried some of the other flavors and found them a poor product.  Their additional flavors were in harsh contrast to the natural flavor of the ostrich meat so I can see how some would see it as a turn off.  My personal opinion though.<br /><br />Like a few other said, I don't like the inconsistency.  Sometimes the quality is good, sometimes not. I'm wondering if there are dips in the ostrich meat market where they have to sometimes use meat they normally wouldn't.  Or if they were left in bad conditions too long during transport.  If the saltiness and dryness were consistent each time, I'd be much happier.

review/text: Got to say when I bought these I was worried about the ostrich, not  going to lie.  When they arrived however they  tasted great, on top of that they're low in fat and great for protein.  This is the exact reason I bought them because I'm trying to lose the last few pounds while gaining muscle. The thing is though that I still think Jack Links tastes better.  Jack Links Slim Jims are high in fat however but on the other side there jerky is low in fat and on top of that around 20g of protein per pack. I gave this product a 5/5 because it was so low in calories and still tasted good but I will say when I finish off with this last bit of body fat then Ill probably switch over to Jack Links because the higher amount of protein. Still great product because it's healthier, 5/5 stars.

review/text: It's healthier than most meat snacks, and it is filling. Great for those moments that you are either too busy or too lazy to make a meal. The fact that it's individually wrapped allows you to always carry one with you. I leave some at work for when I get hungry or for when I am so busy that I don't have time for lunch. My favorite flavor is the original, followed by the peppered. This is also a great price per oz.
