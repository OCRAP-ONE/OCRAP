review/summary: the cats love these
review/text: I actually feel bad when I think how much I paid for these at the vets!  The mark-up there was ridiculous, but these were a great treat for cleaning the cats treats that has proven some results (very little tartar build up) that the cats absolutely ADORE.  One of the cats act as if this is a kitty drug or something when I break out these treats, she loves them so much.  It's never a problem to get them to eat these treats, and now it's not a problem to give them once a day to help keep their teeth clean when the price is much more reasonable than what you'll find at the vets. If your cats are not a fan of brushing, definitely look into these - even if you can brush their teeth, these will help with their dental care and are a decent snack as well.

review/summary: Keeps teeth healthy
review/text: These chews seem to keep the cats teeth healthy.  My oldest cat is 14 and his teeth are in great shape, partly due to these. I have been giving these to my cats for years.  I have always bought them from my vet who charged me alot more for the small bag than Amazon charges.  I was happy to find I could get this larger bag.  It is a great value.

review/summary: Great idea, awesome treats!
review/text: Our last cat spent his last few years with hardly any teeth (although he was 21) and thus could only eat wet canned food. So, when we adopted a new one we decided to take better care of his teeth from the start.  We feed him feline greenies daily as a treat and give him one of these chews a few times a week.  I suppose we could also brush his teeth but to me that seems like overkill (he is a cat after all).  Anyway, he absolutely loves these chews. He bats them around all the while biting them and after a short while the chew breaks apart and he wolfs it down with delight.  I cannot give this product 5 stars only because I cannot say what long term effect it is having on his teeth because he's only 2 so has good health all around.  I wasn't sure if he would like these treats as the common complaint in the other reviews seems to be that some cats just wont touch them.  However, since the treat is pretty similar to a wine cork I would suggest you see first if your cat will play with one (our cat loves batting corks all over the house).  I have a strong feeling if your cat likes to play (with corks especially) he or she will love these chews

review/summary: Improvements after a few days!
review/text: My poor kitty had lost a front tooth a few years ago.  I didn't think much of it because at the time he was a part time out door kitty.  We moved to an apartment and his out side privileges went away (we are on third floor.) He gained a lot of weight and I noticed that his breath became very stinky, to the point where sitting next to him on the couch, he would yawn and you could smell it! Terrible. Then a few weeks ago I noticed that his gums were very inflamed.  After doing a lot of research, I found there were several things that could be wrong. And before taking him to the vet (who I suspect would have to either put him under for a teeth cleaning or take out additional teeth) I found great reviews for this product.  So, based on some other comments about other cats not liking the treats, bought a small bag of these to try. Skeptical but hoping for good results we gave one to our kitty and he loves them! Of course, our cat has been known to really enjoy odd things like green beans, but he realy really enjoys these treats.  He tried to eat through the bag I accidentally left on the counter.  Not only does he seem to enjoy the flavor, I think he likes the different texture AND Most Importantly, we have already seen (and smelt!) a difference in his breath and gums.  I am so happy about what these have done for our cat.  He seems happier, like he's less uncomfortable now too, all he wants to do is snuggle.<br /><br />We still need to schedule a time to bring him to our vet but I was so worried he'd have to have his teeth out or worse!<br /><br />As long as your kitteh has a good appetite and likes trying new things you should be okay. Definitely worth a try!

review/summary: My Cats Love These - The Large Size Is A Plus
review/text: When I introduced these treats to my cats, I had to hold them out for them. At first, they thought they were toys. After they licked it, though, they realized they were yummy treats. It took a couple of days for them to learn the best way to eat them, but now they're pros. I just plop them on the floor and they chow down immediately. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot of crumbs, which a lot of people will probably hate, but, lucky for me, my cats are very clean and thorough so it hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Now, I know that other people are saying that the large size is a negative feature of these treats, but, really, it's not. If they were smaller, they may just be swallowed whole instead. That's what one my cats does with her food and other treats. Because of the size of these treats, though, she's forced to chew them, which is good since these are dental treats. They have to be chewed to be effective.<br /><br />The flavor of these treats must be really good too. My cats are usually very open to sharing food and treats with one another, but when it comes to these treats, they growl if the other tries to even sneak a crumb.<br /><br />Before I bought these, I thought about buying the ones by Petrodex. After I compared the ingredients, though, I realized these were the way to go. Petrodex has two additional ingredients. The first one I googled turns out to be poisonous to cats. It may not be harmful in small quantities, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

review/summary: My cat loves them
review/text: My cat absolutely loves these chews. When I first gave them to her about 6 months ago, I had to break them in half to convince her that she could eat something so big. But now she attacks them and breaks them apart in her mouth and then salivates. She gets one every night when I get home from work as a treat. Her next vet appointment is in 2 more months, so it will be interesting to see if they have made a difference with tartar build-up on her teeth.

review/summary: cat chews to clean teeth
review/text: These cat chews were cleverly designed so the cat cannot grab it on the first try, therefore biting into it many times before it can be chewed.  With each bite it helps clean the teeth.  I brush my cat's teeth sometime but I make these chews a daily treat and they love them!

review/summary: Cat Addiction
review/text: My cat is addicted to this dental treats.  It started out about 6 months ago my cat's vet metioned that she was developing a little bit of tartar on her teeth.  The vet gave me a couple of these treats to try on her to see if it wouldn't be something that might help her.  My cat is pretty finicky at what she eats but it was love at first sight with these treats.  She litterally begs for these.  She knows which cupboard they are kept in so she will jump on top of our microwave that is directly under this particular cupboard and she will meow pretty intensly everytime you walk by her when she is sitting in that spot.  She was getting one treat a day but because of the cost of these treats, we have cut her down to one every other day. When my husband and I are employed again maybe we will go back to one a day.  Everytime she gets one of these treats she acts like she has died and gone to cat heaven! She recommends them very highly!

review/summary: Took Some Time For Cat
review/text: I ordered these around Christmas for my cat. They arrived in a timely manner. I knew they were larger in size, but my cat won't eat them unless broken up. The first few days she sort of turned her nose up at them (and she goes crazy for the Temptations and other dental food I have given her in the past), but not so much for these. If I break them up and put them in her food bowl, she will eat them, though, so she must sort of like them anyway ;). I have only been using these treats for a few days and my cat is young so I am using them as preventative care for her teeth. Anyway, I thought the amount was good for the price!

review/summary: Cats Go Crazy For Them
review/text: These were recommended to us at the veterinary hospital to keep our cats' teeth cleaner in between cleanings. As we've only been using them a few months, don't know if they've helped in that regard, although one of our cats has been back and the doctor said her teeth "look good". She had a dental three months ago, so who knows if treats had anything to do with that.<br /><br />But we do know that the "kids" love them. They go absolutely, hysterically crazy for them. I've never seen such a response to any treat. Our 2-year-old bats his around like a hockey puck, terrorizing it, stalking it, and finally devouring it. Our middle-aged mellow boy carefully contemplates his and eats it slowly, like he wants to savor every bit of it as long as possible. Our senior queen kitty picks hers up and carries it to a private place where she can dine by herself. Our kids are large and the size of these is no problem. At first I cut them into smaller pieces, but that turned out to not be necessary.<br /><br />I only wish they weren't so darned expensive. Amazon has the best price, but with multiple cats getting 1-2 per day, every day, we need to buy them frequently.

review/summary: Cat Dental Chews - Outstanding Product
review/text: I bought this product because every cat I've owned has always had tartar problems. Dental cleanings are expensive and painful for cats. When I first gave her a chew, I had to cut it in half for her to eat it, and I put the bag away in the pantry on a high shelf. I left for the day and when I came home, I found that somehow she'd leapt to the shelf, knocked the bag down and eaten about half of the chews. The shelf is the same location where I keep Temptations treats and she'd never tried to get on the shelf before!  This is a great product - I'd give it 6 stars if possible!

review/text: My vet recommended these for my half-Siamese, very particular, cat because she kept having tarter buildup (and, as a result, bad breath). I was skeptical because my cat is VERY picky about food. She LOVES them. It is her "treat" each day. Well, my vet stopped carrying them, so I came to Amazon and now I never have to worry about quick delivery, tarter buildup, bad breath or an unhappy kitty! Life is great with CET Enzematic cat chews!

review/summary: Took awhile, but now he loves them.
review/text: FIRST FEW DAYS:  Not only does the cat refuse to eat these, but he won't even eat the food that it touched after I broke one up and mixed it in his dry food, so he's gone hungry all day.  Putting it in his mouth --- so he chewed it a bit with his back molars --- made him slightly interested after he was on his own, so he licked it and then batted at it.  But then he "buried" it, and now he won't spend time in the same room with it.  It's only been 24 hours, but I doubt that he will eat it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  For the first few days, I had to force feed part of it to him, and now he really really likes them.  I am not sure whether it's helping his teeth, though.

review/summary: The ultimate cat treat  & DIY pill pocket
review/text: I can't say whether or not this is helping my cats' dental health b/c I don't feed it regularly enough; it's pretty expensive. I will say that it is, however, a very powerful treat for my critters -- they go CRAZY for these, leaping and crying. Other treats don't have this effect. I discovered recently these make good DIY "pill pockets". One cat is on a short course of antibiotic and steroid pills and he's impossible to pill by any normal method, so I've been taking a paring knife and boring tiny holes into these treats and stuffing in 1 pill per hole. Pill problem solved! I'm actually buying more in case I need to pill them in the future.

review/summary: One cat doesn't eat it & the other throws up after eating it
review/text: This was recommended to me by my vet so I'm sure that you can probably get a sample to see if your cats will eat it or whether they'll just play with it.<br /><br />The Chews are surrounded by this plastic "wrapper-like" outer coat which I assume is to make it harder for the cats to chew through and thus help brush away the tartar. However, my cats wouldn't eat it unless I broke it up into little pieces and took away the outside "wrapper," which I think defeats the purpose of giving them the chews in the first place. If I didn't break them up, they would just play with it and bat it around like a toy and it would just end up under my fridge.<br /><br />My cat who did eat it has thrown up every single time from it. I don't know why - maybe it doesn't sit well with her.<br /><br />Wish I hadn't bought the 96 count...probably will donate it to an animal shelter, maybe they'll have better luck.

review/summary: Cat hated it!
review/text: I bought this product on recommendation from my mother-in-law who claims it worked wonders in cleaning her cat's teeth and that her cat loved these things.  Well I have a 5 year old cat who has pretty serious dental disease, so I purchased these hoping they would help.  Unfortunately, my cat really dislikes these treats.  She won't even eat them when she's starving and that's saying a lot.  I thought at first that it was because the treats were too big (wine cork size), so I cut them up into thirds and she still won't touch them.  They smell fishy to me, so I'm not sure why she doesn't like them.  She did eat a few bits of it when I first gave them to her, but since then has decided this isn't for her.<br /><br />I don't care how good a product is at removing tartar/plaque, if the cats don't like it, they don't eat it and then it's useless to me.  I don't know if I should have tried the poultry flavor, but I doubt that she'd like that flavor either.<br /><br />If you're considering getting these, I suggest you get the small quantity just in case your cat is like mine and hates these.

The cats absolutely hate their cat chews! The first time I tried to give them each one, they sniffed at it, and one cat actually bit into it, but promptly spit it back out. The other cat wouldn't even try that. I tried a couple more times, but both cats will not eat them. Now when I give my Dal her chew the cats try to steal that away from her. So I wish these cat chews were more like the dog chews. I can not recommend this product for cats. (But to be honest, my Dal will eat them!)

NOT SO.<br /><br />I don't know what they did, but the nutrient count is different.  The regular pumpkin has 300% of daily requirements for Vitamin A, and 2% of Vitamin C and Calcium.  The Pie Mix has only 90% of Vitamin A; and no measurable Vitamin C.  Calcium remains the same.<br /><br />Other differences are that there are over twice as many Carbs in the Pie Mix, and 2 grams less Fiber and 1 gram less Protein.  Iron is the same in both products.  There is also no Vitamin E in the Pie Mix.<br /><br />In my opinion the Pie Mix is not a bad product, it's just an inferior one.  And while it's not a big deal that I accidentally chose the wrong Libby's product, I don't intend to buy the Pie Mix again, and here's why.  I have a boy who is not a veggie and fruit fan.  He will however eat pie and he likes Pumpkin Pie which is awesome because it can be chock-a-block full of Vitamin A, with a good dose of E and C and Calcium thrown in.  And if I just have one opportunity to fill the Vitamin void, I want to stuff in as much nutrients as possible.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/a sometimes sneaky one at that

review/summary: It's god
review/text: These were purchased, not only for myself, but also for my son away in college. He absolutely loves it. After he got his friends hooked on it, they decided to call it 'god'. It is very spicy and very good. The price here is very reasonable. I also sent them to Iraq and Afghanistan for our soldiers, they wrote me said this is the gourmet ramen. If you prefer not so spicy, you could scale back what you put in from the spice pack. You could also get fancy by adding vegetables(fresh or frozen)/mushrooms, meat/shrimp.

review/summary: Great ramen noodles
review/text: Great product.  Comes with noodles, spice packet, and vegetable packet.  These noodles are spicy as other reviewers have mentioned.  You can decrease the hotness by only adding a little of the spice packet.  I didn't care for the vegetable packet, but that is a personal choice.  These cook up nicely in the microwave in about 3 minutes, comparable to other store bought ramen noodles. ENJOY! :)

review/summary: Yummy!!!
review/text: I took a chance based upon the reviews here.  I had never tried this before or even heard of it before checking out the Amazon grocery deals.  Figured, how bad could ramen be, right?  Well, was I ever pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />First, each package is larger than the normal pack that one would buy at a traditional supermarket. Hint: it is supposed to be for two people.  Yeah, well, I don't share well.  LOL  Secondly, the spice packet is spicier than any other I have tried and boy is it hot and very tasty!!!  As others have mentioned do NOT put the whole packet in at once if you are just having this as noodles (not in soup).  Add some, taste, mix, add some more, until you find the taste which is right for YOU.<br /><br />Be creative!  Add some veggies or stir in an egg when it is cooking.  There are so many things you can do with this and not just eat plain noodles!  If you only use a little of the spice packet then save it to use when cooking other things like chicken or such.  Have fun in the kitchen!!!!<br /><br />By the way, I just ordered these in December '08 and noticed that the exp date is July '09.  That is fine for me as I intend to use it in the next 6-7 months but just a heads up for anyone else out there.

review/text: Great spicy Korean style noodle.  since one pack is 2 servings, I often use half the noodles but the whole spice and vegetable packs for lunch to keep calories down.  Some reviewers complain about the presence of MSG but perhaps they do not know that wheat protein is about half glutamate by weignt.  Dietary MSG has been judged safe by all worldwide food regulators and is ubiquitous in natural products.

review/summary: Great Quick Fix
review/text: I am a big fan of this product. The noodles taste great and are wonderfully spicy. As suggested by the title, this provides a great quick and easy meal. The taste is SO much better than american ramen. If you eat american ramen, I totally recommend that you try this brand. It will change your ramen worldview, truly. With that said, I would not eat this ramen everyday. It is quite unhealthy with high calories, high sodium, and yes, MSG. But as an occasional treat, this is perfect.

review/summary: A Heavy Dose of Salt along with Cayenne Pepper are the Primary Tastes
review/text: This is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Salt and a heavy dose of Red Pepper.  Add an egg - then it tastes much better. Chop up some scallion and it improves even more.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup yet I like it. It consists of a large packet of dried noodles (almost tasteless yet containing 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a spice packet consisting largely of salt and red (cayenne) pepper. However -------- don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper to many soup lovers.<br /><br />Makes about 2 1/2 cups of soup.<br /><br />Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. For many - I'd think they would call this soup at least "medium hot" but for most it would be " very hot". However the heat level is easily moderated by adding less of the salt/spice packet.<br /><br />Yet the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are largely tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal.<br /><br />This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup.<br /><br />I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything "hot". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is more appropriate and 1 star is more appropriate for this soup without an egg?<br /><br />I'd also suggest using only half of the spice packet if this is the first time you've tasted the soup. Even after it is fully cooked you can add more of the spice packet if the "heat" is less than you desire. I prefer about two thirds of the spice packet and since that is hard to measure I'll mix in more (after cooking) if the soup seems a bit too dull. That is rarely the case and a full spice packet seems to kill every other taste.<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: ONE PACKET OF THIS SOUP HAS 90% of your daily allowance of Salt and 40% of your allowed saturated fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). This soup is best served no more than once a month! It is one those processed foods that really should be avoided or enjoyed sparingly. In fact, very few of the soup's ingredients are even recognizable as a food<br /><br />THIS SAME SOUP HAS OTHER REVIEWS AND CAN BE PURCHASED IN VARIOUS QUANTITIES ON AMAZON. IT IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON AMAZON. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. You may want to hunt for the best deal if you are interested.<br /><br />Best Buy: Purchase this soup in 30 package box and you'll pay about the same (per package) as a 20 package box BUT YOU'LL GET FREE SHIPPING

review/text: These noodles are awesome, but the price this seller is charging with shipping ends up costing me more than if I just buy them from my local grocery store. We just bought 2 cases (40 packages) in December that were sold by Amazon, therefore we qualified for the free shipping and they were $8 cheaper than this item. Wish I could buy them in bulk and we would continue to do so if we could get them the way we had in the past. I guess for now I will give my money to my local grocery store.

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: This is simply the best spicy ramen out there. A great kimchi-style flavor that will make you want more even when you're already full. Unlike most ramen brands that incorrectly call themselves "spicy," this one actually does have a little kick to it, though it's not that intense if you are a spicy food aficionado. And ABSOLUTELY DO PUT THE ENTIRE SPICE PACKAGE IN!!! If that's too much spice for you, you have no business eating this in the first place. Go buy a fake "oriental flavor" ramen and eat that instead.<br /><br />I suggest adding some cabbage, bean sprouts, a couple of slices of pork, and an egg. If you have some kimchi (and everybody should have a jar of it), put a few pieces in instead of the cabbage. To make it even better, add just a little bit of sesame oil.<br /><br />Buy a case and hide it from the family, or it will be gone quickly.

review/text: I recently purchased this item since these are my husband's all time favorite ramen noodles. Unfortunately, these noodles arrived with an expiration date of early February 2009. So now my husband has to eat 40 packages of ramen in the next 5 months, which averages out to 8 a month. My husband loves junk food as much as the next guy, but even he would not consume this much ramen in such a short time! If I had known that these were going to expire so soon, I would have never bought them. This is not the first grocery item I've bought from Amazon that has a close expiration date. In summary, don't buy this product unless you want to eat a lot of noodles in a short period of time...

review/summary: Taste Specialty Black Mustard Seeds Really Cut the Mustard!
review/text: Black mustard seeds provide a potent kick to many Eastern and Western cuisines.  I use them to make homemade prepared mustard -- easy as can be and much better than store-bought varieties.  There are three general categories of mustard seed: white, brown, and black.  White is the least potent, and black is the most. Brown is in the middle.  I like my homemade prepared mustard to have a complex depth of flavor, so I use all three types.  The mustard-y properties of the seeds are activated by water, which provides another way to control the potency of the mixture: adding cold water will yield a stronger mustard, while warmer water will mellow the taste.<br /><br />The most simple preparation of mustard is Chinese-style, which is just a mixture of powdered mustard seed, water, and a dash of oil.<br /><br />Basic Prepared Mustard Recipe<br /><br />1 measure* of mustard seed (one type or a mix of all three)<br />1 measure of liquid (can be water only or a mix of water with other ingredients such as wine, beer, vinegar -- I like to use 1/2 measure of ice cold water, 1/4 to 1/2 measure of cold white wine, and up to 1/4 measure of homemade wine vinegar)<br />1 teaspoon good quality oil (extra virgin olive oil)<br /><br />* A "measure" can be any set volume amount.  I typically make about 1 cup at a time, so my "measure" is 1/2 cup.<br /><br />Preparation:<br /><br />Place the mustard seeds in a glass bowl (I use this type: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y9AJB4">Snapware Glasslock Glass Storage Containers with Lids 18pc Set Nesting Design</a>) and add the liquid ingredients.  Cover and soak in the refrigerator overnight.<br /><br />The next day, place the contents of the bowl in a blender or food processor and pulse until most of the seeds are bruised or crushed.<br /><br />If you want a grainy mustard ("whole grain" mustard) remove 1/2 to 2/3 of the mustard and place back into the soaking jar.  Then, continue to pulse or blend the mustard that remains in the blender/processor until smooth.  Place the smooth mustard in the bowl and stir to blend.<br /><br />If you want a smoother mustard, just blend/process all of the mustard until the desired consistency is achieved.<br /><br />A word of caution: Do NOT stick your face over the opening of the blender/processor to inhale the aroma of freshly prepared mustard -- you WILL understand why they called it "Mustard Gas" in World War I.<br /><br />For more potent mustard, do not allow the blender/processor to heat the mixture.  If needed, stop blending, re-chill the mixture, and blend again.<br /><br />Feel free to add honey, salt to taste, black or white pepper, jalapenos, horseradish or any other flavorings.<br /><br />Keep the mustard in the covered glass container.  It will continue to become more potent over a few days (the exact number of days will depend on your preparation), after which the potency will slowly decline.<br /><br />Homemade prepared mustard makes an excellent gift.  And, after tasting, your friends will DEMAND more.  I keep a supply of jars like these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IHJ40M">Bormioli Rocco Fido Storage Jar - Wire Bail - 200 mL</a> for giving.

review/text: This is a good treat for your cat, if he/she likes it. Some do not. I'd suggest a new customer w/ a cat who has never had the treat get a small bag  and not invest in the large one incase the cat refuses it.  My cat likes the hygene chews and I like to treat her regularly. However, they in no way take the place of any other dental cleaning from your vet or regular toothbrushing you can do yourself. This product can not remove any tartar or plaque on the cat's teeth, only a scaling will do that.  If you cat likes them fine, but dont depend on this for your cat's dental health.<br /><br />BTW this produict is available from various sources. Try searching for better prices if esp. you choose to go with the larger size.

review/summary: My cats love them!
review/text: My cats love love love these treats. They're decent size, so they keep the boys busy for quite a while. The older cat had some pretty horrible breath before I started giving him one of these once a day. Now I can barely smell it. They're a little on the expensive side, but it's much cheaper and safer than a full cleaning from the vet.

review/text: I purchased these for a number of months and gave them to my cat who suffers from gingivitis.  However, the last couple of bags I purchased, the product was yellowy and did not look or smell fresh.  I threw them out and have not ordered any more.  I think that the manufacturer needs to improve their QC.<br /><br />No, I did not complain because frankly I don't have the time or the energy to fight these types of situations.  I just won't order any more.

review/summary: CET Chews are great, Amazon, not so great
review/text: The CET chews are fantastic in keeping my cat's teeth clean.  However Amazon has buckled under to a group called "Color of Change" with is a race-centered extreme leftist group that is extorting companies to drop affiliation with a business group called ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council).  Color of Change was founded by Van Jones, an avowed radical with a race-based agenda that has been exposed by his own words caught on tape.  Caving in to such race-based political groups that oppose the free market system is a losing proposition and is a sure way to lose customers such as myself.  My latest purchase of these CET chews tonight was not made at Amazon but at another company. Amazon needs to disassociate itself from race-based hate groups and re-join with ALEC to support the free market.

review/summary: My cat loves them and the seller was great
review/text: I was worried that my cat would not like these and was hesitant to buy this many.  I purchased a smaller bag and my cat LOVES them.<br /><br />So I purchased this much larger bag at Amazon's much better price via Amazon from Entirely Pets.  Again, I was worried about the seller based on other comments.  But they were ordered on Sunday, and I got them Tuesday morning - they ship from Fremont, CA.  The expiration date on the bag is 16 months from now, about what I would get in any retail store.  So I've just not experienced any problems with this seller or this product.<br /><br />The manufacturer admits that brushing your cat's teeth is much better, and I do that about every other day.  This product ensures that there is at least something done for his teeth every day.  And trust me, my cat does not let me forget to give him one of these every night.  He'll claw at my legs until I do and his claws are sharp!<br /><br />By the way, one tip for cat owners: many of an older cat's problems are due to the propensity of most cats not to drink enough water: kidney and teeth problems are common.  I feed my cat only a teaspoon of wet food a day, smothered in about 2 ounces of water.  He drinks the wet-food-flavored water and only then gets to eat the wet food.  My cat is 19 years old (the average cat lives to be about 12-14 years old) and has had no major health problems.  However, the teeth cleanings are getting to be too stressful for him, so I've taken to these treats and brushing his teeth to try to spread out the cleanings.

review/summary: Well priced through Amazon
review/text: I have been purchasing these treats at the recommendation of the vet to help with my cat's tarter build ups.  When they are chewed they release enzymes into kitty's mouth to help fight against the tarter.<br /><br />What really surprised me is the price difference, I was paying about $12 at the vet for a 30 pack.  When I did the math on buying the 90 pack + S&H, it's about the same amount I would pay for two 30 packs -- so I got 30 more, another month's supply!<br /><br />Also, Entirely Pets shipped this very promptly.  I ordered on Labor Day Weekend and it arrived on the following Thursday.  Good Service!

review/text: I own 2 burmese cats and have always had problems with there teeth. So much that both cats have had to have teeth taken out. I recently went to a new vets and they put me on to CET Oral Hygiene Chews. I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />First up my cats went crazy over these chews. My cats normally don't like chews or treats. They pritty much just eat cat food. However they love these chews and they would eat them all if given to them or they could open the container I have them in.<br /><br />After using them for 4 months, my cats went back to the vets for a checkup. The vets were taken back how effective these chews were. Strange given the vets recommended them to me. No more red gums and only a little build up of plaque.

He's at least 11 years old and has had multible teeth cleanings so i know how bad his breath can be. he recently had a checkup and the vet said he was in great shape for being so old. i gave them 4 stars because i was unable to track or check status on my package. it made me uneasy that my package may have been lost.

review/summary: They actually work!
review/text: In September 2009, my vet gave me a few of the fish-flavored chews when I picked my cat up from his teeth cleaning surgery. I wasn't sure about them, but my cat's 12, needs a special canned-food diet, & he needed anesthetized teeth cleaning every year. I figured anything to reduce the number of time he gets anesthetized was worth a try.<br /><br />She told me to break up the first chew so the cat would bite into the flavored part instead of the wierd-feeling wrapper. The cat was a bit dubious about it at first, but he was hooked within 2 treats & learned to bite through immediately. Now he begs for the things and pounces with great glee when I toss one across the floor each night.<br /><br />I feed him 1 treat soon after his canned food. He takes about 10 seconds to eat it & clean up the crumbs. He just had a 7-month check up & there's not a speck of tartar on his teeth. The vet said she'd never have guessed he was 11 or ate canned food! His breath has been great, too.<br /><br />My only reservation is that I think the company may have changed the formula with the last batch I bought. They are more yellow than tan, & smell icky to me. The original chews smelled fine. My cat was ... less than enthused about the change, but he still eats them willingly. I'm not sure if I could have gotten him hooked with the new formula, but he did eventually come to accept it.<br /><br />Overall score: effectiveness-10, taste/smell-4. Try a small bag to see if your cat can be convinced to like the chews, then buy in bulk for savings.

review/summary: Made my kitten sick.
review/text: First off, my kittens loved these treats. They figured out right away what they're suppose to do with them and became their top most favorite treats.  Unfortunately after 6 weeks of vomiting and diarrhea for my little boy involving 3 vet visits at hundreds of dollars through trial and error I was able to determine that these treats were the culprit.<br /><br />They were well loved, appeared to work,  and caused no issues with my girl kitten so I still give them 4 stars.  But if your cat starts experiencing mystery GI issues with these just try discontinuing them for a few days and se if it helps.  I haven't asked my vet what about these might be the issue yet but I will next time I visit.

review/summary: Took some time but worth it
review/text: I purchased these chews for my cat as he had BAD cat breath. Initially, when I gave the treat he sniffed it and walked away. So I made a change and cut his cat food down from one cup a day (big cat) to 1/2 of a cup. By the second day he was willing to take the treat from a plate on the floor but wouldnt take it from my hand.<br />By day five, he took it from my hand. Once he took it from my hand I added back his 2 Whiskas Temptations treats that he received daily. After the first week I noticed the BAD breath became much beter. Now into our 3rd week he looks forward to me returning home and begs (he was a stray and already knew how to beg, lucky me) for his treats. The CET is the last treat he receives. His food was increased back to 3/4 of a cup as he needs to lose a bit. His breath again is much much much better and I am sold. I may try the chicken next time but for some reason the fish was $3 cheaper for the same amount. I did put half of the bag into one of his previous plastic treat jars as it was a pain to keep opening and resealing this big package. Now I just twist open the jar and Voila. Enjoy your experience.

review/summary: Virbac cat dental treats
review/text: My cat loves these.  Unfortunately, he ended up with a bacterial infection from an unknown source, and we had to stop all kinds of foods and put him on a veterinary prescription diet.  The infection could have been from the vet's office, some food he ate, or even the original breeder's house.  We have no other cats, so he wasn't infected at home via another cat).  These chews did an excellent job keeping his teeth clean, but were not as effective with his gums.  I am really looking forward to getting him back on these chews so that at least his teeth will be healthy.  We have to wait for his allergy tests to come back to find out what he is allergic to.  As soon as we get the green light from our vet, I am going to put him back onto the chews.  I would recommend them to any cat owner looking to improve his or her cat's teeth.

review/summary: My cats won't eat them
review/text: I am desperate to find a good dental product for one of my cats, and I hoped this one would do the trick. The reviews sounded positive, but you never know until you try it with your cat. The treats are quite large for a cat's mouth, in my opinion - about the size of a wine cork. The idea is that the cat will have to chew it for awhile, and it will do its tartar-control thing. My cat expressed some interest by sniffing and licking it a little, but he didn't attempt to eat it. I then tried cutting the treat into smaller pieces, thinking that if I got him hooked, he would eventually take the full-sized treat and get the full benefit from the chewing. He ate one little piece one time and then never again. My other cat, who has healthy teeth and gums, did eat one full-sized treat once but didn't go for it the next time. So we'll try something else, which is fine. I do wish there had been a smaller bag of these treats available so I could test them out first.

One of my cats loved them, she actually carried it around with her before eating it. It's kind of like a toy for her, which gives her something to do. The other cat turned her nose up and walked away. I haven't been feeding them long enough to my cats to comment on whether they reduce tartar and build up, but I do give my dog these same treats (the dog chews) and they help her breath and teeth SO much. Every time I take her to the vet, they comment on how clean her teeth are. So I'm hoping it will help my cats teeth out that much also.

Given their propensity for cleaning themselves inches away from my face at three in the morning, that is plenty of reason for me to buy this product.<br /><br />Also - while the cats all are thrilled by food of any sort, they are particularly nuts about these treats.  The sound of rustling cellophane brings them all running.  If I'm not careful they'll climb my legs to get them.  And I have to toss them to different parts of the house so that each cat gets to eat in peace, with no treat stealing or fights.

The previous purchase, in Nov, the first price was around $25, but I looked and looked (including Entirely Pets' home site), then came back to Amazon and the price was lowed to $18.55! They're tracking us--Entirely Pets, not sure if Amazon is involved in this. I don't trust Entirely Pets.<br /><br />So, it's almost $9 more now, 2 months later. I bet if I wait another day, the price will go down more.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good product. My three cats like it, and with brushing teeth, oral rinse, and the chews, they have good teeth. Haven't had to have a cleaning for about 2 years. It is overpriced--$20 would be fair. They're gouging us.<br /><br />There's also Enzadent Chews, from Vet Solutions. They're cheaper right now, at Amazon. Still from Entirely Pets. I'm looking elsewhere.

review/summary: a treat, a toy and a toothbrush all in one
review/text: After a little experimentation with these treats, they have become a staple in our home.<br />Our little cat would not, and could not bite into these treats as they are in their full size.  I'm not sure if it was the size, shape or smell of them, but she was not interested.<br />They are unlike any other cat treat I've seen.  They are styrofoam in consistency and are big - - about the size of a wine bottle cork.<br />The first thing I did was use a utility knife to slice each treat into 3 pieces - - a bit time consuming because I didn't want them to crumble.<br />The second thing I did was roll one of them across the floor.  She took off after it, bit it, realized it tasted yummy, ate it and came back for more.<br />That's all it took and we now have a daily routine that combines playtime, snacktime and toothbrushing all into one.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I came to the site looking for C.E.T. dog chews which my vet recommended for my dog.  That's when I noticed they also made the cat chews.  I have three "finicky" cats, so was skeptical about their liking the chews, but decided to try the fish flavor ones anyway.  Well, the cats went crazy over these, in fact I had to hide the bag as they had ripped through it looking for more.  I have noticed improvement in my oldest cats breath.

review/summary: cat loves these and they are doing the job
review/text: I do notice a difference in my cat's teeth...these are the same brand my vet sells for about half the cost on Amazon.  Fish flavor is his favorite and they are making a difference in the stain and tartar on his teeth .... it only takes one per week to keep his teeth looking great.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: My cats love these treats.  One crawls up my leg trying to get his treat and the other one jumps up on the counter before I can even get the bag open.  I don't know how well they work as far as helping to keep their teeth clean but they sure do love 'em.

review/text: Excellent for dental health - cats go crazy for it. Price is best I've found, but still pricey. These stay fresh for a few months, so don't be afraid to buy large bag. Cons: some cats just don't have a taste for these.

review/summary: CET cat chews  fish
review/text: I have used these cat chews for a year now. I give our kitty one in the morning and one in the evening. They have done wonders for the teeth!<br /><br />Last year, our cats teeth were so bad that she had to have one extracted when she had her teeth cleaned. This year, her teeth looked so good the vet said they didn't even need a cleaning. Vet had told me they worked but I can now attest to that, first hand!<br /><br />The bonus is ... she loves them!

review/summary: Great cat treats
review/text: CET Chews for Cats ECONOMY (96 chews) Fish Flavor<br /><br />We originally tried the CET Chews for Cats (fish flavor) when a friend gave us a small bag. Our cats went nuts for these treats. After their last vet checkup we knew that they needed something for their teeth. We mix up their treats giving them the CET Chews every 2 or 3 days. We're on the second 96 count bag and they still love them. We haven't been back to the vet to know if the chews have had an effect on the teeth yet, but as long as they keep loving them we'll keep buying them.

review/summary: For cats who won't brush their fangs
review/text: We have 2 cats. One eats a varied diet that includes a healthy bowl of dry food which is good for her teeth. The other is so finicky, she drives us nuts. She only eats wet food and only certain flavors and certain brands.<br /><br />Even at the young age of 2, she was having gum problems and looking at a future of early tooth loss (devastating to the ego of a cat).<br /><br />This cat is not a pet-able cat. Don't think about picking her up let alone attempt to brush her teeth, if you value your eyes, your life, etc. This cat is a killer (but we love her anyways and are trying to keep her out of jail).<br /><br />A new younger vet arrived. He suggested these chews for cat number 2 to improve her gums and perhaps prevent her from losing teeth at a young age.<br /><br />She LOVES them. (The FISH flavor NOT the poultry.) She begs for them on her first bowl of wet (of course) food every morning. She lies to the 3 of us humans: after human 1 gives her a chew, she tells human 2 that she has not had a chew yet today, please give me one. Then she tells human 3 that humans 1 and 2 forgot to give her a chew and she gets chew number 3.<br /><br />Or maybe she is not lying because cat number 1 likes them too but the vet did not prescribe them for her. I know she sneaks over to cat number 2s bowl and snatches a chew now and then.<br /><br />Not cheap but well worth the price because cat number 2s gums and teeth have improved. Vet has given up (as have we) on trying to get her to eat dry food.

review/summary: The price is right
review/text: My vet recommended these treats to help with my cats tartar build up. The treats come in a wrapper which I think is edible but I take it off. One cat LOVES these treats and the other won't touch them. But...the AMZN price is so so much cheaper (about 1/3 the cost) than the vets price. I wouldn't buy them anywhere but AMZN.

review/summary: Great Cat Chews but horrible seller. Buy from other seller.
review/text: This seller by far is the only terrible seller I have dealt with from Amazon.<br />The Cat Chews arrived without any expiration date printed on the bags and most of them have changed to a very yellowy color. My two cats won't touch those with a off color. So, I have contacted the seller and someone over there told me to send them back for an exchange. I did that, and called the seller one month later since nobody contacted me and neither did I receive the exchanged product. After calling many times, I gave up and contacted Amazon.com. Since everytime, the person answered the phone told me that he can't do anything and the manager will call me back and he never did. After 5 of this phone calls, I decided I've wasted too much of my time and it's better to direct the issue to Amazon.com. And Amazon has made it so easy for me. They filed the claim and did the refund. I'll keeping shopping with Amazon, but not with this seller anymore. They are many other sellers carry the same Cat Chews.

review/summary: Why Add Sugar To Dental Chews?
review/text: Be aware that this product contains a form of sugar (dextrose) and is listed on the label as one of the main ingredients. To me this makes about as much sense as putting sugar in toothpaste. I love my cats. I'm definitely not feeding them something that can lead to tooth decay.

review/text: My vet introduced me to these chews to help with keeping my cats teeth and gums healthy.  My cats love them.  It's hard to tell how effective these kinds of products are at living up to the health promise.  At worst they are a well received treat and maybe they have healthier teeth.

review/summary: one of my cats loves them
review/text: I have 2 cats, one male and one female.  The male is crazy about these.  I just discovered that he got the bag, ripped it open and ate them all.  I had started with a small bag to be sure at least one of them liked them, so not too bad a loss. The female just sniffed and walked away, but she is not crazy about fish flavored treats anyway.  I just reordered a big bag of the poultry flavored ones.  I am sure the male will like them and I hope the female goes for these as her teeth are the worst of the 2 of them.
