review/text: This is a nice smooth cup. If you are looking for a brew that will scream "THIS IS A CUP OF COFFEE DAMN-IT" it is not for you. No, this cup has good flavor, and is a nice mello brew, great for a mid morning or early afternoon pick-me-up if you are not participating in a decathalon event. If that is what you are looking for, the Tassimo concept is probably not for you. The Seattles Best is a stronger Brew. Give that a shot if you want something different with a little more kick.

review/summary: Defective T-Discs
review/text: After trying several packages of the Signature Blend all with different product codes, I found these T-Discs to be defective.  Most of the grounds ended up in the bottom of my cup and the rest spewed all over my coffeemaker!  I notified Gevalia over a month ago and they have not offered any explanation or solution to this problem.  I have not had this problem with any other brand of T-disc or other Gevalia blends.  It is extremely frustrating considering I am paying extra for the Gevalia name. I would recommend Maxwell House or Seattle's Best being far superior in the T-Discs with no grounds in the bottom of your cup.

review/summary: Gevalia coffee good; customer service - AWFUL
review/text: Some of gevalia's coffee is good.  But their customer service is the worst and most unreasonable I've ever dealt with.  I was having coffee delivered 20 years ago with automatic payment through my bank.  I changed my bank and forgot to change Gevalia to the new bank so one shipment came without me paying on time.  Instead of calling or notifying there was a problem they cancelled all service, even though I paid them immediately on finding out what the problem was - why I wasn't getting coffee.  Then a few months ago I thought I'd give them a try again.  They blocked all my efforts to sign up without an explanation so I called -waited 20 minutes to get a person on the phone - who then finally said they'd "let me" start delivery again.  I got 2 deliveries then all of a sudden my deliveries were "suspended" without explanation.  I contacted them and they said they couldn't deliver to me because of the non-payment (which I paid) 20 years earlier!!  That's after I paid for 2 deliveries.  I explained I had already worked that out - look at your records.  They said basically - too bad.  I have a credit score > 800.  I can buy a $600,000 house w/o problems - yet I can't get this ridiculous company to continue deliveries to me.  They disgust me.

review/text: While these bars were a good "deal" versus the supermarket price, I was pretty disappointed to find that the expiration date on the individual packages is May of this year.  Normally, you would find a much further out date.  I believe these were overstocked and dumped onto customers via Amazon.  They also are kind of dry and hard versus ones I purchased at the supermarket, likely for the same reason.  My kids didn't like them, either, even when we went on a roadtrip and they were the only thing in the car to eat-- that's saying a lot! I ended up throwing them all away. Obviously don't recommend.

review/text: My wife picked up a pack of Kellog's Special K Bars (blueberry variety). I'm not sure why because both of us tend to avoid such products. I guess maybe they're for the baby, because he's the one who's getting them. He likes them, of course. After he's done with his main meal, he often says "bar'" as if asking for a little desert treat and I know exactly what he means. He wants one of the Special K Bars. Well, OK, but I' somewhat against giving him this kind of "candy" food. One thing is certain, he likes the bars and one bar will calm him down.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

But let's not get technical.  I, for one, don't expect a lot of realism from commercial, microwavable soup; do you?<br /><br />Taken for what it is, it's darn good.  Just don't expect to feel like you've just landed in New Orleans (or better, the outskirts).  Be realistic and enjoy a good lunch.<br /><br />This is a hearty, fairly nutritious concoction of its own, with enough resemblance to its origins to at least give you the idea.

review/summary: Not As Good (Tasting) As I Would Have Liked, But Filling
review/text: As I stated in my review of Campbell's Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta soup, I am a family man with the normal trappings of American society; i.e. a mortgage, car payment, insurance payments, children in school, medical bills, grocery bills, well you get the picture.  I am therefore frugal by design, because I do like to save a little of what I make.  That means that I rarely buy my lunch in the company-sponsored cafeteria, or at a local (sit down or take-out) restaurant.  I bring my lunch to work every day sometimes in the guise of "Campbell's Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo" in an 18.6 oz can or 15.25 oz microwave bowl.<br /><br />The soup brand, whose tag line used to be "so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,"  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber, but Campbell's "Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo" contains a scant 2.5 grams per serving.<br /><br />According to Campbell's its "Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo" is a zesty gumbo loaded with chunks of grilled chicken, sausage and vegetables like celery, red and green peppers plus lots of rice in a savory seasoned broth and has just 140 calories and comfortably low 2.5 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous portions of both chicken, sausage, rice and the other trappings of gumbo this hearty bowl is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.69 per microwave bowl at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?  However, the taste of this particular variety of Chunk Soup is a little light on flavoring despite the rather generous 850mg of sodium.<br /><br />Nutritional Information<br />Ingredients: Water, Diced Tomatoes in Tomato Juice, Rice, Tomato Puree (Water, Tomato Paste), Cooked White Chicken Meat, Cooked Andouille Sausage (Pork, Water, Seasonings [Spices, Dextrose, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder], Salt, Hickory Char Oil [Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Natural Woodsmoke Flavor], Sodium Nitrite), Celery, Okra, Green Peppers,<br />Servicing information: One serving (1 Cup) of "Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo" contains 140 Calories, 2.5 grams of fat (including 1 gram of saturated fat), 15mg of Cholesterol, 850mg of Sodium, 21 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of dietary fiber, 4 grams of sugar, and 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />There is always plenty of Campbell's Chucky Soup in the pantry at my house.  It is by-and-large the only kind I buy and Campbell's "Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo" figures highly on my shopping list each week.  Low in calories and fat, Campbell's "Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo" somewhat bland, but ultimately filling alternative to burger and fries, and even a sandwich and chips.  And most importantly if fills me up until my mid-afternoon snack.

review/text: Yellow grits have not been available in our local supermarkets for quite some time, so when I needed some to make my new favorite, Zea's Corn Grits, I searched online.  The first brand that I tried made much of being "stone ground", but the texture when cooked was too coarse for the dish.  These Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Corn Grits were my second purchase, and they have the perfect texture.  They cook quickly and are full of good corn flavor.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I am from the South and yes, I've eaten a lot of grits in my life. Except for most of it I ate traditional white style. Until I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I had to find a gluten-free version of grits that were 'safe' for me to consume. Thankfully I found Arrowhead Mills. I have eaten a bowl of Arrowhead Mills Yellow Grits nearly every day for several years now. They are without a doubt the best-tasting grits I've ever had. They are creamy and flavorful in comparision with white, and they are better tasting than some other organic brands I had to try when the store ran out of AM. They are also consistently produced and I've never had any issues with them. If you haven't tried grits before, or yellow you really are missing out!

review/summary: False Grit
review/text: I ordered this product because I was curious, it looked different from the usual grits I eat, and it was cheap. What I got was nothing more than packaged corn meal mush, just as easily made at home. It wasn't bad but I expected a little more, tastewise, than what I got. I'll stick with the traditional white hominy grits in the future. Here's hoping that they'll be available on Amazon soon.

review/summary: Just what do you mean by "organic"?
review/text: I thought this would be some kind of find, all right.  It said organic on the box, so how could I go wrong?<br /><br />Well, to me "organic" means pure and natural, as in its original state.  I got the 4-pack and put three of the boxes in the freezer so they wouldn't spoil, and then only later found that the product had been degermed. ;-(<br /><br />I wonder what they did with the germ... sold it to the health food stores?  Slopped hogs with it?  LOL<br /><br />These may be good-tasting grits, as good as you can get in the store, perhaps.  But at least this way the buyer can make an informed decision.

review/summary: Better than Tijuana Mamas
review/text: Like other reviewers, I loves me some Tijuana Mamas. But I just recently discovered these, and I like them even better.<br /><br />The ingredients are similar, but these are beefier and, I think, just a tad hotter. (I'm reviewing Screamin' Demons here. Hot Heads are almost as hot, but not as fat as Demons.)<br /><br />They're made of a soft more-or-less-meatlike substance rather than proper sausage, but if you've had Tijuana Mamas before, you'll know what to expect. These are a bit harder than TMs but with a similar texture.<br /><br />Great snack -- and if you like spicy flavors the way I do, you'll also have a good time sucking out the leftover hot vinegar after eating the sausage.<br /><br />Nutritious? Hell, you've got your pork hearts, your vinegar, your pepper extract -- that's three of the basic food groups right there. The only one missing is alcohol, and I understand it's possible to get that from supplements. ;-)

review/summary: It's not hard sausage -- more like a mushy hot dog with red food coloring added
review/text: I've been a fan of Jack Links beef jerky for a long time.  This product, however, sorta scares me now that I've tried it.  They are dyed red and don't have a sausage-like consistency at all.  That is, this isn't a hard sausage.  It's like highly processed meat (including pork hearts!).  Under the red skin, they're really mushy, almost like p�t&eacute; or a soft hot dog.  An individually wrapped red, soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good, but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.  Make sure to try one before buying in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not condemning the product or people who like it.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Hurts So Good!
review/text: OMG these things are HOT and not for the faint of tongue! And that's from someone who is no wimp when it comes to spicy. But I love them. If I rinse the "juice" off under running water for about 20 seconds and make sure I have a drink (or fire extinguisher) at hand, they are really good. And unlike the delicious but addictive beef sticks, one is enough.<br /><br />The Jack Links Hot Heads are good too, and not as hot as these things, but the taste and texture aren't quite up to the Demons. If you can handle the heat, you'll probably like these. I would give them a 5 if they weren't quite so hot. But then I'm eating one as I write this, so maybe I'm especially sensitive right this minute. :)

review/text: A few years back Jack Link Hot Heads were my favorite hot sausages. Somehow, as at least one reviewer shares, they developed a texture issue. The once firm, hot-dog like texure was replaced with a pate-like tube...which I did not care for.<br />Well, I recently decided to give them another try. Lo and behold! They're back to the orginal firmness! And still very tasty too!<br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Awesome snack!!!
review/text: I have always liked these things (Screamin' Demon), and usually grab one on my way out of town to the beach.  But now that I'm pregnant and craving spicy stuff, I can't get enough of them!!!  The sodium content is high, so I have to watch it.  But the vinegar settles an icky tummy (believe it or not!), and the hotness has me going about cross-eyed...which is good for me because I like spicy stuff.  It really hurts tho if you get any of the juice under your tongue...that's tender meat under there!  However, if you're prone to heartburn, like I am, you'll be suffering a few hours later...have the Tums ready!  Overall, completely worth the suffering after eating it!

review/text: I buy these from local gas stations all the time. I grew up getting "tiajuana mama's" and Ficher's "red hots" from local stores. Jack Links has produced a similar product that I find tastier than anything else I have tried. If you like pickeled food with a vinegar taste (eggs, kosher pickles, sausage or most anything you would find in an interstate truckstop) you wont be disappointed with these.

review/text: I absolutely love Darrell Lea licorice, especially the strawberry and apple-flavored varieties.<br /><br />I was first able to buy these at the Duty Free store here in the Philippines, and decided to order them via Amazon when the Duty Free store ran out of stock. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the licorice Darrell Lea exported to the US was better in quality, using only natural colors and flavors.<br /><br />These are less colorful in appearance than the variant I first tried, owing to the use of natural colorants. The flavors taste natural (and better) as well.

review/summary: A Gift from Oz
review/text: This caught my eye today while shopping and although it was a toss-up between green apple and mango, I went with the former. Not to belabor the point but this is wonderful licorice--nice chew with a bright, natural flavor cut to a shortish length that affords the satisfaction of holding it to bite off a chew...but only once (not a bad thing--it keeps one from compulsively popping bite-size pieces). I can't speak for the other flavors (YET) but green apple's a winner, clearly due to the care the manufacturer has put into her product which includes simple ingredients of fine quality. And FWIW, it's both vegetarian and kosher. By all means, give Darrell Lea's licorice a try--I don't think you'll be sorry.<br /><br />Update: I just bought a bag of the strawberry and it ROCKS; it's even better than the green apple. Be advised, though, that the Darrell Lea strawberry that my local Trader Joe's carries is artificially flavored and in a small tub; the one I bought elsewhere is in a bag and clearly labeled "NATURAL FLAVOR." Thanks to other reviewers for recommending strawberry!<br />Update again: tried the mango and while it was very nice, the strawberry--IMHO--continues to reign supreme. In fact, I intend to pick up another bag today. :)

review/text: This brand is my absolute favorite brand of licorice. I usually get Strawberry, but I bought this green apple for my girlfriend, since that is her favorite flavor. It's good, but not as flavorful as I thought it might be for green apple. The strawberry has such a full flavor and just what I would expect. I just knock it down one star, because I like a really tart green apple flavor, and this is very mild. Wonderful product, though, and it is natural so I understand that's what candy tastes like without a bunch of extra flavoring. They won't lose any money on my account, however. I'm ordering another case of Strawberry today!

When I eat this apple kind, it makes me wonder what it is like to eat a partly dried glue stick, or perhaps a bar of deodorant. I mean, the taste is not bad, it's just such a very strange consistency. Anyway, there are a good number of flibbertigibbet reviews for this stuff, so good luck with it but I recommend the regular black kind!

review/text: It's a soup, not a stew, so don't expect more solid than liquid, although my experience is that it's about equal proportions broth to solids.  It's clearly labeled as "chicken & sausage" gumbo, so the lack of seafood should not surprise.<br /><br />As for taste, I think it's really good.  Nicely spicy, but not overdone.  Fairly generous portions of chicken and sausage, with a nice complement of tomato, okra, celery, and bell pepper.  It's my favorite of all the Campbell and Progresso soups I've tried, and it's on my Subscribe and Save order.<br /><br />Interestingly, the "lower fat" (5 calories per serving less but equal percentage overall), lower sodium (replaced by potassium) version, which is understandably less tasty, has more calories (10 per serving).

Be sure to remember to add the caraway seeds near the end of the working of the dough as this is what REALLY enhances the flavor.

review/summary: Pretty good and much better than canned
review/text: This tuna is sustainably caught and so far the only sustainably caught tuna that does not come in a can that I have seen. It tastes good and a lot better than canned tuna. This is important because I eat eat it from the jar. If I were to make tuna salad out of it I would opt for the cheaper canned tuna. My only complaint is that it is salty but I find most foods a little too salty.

review/summary: Delicious chips
review/text: These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right "kick",  and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.<br /><br />Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

review/summary: Pretty good so far with slight modification
review/text: I bought this dispenser to replace a Bags om Board bone dispenser which worked great until it fell off my leash and I lost it. The problem with the bone dispenser was the plastic ring that attached it to the leash popped open and the bone dispenser fell off the leash without me knowing it  --and this was after only having it for 2 weeks! I decided to order the white dispenser but wasn't too impressed with the plastic zip tie that attached it to the leash either-- as another reviewer pointed out, the end of the plastic tie irritated my hand, the tie itself couldn't be readjusted once you attached it, and I was afraid the plastic tie would eventually break off and I'd lose this dispenser too. So I removed the plastic tie and substituted a metal key ring to attach  the dispenser to my leash and so far so good! The bags are great, the metal key ring securely attaches the dispenser to my leash yet I can easily detach the key ring from my leash if I want to, and I have no problem getting the dispenser open. It's too bad the company doesn't use metal key rings instead of the cheap plastic rings and plastic zip ties-- if they did, I'd give this product a 5 instead of a 4.

review/summary: Accessorize your dog's leash!
review/text: I was skeptical and at first didn't like the bulkiness of the Bags-On-Board holder attached to my dog's leash.  But once I got used to having the holder and bags in it...it's great.  No more stuffing my pockets with large shopping bags, no more searching in garbage cans for discarded cups or bags to pick up dog poo with...I always have bags with me.  Only down side is being able to find affordable refills...which was no problem on Amazon!  I order the 120 bag refill for $6.30 (so far) and have plenty!<br /><br />The only down side to the style I have is that it is attached with an electrical zip tie and the end scratches my hand occasionally.  Bags-On-Board now offers a retractable leash with the bag holder built in...but I'm not sure of the quality of the leash or the sizes (animal weight) that it comes in.

review/text: A agree with the 1 star review posted in 2008 that this dispenser is difficult to open. I also do not like that the attachment device is a zip tie, which makes it harder to change leashes without modifications by purchaser.<br /><br />But of all the bag dispensers I've owned, this one has stood the test of time. After over a year it is showing no signs of wear or of breaking down.<br /><br />So, if you have strong hands and only ever use one leash.... this is a 5 star choice. But for me there is still room for improvement.

review/summary: Great for kitty litter disposal!
review/text: I used to salvage plastic bags from the grocery stores etc. to dispose of kitty litter waste but recently I have stopped using plastic bags and am using cloth bags for my shopping. I purchased these bags because they are the perfect size for multiple daily waste removal (the litter scoop fits right into the bag) and because they are environmentally friendly. I attached the little dispenser right onto the litter box (it comes with a plastic zip tie) and it is super convenient to have the perfect little sized bags ready to go. I have not had a problem with tearing or holes in the bags and they are easy to tie up after use. Will purchase plenty of refills!

review/summary: Bags On Board Review
review/text: We have always used "Bags on Board" for our pet clean up.  Unfortunately, this time, the container that hangs on the leash broke off and we had to purchase a new one.  I can't say how it happened because my husband was walking the dog.  However, I would not let that keep me from purchasing this product. It is lightweight, easily dispensed and, having them on the leash, makes it so simple to clean up after your dog.  Everyone should be required to carry something as a courtesy to walkers.  You can use other types of plastic bags from groceries or other purchases, but these are the most compact and easiest to carry around and use.

review/text: I bought a bag dispenser before which turned out to be a nuisance to use, and which only took refills from the company who made the dispenser.  Unacceptable.  B on B makes excellent bags and put them in an excellent dispenser.  I find the cap a little hard to get off (note: it pops off, but not easily), but I expect as it ages, that will loosen up a bit.  Perhaps the stiffness is intended to give it a longer useful life.<br /><br />BTW, I don't have a dog.  These are the bags I use for my daily scooping of my cat's litter box.

review/summary: Give this one a wait
review/text: I have two of the fire hydrant versions of this product. As my dog's name is Gunny, I just couldn't resist getting this version. I received it promptly from Amazon, but when I stuck it on the leash, the "tie" wouldn't "lock" in place. So Amazon exchanged it for another one and the same thing is wrong. I have contacted [...] in order to avoid another exchange (guessing this is a batch problem.) They got back to me in less than 12 hours and are sending me a tie. Do order this, but wait until Amazon has sold their existing units off or sent them back. It is very cute, so between that and bagsonboard's great customer service, they do deserve a 5-star. I wish there was more quality control, but most products don't seem to have any these days...

You would never guess that from the taste.<br /><br />In comparison to the Chocolate, which doesn't taste that chocolaty, the Vanilla Ice Cream tastes just like it says. Creamy and it doesn't have that sweet aftertaste that sticks around like you get with shakes that have a lot of sugar.

I love Lean Body's shakes and this is the best of them all.  I usually would not reach for Vanilla flavored anything...just chocolate.  I tried this one because it was all that was left in the gym and now I know I had been missing out.  This is the best protein shake and ...it is filling, full of nutrition, and has 40g of protein.  It is low in carbs also.  I was once an EAS Advantedge user.  This has double the protein and taste.  Warning: the air bubbles that may form while you are drinking can make you feel like something is in your drink but it is just an air bubble.  Also, it tastes good when is served cold.

review/text: After doing some research on the best RTD Protein Shakes, I've come to the conclusion that Labrada's Lean Body is the best tasting RTD out there.  I was a fan of Muscle Milk, but Labrada tastes better and gives you more protein in a similar drink size.  I also like that the drink doesn't sit in your stomach.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the price.  But if you're looking for a quick protein drink on the go, look no further.

If you are looking for a post-workout shake, this is easily digested 15-25 minutes after a hard workout.

review/text: If you're loooking for a ready-to-drink shake, try a different brand. Over the course of two months I ordered two 12-packs of the Labrada shake. Delivery was prompt, but in both cases the whey protein and other solids in every carton had separated from the liquid, congealing into a chunk that couldn't be remixed by shaking the container for as long as a minute (as the manufacturer recommends.) In one instance, getting the contents out required slicing open the carton. Once the contents had been put into a blender, the shakes were satisfactory --- creamy. delicious and filling. But not RTD. If you're going to end up using a blender or shake bottle anyway, buy Labrada meal supplements in powdered form to begin with. I've found them equally tasty (although made with sugar,) equally nutritious and you'll be getting what you expected.
