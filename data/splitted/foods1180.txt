review/summary: Good Food
review/text: Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him "Friskies" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!

review/text: Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago.  You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.  I got it because he had gingivitus and i had to spend quite a bit to have his teeth worked on.  The vet told me his teeth are still looking nice and clean a few months later!

review/text: Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that "stuff" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.

review/summary: Hills Science Diet Oral Care
review/text: My cat loves this cat food! He likes the big chunks and if I mix it with another variety which is smaller nuggets he sifts through and pulls out the bigger oral care pieces. Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.

review/text: My 2 indoor cats have been on this food forever.  They do not get any canned food supplements.  However, with all the Science Diet flavors I often find that the large bag of this one is not in stock when I go to buy it in my local pet stores including the big box stores like Petco or Petsmart.  so finding it on Amazon and eligible for Prime shipping made my day.

review/text: This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to "improve" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is.

review/text: We have several cats, one of which has had a vomiting problem for many years.  We tried many cats food.  Science diet sensitive is one of the foods that works.  There are 2 otherss.  1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great.  the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive.  I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best.  We also give the cat Prednisolone under a Vet prescription, as the vet said it was inflamatory bowel disease.

review/text: I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.

I decided to add Hill's Adult Oral Care to his regular food for two months and see if it made a difference.  Two months later, my vet examined him and he no longer needs the cleaning!  Now every tail in my home has this product added to their favorite food.

review/summary: Bought this for the Fiber
review/text: Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...

review/summary: Blotto cries for it!
review/text: My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again.

review/summary: My kitty LOVES it.
review/text: The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Worst Junk Food Ever
review/text: I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.

review/summary: Terrible ingredients but my cat did eat it.
review/text: Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so "light" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  Please try another brand like orijen or evo.  your cat will thank you.

review/summary: Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!
review/text: I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!

The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!

That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three.

Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth.

review/summary: Not tastey
review/text: I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.

review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/summary: Important staple of Scandinavia
review/text: Nothing like white goat cheese, it's sweet and with a tiny hint of bitter. Being a norwegian-american family we eat it every day if we can get hold of it. I was surprised to see it listed as gourmet, its an everyday food over there. Like the picture on the wrapper, its sliced using a cheese slicer, a knife or wire cutter will cut too thick. bjorklund makes a good one. Most commonly served for breakfast or lunch on buttered rolls or bread. I like it on a sandwich with a layer of good jam under. Its good on toast and buttered waffles where the heat causes the slices to sweat and melt slightly, changing the texture, and making it delicious.

review/summary: A nice cheese, fun to eat.
review/text: This cheese is nice, friendly to the palette. It has a nutty flavor, like aged Swiss cheese, and a the tang of sharp cheddar. There is a lovely sweetness to it, tastes of caramel. The cheese has great character.<br />To me, there was no off-putting flavor that I would have to acquire a taste for. Nothing really strong, piquant, musty, sour, briney, smokey, or pungent in it's flavor; it is mild tasting.<br />It is rich, dense, and creamy. I hate to compare it to velveeta, but it's texture a bit similar but firmer, more dense, thought the comparisons stop there.<br />I've had this cheese by itself, on crackers, crusty breads, and in sandwiches; today I had some in a sandwich with sliced deli chicken, yellow mustard and clover sprouts. If I made the same sandwich and replaced the Ski Queen Gjetost Cheese, with aged Swiss, and the yellow mustard with honey mustard; the sandwiches would have a similar flavor profile.<br />This cheese will be a fun addition to my next cheese & fresh fruit platter.<br />This cheese is nice for when peckish; being savory, nutty, sweet, and filling.<br />Even if you are not adventurous when trying different cheeses, I would sooner recommend this cheese to try; because it is unintimidating, mild with no strong flavor, rather than recommend bleu cheese, or even smoked Gouda. This is a fun cheese!

review/text: This was an interesting purchase. I've tried a few different types of bernost, dark nutty Norwegian style of cheese, and a couple brands of gjetost; this was by far the tastiest of the group. If you've got a hankering to expand your cheese eating prowess and get a little worldly with your snack choices, then by all means give this a shot. It's a bit of a departure from most cheeses you're used to seeing, but try it on a whole grain crisp and it really works.

review/summary: Unexpected and definatly for the adventurous!
review/text: My parents were world travellers before having a family, so they have often exposed my brothers and i to interesting and strange foods.i remember this exact brand in our fridge often. This cheese is probably not for someone who thinks "swiss" is adventurous. I think there is room in the cheese spectrum for all kinds of cheeses, and this one is worth a try. I think of it as a dessert type cheese, you could probably pair it with a white wine and fruit and crackers. Think of less is more here, use a thin cheese slicer and take small bites. Im not sure if the bad reviews can be trusted, cheese is one of those things that some love and some dont, that doesnt mean there was anything wrong with the product:)

review/summary: Caramel
review/text: I had never seen or heard of this cheese before when I saw it in the cheese section of my local supermarket, so I bought one out of curiosity. It's almost uncanny how caramel-like it is. It looks like an oversized version of a caramel candy you get at a store. It's brown-ish in color (like caramel). It's not a very hard cheese or very soft. It slices very easily. The taste is sweetly reminiscent of caramel. Maybe it would pair well with chocolate.<br /><br />It's so much like caramel that it is very unlike any other cheese I've tasted. That's the reason I only give it three stars - maybe it's technically a cheese, but it doesn't taste like cheese. That said, it's not bad, it's just unexpected.

review/summary: Love it when I can find it!
review/text: I don't buy perishables online, so I've never purchased this from Amazon.com, but I do buy it whenever I see it in stores near me (usually twice a year.)  The first time I bought gjetost, it was on a whim while doing my normal grocery shopping.  A local supermarket had it in their fancy cheese section and it caught my eye.  So I gave it a shot!  I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance and flavor:  It looked kind of like a giant Kraft caramel, and had a soft, sweet smell.  The sweetness was very apparent when on your first taste.  The is a hint of caramel and salt to go along with it (the salty flavor seems rather characteristic of goat cheeses to me.)  One thing I noticed is that there is the slightest aftertaste that reminds me of the finish that would come from Islay region scotches! (most unexpected!) This cheese isn't very hard, and seems to soften quickly.  I frequently pair it with fruit and have it as a snack.  I'd actually love to melt it and serve it with apple butter and Granny Smith apple slices!

review/text: Good stuff.  I live in a medium size town, but specialty cheeses are still hard to find locally.  I was introduced to gjetost by a Norwegian friend (the cheese is from Norway) some years ago.  Loved it! So, I was delighted to find I could buy it thru Amazon.  Ski Queen is a good brand and the seller, "For The Gourmet" has provided first class service.  I have bought twice so far, but I bought 8 blocks each time.  Freight cost from other sellers is prohibitive.  "For The Gourmet", however, does not gouge you with such excess fees.  I found that the unit cost per block goes down considerably if you order 6 -8 blocks at a time.  And ,as my grown son and daughter-in-law really enjoy the cheese as well, 8 blocks just doesn't last that long.  If you have never eaten gjetost before, however, you might want to just get one block to try it out.  It has a surprising taste (very much like salty caramel) so you have to keep an open mind the first time.  My mother-in-law didn't like it, but she often doesn't like new foods the first time out.  My only complaint is that I wish this supplier carried the larger blocks, which are less expensive than the smaller ones.

review/text: Warning first off: This has cows milk and cream in it!<br />The ad does not mention that. So if you want a pure goat milk cheese visit the company's website and buy the pure goat milk version direct. I haven't seen it on Amazon.<br /><br />Second: This is DELICIOUS! It is a unique caramel flavor, and makes a great cheese to eat with fruit and/or crackers. It is firm but soft enough that you should use a sharp cheese slicer to cut it very thin. A really good product for cheese lovers. I just have to restrict myself to the pure goat milk version in the future.

review/summary: Wonderful Dessert Cheese
review/text: I love my cheese and have been fortunate enough to have cheese from all parts of the globe. The somewhat sweet taste of this delight is perfect with an after dinner wine and some apple slices. I served it on winesap apples so the sweet taste of the cheese and the tart of the apple went well together. Thin slices do this cheese justice so use your cheese slicer! The thin slice seems to melt in your mouth! Also I allow my cheeses to sit out for about an hour before serving. I think I heard it best put that we Americans are the only country that puts its cheese in a body bag! Since cheese is living it is often best served and kept on a cheese board, glass dome in a cool room. This product is wonderful if you are looking for a nice way to end a meal, a nice snack or a garnish on soup (I tried it on Tomato Basil soup). Cheers, enjoy and happy holidays!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XWZH1U">Ski Queen Gjetost Original Goat Cheese, (8.8 oz)</a>

It seems "manufactured" and tastes like no cheese should taste.  Slicing it thin is no help.  It has a strange butterscotch-y flavor, but is not as sweet and the consistency is just icky.  Bad, bad, bad stuff.  Nearly as bad as Velveeta.  Maybe even worse.

review/summary: Not real wasabi..
review/text: Beacuase of its crunchiness, you can't get enough. Unfortuneately its made from horseradish and food coloring. True wasabi almost tatses like spicy pungent mint. I still like the crunch it packs and enjoy my sinuses being drained out.

review/text: I have 3 cats. I bought this after I almost lost my male cat, Gary. My cats love it!!!!!!!!! They eat this so fast! I put it out for Gary and my two females cirlce around waiting for him to finish! I don't have the heart to tell the females this is Gary's special food! I let them all eat it. The females do what aI call "speed eating" they love it so much. Gary likes it best when I mix a little water in it and make it softer!

review/summary: My cats LOVED it
review/text: I had to put my cat on a strict diet because he was having problems with bowel disease.  I switched from meow mix to this and my cats devoured it!  Although, they did not like the (Holistic Select Duck and Chicken Canned Cat Food ), they just nibbled that one and walked away.  After switching foods my cats symptoms started clearing up.  I highly recommend this food and I'm sure your cats will love the taste!

review/summary: All three of my cat's rate it a BIG 10! 10! 10!
review/text: Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She "cautiously" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says "You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and "no way!" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage "dining room". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his "Happy" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to "shop around" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne

review/summary: Excellent cat food!!!
review/text: We have an 18 year old cat and he had actually lost weight and didn't look too good.  At the time we were feeding him his usual excellent quality dry kibble.  However, when I added this canned food to his diet ( he gets a small amount 3 times a day along with his dry food) his health changed dramatically.  He added some weight and he looks so much better.  Holistic Select pet foods are top quality.

review/summary: Food Disappeared Immediately! Cats Loved It
review/text: My Vet recommended feeding some wet food everyday to my cats instead of only dry food to help prevent kidney problems in later life. Two other cats developed kidney problems later in life and needed additional fluids everyday.  I have tried a variety of cat foods, but this is their all time favorite. I like it because it is a Holistic Blend of great ingredients that the cats love. It has a soft, blended, wet consistency. I still give them Halo Dry food, a small amount each day. Everyone who visits mentions how healthy their fur looks.

review/text: The place I adopted my cat from included a case of the Holistic Select wet food, and that's all he's been eating since I've had him -- for the last three years.  He's been doing great with the Duck/Chicken, and he likes all of the flavors, which I rotate, with no ill effects.  I would recommend this brand to anyone that wants to give their cat really nutritious food -- I refuse to feed my cats the commercial brands due to their questionable content.

review/summary: Cat loves it
review/text: My cat, Sterling, is a rather picky chap and, after trying what I thought were every affordable and healthy canned cat food in my area, I finally stumbled upon this one. My cat loves every flavor but turkey, though I doubt it's the brand, he just doesn't like turkey. Anyway, my usual pet store is sadly taking these off the shelves, so I supose I'll be buying it here. This food is well rounded and (according to my cat) delicious. He is a discerning fellow, after all.

review/summary: Not great consistency
review/text: Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation.

review/summary: Not the best...
review/text: This does not live up to the quality of Planters products. I thought this bar would be nutty and fruity like the Nut-rition mixes. However, I was disappointed... very few almonds, peanuts, and cranberries per bar. Texture is like sawdust. Not much flavor... I think I will be sticking with Nature's Valley Chewy Trail Mix bars. Saving grace... may be good for someone who likes chewy bars that taste like they have very little sugar, but actually has 9g of sugar which is a lot since one bar is 35g. Each bar is 160 calories compared to same size Nature's Valley Chewy Trail Mix bar that's 140 calories (but has 13g of sugar).

review/summary: Excellent vegetarian ready to eat meal!
review/text: If you like hummus, you will love this little ready to eat meal.  It is convenient, lightweight, packed to go anywhere (work, car, backpacking, picnicking, survival kit, etc.), and really fun and tasty.  You get a little bag of gluten free rice/seed crackers (about 7), a tubie of hummus (which was surprisingly good!), a little bag of roasted, salted soybeans, a bag of hot/sweet nut mix with a few dried cranberries, and a small (.43 oz.) 60% cacao dark chocolate bar, all packed nicely in a sturdy little box. And inside the box is a Sudoku puzzle. All in all, worth the money at $3. a box with Subscribe and Save.  The expiration date on my unit, purchased March 2011, is August 13, 2011.  I agree with the other reviewer that you could snack on this throughout the day, or eat it for a lunch.

If it's your entire lunch, the numbers are great.  And this is quite filling if you wait a few minutes after eating.  (I eat quickly and sometimes don't realize I'm full.)  The hummus and crackers are pretty good.  I mix the fruit & nut mix with the edamame because I don't like the edamame alone.  I kinda wish the chocolate bar was bigger, but it's probably an actual serving.  Darn.<br /><br />Quite good.

review/summary: Delicious portable meal for both meat and non-meat eaters alike!
review/text: *Update*<br /><br />These are now in my regular lunch rotation, regardless of whether that's during the school year, or during summer. The meal presented in this kit is healthy AND delicious, and the perfect size for carrying aboard a long flight, on a road trip, or for a quick lunch at work. For me, Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature also adds an extra incentive to keep these on hand, with the 15% discount, $1.00 off coupon promo that's currently on for it, and the free shipping feature. SO many reasons to keep these around!<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />I got lucky enough to come across one of these at, of all places, my local TJ Maxx store. Having tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBLF2E">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> before, and enjoyed it, I was excited to see this one on the shelf, as it has the same dry roasted edamame in it that I've been craving since the salmon salad meal kit.<br /><br />Honestly, I think THIS one may be my favorite of the two!<br /><br />The first thing that I dove into was, of course, the lightly salted dry roasted edamame. As in my previous experience with them, they were super dry, and needed some liquid help getting to my belly, but they're tasty & filling enough that they still have me wanting more of them.<br /><br />The fruit and nut mix was delicious, but don't ask me to give you any details on what, exactly, I liked most about it, because I devoured it so quickly that, outside of the spicy & sweet kick of it, it's hard to give details. Just let it be said that if you're looking for a trail mix without too much sweet or salty, this will perfectly satisfy that craving, while adding a nice crunch from the nuts, chewiness from the flavored dried cranberries, and spicy bite from the pepper coating on the almonds. Delicious!<br /><br />There were no utensils in this GoPicnic box whatsoever, but the only thing I needed was a pair of scissors to snip a corner off of the hummus pouch. If you take this with you on a hike, you'll undoubtedly already be carrying either a Leatherman-type tool, or a Victorinox-style Swiss army knife, so either of those will have what you need. If you DON'T have a comparable tool with you, opening the hummus pouch might be a bit more laborious, but I can't imagine it'd be impossible. Since I like skinny lines of hummus or whatever I happen to be applying to a surface for consumption (horsey sauce at Arby's, mustard & catsup on my burger, etc., etc., etc.), I only cut off a small corner to ensure that I could get the thin lines of hummus that I wanted onto my Crunchmaster multigrain crackers (which, incidentally, I'd never had before, but am now in love with). The WildGarden Traditional flavored hummus (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5IMSQ">Hummos-Single Serve Packet (10 Packets)</a> had a delightful tang, and was delicious! There was plenty to cover every Crunchmaster cracker, pieces and all, and still enough left to squeeze a generous dollop onto my finger for a final tangy treat.<br /><br />As always, the box contained a delicious, smooth square of dark chocolate that was just the right amount of sweet and tasty, without being too much of anything else. The box also had a Sudoku puzzle on the bottom of it, as had the box containing the salmon salad meal that I'd tried before.<br /><br />Overall, I'm finding that these GoPicnic meals are just right for me for a satisfying cold lunch at work when I don't have time to nuke anything before my next class, and I'm seriously considering subscribing to one of 'em, just to have 'em around. I honestly wish Amazon would make up a variety pack of these as an option, because, having liked both of the two that I've tried, I'm starting to think that I'd like 'em all!<br /><br />Delicious, convenient, AND healthy! This one covers all the bases!

That's 3 stars, add a star for flavor and another for convenience and value and there you have 5 stars!  Anyway,  whoever suggested that one combine the edamame and the fruit nut mix is definitely on to something because the edamame is pretty dry and bland so, the mix flavors it up a bit and make it much for palatable.  The hummus is pretty good and I really appreciated the lightness and flavor of the crackers.  The dark chocolate also has good flavor and is a prefect way to top off this meal.  This is perfect for me to tuck in my purse and bring it for lunch when I'm working or on outings with my family (although I think my 5 year old will prefer the peanut butter one:)). So with the $1.00 off coupon, the s and s savings and the other 10%  discount I paid less that $2.50 for each meal, what a great value!

review/text: When I first saw the hummus dip package I was wondering how I was going to get it open without a scissors but it opened easily just by tearing it open with my hands. The hummus is actually some of the best I've ever had and this one is especially lemony. This box also contains a package of dry roasted soy beans, spicy and sweet fruit and nut mix and a small bar of dark chocolate. This is one of GoPicnic's more exotic selections. While these boxes work well while traveling, they are also good for breakfast or lunch at home when you are not in the mood to cook. You can also keep a few boxes at work or in the car for an instant meal. I must say that the chocolate in this box is some of the best I've ever tasted - so smooth and creamy for a dark chocolate.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Nice treat for a light lunch!!
review/text: Saw this as I was perusing a local pharmacy for a decent light lunch. I was about to settle for one of those cold cut and crackers deals when I saw this and snatched it up. It was perfect. A nice light healthy lunch power packed with protein. It came with sesame crackers (very tasty), humus, a very tasty fruit and nut mix, roasted edamame and a small square of dark chocolate. The great thing about this product is there is not alot of sugar (the chocolate is sweetened with beet sugar), NO MSG (which is a big reason I love this product!), and the fruit and edamame really is tastier than you will find in other mixes. My only complaint is that there should be more crackers...:  Still, I am loading up on these and they're gonna be my main lunch for the next few months :)<br /><br />I would like to add that there have been a few negative comments about how hot and spicy the nut mix is. I eat alot of hot spicy foods. I like the spicy nut mix and didn't think it was all that hot and spicy. Perhaps, at first there's like a burst of spice flavor... but any heat dissipates quickly. If you have never eaten jalapenos, chile, or turmeric, you might find it has too much bite for you. The kind of heat that is in the mix may bother some... in this case, eat just a few at a time along with your humus crackers. If you gobble the whole bag down at once, this may be a problem if you can't handle heat. The humus will help dampen the heat ;)

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: Okay, first, I love GoPicnic stuff in general. This was my first GoPicnic item, and I really enjoyed having it on whatever plane flight I brought it for. The crackers and hummus are absolutely *delicious*, and I practically licked the hummus tube clean. I could've eaten a half-dozen servings of those chips & hummus, in fact.<br /><br />But there's a few downsides, and they really got in the way of my love for this particular gopicnic.<br /><br />First, the hummus tube sometimes opens easily -- but sometimes it's like trying to open an over-glued box of milk when you're a little kid. You keep making dents, but you can't get at what you're after. Or, if you do, you end up somehow making holes in multiple spots and it oozes out of each. The tube could really use some kind of redesign. Both to make it easier to open, *and* to make it easier to get everything out once you *do* pry it open. I'm sure if you're eating it at lunch at your desk you've got scissors and can make short work of the task, but flying in coach you face a far more daunting task.<br /><br />Then, my second beef: The nut/fruit mix. This is, obviously, just a personal taste issue. I'm sure someone, somewhere, likes the mix. Me, I'd rather eat fruitcake. Or collard greens. (As you can probably guess, I don't care for either of those, either.) If I open the fruit/nut mix at all, it's to pick through and find a few bits I like. But that's a waste, and usually a bit disappointing. The desert, a dark chocolate square, is great for you pious lovers of the mystical chocolate -- but, me, I'm a wuss and like my chocolate like I like my women. Milky? Okay, that makes no sense. But I definitely prefer a lighter, milkier chocolate. Oh, and I almost forgot the dried edamame -- another dud for me. Which is weird, because I adore fresh edamame.<br /><br />Do I eat the dried edamame? Or the chocolate square? Or the fruit/nut mix? Yeah, usually I'd eat at least some of it, feeling kind of silly for just eating crackers and hummus when I paid for the whole box. I often peer around at whoever I'm traveling with, hoping/wishing I can get one of them to give the food a whirl so I don't feel like such an uncouth waster of perfectly good food.<br /><br />I'm trying not to vote this too low due to the food choices, because that's a personal taste thing, and I'm sure the components are well-executed. My low score is for the logistical difficulty involved. The best part of the whole meal is the hummus, but I can't *get* to it. And even when I do get to it, I can seldom get it all -- in both cases, this makes me a sad monkey. I hope my three stars aren't unfair. And I hope someday GoPicnic can tweak the packaging, or the lineup, or *something*. I really like the way they do things, so I'd *love* to love this. I just can't, not right now.

However, watch out for the dried roasted edamane, (these are really a pepper not a nut). Try these box lunches folks, they really are Lunchables for adults.

review/summary: Excellent meal for an excellent price.
review/text: I have been eating GoPicnic for a couple years - since I first discovered them on the airlines.  Although I was disappointed when my usual airline went with a different on-board meal, I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  I travel a lot and in addition to airlines, I find GoPicnic to be a great option for airlines, to avoid eating in cafeterias, and I also send it to my friends serving in Afghanistan, who LOVE it.  I will keep buying GoPicnic.

review/summary: Great gluten-free option
review/text: Finding snacks or a quick meal on my college campus (and in airports) is difficult when sandwiches and most cereal bars aren't options. I keep one of these in my backpack at all times, which has helped me to avoid eating things I don't like or going hungry. Some of the proportions seem off - too few crackers, too much edamame, but everything tastes pretty good. The spicy almonds are the best part!

review/text: This product is excellent for an easy lunch outdoors, at work, or at school. No need for utensils, a microwave, hot water, etc., and higher protein and fiber than most other vegan on-the-go meals I've tried. The hummus and crackers are good, the roasted edamame is great, and the chocolate is a nice small dessert. The fruit and nut mix is the only part I don't like very much. I was surprised by how spicy it is, and even though I like spicy food, it doesn't taste quite right. Very good overall though, and I love that it's vegan and gluten free.

review/summary: Great Except for One Item
review/text: I got one of these at my college bookstore and they are great except for the nut mix. It doesn't say on the box but the fruit and nut mix contains flaming hot habanero pepper almonds. I bit into one not expecting the heat and ... whoa! The hummus and crackers are very good, especially for shelf stable. I honestly wasn't expecting good hummus from this but it's really good and goes well with the crackers. The chocolate and the edamame were my favorite things in the box and I was wishing there was more of the chocolate (lol). If they would replace that flaming hot fruit and nut mix with the cranberry mangoes that are in the turkey one I would give five stars. However if you really like spicy you might enjoy it.

review/summary: Perfect shot of protein
review/text: As a gluten free, vegetarian, collegiate athlete, I am in constant search of relatively healthy yet protein-packed snacks.  This product is absolutely perfect.  I've taken to bringing this sets to cross country meets with me and they always do the trick. My teammates are fascinated by what they've taken to calling my "grown-up lunchables" and I'm just happy to have a gluten-free snack that isn't in overly youthful, "kiddy" style packaging! The hummus has a strong lemon flavor, the crunchmaster crackers are probably one of my favorite gf brands, and I adore the fruit and nuts mix. The sweet and spicy combination is delicious, and I usually consider myself to be a weakling when it comes to spicy anything.  The edmame is salted well and there is a surprisingly large portion size contained within the package so I usually end up sharing.  As for the chocolate square, it's fairly good though I would prefer it to be slightly darker.

review/summary: A moment of desperation that made my day.
review/text: On a recent trip my flight was delayed and my empty stomach couldn't wait anymore. I avoid the greasy restaurants in the airports so I went to the news shop I was looking at the fruits & nuts section when I spied these little meals ready-to-eat. It was about the same price as everything else and I thought that if nothing else they couldn't possibly hurt crackers and chocolate!<br /><br />Boy was I surprised at how much I enjoyed this meal from a box!<br /><br />Hummus:<br />PRO: possibly the best commercial hummus I've ever had. Smooth and lemony without being overpowering.<br />CON: squeeze tube was hard to open and awkward to squeeze onto the crackers.<br /><br />Crackers:<br />PRO: The crackers were crispy and had a nice salt taste without being too salty.<br />CON: could have used a couple more. Ended up with extra hummus, but I just squeezed it into my mouth. :)<br /><br />Nut Mix:<br />PRO: Nuts and dried cranberries, I like them both.<br />CON: I didn't think the "haba&ntilde;era" almonds were very spicy. The mango cranberries were not my favorite, but still a nice sweet treat.<br /><br />Edamame:<br />PRO: Nice and light and not too salty.<br />CON: Would have liked a little more flavor on them. Maybe some pepper?<br /><br />Chocolate:<br />PRO: I like chocolate. It was a good dark chocolate without being bitter.<br />CON: None.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />PRO: Easy to open. I liked that everything was individually packed (instead of one tray with compartments) so that I could pick and choose what to eat when. I saved a few items for later.<br />CON: Other than the hummus tube (see above), none.

review/text: I like keeping non-perishable snacks in my desk for work, so I bought several of these.  The nut snack is good (albeit a bit spicy), the chocolate was chalky and white (inedible), the crackers are ok and the hummus is ok.  I never eat the edamame because I don't like the roasted ones.  The main reason for my negative review is that the last 6 pack I bought had an expiration date of 10 days after the date it was delivered -- totally unacceptable.  Also, one of the 6 boxes was missing the crackers.  I'll figure something else out for my at work snacks.

review/summary: Bland, bland, bland
review/text: There are so many hummus flavors out there that upon trying this and finding it bland with a sour aftertaste I was disappointed.  The crackers are the same multi-grain in several other gopicnics and are good but the roasted endamame...um...bland.  Dray and bland and sawdusty even.  Maybe if the main meal (hummus) had been flavorful these would have been a good side. No.  There are many flavors of endamame also on the market, why combine bland hummus with bland endamame??  I felt like I was eating a cardboard box.  The nut mix is good...it's also in the turkey sticks meal but the dark chocolate was a disappointment.  Mostly because it wasn't a more exciting dessert to reward you after eating a cardboard box for a meal.  Not even remotely interested in repurchasing.

The edamame are quite dry, so do plan on having some water nearby! The nut and fruit mix is delicious and the chocolate is great. Now that we're back in the states, we want to order more just because were craving some of that yummy goodness.

review/summary: Great quick lunch--a better 'lunchable' for kids and adults!
review/text: I give the gopicnic meals five stars because they are, for me: convenient, cheap, tasty, and reasonably healthy.  I am too busy/lazy (give me a break, I've got a 2 year old, and I like to sleep as late as I possibly can in the morning before getting up and getting us out the door) to prepare my lunches for work, and I work in a small office where heating up my leftovers and eating at my desk isn't the most enticing lunch hour.  I'm also trying to lose weight, and the calorie contents of these are reasonable for lunch--I will say that a piece of fresh fruit, some cheese or maybe a small side salad would round it out for me and keep me satiated until dinnertime.<br /><br />I saw these at Target and picked up a couple--the Sunbutter & crackers and the hummus and crackers.  So far, I've tried three different varieties.<br /><br />HUMMUS:  This was surprisingly tasty.  I love the flavored hummus--spicy or garlic--so I was expecting something bland.  It had a bit of a lemon flavor to it, which I enjoyed.  The crackers were tasty, and the trail mix wasn't too bad, either.  I could live without the edamame, but it wasn't too bad--I will try someone else's suggestion of mixing them with the trail mix next time.  I didn't try the chocolate--I don't like dark chocolate.<br /><br />SUNBUTTER:  This was the first time I tried sunbutter---it was way yummy!!  Again, I was satisfied with the meal--the fruit bites were tasty, I enjoyed the trail mix, and the cookie wasn't bad, either.  Nothing was too salty, and it was a good combination of flavors.  This is definitely an item I'll be packing for my son--who is allergic to peanuts--when we're on the go, as well as for me.<br /><br />TURKEY STICK&CRUNCH:  Not bad--but I found it was a bit on the salty side (the turkey stick).  The chips were not my favorite, but I could tolerate them.  Same cookie and fruit/nut mix as in the other boxes--so I knew what to expect.  I'd eat this one again, even though it's not my favorite one so far.<br /><br />I ordered more on amazon, and with subscribe and save, it came to about $3.15 per meal--even with a piece of fruit and something to drink, it's cheaper and healthier than dining out all the time--and I don't have to bring any tupperware back home to wash!<br /><br />This is a great idea--I hope more flavors come out.

The only thing that concerns me is the calories, since I'm working on losing weight, but I've learned to make it part of my daily plan. I am going to be buying these in bulk when I get paid next time, I work in a school and these are great for after school when I have the shakes and can't get to a good meal right away. I lost another dress size! I'm so excited to have this product! And I was trying protein bars, but I've wasted so much money and most of those are nasty. These are sooo good and satisfying!

review/summary: Good GF/CF idea -- FOR ADULTS!
review/text: I'm a GF/CF mom, and I was looking for something: #1 to bring with me when I to go work, #2 to send with my daughter for lunches, and #3 to bring for the family when we go on a "field trip" like to the museum or the pool.<br /><br />#1: GREAT choice! I LOVE the hummus, crackers, and fruit/nuts. The soybeans are ok. I give the chocolate to my husband or a friend. (I'm trying to avoid sugar.) I like that the meal is high in protein (25g!!) and fiber (12g!!). The individual packages make it easy to adjust to the size of my hunger: have one thing now; eat another later. Also, it's great to have a quick GF/CF option for times when I know I won't have a fridge or a stove.<br /><br />#2: Bad choice! These are not for children--even an adventurous one like mine! For example, the fruit and nut mix is called "Baja Blend", and it contains "Habanero Almonds" and . Few children will be able to handle this level of spiciness. My daughter LOVE edamame so I thought she'd go for them roasted, but these are very strong. Even the chocolate is a very bitter, dark chocolate. It's just not kid-food.<br /><br />#3 Ok choice. Divided amongst our family we can easily find someone to take each item from this box, and the fact that each item is individually wrapped makes it nice for the snack-style eating we do on a field trip, but they're really just too expensive to be used in this way. We're better off just packing the items that we want.

review/summary: Good concept
review/text: This was a good idea. Unfortunately, the main ingredient, the hummus - is what put it in the fail category for me. Aside from the chocolate, which seemed old to me, the other components were tasty enough. The hummus was not right as far as I was concerned. It came in a tube kind of like toothpaste and even if you could get past that, the taste was not like any hummus I have ever enjoyed. I realized that it was risky, as it is hard to beat delicious fresh hummus, but I was just hoping.

review/summary: A good portable gluten free lunch option
review/text: Overall, this product is a great idea. Portable, doesn't need to be refrigerated, low calorie, gluten free. However...this is the worst tasting hummus I have ever had in my entire life. The chocolate was crushed and resembled taffy. The trail mix is good, as are the crackers, especially considering they're gluten free. I purchased this six pack for around $18. At the current price ($29), I don't think I would purchase these at around $5 a piece - just get together some gluten free snacks and put them together in your own lunch kit.

review/summary: Brilliant Idea
review/text: Pure Genius. Tasty and nutritious. Low calorie. Convenient. Not boring. Great way to showcase new and innovative gluten free foods. My biker husband ( who has celiac) is quite a sight with the little Go Picnic box in his lap!

review/summary: Not safe for wheat allergy or celiacs
review/text: The label on the back of the nuts warns that the product is manufactured on shared wheat equipment. I have never seen a "gluten free" product that is processed on equipment shared with wheat. Most gluten free products aren't even in the same FACILITY as wheat, let alone the same equipment!<br /><br />Frankly, I do not trust the gluten free label on this product.

review/summary: May contain wheat
review/text: If you have celiac disease, be sure to read the fine print. The nuts in the fruit and nut pack are processed on equipment shared with wheat.

review/summary: Just a collection of snacks
review/text: If you eat everything in the package you will have consumed 18 grams of fat. It includes a huge package of hummus and about 5 crackers; it's really just a collection of small snacks. It may keep you full briefly but don't count on this to feel like an actual meal.
