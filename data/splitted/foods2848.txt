review/summary: Really good coffee
review/text: This is the best K-Cup I have found. I like good, dark coffee.<br /><br />I think the name Jet Fuel is a bit misleading. It's not like it's spiked with Red Bull and cocaine, it doesn't seem to have any more caffeine than a typical cup of dark roast. But it does have a nice dark roast flavor.

review/summary: Our favorite extra-bold K-cup--dark, rich, full-bodied
review/text: Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People "extra-bold trilogy"--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey.<br /><br />We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, "Is that as dark as it gets??" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.<br /><br />P.S. You might look into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a> as well. It was the first big hit for us, and still one of our faves.

review/summary: Extra Bold Flavor and Green Packaging (Finally)
review/text: My husband likes his coffee extremely strong, so much so that I brew the 5 oz cups and double up on the kcups in a large mug. Basically, he likes sludge, lol.<br /><br />He had been drinking Timothy's French Roast, but the price has gone up again and I really despise the packaging. Really...they're kcups, not bone china, why the need for 2 packages, carboard, plastic and another box?<br /><br />I like the fact that these kcups come in a single box, not as much waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my picky husband said that this coffee was surprisingly good. I'm happy without the extra packaging and the lower price tag.<br /><br />Now they just need to put this on Subscribe and Save.

I don't like weak coffee, nor does my husband.

We were bummed when we ran out, and we're now going to switch our subscribe and save to Jet Fuel.

review/summary: The absolute best so far!
review/text: I really like Coffee People Donut Shop coffee, but since it is a tad on the weak side for my tastes, I decided to try the Coffee People XBold variety pack.<br />For reference, I have a Keurig B66 which has 3 cup sizes (5.25, 7.25, 9.25oz), and I always use one K-cup for one 9.25oz cup, and I drink it black. I don't make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn't always mean "strong"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I've tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no "strong" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, "Wow, this is good coffee!"<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn't have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense.

review/summary: Ugh....never had grounds in my coffee until I bought this brand
review/text: I have had a keurig for over 4 years.  Never have I had grounds in my coffee until I bought a fifty pack of Jet fuel.  As I work my way through the box, I am throwing out about every third cup.  I "believe" the problem is a thinner than usual foil top, a larger hole is created, during the punch,  and the water is not regulated at the same percentage.  I called to talk to "the coffee people", 2x - never got a human, left my phone number both times, and have never gotten a call back in since the orginal call 10 days ago.  I am done with jet fuel and coffee people, Timothy's  - you have my k-cup money!

review/summary: A Cross Between Starbucks and the Truck Stop...
review/text: If there is a weakness with the Keurig coffee system, it's that most of the K-Cups--even the Extra Bold varieties--tend to brew a weaker cup of coffee, lacking the full flavor of a regularly brewed cup of Joe. I've therefore learned to order sampler packs if available, so I don't get stuck with a bunch of K-Cups I don't like. So I got the Coffee People's Extra Bold sampler pack which included, Black Tiger, Wake Up Call, Organic, and Jet Fuel. And I found them all purdy good.<br /><br />But with the Jet Fuel, I found myself thinking, "Wow, I've finally found a satisfyingly full-flavored bold coffee!" I even had to put two creamers in my cup instead of my customary one, and I found myself savoring every sip. If you're looking for a full-flavored bold cuppa Joe, this one is for you!

review/summary: Coffee Snobs READ THIS!
review/text: I will keep this one short and sweet. In the past 15 years going from my late teens to 30's I have become somewhat of a snob over what Joe I will allow to pass over my lips. The Keurig seemed like a fine idea but I was afraid, as with many of my snobs, that the coffee could not be strong enough to penetrate the morning fog around my brain on a Monday morning. I'm sorry to say that many K-cups fell flat on their faces and my confidence in Keurig was nearly lost. Well fret no more my friends because Jet Fuel is delicious and boy is it STRONG! There is no need for these silly shenanigans where people are starting the brew and then lifting the handle for longer steeping. Although I think if you did that with the Jet Fuel your eyes may literally shoot out of your head. Just pop in the cup and consume with smile. I bought this Keurig for my office and am already planning on one for home and my travel trailer. If you are as picky as I am about your morning ritual and like a nice strong cup of coffee please try the Jet Fuel. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrific coffee at a (relatively) great price
review/text: I confess that I never would have actually purchased a Keurig coffee maker, but I received one as a gift and I have found it to be a useful and enjoyable toy. Being able to brew one high-quality cup of coffee is indeed one of life's little luxuries.<br /><br />Like other single-serving, prepackaged food technologies, however, Keurig k-cup coffee tends toward the expensive when compared to whole bean or tinned ground coffee. If for this reason alone the Amazon "subscribe and save" approach to buying K-cups would be a fabulous institution. By having the coffee delivered at regular intervals (with free shipping!) the cost is reduced considerably.<br /><br />But which coffees to buy? I selected Jet Fuel partly, I confess, because the name is so darned cute. The (relatively) non-wasteful packaging also was an attraction, though let's face it, there is plenty of plastic residue associated with this brewing technology. The Coffee People at least minimize the waste, however, and for this I salute them.<br /><br />What about the coffee itself? Jet Fuel is a dark, rich, full-bodied coffee that to me is reminiscent of the "industrial strength" coffee I can get at Peet's, my favorite west coast coffee purveyor/establishment. In other words, it's amazingly delicious.  The Keurig system allows you to select the strength you want.<br /><br />Overall, Jet Fuel is a winner for fans of robust coffee. Bon appetit!

review/summary: A Top Favorite - Strong Coffee
review/text: I love the variety of choices you get with the Keurig and this is another fine example.  My family tends towards the darker roasts and have settled on a few favorites.  We've been trying to make our way though most of the varieties and Jet Fuel has landed solidly in our top 5.<br /><br />This is a strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  We only use it on the largest cup size setting as it is too strong for smaller cups.  However, being strong should not be equated with tasting like burnt dirt.  There are some great flavors in this cup and a nice long smooth finish.  I love it when a sip of coffee lingers on the tongue for a few moments and makes you want to take another sip.  Jet Fuel meets the bill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o strong dark brew<br />o nice flavors<br />o long smooth finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit too strong for smaller cup sizes<br /><br />Overall - highly recommended - a family favorite.

I prefer its higher [than other roasts such as the "donut shop" blend] level of acidity in the morning to leave a sparkle on the tongue and kick in my step.

review/summary: I really LOVE Jet Fuel -- but can we talk price?
review/text: When I first ordered Jet Fuel a few people told me it was way too harsh a coffee, and to only get it if I wanted to be wired for the rest of the morning.  To tell you the truth, I didn't find that thought unappealing, so I ordered it.<br /><br />My verdict?  It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.  I think it has a pleasant taste, no strong aftertaste, and though I will admit it probably has a bit more kick than, say, my wife's Donut Shop coffee, I'm not buzzed on it.<br /><br />Incidentally, I think the only way to get K-cup coffee is to order it on subscription in order to get the 15 % markdown.  Be aware that even subscription prices are available to rise (and fall, I suppose) with the market.  I had thought the price was locked in, but I was wrong.<br /><br />I love K-cups, and I also love Amazon, but unless the prices drop soon, I'm going to have to buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond...they're not too expensive over there, and they're always having 20 % off or $5 off coupons, as well as sales, and that is about the only way to get K-cups cheap.  I'd rather use Amazon, but paying 60 cents and more for each cup is ri-freaking-diculous.

I drink 2 cups of it per day and it saves me the trip to Starbucks although I don't think the coffee is quite as good.  If you are a total coffee 'snob' then you might not like it, but if you like coffee but prefer to have something a little better than maxwell house or folgers, this might strike the right balance for you.

review/summary: STRONG Coffee for the Keurig
review/text: I like strong, dark coffee, so I am usually disappointed by k-cups, which tend to be a little on the weak side.  I usually pack my own coffee cups (using a Keurig adapter)so I can get a strong brew, but my Keurig sometimes malfunctions when I use the adapter.  I decided to try Jet Fuel instead, and I was not disappointed -- smells rich, tastes great.  If you want that strong coffee smell and taste, you won't go wrong here.

review/summary: Perfect for making lattes
review/text: I was searching for the perfect K-Cup to make lattes at home. I wanted one that tasted the most like coffee shop espresso. Jet Fuel is the hands-down winner! It's rich, bold and slightly bitter, which is perfect for lattes. I brew it on the smallest setting so that it is more concentrated. I heat milk with flavored creamer and pour it into the Jet Fuel. Then I whip it with my little hand-held frother. It tastes as good as, if not better than, a coffee shop latte at less than half the price! So wonderful! I would not drink Jet Fuel straight, but it is the perfect choice for lattes.

review/summary: Boldest K-Cup I Found
review/text: After I got my Keurig coffee maker and tried some of the brews available in K-Cups, I thought I might have to settle for a less bold coffee.  Based on some reviews on Amazon.com I went with Coffee People Jet Fuel and I've been very pleased for a couple of years now.  I do the subscribe and save option, which is great for me and a pretty good deal (at least for K-Cups).

review/text: In no way would I consider these k-cups having a bold flavor. In fact, I usually have to use two of them on the espresso setting to get any enjoyable flavor from them.  If I were you I would stick with the Donut Shop k-cup as it has a more natural coffee shop taste.

review/summary: Best K-Cup for Strong Coffee Drinkers Yet
review/text: I've had my Keurig for a year, and my only complaint has been the quality of the coffee made:  Not bad, but not nearly strong enough for people who think their coffee should run like molten lava rather than a fast trickling stream (OK, not really sludge, but you get what I mean).  The closest I came to finding a good cup was Dunkin Donuts' Dunkin Dark, but they are pretty expensive from the store.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here, I decided to give Jet Fuel a try.  WHOA!  This is proper coffee that will put hair on your chest, but also tastes DELICIOUS.  Buying in packs of 50 for a family with 3 coffee drinkers (and frequent visitors) also means fewer trips to the store for coffee.<br /><br />Very happy I chose to buy this brand, and now enjoy my morning hassle-free cup of coffee!

review/text: We've been receiving Jet Fuel via Amazon's "Subscribe And Save" program for about a year.  The coffee is dark and strong, as we like it.  Subscribe And Save is a great convenience.  However, with coffee prices creeping up as they are, we are re-thinking the whole single-serve coffee thing.  May put away our Keurig brewer and haul out the ol' drip maker from the back of the cabinet.  The taste of the coffee rates five stars.  If factoring in the price, it would be fewer stars.

review/text: I was drinking Timothy's San Lorenzo Dark, but apparently it's no longer sold in the US market, so I was looking for a replacement. Jet Fuel is a little stronger, but very good! Many of the "bold" and "strong" K-Cups have a bitter or burnt taste that I don't like, but this one is perfect. It's strong and gets me going in the morning but still tastes good.<br /><br />I took a bunch in to share with my co-workers and they all liked it as well. Definitely a winner in my book!

Now, I use a B-60 and I make a couple brews off the same kcup on the large setting because I drink a lot of coffee and I'm cheap. I'll brew both into the same (rather large) cup to even out the tastes. It still tastes very good, but not as bold. A little creamer for me and I'm good to go! I now drink this more than the Kona blend from Coffee People. I also appreciate how cheap it is!

review/text: I have had this on auto delivery for about a year, but I'm not happy with my last delivery, it just lacks the punch it has had in the past I don't know if they changed something or if this lot was a fluke, but when I get my next shipment if it's not back to it's extra-bold, rich and full bodied, I will be dropping it.<br />Please if it's not broke don't fix it.<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XLH4Y">Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>

review/summary: Decent coffee
review/text: Got this to try another type.  I have been drinking the rain forest extra bold and that is pretty good.  I can make a decent cup of coffee that fills a mug.  Even the largest size on the Kurig is OK.  Anyway, the Jet fuel is quite similar and I can't tell much of a difference.  They are both strong enough for my taste.  One problem I did have, is the cardboard box was so large it would not fit in the kitchen cabinet.  It is one of the "frustration-free" Amazon boxes.

review/text: This is the best choice if you like real strong coffee. I love coffee but I'm picky on my coffee. I would always go to the coffee shops to get latte. But after purchasing the k-cups I can make coffee at home. It also comes with different favor.

review/summary: fixed the grinds problem; great coffee!
review/text: Jet Fuel is nice and strong coffee with excellent flavor!  Once in a while the kcup releases coffee grinds into the liquid. I contacted Green Mountain Roasters, who make Jet Fuel, and they suggested this fix:  when inserting your kcup into your coffee machine, push the kcup DOWN onto the little puncture needle until it is sitting firmly in place.  Then continue as you normally would for your Jet Fuel cup.  The grinds-into-the-coffee should not happen again.  Reason: pushing DOWN releases some of the pressure in the kcup which prevents the problem.  This has worked for me and I haven't encountered the problem since.  If you have a problem with quality, go to the Green Mountain Roasters website and send customer service an email. They were very responsive when I emailed them!  They'll want the lot number on your Jet Fuel, so be prepared!

review/summary: Manufacturing error?
review/text: I love the flavor of this coffee, but I agree w/ the post that it may be poorly manufactured.  I frequently have to clean my Keurig from blown out K-cups.  I suspect that problem is more of a coffee maker issue than the K-cup though.  My biggest complaint however is a recent apparent manufacture error.  I received K-cups which show they are Coffee People Jet Fuel but they have a distinct, nasty sweetened mocha flavor.  They're definitely not Jet Fuel flavor.  I cannot find a place to post a complaint to either Coffee People or Amazon, so I guess I'm stuck w/ 50 nasty flavored K-cups.

review/summary: Jet Fuel ok for dark roast
review/text: I tried Jet Fuel after looking at the reviewed on a number of K-cup roasts. I am a home roaster and new to K-cups because we have a Keurig in the office. I also bought a Solofil reusable K-Cup, which works very well. I was concerned that the so called K-Cup dark roasts would be weak and tasteless. I was wrong, in fact the Jet Fuel is a bit over the top dark and very acidic. I would recommend Emril's Big Easy Bold or a Coffee People French Roast for everyday - Jet Fuel is good for an occasional jolt.

review/summary: K-Cup Switch to Coffee People Jet Fuel Proves OK
review/text: My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included "Dark Extra Bold."  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.

review/summary: It's OK!
review/text: I was researching different flavors and reviews on K Cups. I came across Jet Fuel which was supposed to be one of the "Boldest" K Cups available. They arrived this morning and I could not wait to try them in my machine. I was quite surprised on how not so "Bold" they tasted!<br />I have tried quite a few other brews and I found the "Jet Fuel" to be the same or less "Bold" than the other ones.<br />I would suggest if you are considering this brand due to its "Bold" flavor that you only purchase a small amount first. I purchased 2- 50 count boxes and sure I will use them but I will still use the other brands that seem to be more "Bold" such as "Expresso Roast" and others.

review/text: This coffee is awesome. It's pretty strong, so you can do the largest setting on the Kuerig and give yourself a 'warm up' by using the same K-cup and doing another shot through it with the small or medium setting and it still tastes great.<br />BTW- Whoever posted that there were 'grounds' in their coffee... I have had no experience with that and I've ordered 3 times.

review/text: I listened to a couple of friends that raved about this item.... wrong move. I love a very strong, bold cup of coffee. Increased bitterness is OK, if it is balanced by the flavor. This item isn't it. It was perhaps the most middle of the road, marginal cup I've had in a long time. Little taste, marginally robust, and lots of caffeine. I won't ever buy it again. The Coffee People Black Tiger is a much better product. I also enjoy Emeril's Big Easy Bold....long before this slack waste of time. Save yourself drinking a marginal cup of coffee and try something else.

review/text: I figured "Jet Fuel," that's perfect!  Expecting a really bold and full-flavored coffee but got instead a highly acidic and poor tasting brew.
