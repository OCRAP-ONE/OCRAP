review/summary: Not so good this time
review/text: I have ordered Wicked Jack Rum Cakes in the past from Amazon and they were delicious.  However, last week I received a pack of 6 mini rum cakes and a chocolate 16 oz. cake.  And they all are dry and a bit hard.  I think they have been on the shelf too long.  I will never order again and take the chance.  I had to discard most of the cakes.

review/summary: A very delightful decaf
review/text: I've been drinking Coffee Bean Direct coffees for years and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite decaf from them has always been their Columbian decaf. Well, I now have a new favorite.<br /><br />This is a blend of medium and dark roasted decaf beans. I'm certain that one of the beans is the Columbian decaf, since I've drunk enough of that to recognize it. I'm pretty sure they added their decaf Sumatra, and I'd guess that there's also some dark Guatemalan in the blend. But regardless of the specific varieties, the end result is a smooth, rich cup.<br /><br />The beans are mostly dark roasted - I'd guess the ratio of medium to dark is about 70% dark, 30% medium roasted beans. But despite the emphasis on the darker roasts, you don't get the harsh, burnt flavor that is often present in really dark roasts. The darker roasts add depth, but the medium roasted beans keep it mellow.<br /><br />It's a very versatile bean with regard to brewing methods. I was very pleased with it as a pour over, and it also did quite well in a French press. The French press mellowed out the sharper notes but retained the richness. Brewing it in a moka pot also turned out better than I expected given the preponderance of darker beans (I tend to prefer medium roasts for moka brews). My success with a moka pot made me try it as espresso with mixed results. It was just OK as a straight shot, but was very tasty as an Americano. I expect it would be good as well as a latte (I'm not a milk drinker, so I can't say for sure).<br /><br />If you're looking for a good decaf, this is a great one to try. If you're unsure if you will like it, you can get a small trial bag from Coffee Bean Direct to try it out before you spring for a 5 pound bag. Amazon is the best place to get the 5 pounders since they usually are priced below getting it from CBD. You can also get a great price if you can find it on the Amazon Warehouse.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: This food is a hit!<br /><br />The cat likes it because it's got chunks of shredded meat in gravy. He won't eat ground or pate-style foods, so the shredded meat in this one is a winner.<br /><br />I like it because, for one thing, it's grain-free. To my mind, if you could only pick one quality to shop for, grain-free would be it; carbohydrates - and particularly grains! - are not good for cats. It's very high in protein, which *is* good for cats. It contains pumpkin, and while that is a carbohydrate, it's supposed to be good for their tummies. I'm also pleased that it contains duck meat, since I like to rotate my cat's protein sources to take advantage of their differing nutritional profiles. And finally, it's got plenty of gravy to help my cat stay hydrated; cats are built to take in much of their fluid from their food sources, so feeding dry food exclusively can dehydrate them (and possibly lead to urinary crystals).<br /><br />True, it's expensive. Even for higher-end cat foods, it's expensive. But if you'd ever had a cat develop diabetes because of an improper diet (i.e. dry foods high in carbs and too low in animal-based proteins) - or any other condition brought on by a poor diet - you'd agree that a little expense up front is way cheaper in the long run than treating the health condition. The fact that I'm still giving it five stars should tell you something. Not that I don't recommend shopping around for deals!)<br /><br />Give this food a shot. It's a very healthful choice.

review/summary: Decent pre-made start to Pad Thai
review/text: If you are interested in getting this sauce to make pad thai at home without devoting nearly an hour to gathering and prepping the ingredients, this sauce is an excellent choice. However, please understand (I think some of the other reviewers didn't) that unlike most pre-packaged and processed foods, this one is devoid of ANY salt.  You will have to add salt or fish sauce to give it any type of flavor. I don't see this as a negative, since I can now control the amount of salt my family eats when I use this sauce.  It does also need lime and I liked adding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LO40AG">Huey Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (28oz)</a>.  If you view this product as a base to making a decent pad thai instead of a complete sauce to take anything resembling cooking out of your hands, you should be pretty satisfied with it.

review/text: I bought this sauce hoping to be able to make Pad Thai for my family at home that would taste similar to what we get when we eat out. I know that recipes and tastes will vary from one to the next, but this was listed as "Classic Thai sauce".<br /><br />The first night I tried using it, I immediately knew it wasn't what I was looking for. Luckily I had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CE3SO">Thai Kitchen, Pad Thai Sauce</a> on hand and between the two I was able to come up with something that my family did enjoy.<br /><br />While this sauce may be a starting point for your meal, if you're like me it won't be enough. While I was hoping to find something pre-made and easy, I may just need to get up enough courage to try making it from scratch.

review/summary: Not authentic, but works well as a quick base for adding other ingredients...
review/text: If you're looking for or expecting authentic Pad Thai sauce, you will be disappointed with these pouches. If you're looking for a base sauce that you can add your spices and seasonings to for various dishes, it's a good start.<br /><br />Depending on price (which has fluctuated quite a bit over the year or more we've been ordering), it's a good value.<br /><br />Price is important because we never get by without using at least two and often three pouches (which includes watering them down with a half-pack of water per pouch) per dish.<br /><br />FYI: This isn't low sodium (17% per serving, two servings per pack) or low fat, so keep that in mind as you use it. (I think someone posted elsewhere that it is devoid of salt. I just checked the label on the pouches and 17% sodium means there's salt in there.)<br /><br />We used to make our pad thai sauce from scratch but it wasn't economical for us to purchase all the ingredients given the frequency of use. So we tried these as an acceptable substitute for our purposes. We often split a dish into two and make one spicier for guests who like it hot and leave the rest milder (bland to some). Again, having an option is a plus.<br /><br />Foodies will never love this or want to use, but for the rest of us, it's a fast and edible option.

review/text: The package is so pretty I expected contents to be pleasing too. But it is very disappointing: plain, sweet, and tastes nothing like Pad Thai. With heavy doctoring it is edible. Once you've hauled out lime, chili, and fish sauce, you might as well skip the package and make real Pad Thai sauce. It gets two stars for motivating me to cook food and for not needing to throw away my dinner after cooking, but I will never buy it again.

review/text: I really like this flavor. It's very unique and unlike the Strawberry Banana flavor, this flavor of Blueberry Pomegranate actually tastes like the name. The number one ingredient is Apple Juice, but in this case it doesn't detract from the main flavor of the drink, which is blueberry. There is no added sugar and is sweetened with Stevia, an all-natural plant. I am an energy drink guru so to speak, I have tried about every brand out there from red bull to rockstar, and thus I am used to the bad taste from most energy drinks. With 70 percent juice, these Jamba Juice energy drinks are a much better tasting and healthier alternative. The only complaint I have is there is no ginseng added which would make this more of a complete energy beverage. With Amazon's Subscribe-and-Save feature it brings the cost per can down to $1.77. not bad.

review/summary: Who says an energy drink needs to taste bad?
review/text: I'm not going to lie, I was never a big fan of energy drinks. I find most of them vile or they have a strange aftertaste. And the caffeine content in 12+ ounces usually gives me the jitters. So I avoided them.<br /><br />I got the chance to try the crisp apple energy drink a little over a month ago and was impressed with it so I decided to spring for the blueberry pomegranate. In my opinion, it tastes better than the apple. It has the same amount of carbs, but the blueberry pomegranate tastes sweeter without any sort of weird/fake flavors. It's tastier than an energy drink has any right to be AND it's natural.<br /><br />This is sweetened with stevia so if you have an aversion to that sweetener you may want to avoid this product. I don't like most of the "fake sugars" out there, but in this case I cannot tell this drink has an alternative sweetener.<br /><br />An all-around wonderful product. Highly recommended.

review/text: I am allergic to coffee and black/green tea, and, while I love the taste of soda, I detest drinking something that is horribly bad for one's health and massively acidic. Thus, I spend most days caffeine free. There are days, though, when I really could use a pick-me-up drink.  I do not like the taste of 5-hour energy drinks or the ingredient list, so I was psyched when a friend introduced me to Jamba products. They taste great and are made from generally healthy ingredients. Sure, there is still the issue that they come in a can and can liners often contain BPA, which is a carcinogen, but they still rank high on the relative health scale of energy drinks.

review/summary: Horrible taste that lingers
review/text: I got one of these for free during lunch as they were handing out cans of it on the street today.  I had never heard of this product and had no expectations of it.  I drank a sip and was pretty disgusted.  The aftertaste was similar to that of a diet soda, and while there was a slight hint of blueberry in the aftertaste which was nice, that didn't make up for the overall bad taste.<br /><br />I've read the other reviews on here about the great taste, so maybe it is personal preference, but I recommend you try one before you go and buy a dozen.<br /><br />On the plus side it did give me a jolt of energy, but it only lasted a 10-15 minutes.  It have only been a result of the bad taste.  The smell and appearance of the drink was not appealing either, a little unsettling actually, but it's all natural so I guess that just comes with the territory.

review/summary: Great chew bone for canine dental health
review/text: My three Shelties love these chew bones. They are picky about what they chew, and these bones help scrape tartar off their teeth, without disintegrating into dangerous sharp shards. They don't leave any stains on the rugs, either. This is a good product at a very good price.

review/summary: CAN BE DANAGEROUS!
review/text: I bought 24 of these bones and both my Jack's love them, but I found that they are cracking long sharp slivers of bone off and if they swallow these there will be a visit to the vet.  So, I'm allowing them to clean the bones and when they start to crack them I'm tossing the bones in the garbage.  I won't be ordering any bones from now on.  I've done some research and found that it's best not to take the chance with any bones cooked, raw or smoked.<br /><br />Good Luck to all!

review/summary: Looks like something I would want to eat
review/text: I'm pretty picky when it comes to what I feed my 4 year old shar-pei- in fact, I cringe at the thought of routinely feeding my dog most of the mainstream/ popular brands after 'google'ing some of their ingredients. Selecting a treat that I'm comfortable giving her can be frustrating.<br /><br />I ordered these treats in hopes that they were acceptable and wouldn't be spit out on the kitchen floor. I must say that they far exceeded my expectations. There was actually a split second where I wanted to try one- they look like tasty human treats! The shape reminds me of minature muffins with the texture of a crunchy cookie. My girl not only didn't spit out the treat, she ran into the living room to eat it/ savor it in privacy! Her reaction was pretty funny.<br /><br />If you are looking for a treat Made in the USA, with ingredients you can pronouce, and doesn't look like it was processed at ACME industries then you may want to give these a try. (I'm glad I ordered two boxes!)

review/text: I'm ordering more of these today. My dog loves them. In fact, he loves just about everything Three Dog Bakery makes. The cookies loose in the box are a better idea for us, because the ones that look like little Oreo cookies lined up in a row in a box are too fragile. I end up with a mess of crumbled-up cookies at the bottom of the box, which are pretty much useless.<br /><br />These don't do that. They are just the right size for us, for him to eat and for me to enjoy giving him, and he loves the taste. I love the smell of these baked dog cookies!

Corn-on-the-cob, eggs, popcorn, pizza, sauteed asparagus, even cottage cheese...the spicy-sweetness seems to complement foods in a way that brings out a hidden note to any recipe.

review/text: I recently purchased a 6 box carton of Pickwick Black Tea with Peach from Amzaon. My wife and I had this tea some time ago in a restaurant and found it to be excellent. We like black tea and the hint of peach flavor made this a perfect drink for us. We could not find it in any stores, but saw it was available at Amazon. A son and daughter both tried the tea and ended up with two of our boxes.  We will be buying more because this is our tea of choice.  Excellent Flavor!!

I'm glad it was; it been almost 3 year ago when i first trued it and every day after it it the only black tea i ever drink daily. Try drinking other brand when i couldn't get acces to it anymore and felt that the other tea didn't compared and black tea doesn't tase as good as it use to. Until i found it on amazon, now it continue to be my daily tea, and only black tea i ever drink everyday. I only drink other tea brand (and type) when needed or if i don't have any of this tea. It give you a rich black tea flavor and a good sense of peach; not to strong but not too mild either. Really great, love it and will continue to love it!

review/summary: Maine Coon Food
review/text: We are long term (10 years) users of Royal Canin Maine Coon food, MC-31. It has worked very well in providing a balanced meal high in all required vitamins plus Omega 3, 6, and 9. The large kibble keeps our cats from requiring periodic dental cleanings. Our present pair of Maine Coons have NEVER required a dental cleaning in 8 years.<br />The only problem we have had with this product is the size of the bag. It is too small. Maine Coons are BIG eaters, a 6 pound bag doesn't last long ( 1 week) with 2 full grown Maine Coons. Royal Canin did pack the food in a 20(?) pound bag some time ago, but discontinued that size because of complaints of lack of "freshness". How could a Mylar bag packed product be "unfresh"? Whose opinion of lack of freshness was it, the Owner?, the retailer? the Cat? or the manufacturer?<br />What do breeders of Maine Coons do? They do NOT buy $25 bags of 6 pounds of kibble. They seek out competitive equivalents to feed their cats, use MC-31 sparingly, but advise their customers of what is the best and what is reasonable to feed these big guys.<br />A vet tech suggested Amazon as the most reasonably priced source of Royal Canin MC-31. Royal Canin should reconsider this marketing decision to sell little bags of food for the biggest breed of cat in the country!

review/summary: Big girl is happy!
review/text: I have gone through many brands of cat food for my Maine Coon mix female. She's about five years old now. I discovered this food first at a boutique type pet store... I was looking for our regular Eukanuba brand. This fancy place only had some pricey food, including Royal Canin, which I was not familiar with. I bought it anyway since I had never seen food especially for the Maine Coon breed. Well, our cat Vita loved it. She can't just scarf this food down and then throw up like she does with other food! She eats it properly and, amazingly, does not leave food in the dish. Her favorite trick is to always leave food behind and then complain that it's stale. For instance, with the Paul Newman food, she eats a few bites and then walks away. Then she comes back and camps out by her dish waiting for a few more "fresh" morsels. When I give her Iams, she gobbles her food like a little demon. Then I go to work or do some chores and voila, I find a pile of thrown-up kibble on the carpet. Of course, I try giving her small doses of kibble... boy, does this cat eat a lot. She is very healthy though and not too fat. The main point of my review is: so far Royal Canin Maine Coon 31 Formula is proving to be the right food for this big girl.<br /><br />Other important points: The price through Amazon is much better than through the pet store. The convenience of finding it online versus not knowing where the heck it might be stocked is wonderful. The most surprising thing was shipping was super fast. I ordered on Saturday night and got it Monday afternoon. How did they do that? I've never experienced such fast FREE shipping with Amazon. Also, I paid no extra sales tax. I really hope to keep this up and have the same experience. You can't beat this.

Our female Calico needs to have it pulled away from her (other than for treats), so that she doesn't wipe it out and leave the Coons without any for themselves.

They quit throwing up uneaten cat food and the tabby loves it too.  It's a bigger kibble specially formulated for their mouth size and design.  I highly recommend any M.C. Royal Canin dry cat food.

review/text: We have one Maine Coon and two other, shorter-haired cats.  This food is the only food that prevents our MC from gulping down her food so quickly that she gets sick later.  The kibble size forces her to chew her food- a definite win.  But best of all, all of our cats love this food.  And their coats seem so much softer now.  Wish that it came in larger bags but I'm glad that Amazon carries the 6-pound bags.

review/summary: Well-Balanced and Enticing
review/text: I have a very finicky cat, who doesn't tend to eat most foods.  The few that I've found that he would eat, he lost interest in after a few days.  Additionally, his coat was getting a dull look to it and had lost much of the softness that is so characteristic of his breed.  I started feeding him Royal Canin's main coon formula (which is his breed, of course) and haven't looked back since.  He has been on this diet for now 2 years and hasn't turned his nose up at it once.  The food obviously appeals to him immensely; where before he seemed to eat only as a necessity, he looks forward to it every time I open up the canister to get him another scoop.  His coat has turned down-right lustrous, too.  Perhaps the most delightful side effect is his litter box.  Because the food is so well-balanced for his breed's digestive needs, his is using the litter box much less, with barely any accompanying odor.  This stuff is great - I will never switch him to another product again.

We kept him on his kitten food by recommendation of his Dr. and breeders until he was 1 yr old.  When he was 11 months old we started giving him this as a treat to get his system use to it.  When we ran out of the kitten food, he was already use to this food and he loves it!  It is bigger pieces so he has to chew it which helps his dental health and his tummy.  This a great food for him and you WON'T beat this price.

review/summary: The BEST EVER for my gentle giants!
review/text: Several years ago my first Maine Coon cat found me.  It's true what is said about these cats - you can't have just one!  Now I have three  ^..^  My first MC came to me with a gum infection and lots of dental plaque at only 9 months of age.  This was when I discovered Royal Canin cat food specifically designed for large breed cats with larger muzzle and jaws.  They eat food differently than smaller cats and need the large kibble to slow ingestion and encourage thorough chewing.  Now everyone has clean teeth and we've never had another dental bill.  The extra ingredients for joint support (glucosamine) and coat (salmon oil) are wonderful, and my cats are thriving on this dry formula.  I also feed a partial raw diet and always offer plenty of kitty greens.<br /><br />All large cats can benefit from this formula:  Norwegian Forest Cats, MC mix and any cat with a large muzzle and dental problems.  Thank you, Royal Canin and Amazon for bringing this to us at a great price.  Note to Amazon:  would be great to have this in the frequent flyer auto-ship option.

review/text: I've owned Maine Coons and larger mixed breeds for many years, and Royal Canin is by far the most reliable food out there. My current big guy has FIV, so keeping him healthy is even more important.  He has a tendency to wolf smaller kibble down so fast he will throw up because none of it gets chewed. That has never been a problem with this food. He absolutely loves it.  His coat has been in excellent condition, as have all of the cats I've fed this to. He's middle-aged and has never had any dental problems, and is generally free of any need to go to the vet--even with the FIV.  I happily pay a little extra to feed my cats this great food, knowing this keeps them healthy and happy.

review/summary: Best cat food for my MC
review/text: After trying what seamed like every brand in my local stores for one that both my MC and domestic sh would both like eating and not cause my MC to vomit up his food. This is the one I was looking for. My only complaint would be that you can only get a 6lbs. bag. A 10 or 12 pound bag would be nice. If they remain at 6lbs. (as it looks that it will) it would be nice if Amazon would add it to their "subscribe and save" program. I have emailed this request to them and hope that it will be considered l. By the way thee reviews Rad I spears that it would be used and it would in turn introduce a fantastic product to people who could benefit from it.

review/summary: A marvelous treat
review/text: Adian and Mocha, who are not full-blooded Maine Coon cats but clearly have some coon cat genes, look forward every day to their late night snack of Royal Canin. They obviously think it is delicious; they look forward to it and let me know when it is time to serve it by voluntarily coming indoors and dashing madly to the kitchen once I head that way.<br /><br />I think the larger size is a good addition to a balanced diet since it is (a) eaten more slowly and not gulped and (b) probably does help their teeth.  Both of these male litter mates are large, happy, healthy cats with soft,velvety, glossy coats.  And while I don't know whether it is the brand of cat litter used--a flushable corn-based material--or their diet, their litter box has no obnoxious odor. So, this will be a continuing treat and ordered regularly from Amazon where, as a prime member, the shipping is free.

review/summary: Wow, this is good stuff!
review/text: We decided to switch our 2 Coons, aged 8 months and 4 years, from their raw diet to dry food after our vet expressed concerns about nutrition.  She recommended Royal Canin 31 because it is formulated for the Maine Coon's unique needs and there have never been any quality concerns.<br /><br />Having never eaten dry food, we weren't sure the cats would take to it easily.  We put a few bits down just to see what would happen, and to our surprise they snarfed it up and begged for more!<br /><br />We still give them a few meat scraps occasionally, but Maine Coon 31 is their primary diet now.  We feel better knowing they are getting a balanced diet and we don't have to worry about tainted meat or dangerous bone shards. Plus, they don't bolt it or drag it around like they did their raw food, so their teeth and jaws are getting the cleaning benefit, it's better for their metabolism, and we don't have to follow them around with bleach wipes at the end of the day!  To top it off, you can't beat Amazon's price.  Thank you Royal Canin and Amazon!

review/summary: This food is designed for DOGS NOT CATS!!!
review/text: This cat food is caused my cat to end up with major dental work. My Maine Coon started having major teeth isues after eating this food. I contribute this issue to the HUGE size of kibble pieces that this food is made into. The size is of that of a dog food NOT a cat food.<br />Yes, Maine Coons are like dogs in many ways but to designn food that is sized for dog's mouth is simply insane.<br /><br />I did not realize how  much strenght it requires to crash this food into smaller pieces untill I decided to take one piece and try doing it with kitchen knife on the counter top.<br /><br />My cat ended up breaking off one of her K tooth and injuring in other ways other teeth.<br /><br />This is  horrble horrible product and I am not even reffering to the nutritional value of it, I am leaving it to others. I would simply never offered the dog sized catfood to a cat as it obviosly comes with price in cat's well being.<br /><br />I don't understand why cat food has to come in such a big and hard pieces across the board, I try to present your cat with many different kind of cat food and  realized after a while that for whatever reason cat will stick to that that is easiest to chew. Is it co-incident?<br /><br />Why the company can't make a smaller and easier to crash in their mouth food? that is a mystery.

review/text: While traveling in Germany last year I discovered this wonderful licorice candy. When I returned home I could not find it in any of our local stores so I checked here on Amazon and found it. I have ordered this candy from Amazon three times in the past year.  I share it with my licorice loving friends. What a treat! It is so hard to find really good Licorice but this is it. It is made in Germany so it is a little high priced. I order the 5 pound box and the box with 10 packages at 5 ounce each and this bring the total to over 25 dollars so it qualifies for free shipping... what a deal. I divide up the box and freeze it in Zip Lock Freezer bags and it keeps well.<br />  Try it and I think you will like it too... even people who don't like licorice often like this one.

review/summary: Water with light flavors of pear
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this drink but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a nice still water with a natural pear flavor.  The latter was key because I was worried it might taste artificial or off, but instead it tasted crisp and true to life.  It's worth noting that the flavor is subtle.  It actually didn't hit me when I first took a sip but lingered in my mouth after I'd finished the beverage.  It is definitely much more subtle than a juice or flavored seltzer water, but is enough to add interest and variety for those who don't drink enough water when it's plain.  I also love that there are no calories, caffeine or other artificial ingredients making it the perfect guilt-free drink.<br /><br />Overall, it's delicious.  If you're expecting a strong, juice-like flavor you'll probably be disapointed, but if you're looking for a light, clean flavor that is more interesting than water this is a great choice.

review/text: This is, what, 99.9% water with a drop of fruit extract? The price is overblown. Hence the star off.<br /><br />However, for those who like something a little extra with their water, this is very nice stuff. The pear flavor seems a bit more than pear--I want to say there's a hint of banana and a hint of honeydew under there, too. It's nice. I like it. Someone described it as adding water to a glass in which you've had juice. Yep, that's it, with a more complex character, perhaps, to the flavor.<br /><br />Bottled water, flavored or not, is big business and I understand why they'd price it as high as they can get away with it. It's an aptly named, pleasing product, so yeah, four stars.<br /><br />But I'm thinking of investing in a half-dozen fruit essences/extracts and some TrueLime, TrueOrange, and TrueLemon, and just add it to my chilled filtered water at home. It irks to pay this much for "hinty" water. Plus all these plastic bottles are not helping the planet any, are they? I've got stainless steel and other eco-friendly goods at home, might was well put them to use.

review/summary: HINT ---- Simply the best bottled beverage.
review/text: I started drinking Hint Water a few years ago when Smartwater discontinued its similar line of no-calorie, no-artificial-sweetners, lightly flavored waters.  I find that I drink a lot more water during the day with these than with filtered water.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and refreshing ---- just a tiny hint of flavoring.  No syrupy flavor like all the trendy "fitness drinks" out there and no carbonation or harmful artificial sweetners like with diet soda.<br /><br />I was an absolute Diet Coke junkie for fifteen years until I found this product.  No hyperbole ---- it's literally the only thing that I can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from Diet Coke.  It might seem a bit pricey, but for my health I think it is worth every penny.  I just wish they would stock a larger size so I wouldn't feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles.  Also, this may seem a small point but I am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me.  I always get compliments when I hand these out to guests ---- both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon.  They are very subtle.  My husband's favorite is the honeydew-hibiscus.  I like it, too, but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this product highly enough.

review/summary: Hint is the Bomb!
review/text: I love this water.  Pear is my fav.  It also has an essense of banana to me, which I like.  I love that it has zero calories without added artificial sweeteners.  BIG plus for me.  I do wish the price wasn't so steep.  It is basically water with natural flavors added.  My sister thinks we can duplicate at home.  I might give it a try.  Or continue to splurge every once in a while.  Great product though.

review/summary: It's OK, too pricey for the low taste
review/text: I was hoping that there was somehow a flavored water drink with good flavor without sugar or chemicals.  I am still hoping.  Hint does have exactly hint which is what I should of expected.  It's just too expensive of a drink to buy when it really doesn't taste much different than regular water.

review/summary: crisp and refreshing!
review/text: This water is exactly what it promises to be... and I loved the crisp/refreshing pear taste, which was actually stronger than I was led to believe by previous reviewers! It's definitely a pear taste, not just an aftertaste, but it's a delicious and mellow one, not overpowering - and very natural tasting. Looking forward to seeing Hint's newest flavors on Amazon, especially Hibiscus Vanilla!

review/summary: Hint Water
review/text: I thought this water was terrible. I was very disappointed. It almost had a "perfumy" taste to it. Not something I would buy or recommend

review/summary: HINT...NOT EVEN!!
review/text: I ordered four different flavors of "Hint".  I HATE them all!  Yes, there is a "hint" of flavor, but it tastes very "medicinal", not at all refreshing.  In order to just get this stuff down, I have to add some Crystal Lite just to hide the awful taste!  "Twist" by Talking Rain is a MUCH better choice and the price is also better because you get "free shipping", but with the Hint, it is just below the $25.00 allowance for free s/h, so you have to either buy a second case, or pay the shipping which is pretty steep.  I don't recommend this product.

review/summary: Wonderful black rice, high nutrition, the best
review/text: I use this for all my rice needs nowadays.  I would never go back to brown rice as this rice is so tasty that nothing compares to it.  It is high in antioxidants and just incredible tasting.  It has amazing taste.  Try it, you'll never be the same and you will never buy white rice or brown rice again after your taste buds have experienced this yummy rice.
