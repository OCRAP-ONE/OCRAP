review/summary: Easy to prepare, delicious
review/text: I've never tasted curry, and my only venture into Asian food has been at the local Chinese buffet.<br /><br />I liked this a lot! Enough spiciness but could have had a little more--when compared to salsa, this is mild, and the coconut is a nice balance to the spicy flavor. I didn't notice this being overly sweet.<br /><br />I used 2 lbs. of extra lean stew meat; I'm lazy when it comes to cooking and also don't like to touch raw meat (I know, it's just the "dead animal thing" I have going on in my head). The package said to serve with either rice or mashed potatoes.  I boiled some small red potatoes, and mashed those up with their skins on.  Some of the "gravy" was good on top of the mashed taters. This box made 5 adult-sized servings, plenty to go around, and we were all stuffed.<br /><br />This is a dish I wouldn't be ashamed to serve to company, and I plan on ordering more.

review/summary: I'm just a mom, and don't know what Rendang Curry is "supposed to" taste like.  We loved this...
review/text: I'm just a mom, have never been to Asia, and know nothing about how Beef Rendang is "supposed to" taste.  So whether this is authentic, frankly, I have no idea.<br /><br />But... I made this for my family (me & hubby and five kids ages 5-14) and everyone absolutely loved it and begged me to make it again.<br /><br />This was easy to make.  The box contains two packets of stuff, with nice easy-to-rip-open notches.  I prepared it exactly following the instructions (something I rarely do!), and that required:<br /><br />*1 3/4 pounds of beef (okay, I used round steak instead of the beef tenderloin called for)<br />*vegetable oil<br />*water<br /><br />That's it.  Sliced up the beef, cooked it until at least browned, then set aside.<br /><br />Added the contents of the two packages and the water... one odd thing is that it calls for 4/5 a cup of water.  I used something close to a full cup-- but I like to have more sauce than most recipes seem to make.  At this point, you have to be sure to stir it well... the coconut powder clumped up a bit, but giving it a good stir in the hot water and just being sure to pay attention, and I didn't have any problems.<br /><br />Then you add the beef back and cook until the meat is done.<br /><br />They recommend serving with rice or mashed potatoes.  I made a whole lot of rice, and served this over the rice.  We had a side veggie as well, and for 7 of us (including two teen boys) we actually had enough left over for my husband to take to work for lunch the next day.<br /><br />It smelled amazing.  And it tasted even better.  The flavors combined wonderfully, so it just tasted rich.  I have family members who "don't like" coconut, and nobody even noticed -- it just blended so nicely.<br /><br />An added bonus is that the package claims that there is no added MSG, nor artificial colors, and no added preservatives.<br /><br />I will make this again.  In the future, I might try adding a bit of veggies.  But serving it with a full pot of rice served to stretch it for my family.

review/summary: Unique and flavorful
review/text: According to the box, Rendang Curry is a food served in Saigon. I now officially love love love Saigon food. One box would easily serve 4, and takes mere minutes to put together. I served it over couscous, which was a perfect accompaniment because it didn't fight the huge flavors of the sauce. The curry is a unique combination of flavors - spicy with a bit of heat but that same heat disappears quickly in your mouth as the sweetness of the coconut milk kicks in. It really was spectacular flavors that were new to me.<br /><br />A downside. The box calls for 28 ounces of beef tenderloin. Where I live, that's about $35 worth of beef. I talked with my local butcher and he suggested I use sirloin cut up for stir fry (labelled as "stir fry beef" in my grocery store). That cut the cost of the meat down to about $6.00. Because the meat cooks in the sauce for several minutes, the meet was very tender and I see no drawback from the substitution.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this product again. In fact, I will be looking for other Prima Taste products to try! If you like to try new international foods, definitely put this one on your list.<br /><br />(The four star review instead of 5 stars was due to the recipe calling for Beef Tenderloin. Flavor-wise, this is a 5 star product.)

review/summary: Very delicious
review/text: This is very tasty and makes such a quick and easy meal.  I've never had rendang so I can't say if it's authentic, but it did remind me of coconut curry with a bit of green curry taste.  Very clean and fresh.  I actually used pork tenderloin because it's what I had and it worked out very well and the meal came together very quickly.  I slightly browned the meat and then followed the directions, but added a bit more water than called for.  It still thickened up very nicely.<br /><br />There is plenty of sauce so adding veggies would work out well.  It comes with two packs, the curry paste/seasoning and the dehydrated coconut powder.  When I added the powder to the pot I figured it would clump up, but it mixed very smooth and perfectly.  It is a bit sweet, but it's also pretty spicy (at least for me).  I think if you find it too sweet you could add less of the coconut powder.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to buy this again.  So tasty. My whole family just loved it.

review/summary: Not great.  .. and a bit expensive
review/text: Though I doubt this item will be liked my most American palates, I think overall the product is okay.  This is a product of Singapore.  If you're not all that fond of Thai curry, then you probably won't care for this either.  Personally, I LOVE Thai curry a lot more than this.<br /><br />I do have a few "issues" with this product.  First, there are "leaves" in the sauce, and they can be quite "tough".  You might want to strain them out.  Next, the sauce is quite "oily".  The first ingredient in the sauce is vegetable oil.<br /><br />One totally ridiculous thing is what they show as the serving size and servings per package.  They show that the package serves 15 people and a serving size is two tablespoons.  Totally outrageous.  The reason they do this is so that it makes the calories look low (110 per serving).  The directions show to add 28oz of beef tenderloin, which is also crazy.  One would NEVER use such an expensive meat for a box mix such as this.  Beef stew meat works just fine. But based upon what the box shows as a serving size, then you would have less than 2oz per-person.<br /><br />I also think this item is quite expensive for what it is.  Also, I don't think I'd be interested in making this 4-times before the product expires.

review/summary: Great flavors, too sweet
review/text: I used to live in Malaysia and am always looking for dishes to replicate the amazing food I had in KL. This beef rendang has great flavor - that's for sure.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because I found it overly sweet and a little too mild in heat.  Plus, there were hard bits of leaves that were somewhat distracting.<br /><br />I wonder....would using a can of coconut milk cut the sweetness?<br /><br />But....the flavor was so good and the preparation was so darn easy, that I'm ordering more boxes to have on hand.<br /><br />And yes - I would serve this at Supper Club . I just wouldn't tell anyone how easy it was to make!<br /><br />I wonder....would using a can of coconut milk cut the sweetness?

review/summary: Not to my taste
review/text: I am in no way an authority on Indian food. I do enjoy eating it and am famiar with the spice palate, but I have not tried this dish before. I can't say whether it is authentic or not. I can say I didn't like it. I followed directions exactly but the taste was just odd to me. Too bitter and no I didn't burn any ingredients. The texture of the sauce was off too. It had an unpleasant mouth feel, slightly grainy. We had a LOT of leftovers (no one cared much for it) so I tried it again the next day thinning out the sauce in an attempt to make it smokther. Nope, still didn't care for it. But that's just my (our) opinion.

review/summary: Pretty good, but I wouldn't get it again.
review/text: Having only tried Thai food fairly recently (within the last couple of years), I was eager to try this kit out at home.  I knew it was likely that it would be out of my diet comfort zone, and it really was, but I decided to try it anyway.<br /><br />We made it with lean beef, but if I were to make it again I might try it with bison, chicken, or maybe even tofu.  I thought it had a nice balance of flavors, but it could use a little more spice for my taste.  I realize that to make it marketable to the masses, they can't make it too spicy - I'm just saying that if you do like your food spicy, you should anticipate using a little hot sauce; and if you don't like it too spicy you should be okay.  All in all, I'd recommend this to someone who likes curries and doesn't really care about fat intake.  The fact that it's a bit pricey and I do care about fat intake is what makes me say I wouldn't get this again, but it's just a bad product for most curry lovers.

review/text: I very much enjoyed this entree kit. I love all sorts of Asian cuisine, but never tend to have the staples of cooking it in my kitchen. Because I'm on a budget, it never seems worth buying a whole pantry full of ingredients for one meal. (Of course, I aspire to gather those ingredients.)<br /><br />I found this mix to be a perfect way to prepare my own curry at home without buying all the specialty ingredients. I found the instructions easy to follow, and the meal easy to prepare. Until I get the Asian pantry going in my own home, I'll be looking to this brand to satisfy a craving.

I think the seasoning blend is different than what most restaurants here in Connecticut/Northeast use because this had a foreign taste to me that I did not like.

You pretty much just add the (almost cooked) meat and any other ingredients that you want in your curry and then finish cooking it all together.

review/summary: Excellent Curry Sauce
review/text: Many years ago I had a Malaysian friend who would occasionally wow me with a curried egg that she said was a local dish in Malaysia.  She never gave me the recipe so I tried for years to  get the ingredients just right to make that wonderful dish only to fail.  I had forgotten all about that dish until I tried the Rendang curry sauce kit.  Being a vegetarian, I substituted the meat for vegetables and was immediately impressed.  The curry has a mild spicy-sweet  flavor with  a moderate amount of coconut undertone.  It is similar to Thai curry but a little less spicy and has more coconut flavor.  If you like Malaysian-Singapore-Thai cuisine, then you will love this Rendang curry sauce.

review/summary: Hard to believe this is pre-packaged food, and my Chinese wife and Thai friend agree
review/text: I was expecting this to be really salty, like most prepackaged food, but was pleasantly surprised. Albeit not as surprised as my wife (who grew up in Beijing and generally hates prepackaged food) or our friend from Bangkok! Along with the recommended beef, we added potatoes, veggies, sausage, and just a little sugar, and it tasted like homemade. Our friend didn't even realize that it was packaged food until we showed him the box -- he just assumed that my wife made it from scratch.<br /><br />Also, the small box made a pretty good amount of sauce. Often times with these kinds of things, one or two people can easily finish off a package that claims to have 6 or 8 servings so they can water down the "nutrition" information. Along with some rice, this made enough for three adults with one small serving left over.<br /><br />The only negative is the leaves -- there are a TON of them. I ended up chewing up and swallowing a lot of them just because it got to be a hassle picking around them. I would have preferred fewer, larger pieces. I wouldn't want to change the taste, though! It's a bit expensive, too, but considering how much food it makes (despite the small box), it's not too bad.

review/summary: From a box, this is tops
review/text: I've never had a Rendang Curry, but I am generally familiar with South Asian cuisine, and I have no doubt that this is a good rendition. If I had this at a restaurant, I'd be pleased. Having this from a box is a delight.<br /><br />The package notes that Rendang Curry was originally developed to tenderize and mask tough cuts of meat, so I went to my grocer and got a cheap package of stew beef. Following the instructions I browned my stew beef, although I tossed in some onion which isn't in the recipe. Remove the beef from the pot to start the curry, and here's where it gets interesting. The dish is basically a gravy in two parts. The first is a curry paste which you add some water to, which is pretty standard. To this you add a sizable package of ground coconut, which turns the reddish curry into a deep orange-brown gravy. This portion of the process smells heavenly. Throw in your beef (and in my case, onions), and simmer until tender.<br /><br />I served my curry straight (normally you'd spoon it over rice, although the box also suggests mashed potatoes), and used a baguette for my starch and for dipping. The beef was tender from stewing, and the sauce complements a good stew beef wonderfully. The flavors are complex, creamy, and just a hint of spicy. This is not authentic South Asia heat, but it was spicy enough that I got a case of sniffles.<br /><br />I can only come up with two negatives. One is that the powdered coconut should really be added to the water first, because if it's added to the curry paste it tends to form lumps. This is nothing that really detracts from the taste, but the texture is a little odd, so I'd suggest a slight revision to the directions. Two is that the dish includes large chunks of herb leaves, and while they are authentic to the cuisine, they don't reconstitute well and again affect texture. I highly suggest tossing in some onion with the beef as I did, which is an authentic touch and will help to mask the texture issues- in fact some raw onion wouldn't be out of place either.<br /><br />This is restaurant-quality curry in a box. Pick some up today.

review/summary: Fast, easy, and delicious
review/text: I recently made this for my parents, who were born and raised in Singapore. They grew up eating things like rendang curry, and Prima Taste is a Singaporean brand that my mom has relied on many times to make laksa at home. This curry was exceptionally easy to make -- I added about a pound and a half of beef, browned it in a dutch oven and put it aside. In the same pot I added the curry paste, coconut powder, and 4/5 cup of water, brought it to a low boil, and then added the beef to finish cooking. From start to finish, including the time it took to cut and trim the beef, the entire process took just about 20-25 minutes.. not time-consuming by any means.<br /><br />The sauce is thick and plentiful with a strong coconut flavor. We all thought that the curry was overly sweet and needed the kick of added heat. I served this with rice that I soaked in coconut cream and pandan leaves, ikan bilis (fried anchovies), and a fried egg. With a side of vegetables, this box can easily serve 6 people, at least in my family, or 4 people very generously. My parents and I ate about half for dinner, with plenty of leftovers.

review/text: This curry sauce kit is good on all sorts of meet.  Everything is in the box, except for utensils and the meat of your choice.  The whole process wasn't messy at all as I thought it would be, even for a non-expert cook like myself.  This was very sweet-spicy, but not too overwhelming.  If its too spicy for your liking, simply add less spices.  The only downer for me was that I choose not to ingest the thyme leaves and there were several along the way that I had to pick through.  Other than that, Prima Taste delivered the great spice that I was looking for.

review/summary: surprisingly good
review/text: Actually this curry sauce was really good. A lot better than I expected from a box. The kit is full of ingredients to make a sauce - it has a packet of paste (the sauce base) and a packet of coconut "premix" (a powder made from dehydrated coconut milk and bits of coconut). You just add water and you have delicious curry sauce.<br /><br />Instructions said to brown 28 oz of beef for this. But I think you could use any meat and / or veggies and it would taste good.<br /><br />It's not very spicy though. If you like spicy, you'll have to add some. It's also quite high in sugar and fat.<br /><br />One tip: the coconut premix has a texture like sugar. It comes in a packet and has some lumps in it (also like sugar). You don't want the lumps. Mush the packet with your fingers to squash the lumps back into powder. This will make it easier to mix the sauce into a nice smooth texture.<br /><br />It was easy, tasty, and made quite a lot of food. Probably 4 servings at least.<br /><br />I'd buy this again, and I'd try this brand's other sauce kits too.

Also, don't refer to yourself as 'self,' because it's a bit pretentious." And so I got it and finally got around to cooking it today. What are my thoughts?<br /><br />First off, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed the coconut powder separately. Then I cooked up everything and dumped it over some rice. The end result was...well, interesting. It tasted good, but not excellent. I'd expected a bit more, starting with it being a little more spicy. I was also taken aback by how much "grass" there was inside the spice-paste pouch. I thought it was going to be little bits, but no, it was good sized bits. Beyond that, I did find the paste pouch to be interesting. It seemed like a good way of doing things.<br /><br />Anyhow, I can't really compare this with any other forms of curry, since I've never had any, but it was ok. Not great. But ok. I'll probably never rush out to buy it, but if I get my hands on some more, I'd be willing to eat it.

review/summary: Good Curry
review/text: I am a "Indian food" kind of a guy, but still, this curry was surprisingly good. It tasted more Thai-ish than anything else, and if you dig Thai food, even better. On my second go, I left out the coconut curry, and it didn't taste as genuine. So, experiment with it a little. In the end, you will really like the curry.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Felt a bit like I was making a special Hamburger Helper especially when I added the powdered coconut mix.  Besides that this was very good.  Really enjoyed this over some brown rice.  Lots of yummy sauce.  Has just a slight touch of spiciness that kept my  young kids (3 & 5) from eating a full serving but they did like it and had a few bites.  I do think a much of the taste of the dish overall will depend on the type of beef used and how you cook it.  Certainly don't want to have meat be too chewy.  I would be tempted to try the mix with chicken in the future.

review/summary: Tasty though hardly a revelation, and rather expensive
review/text: After reading the other reviews here I was expecting some sort of curry revelation from this Rendang. But dang, Ren and Stimpy, it was merely quite good, maybe very good for a packaged curry. It's got some layers of taste but nothing approaching a freshly home-made curry, and miles from a serious restaurant. And at almost 7 per package, if you buy four, this is hardly a bargain.<br /><br />First problem: it's barely spicy. I don't need nuclear but I do want heat from a curry. This has little if any. Second issue for me was the packaging. Squeeeezing this paste out of the army-rations-type foil pouch made me feel like my unit was going to be deployed at any second. Maybe that's just me...but it also made it hard to get all the contents out without serious rolling and some mess on the hands. Far from ideal. Plus the bay leaves were kind of a hassle to deal with; they certainly are key to the taste but while the full leaves are easy to find, the smaller pieces make for some weird chewy moments. Don't swallow...<br /><br />From a pure taste perspective, it's a good Rendang but if you've ever had a truly fresh one made with fresh spices, not just a paste, then you know the difference. At seven clams for less than two servings, I'd say go to your local gourmet Indian or Thai place and get the real deal.<br /><br />But, if there is no such option nearby and you love Rendang, then this is certainly a decent alternative. I just don't think it's that far beyond Mae Ploy or the other packaged curry stalwarts, and they cost literally a third or so what this does, plus you can use fresh coconut, and you won't need to add more spices on your own to get it close to real curry heat.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Basic Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Next best thing to being there.
review/text: A few years ago, after reading about the restaurant in "The Barbeque Bible" by Steven Raichlen as being his choice for one of the top ten BBQ places on earth, I had a chance to dine at this mecca due to travel near Memphis for my daughter's soccer tournament. We spent Friday and Saturday in Germantown enjoying the soccer event but I was also looking forward to Sunday when I would acheive a quest of my own.<br />  We arrived in the area near noon that Sunday as we had a long drive ahead back to Dallas/Fort Worth. After touring the Gibson guitar plant, we went down the small alley toward the place when a smiling man called to us from the shadows, "You must be here for the Rendezvous!". I said "Yes, Yes Yes!", my face gleaming. Then he said "Sorry, it is closed on Sunday".<br />  Disspirited, we walked over to Beale street and entered a shop that coincedently sold the restaurant rub. I bought a couple shakers thinking at least I'll have a taste something like their ribs at home. We walked up the steet and had a very good meal and entertainment at B.B. King's and then made our way to Texas.<br />  A couple of weeks later, I was able to try the rub on a rack of ribs. Simply GREAT (and I do mean simply). Just follow the intructions on the shaker which call for basting while grilling in a solution of 1/2 vinegar to 1/2 water.<br />Add the rub near the very end of cooking. Just so delicious.<br />  I now buy four at a time and have given the same as gifts. Enjoy.

review/summary: Got me off prescription acid reflux medications!
review/text: I have suffered from acid reflux for years which is ridiculous since I am 22! I have been taking nexium for around 2 years and protronix before that. Any food fatty, sweet, high in sugars (bread), or spicy sent me into a ball of pain because of the acid that came from them. I read that apple cider vinegar is supposed to be a fantastic way to control these kinds of problems and far healthier than a dependence on those prescriptions (not to mention cheaper)!<br /><br />I ordered these caps as I had smelled apple cider vinegar as a liquid and it is absolutely disgusting, I don't think I could have even choked it down for its benefits. I got these pills and in the beginning I took them as directed which for the first week or so was hard because my body was very dependent on proton-pump-inhibitors. After that initial week of hell I was able to make due with these pills. Then another week or two later I realized I didn't have any residual pain of those acid flair ups!<br /><br />I have now been off a proton-pump-inhibitor for 6 months successfully! I only take these before particularly fatty, sugary, or spicy meals to aid in keeping acid levels constant. The pills stink pretty bad make no mistake about that, but who cares when you compare the smelly pill to the money you'll save on prescriptions and the side-effects of those meds?! If you have acid reflux or acid issues I absolutely recommend you get a bottle of these and try it.<br /><br />People should also note that the 1star review on here is not related to the product at all, it is in regards to the shipping manner. Don't let that bad review bias you against an amazing product.

review/text: I saw all the great reviews for the Bragg's brand apple cider vinegar and bought some to try for my many issues.  The only way I could drink it was by mixing a tablespoon with V-8.  I decided to order these capsules instead and have been taking them for about a week.  For years I have been suffering from lower back pain.  Trouble sleeping, bending over, etc. without moaning from the pain.  I woke up this morning and was completely amazed that I did not have any back pain!!  All day I have been bending over to touch the ground to test and make sure that I'm not going crazy, but the pain is gone!  I'm telling everyone who will listen to me about this miracle.  I sure hope that my relief lasts and I can only give the credit to these ACV caplets since I do not take anything else for any kind of pain relief...except for the occasional Advil for a rare headache.  I'm not sure if these little guys will help with other issues going forward, but I have decided to subscribe to a monthly shipment just for the pain relief.  They smell like vinegar and go down easily.  I am more than pleased and still in shock at how I feel!

review/text: I agree with the other reviewers who indicated that this is a good quality product.<br /><br />The capsules smell very fresh.  Vinegar indeed can smell stale, aged or depleted.  Obviously age doesn't hurt vinegar's function, and high quality vinegar can age like wine.  But here, freshness suggests that the company has high turnover, which is a good sign.<br /><br />The capsules appear to be made with a very high quality gelatin (or whatever they use for these particular ones).  While capsule quality doesn't seem like a big deal normally, when the contents are vinegar, I think it's worth mentioning.<br /><br />I feel perfectly fine taking these; no stomach upsets or other issues.  I have only taken one daily (I think many people take too high of dosages of various products every day, which ends up causing problems sometimes if you aren't well educated on the vitamins and herbs etc. that you are using).<br /><br />I would purchase these again and I would also try other products from this company.

review/summary: good taste but deceptive packaging description
review/text: Frist, Nirmala's blend is lovely.<br /><br />Second, the information about the amount you will receive is deceptive and that ticks me off. As described I, wrongly assumed, I would receive a "2-1/2 by 1-3/4 inch air tight tin" full of the spice blend. Not so.<br /><br />Third, if you plan to order from Nirmala call them and ask how many ounces you will receive of the product in the tin.<br /><br />Fourth, compared to other places, this was extremely expensive for a very small amount of product.<br /><br />Sixth, a little more information about peri peri I found interesting:<br /><br />African birdseye (or African devil or African red devil) is a cultivar of the chili pepper that grows both wild and domesticated. It is a small and extremely spicy member of the capsicum plant genus.<br /><br />Piri-piri, peri-peri or peli-peli is the name used in Portuguese and a number of African languages to describe the African bird's-eye chili. The variations in spelling derive from the various pronunciations of the word in parts of Africa, although "piri-piri" is the correct spelling in Portuguese.<br /><br />In Portuguese cuisine, piri-piri is often used in preparing sauces and marinades for roast and grilled dishes, especially chicken and various fish.

review/summary: Nirmala's Peri-peri blend
review/text: The Peri-peri blend is tangy and tasty, my only negative is that Peri-peri is not even listed in the ingredients so I feel the percentage must be quite small. The label says "other herbs and spices" of which I assume the Peri-peri is included in.  It goes good on anything that you may feel needs a little zip without too much heat.  Fast shipping and fairly reasonable pricing.  Thanks Nirmala!!

Seriously cat, you can't eat the shredds or bits...(no teeth problem)this is the heigth of spoiling but I put in a mini food processor to get her to eat.  Gives you an idea of who runs whom...bought this flavor and now she is super happy and will try to get the can out of the cardboard tray herself if Mama doesn't move fast enough.  I also gave her a couple other flavors but she only nibbled, this she gobbles and snorts as she eats.  I'm thinking she really likes it...lol  So buy this and your baby will think she is something special too.

review/summary: He eats it,
review/text: After trying two other food (Purina ONE dry food (vet rec), Purina ProPlan wet food, both urinary tract health varieties) this was the first one my cat would eat at home (apparently he ate the ONE for the vet- just like he ate his antibiotic out of the vets hand while we have to shove it down his throat...).  He spent 20 days at the vet, and ended up going back for emergency surgery to remove a stone, and lost quite a bit of weight during the process.  After we got him home he refused to eat until we tried this food.<br /><br />Anyway, eventually when he is less pitiful he will have to eat the gigantic bag of ONE or get a job to pay for it, lol, but for now this is helping him recover.  He will probably move to a 50% canned, 50% dry food diet eventually.

review/summary: My every day green tea
review/text: I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays "NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays "CAFFENE FREE".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.

review/summary: Best Yirgacheffe I have found at Amazon
review/text: I came to Amazon looking for African coffee when Green Mountain raised their shipping rates to $30 for 1-2 lbs to Hawaii, making it just too expensive to maintain.  It is practically impossible to find African coffee here, which is why I had been getting it by mail to begin with, and my early experiments were not very satisfying.  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHATY">Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a> and found it to be burned, bitter.  At the time I thought it was better than none at all, and so tried their Kenya AA (actually, it was Kenya AB, which I had never seen offered before) at which point I figured they were just buying lesser beans, and so the search continued.  I tried a sampler from Coffee masters <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UFSOXE">Coffee Masters Around The World In Twelve Coffees Variety Pack, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)</a> and was overall pretty impressed, so I subscribed to several of their single origin roasts.  The yirgacheffe is very nice, not the very best I have ever had, but way way better than what I got from coffee bean direct.  Recently I received a notice of a price increase prior to my subscription shipment, and so decided to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>.  That was nice coffee, mild and smooth, but did not have the distinctive taste of Ethiopian coffee, and so I am back :)<br /><br />The Coffee Masters roast is just about right for the coffee, a medium roast which brings out the chocolately undertones (which I missed with the Equal Exchange roast).  I have received several shipments, all were fresh, roasted right: no complaints whatsoever (but for the price increase ;)  This is the best African coffee I have found on Amazon thus far, and I have tried at least half a dozen.  That is not to say there may not be a better one lurking which I have not tried, but I am more than satisfied with this and so just reupped my subscription.<br /><br />I you do not typically order single origin coffee, or are not looking for a certain distinctive taste you would probably like the equal exchange more than I did.  It is a nice cup of coffee, but in my opinion, this one is better.<br /><br />  This is a nice coffee' mild, smooth and non-acidic, what's more, it tastes like single origin Yirgacheffe complete with the floral nose and chocolate finish.  I am looking forward to starting my day right again!

Price was acceptable - within a few cents of our grocery store price. Packaging was fine. Shipping time was as promised.  Quality quite simply sucked. We picked one bag of the four at random. The beans were dry, with no 'oil' or aroma. We made a pot with the proportions of beans to water that we always use, which turned out weak and watery-tasting. VERY disappointing. We have kept the remaining bags as an emergency backup in the freezer, but honestly, hope we never have to use them!  We found an acceptable alternative at a local source, at a slightly higher price, but superb quality and flavor.

If I lived in a location with a poor coffee bean selection I'd still be ordering online, but if you live in Seattle or any other town with fresh beans I'd recommend buying locally.

The proper way to drink this tea is by pouring boiling water on it and steeping for 5 minutes, which usually make it fairly dark. Unlike other teas, it seems to stay smooth-tasting even when you make it strong and has a nice reddish color to it. I can't get enough of this tea. On the other hand, my wife absolutely hates the flavor.

review/summary: Smoke me a bowl...of tea
review/text: I first heard about Lapsang Souchong while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580087450">The Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide</a>, where they described the history and manufacturing process for the unique tea, as well as saying that it's strong smoky flavor had a "love it or hate it" reputation amongst tea drinkers. Well, my favorite beverage in the world is the Islay whisky Laphroaig, and I have heard those exact same terms used to describe its flavor many, many times.  I knew I had to give Lapsang Souchong a try.<br /><br />Of course, there are many Lapsang Souchong's available, and it was really just a gamble to decide which one to chose.  I wanted a loose-leaf tea, since they tend to be of superior quality to tea bags.  I had heard the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JP6H2O">Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong Loose Leaf</a> described as a "beginner's Lapsang Souchong," with a less-intense smokiness and I knew I didn't want that.  If "less-intense" was what my palette demanded I wouldn't reach for a bottle of Laphroaig!  Another reviewer recommended this China Mist product (sold under the name of their imprint company "Leaves Pure Tea") as being a good example of Lapsang Souchong.  The price and quantity were just right so this is what I picked.<br /><br />I am extraordinarily pleased with this purchase, and now am a dedicated fan of Lapsang Souchong.  The aroma is an intense smokiness, although the flavor is much more delicate.  I went with the recommended steeping time of five minutes in under-boiled water, and that seemed just about right.  If this tea is "love it or hate it," I definitely fall into the "love it" category.<br /><br />The tea comes packed in an air-tight package with an oxygen-eater insert so it is as fresh as modern technology can make it.  The zip-lock bag is re-sealable, which is nice. I can't find any details on the grade of the tea, or where is was processed but I assume for the price we are not dealing with a  top-quality first-flush product, but for something that has been smoked over pinewood for so long you don't really need the most delicate leaves!<br /><br />Aside from enjoying a glass of Lapsang Souchong, it is really wonderful for cooking.  "The Story of Tea" has a Lapsang Souchong ice cream recipe that I want to try out, and I recently used some in a soup I was making as a replacement for liquid smoke.  It turned out fantastic, with the tea lending a complex smokiness to the dish.

review/summary: Single Malt and Cigars.
review/text: Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.<br /><br />This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the "single malt and cigars" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it.

Michener's 1974 historical novel Centennial, Rocky Mountain fur trapper Alexander McKeag describes lapsang souchong as "a man's tea, deep and subtle and blended in some rugged place," ... "better even than whisky." " --Wikipedia<br /><br />By some arcane internet subject that led to another, and another, I ended up having read that Wikipedia line the other night.  I ask you - how in the hell was I supposed to pass that up?<br /><br />So I went and bought a mesh tea ball, and bought this tea.  Yeah, I read the great write-ups here that spoke about the nuances of different brands, and that encouraged the decision to try it as authentic as possible (because so many brands of tea sold at Wal-Mart these days really don't do much for me ... in fact, hot tea in general never did much for me...).<br /><br />After steeping it for a few minutes I'd say the aroma was that of 50% smoke and 50% black tea. The black tea aroma came after the initial smoky smell, and I found this both pleasing - then reassuring.<br /><br />Initial tastes is that of just less than 50% smoke - unless you inhale before or during the intake ... then you get a boat-load more smoke.  The ability to change-up one's experience with each sip is isn't a bad thing; quite the contrary.  The rest is some mix of tea and sweetness.  I don't really have a clue where the sweetness is coming from as I haven't read about it here, but there doesn't seem to be any need to add anything to it to sweeten it up (not that I'd adulterate a good tea or coffee anyway).  Perhaps I'm confusing smokiness with sweetness, but truth be told they seem intermingled here - no unpleasantries abound.<br /><br />Lastly, without having a good way of describing what it really is, I don't find it something that should be seen as either "love it or hate it."  This brand's version of it, at least, is first and foremost a tasty tea (well, 50.1% of the flavor is, anyway, give or take 10%), so someone looking for a black tea experience probably won't hate it, but that isn't to say that people who mix stuff into their beverages will find it mixes well.  It would seem that it's the delicate balance of the far ends of this tea that is the prize, so putting something else into it may ruin that which you're trying to improve.

review/summary: Not what it used to be -
review/text: I used to buy Four Paws catnip and my cats loved it.  Then I couldn't find it for a couple of years and was thrilled to find it again on Amazon.  What I got was a bunch of sticks mixed with the catnip.  There is no scent.  The quality of this product is so bad my cat won't even touch it.  I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of this product and am sorry I ordered two boxes which are useless.

review/text: Like the product, But shipping is a problem. You can't put six jars in one bag with nothing between them without a mess happening. I have lost two jars out of twelve so far to breakage. Amazon is unresponsive to this problem.

review/summary: Unspeakably Good
review/text: So, good, in fact, that they may lead to oversnacking, which would defeat the purpose.  Basically the fruit crisps are just like thin pop-tarts, so the idea behind it is to finish off the meal or enjoy them with a cup of coffee rather than pig out on them like a chunk of cheesecake.  I think they are overpriced, however, the net weight per pound is right up there with top sirloin, and any time they charge that much for sugar and flour, I have to wait for them to go on sale.  Very delicious, though, I have to limit myself to one pack at a time or else I'll get in trouble...

review/text: glad Amazon has these and the strawberry ones, my wife and I love these, although they have a mild cardboard taste (must be the 100 calories) and are 2x really thin bars.  I have a subscription setup through amazon with these, set at 4 months, then the strawberry ones setup at 4 months also, however they alternate, so every 2 months I get one then the other!  that way I still have variety, but get bulk tasty treats shipped to me... :)  I've already gained 5 pounds (just kidding)

review/summary: Decent 100-calorie snack
review/text: Each wrapper contains two 50-calorie crisps.  They are essentially a thinner, crispier nutri-grain style bar.  They don't provide much nutrition other than a small caloric energy boost.  I don't eat one everyday but they are good for when I don't want a full meal replacement bar and don't have fresh fruit/veggies/nuts around.

review/summary: Special K Fruit Crisps
review/text: I tried this on a whim because they had a coupon at the store when they first came out.  They are the best.... unfortunately you want to keep eating them.  They are the perfect snack in between breakfast & lunch.  Perfect to eat at your desk and still keep working.  I hope they come out with more flavors.  I have been having problems finding them in the stores on a regular basis so I ordered them here.  Very convenient.

review/summary: So delicious
review/text: I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

review/summary: Special K Fruit Crips
review/text: These are so good.  I was looking for a light snack that I can keep in my purse for those times my blood level gets low.  I first tried the brown sugar and cinnamon.  I then went back for the strawberry and blueberry.  All are really good, crips, thin and they do remind me of poptarts but smaller and no guilt.  My least favorite is chocolate.  I'm waiting for apple to come out or even a better flavor pineapple.  That would be yummy.  I gave one to a friend who was flying one day and she really liked it.  I also asked a friend at work if she had tried these and she said yes that they are too good.  I let her try my blueberry and she loved it.  You can't go wrong when you want a little snack that won't throw you off your diet.  But just be careful as stated before in a review you can go overboard with these at first because they are so good.  Pace yourself and you'll be fine.

review/summary: Great snack but packaging is annoying
review/text: I really like these snack bars to eat in the morning on the go, the only problem is the packaging is terrible! The box the bars come in is the hardest box to open. The opening flap always tears and usually tears the flap underneath it as well. Even if you were to rip off the flaps completely the perforations offer no help. The troublesome packaging makes me think twice about buying this snack in the future. Too bad because the bars are tasty!
