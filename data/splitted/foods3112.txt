review/summary: Good value; fragrant plump beans
review/text: I was pleased with my purchase of vanilla beans.  They arrived promptly and were fragrant, moist and plump (at least most of them were).  I used them to make vanilla extract with 4 different vodkas.  It's only been three weeks (I usually wait at least 4 months before using) but the extract already smells divine and more like vanilla than alcohol.  The beans were so affordable I decided to make double strength extract.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.

review/text: I have a 10 yr old & a 7 yr old dog. The 10 yr old will eat anything, the 7 yr old is extremely picky & has a delicate stomach. We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

review/text: I was introduced to this dog food over tens years ago. One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/summary: My dogs eat it. Ingredients are better than anything at the grocery store.
review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/text: I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/text: The name may have changed but still tastes the same. Although all the flavors are great Malt is my favorite - and has been since the 80's! Problem is that my local stores stopped carrying the 10 count Malt packages and I had to buy the Assorted. With only 2 Malt envelopes I found myself rationing - and still when I craved a malt I found I had run out already. I happened to stumble upon it here and found the price acceptable. Now - I never run out! Once in awhile I'll have a desire for another flavor and that's where the assorted comes in handy but I am pleased I'm now fully stocked with malt. It really should be added to the subscribe and save program.

review/text: First, I have to say that I only spent about $28.00 for a pack of 6 vs. the $52.00 that's shown online now.  I hope that the price goes down soon so that I can buy more since this flavor is not available at our local grocery stores.  With that said, I will say that the malt flavor is my favorite and for one simple reason.  It's the only flavor from Nestle Carnation Instant Breakfast drinks that contains no artificial flavors.  To me, that's important since this is what I give my two kids for breakfast every morning.  I used to buy them the regular chocolate flavor, but then noticed that it had artificial flavors, whereas this one did not.  I guess to them, chocolate is chocolate because they did not complain or even notice when I switched and started buying this malt flavor.

review/text: A lot of times I don't really feel like eating breakfast so early in the morning because my stomach feels sensitive in the mornings. So I prefer to drink my breakfast. Nutrition drinks are my favorite for in the morning. However when looking through stores these drinks can be a bit pricey. I was fortunate enough to find such a great deal on Amazon. There are so many flavors I have yet to try.  If you drink these on a daily basis I highly recommend buying them in bulk from Amazon.

The taste is really delicious, probably the best one I've ever had (out of maybe 6 common ones that I've tried in my life.) If you don't like some good heat, you may want to steer clear.  I actually add extra water to mine, and it's still delicious and quite spicy.  The price here on subscribe and save is off the charts good...12 packages arriving at the door for under $4?  Of course, this is not a healthy meal, so you have to be careful of the sodium and carbs, if you have high blood sugar, or high blood pressure. For us, it's an occasional treat, not something to eat every day.

review/text: A rare find in the US, this Latin American coffee is as good as instant coffee gets. They use a blend of coffee and caramelized sugar to produce this mild, great tasting coffee. I find it works nicely in coffee smoothies and other blended coffee drinks. Once opened, it doesn't keep much longer than a month though.

review/summary: This is THE chicken broth that tastes like Chinese food.
review/text: I've been trying to make Chinese food at home for the past 30 years. Not all the time! I've eaten in a lot of Chinese restaurants. Could never find the chicken broth or cubes that would give that special Chinese flavor. Not even the regular Knorr chicken broth that's found in American grocery stores tasted right. Egg Drop soup or chow mein never tasted as good as even the cheapest mall food. Then one day my wife and I were shopping at a local Oriental food store and we asked the owner what they use to make their lunch buffet. She pointed at this can. That was it! Now even egg drop soup tastes like it should. By the way, there are no eggs in Egg Drop soup. I don't care how many cooking channels and TV chefs say otherwise. What you think looks and feels like egg white is realy dried tofu skin. It is the skin that develops on a batch of tofu that they skim off the top. It's dried and sold in packages. That dried curd and this broth is what makes egg drop soup. Plus a little tumeric powder for color and flavor. Go ahead and use eggs. It will always be stringy and fishy no matter how you stir it.

Sometimes adding a little milk and sugar is good and sometimes just plain is good.  Haven't tried it iced yet but I'm thinking in summer I will.  We recently switched to tea after noon...  replacing the afternoon pot of coffee.  Sometimes I like it so much I think I may give up coffee.  Will have to try the other varieties made by Tazo Chai... there is a wake up one that might completely replace my coffee.

review/text: Tazo Chai tea in the filter bag has an aroma and taste I love.  I also drink Stash Chai, but I prefer Tazo Chai because it adds a small and pleasant bite.  That may be because its spices include pepper and anise.  I fix it every morning, 14 oz. at a time, using one or two tea bags (depending on how sparky I feel at the time).  I add two bags of Splenda and two ounces of skim milk.  The result is 16 oz. of pure, low-calorie pleasure.

review/summary: India's Original Spiced Milk Tea.
review/text: In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.<br /><br />Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ...

review/summary: This stuff is terrible!
review/text: I love Chai.  It's one of my favorite drinks, but this Chai is absolutely awful.  It has such a terrible Pepper aftertaste you can hardly drink it.  I bought a box of it 32 ounces and mixed it with my favorite milk beverage, Rice dream almond, which is my favorite way to make Chai.  I had a few sips of it, and I thought it was going to be okay, but after about a half a cup I couldn't even finish it.  I threw the cup out and then I dumped out the remainder, after giving some to my roommate and she thought it was terrible too. The first sip is okay until the aftertaste hits you.  But the strong black pepper aftertaste is just overwhelming he can't taste the Chai at all.  This was a total waste of money.  Both the $3.85 for the Chai and the $2.95 for the Rice dream which fortunately was on sale.  Fortunately for me, I had some Oregon Chai still at home and another box of Rice dream that I could mix it with Chai was an out of luck entirely.  For me, I'll stick with Oregon Chai it has a much better flavor and no bitter aftertaste.  Plus, you can also get it in regular or in unsweetened in case you happen to be dieting.  If you get the unsweetened and mix it with Rice dream or almond dream that gives it plenty of sweetness on its own without the calories.<br /><br />I would never recommend this to anyone.  Don't be fooled.  Just because it's a name brand doesn't mean that it's going to be tasting well.  I wish you better luck than what I have with it, but I really recommend going with something else like the Oregon Chai.

review/summary: Broken House Rules- a treat worth a scolding
review/text: Before using this product we had a "no dead birds in the house" rule.  Henceforth, when I gave my dog one of these for like thirty seconds he would give it a lick and then look at me with the wide eyed guilt look.  Finally I realized what the problem was and gave him the all clear at which point he tore-down.  I took it as a sign that he enjoyed the treat but then I caught him later with paws on the table trying to get to the bag.  As a sign he LOVED the duck's feet it was great.  However, since we still have the "no climbing on furniture to steal things" rule in the house he had to be scolded and watch me put the treats on a shelf six feet off the floor.  After watching him with his second one I truly believe he would have risked another scolding if they hadn't had their new home on the high shelf.

To find them on the warehouse deal was amazing. I got 12 one pound bags for apx 18.00!  Usually, they sell for 3.29 a bag! These were shipped from Pennsylvania the home of the Snyder company in their own box with no room to spare (thus little to no breakage)! They have an expiration date of May 13, 2012 which is a little over 3 months from today(Feb 15)! This averages out to about a bag a week. These are big fat pretzels. One just fits in the palm of my hand. I tried one and it is absolutely NOT stale! This is indeed a fantastic find and savings!

review/text: These Snyder's of Hanover Olde Tyme Pretzels are the only pretzels I want, I love everything about them. The size of these are one size down from the largest bagged size and are very lightly salted, which I enjoy very much. The texture is not rock-hard like some other larger pretzels I've had; rather, when you bite into one of these, it has a flakey, slightly (but pleasantly) crumbly texture that is easy to chew. The flavor is mild and just plain good. I enjoy making chocolate covered pretzels once or twice a year during holidays for my family as well as bundle up packages of regular and white chocolate pretzels as treats to give away, and everyone enjoys them. I have found these pretzels are also very good when one is getting over a sick tummy because they are so mild. I never cared very much for pretzels before until I tried this brand and have been buying them ever since!

review/summary: Too crumbly, not enough salt
review/text: To each his own, but IMHO, these are possibly the worst pretzels I've ever had. They don't have much flavor, and they are too soft and crumbly--almost the consistency of a crusty Lorna Doone cookie. Not much salt at all. I'd go for the sourdough variety instead.

review/summary: fiber content is wrong on the label, not 11 but 6!
review/text: A fellow dieter corrected me today and directed me to the Nature's Path website where it says:<br />"March 22,2012 ...This cereal does indeed have 6g of fiber per serving and the product details and nutritional panel on the website have been updated to reflect this; we're sorry for any inconvenience."<br />[...] then scroll to the Optimum Slim<br /><br />I am very irritated at the difference in numbers. Amazon's label says 11 grams of fiber, my box says 9 and their own site says 6. Corrected to 6.<br /><br />But it is a delicious cereal and so easy that you will be willing to eat breakfast - high in fiber (6) and protein (9) - and all organic. If you are really running late, pack up some in a zip-lock and munch it in the car.  I like it so much I get it in the Subscribe & Save program on Amazon. It does cost less than in the grocery store.

review/summary: My favorite cereal
review/text: The best cold cereal I ever had and I'm in my sixties. Healthy, great taste, not overly sweetened, keeps its crispiness in liquid (I use Silk soy milk). Add some dried cranberries, almonds and fresh fruit for added goodness.

review/summary: One of my Top Favorite Cereals! Can't wait for breakfast!
review/text: I have been telling my friends to try this cereal because I like it so much.  The best thing I like about it, after the taste, is that its actually GOOD for me!  I tend to like some cereals which aren't the best thing for me to be eating as I'm in my mid 40s, but this one tastes fabulous (not too sweet, either) and is a very healthy choice. I totally disagree withe the other reviewer who says this cereal is "bland"-it is anything but bland. I am what most people would call a "foodie"; I live to eat, not eat to live.  Most of my friends trust my opinion in foods because they know how picky I am, and I'm also a total "label reader."  I feel good when I start off my day by eating something healthy as it sets the trend for the rest of the day. Hope they don't discontinue this product...I love it.

review/summary: Overall, best cereal on the market imho
review/text: First of all, the reason why I buy this cereal is because of the stellar nutritional stats it has: 9g each of fiber and protein per cup for only 7g sugar.  The taste is perfect - there's a perfect amount of sweetness to it so your mouth isn't awash in sugar but at the same time you don't feel compelled to add any sugar or other sweetener to it.  It's probably sweet enough that small children would like it, but I don't have any small children around to test this hypothesis.  I also love its texture - it's incredibly crunchy, so if you have bad teeth it may not be the cereal for you, and by the time you finish a bowl it's still pretty crunchy and not at all soggy (not like other cereals that practically disintegrate by the time you're done with a bowl).  It's pretty neutral in its flavor aside from the aforementioned subtle sweetness, so you could add whatever fruit you wanted to it.  I'm a big guy (trying to become a bit smaller lol), and one serving of this with some soy milk will keep me satisfied for a couple of hours (a balanced breakfast includes more than just cereal, but I'm like most people and usually on the run at breakfast time so I have this with a glass of orange juice only).<br /><br />So there you go: great nutrition for a cereal, great taste, great texture, it's relatively filling, and it's quite versatile.  And the price on amazon is SO much better than what you'll get in the store.<br /><br />Like I said though, if you've got bad teeth, it may be too crunchy for you, and small children may or may not like it, although you could probably get them to eat it eventually if they don't like it at first.

review/summary: Great Cereal
review/text: This is a good tasting cereal, with low fat and lot's of fiber.  I add some fresh fruit and skim milk, to form a balance breakfast.  This cereal is not carried in all supermarkets, plus, the price is great on amazon!

review/summary: Relatively bland taste, especially for the calorie count
review/text: We bought this cereal along with several others by Nature's Path, a company that makes some pretty good cereals.  The taste this one however seems to be quite bland.  That in itself would not be an issue, however it contains 210 calories for the standard serving size of 55g (3.8 calories per gram), which is a lot.  Especially when Cinnamon Toast Crunch contains 4.2 calories per gram (only 10% more) and tastes like candy.  If you mix those two together it's alright, and the result is good taste plus fiber.

review/summary: not what I thought
review/text: The coffee is good, but this flavor gets old fast! It has a film that will linger on your tongue and it is kinda gross. The first time you taste it its like heaven, but after that.....it really tastes like drinking liquid sugar
