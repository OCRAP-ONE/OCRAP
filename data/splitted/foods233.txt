review/summary: "heavy" flavor
review/text: The first time I had this tea, I couldn't stand it.  Had one or two teabags, mourned my purchase, and left the other 18 tea bags there.  I've just tried it again and I found it all right, so I think I can get through the rest, but it will definitely take time.<br /><br />The flavoring added to this tea is clumsy and heavy.  The tea bags themselves say "natural & artificially flavored" and say it has a "rich, robust flavor".  That's for sure.  Dunk a tea bag in a glass of unheated tap water (I drink all mine steeped in room-temperature water, never boiled) and you will watch the water immediately turn brown, whereas a higher-grade tea would need much more time to get anywhere near that coloring.  The aroma also is very artificial-smelling and way too strong compared to what naturally flavored teas smell like.<br /><br />Is this a problem?  Not necessarily.  You might be looking for a "heavy" tea that you can use as a step to wean your kids off of colas.  With some sugar, possibly some cream, this might be exactly what you are looking for.  In the same way this might also be a way to wean yourself off of coffee if, as a coffee drinker, you feel that teas are too "light".  Or you might just like your tea this way, period.  Just be aware of this when you buy it.<br /><br />I recommend the Dilmah brand, Caramel flavor, as being similar to this one but not as fakey smelling.  (Dilmah also makes a Vanilla, which I think is OK but not stunning.)

I wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing.

I normally only can find when I make trips up to Canada, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this online at Amazon, and for such a reasonable price.  The toffee is buttery and very chewy.  If you have sensitive dental work I would not recommend purchasing as this will give your teeth & jaw quite a workout, but if you don't have those type of problems, this is the best toffee I have ever had.  I just wish Amazon carried the licorice flavor!

review/summary: Works great, decent taste...
review/text: I've used these drinks since I discovered them many years ago... started with Red Bulls, but sometimes I just didn't want all that much to drink... so I found the 5-hour energy shots.  Used them almost daily until I couldn't afford them anymore... went to the "Rock On" shot from Walgreens because they were much cheaper and I could the 6-packs 2-for-1... Been using them for over a year and I just saw these so I bought a bunch... at $1 a piece, they are the cheapest and were basically the same as the rest...  They work just as well as the rest.<br /><br />Ingredients are all similar, some minor differences:  this has an "enzyme blend"...  this also has slightly more of the "energy blend" than others (the energy blend is a combination of Taurine, Malic Acid, Caffeine, among other things).  It has 0 calories, some other products do have a few calories.  This also has a bit of Niacin which can give some a slight tingly feeling in their skin for a few minutes... I've taken Niacin before and gotten that tingly feeling, but don't get that with this drink.  This also has a small bit of Sodium.<br /><br />The taste is the same as all the other energy drinks.  They all have a slight aftertaste.  I actually like Grape and Berry the best.  The Orange has always been my worst flavor in all the drinks.  Again, they are all similar.  There is no real difference in taste or in aftertaste.<br /><br />The effect of all these drinks is profound.  Not in a bad way, they make me much more productive at work.  I sit behind a desk most of the day and 1 of these in the morning keeps me alert and more focused throughout the day.  When not at work, I will usually be very lazy around the house, but take one of these, and I'm cleaning the attic in a few minutes, and planning my next activity while doing that!  I don't notice any crash, none at all.  Just don't take it too late in the day.  Anything after 5:00 or so and I won't sleep until well into the morning.  :-)<br /><br />I'm glad these are around.  My wife used to take B12 shots for energy back in the day.  She'd get it from a registered nurse in a gym... until people would walk in on them and think they were doing steroids.  :-(  So a shot of this is much more acceptable in public.  :-)<br /><br />Enjoy!

I made the mistake of trying it at 5pm and didn't get to sleep until around 1:30 (Yeah, I'm an idiot. Didn't really think that through). A fantastic side effect: It kills your appetite. I don't get any of my usual food cravings when I use it. Yay!

I'm not a coffee drinker so these energy drinks are my only saving grace.  Having had the others out there, I loved the increased alertness I had after drinking Energy 2000 and it seems to last for over six hours.  It makes sense since according to the label it has 25% more "energy" than it's counterpart energy shot.  So it lasts longer AND it costs less?  Count me in!

review/text: bought this 5 hour energy knockoff at local grocery shop. I couldn't have more than 3 sips of the orange flavor, had to dilute with mountain dew, but even then it was bad. Few days later, I tried this grape flavor to help me with an all-nighter. I had one sip and I almost threw up. I'm not lying! This is a horrible drink and should not be consumed. I never created a review, and i shop a lot here, but this one of those times that you strongly feel about something (either real good, or real bad) Do yourself a favor, buy just one can to try for yourself. Obviously the previous review is by the manufacturer.

review/summary: My dogs love the Greenies, and I like Amazon's price...
review/text: I am an enabler.  My two dogs have an insatiable addiction to Greenies.  Every night around 8:45 p.m., they start whining, barking, and circling me... and they don't stop until they each get a Greenie for the day.  If you're a consistent buyer of Greenies like me, you know that it can get very expensive-- at the local chain pet store I can expect to pay $17.99 per bag of Greenies (12 oz., 43 teenie pieces).<br /><br />Which leads me to review Amazon's performance in delivering these doggie treats at a reasonable price; currently it's $15.99 per bag and if you buy 3 bag you get one for free.  In addition to this, there's free shipping which saves me time and a needless trip down to the pet store.  If you buy 4 bags, you're getting it for about $12 per bag, which is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />In terms of the snacks themselves, the senior version of these Teenie Greenies are great-- they taste just as great as the original (based on my dogs' ability to consume it in under 3 minutes) but they have a softer consistency.  One of my dogs is nearly 18 years old, while the other is 9 years old... so dental care and not stressing out their teeth is really important to me.<br /><br />As long as Amazon maintains this deal, I'll continue to purchase the item directly from them.

Senior Greenies saved the day!  He loves the taste.  I cut them into tiny slices so one treat lasts longer.  Keeping an older dog's teeth clean can be a challenge, especially if they aren't able to eat really crunchy food or gnaw on rawhides or bones.  Senior Greenies can help!

review/summary: Bieglow Cinnamon Stick Tea
review/text: This tea is heaven in a cup! It's like drinking a warm, liquid cinnamon bun. When my local grocery stores (all of them!) stopped selling this variety of Bigelow tea about four years ago, I searched high and low for a replacement, to no avail. You can't just add cinnamon to regular black tea. Herbal cinnamon teas do not taste the same. Nothing else can compare to Bigelow's cinnamon stick tea. Then I found the tea online through Amazon, and I ordered three cases of six 20-count boxes. That's 360 bags of tea, enough for half a year if I ration myself to two cups a day, which is hard to do. You get the picture ... I'm crazy about this tea. Try it, you'll be glad you did.

review/text: I was very glad to finally find a way to recieve my favorite tea.  I am unable to purchase Cinnamon Stick Tea in the Nashville and surrounding areas...and drank it on a daily basis when we lived in Texas. So when I searched and found you had it, I was thrilled.  The price is very fair.  I bought 6 boxes and the price total for each box and shipping were close to the grocery price I had been paying.  Another, YEAH!!  I will order again and again.  It took less than 48 hours to arrive once my order had been placed.  This was way above your 5 star rating!!!

review/summary: My Favorite Flavored Tea
review/text: I drink this Bigalow Cinnamon Stick Tea more than any other flavor and brand.  It is probably 4 out of every 5 tea bags that I use.  I have been a tea drinker for many years, and this is, by far, my favorite.  Very few of the major brands offer a cinnamon flavored tea in tea bags.  Whenever I have found them, I have tried them.  None are equal to Bigalow Cinnamon Stick.<br /><br />  These tea bags do not overwhelm you with a spicy flavor, as some others do.  The cinnamon is subtle, and adds to the smoothness of the quality black tea that is the basis of this brand.  I usually drink this tea hot and black.  But in the summer I add ice and sugar for a very refreshing and different iced tea.<br /><br />  Thank you Amazon for offering this hard to find tea in a six pack of boxes, at a discount price.

review/text: Ok, I'm very biased.  I love this tea.  I've been drinking it since high school or even earlier for over [mumble, mumble] twenty years.  When the stores in my area stopped carrying it, I went to Amazon.  Great price -- and I can get six boxes at a time.  Great for the tea addict.<br /><br />No, it's not as trendy as some of the other teas out there, but it's smooth and not acidic.  It has a nice cinnamon flavor -- not overpoweringly so either.  It's not sweet like many of the orange and cinnamon teas I've tried but couldn't choke down.  A very smooth, palatable tea.

review/summary: Worst Cinnamon Tea I have ever had
review/text: I am not sure if I received a bad batch, if every other reviewer is either trying to punish everyone else for their bad decision to buy the product or if the other reviewers are paid to lie about it but this tea is awful.  I purchased this because I really enjoy cinnamon tea, all of the reviews raved about this product and its great cinnamon taste so I took their advice and purchased 6 boxes.  I received the tea yesterday (good ol' Amazon), quickly made myself a cup only to find out it has zero, nodda, zilch cinnamon taste.  I mean they mine as well just label this black tea and call it a day, there is not even a hint of cinnamon flavor or any flavor for that matter in the tea aside from black tea.  While I do enjoy flavored tea, I am not a fan of plain tea and I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this product.  If you are looking for plain black tea go ahead and give this a shot you will be happy with what you get, but if you want cinnamon tea don't waste your money or time on this.  AWFUL!!!

review/text: I found these years ago at a small buck shop as a kid, and I don't think I've ever seen them anywhere else. I've moved since, and it's probably been about three years since I've had them last, but I remembered how much I loved them and wished I could find them again. And now I have, which is why Amazon is the best! These are packaged exactly the way I remember, same box, same wrappers. I got it in two days with Prime and the package was perfect, no nicks or tears.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I find these to be a bit sweeter than I remember. It could just be me, but I was sure I'd recognize the flavor accurately. Though that's a little disappointing, they still taste really good and smell as awesome as ever. My fiance (who had never tried them before) now loves them too.

review/summary: The Mainstay of My Day
review/text: Every day, whatever the season, I have to have my pot of Plantation Mint tea.  Finding it had become a problem, though.  The one store that sells it for $2.19 a box seldom has it on the shelf, and the other store that carries it regularly sells it for $2.99 a box!  Living in a rural area (a national forest, actually) a long ways from the nearest large town that has more than the two groceries in the closest small town, I've had to depend on just these two stores, getting frustrated with either not finding the tea or paying an exorbitant price.  BUT, now that I've found it here and can have it delivered at regular intervals, no shipping charges, and at a savings over the store prices, I'm ecstatic.  No more running from store to store and hoping, no more getting strange looks when I stand in the coffee/tea aisle and cuss because the shelf is empty, no more wondering what I'm going to drink to feel good when the Bigelow box is empty.  My favorite tea now comes right to my mailbox, reasonably priced and automatically...like magic!  Life is good!

review/summary: Favorite Mint/Black Tea Combination
review/text: I do not have much experience with Bigelow outside of their Earl Grey (of which I generally choose Twinings), but I do love their Plantation Mint. I general keep at least half a box of it around at all times, because it is a wonderfully flavored tea that my friends enjoy and it is something they will drink no matter what particular blend I might be brewing for myself.<br /><br />With a little bit of honey, it makes a nice medium bodied tea for a cold night whose mint helps to open the sinuses and the soothe the throat. Cooled with ice in a tea glass, it is an extra refreshing drink that fits right in on a summer day. It is this versatality that demonstrates how well this blend is balanced. It tends to stay away from bitterness even on over steeping, so it is easier to adjust to a strength you like without having to resort to milk to round the edges.<br /><br />And, to better justify buying it the "Amazon six-pack", it has a good long shelf life and it keeps its flavor strong for a couple of years.

review/summary: Less a tea, more a remedy
review/text: Bigelow's Plantation Mint isn't just a tea. The moment you toss the bag in water and start to smell that intense aroma of fresh mint, you'll realize you've gotten not only a tea but an aromatherapy kit that'll have your whole house asking for their own cup.<br /><br />The tea itself is wonderful. You might not expect tea and mint to go this together, but they really do. The overall flavor that you get is a wonderful mouthful of mint flavor with just enough bitter tea to make it go down smooth. It really is a fantastic experience.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a downside, I'd say that the flavor is just a touch too syrupy. Anyone who's actually used fresh mint before will likely recognize this tea for what it is- an (excellent) mint syrup drizzled (deliciously) into a cup of tea. Basically, this is a really good approximation of mint infused tea, about as good as you could possibly expect from a bagged tea. For a product this wonderful you can't help but wonder what it would be like to have real leaves and brew them yourself. However, that's the trade-off you make for just being able to toss a bag in water and get your tea quickly. And having a tin of fresh leaves in this mix, you'd probably use it for the smell long before you considered drinking it anyway.<br /><br />In the end, this has instantly become my very favorite comfort tea. Especially if you're feeling a little under the weather, the smell solves a stuffy nose in no time. Definitely get a box and try this- maybe two boxes if you have other tea drinkers in the family, since they'll likely steal the first box for themselves.

I find this to be problematic when I bought the tea specifically for this purpose.  I confess, it could be that this tea just does not like cold brewing, but that would make it unlike every other tea I have ever bought.<br /><br />If you wish to enjoy the tea as a cold brew, look elsewhere.

review/text: I love mint tea, it always soothes an aching or upset tummy and tastes refreshing. This is the best brand of those I've tried (Lipton, Stash...) and so it's worth the price to me though I certainly wish it were lower. :)

review/text: This tea had been my favorite for years -- something about it is so much better than your run-of-the-mill mint tea.  I haven't been able to find it at the grocery stores in the area for the last few years and then a lightbulb went on!  I checked Amazon, and of course, there it was.  Great price too.

review/summary: Refreshing & tasty!
review/text: On my regime of eating better and working out, I have cut out all soda and high sugar juices and replacing with iced tea. I bought several boxes of Bigelow tea at my local store in various flavors, and this being one of them. I made iced tea one day using this Plantation Mint flavor. Before I even tasted it I could tell it was a love affair about to begin, just from the aroma. YUM! After I made the tea and tasted it, WOW. It's so refreshing and tastes so good. A lovely mint flavor that's not overwhelming but just right. It's also a great remedy for an upset stomach and/or a cold, as it soothes, settles your stomach and makes you feel so much better. This is my all time favorite tea from Bigelow, with Constant Comment being my 2nd! Try it you'll love it!

review/summary: Cool Mellow SPEARMINT Black Tea +++
review/text: "Plantation Mint" recreates old traditional Southern USA fine, mellow, balanced black tea with cool spearmint to invigorate, refresh and soothe at any time. Good icy or hot. Good with or without cream or honey. With natural spearmint leaf added to good black tea leaf. With richly balanced tea and mint in individual sealed steeping bags. Healthful antioxidants from both the black tea and spearmint. Soothes even someones belly as well as attitude due to MELLOW spearmint known to do so -- such as versus ache, nausea, heartburn and indigestion. Not somewhat harsh like peppermint yet not somewhat bland like green tea. BALANCED indeed. Great virtue at a small price for this pack of six 20-count boxes. Bigelow and Amazon, thank you ever so kindly +++

review/summary: It's always tea time!
review/text: As in the words of Charles Dickens..."My dear, if you could give me a cup of tea to clear my muddle of a head I should better understand your affairs." I take that to heart!<br /><br />Okay, this tea is a mix of black tea(contains caffeine) and spearmint. As many of you already know, drinking spearmint tea has many health benefits. Personally, I prefer spearmint tea over any other herbal tea and I drink this Bigelow one during the morning and afternoon time. I drink another spearmint tea brand(caffeine-free) at night before bed.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent. The individual tea bags are wrapped up in an individual packet(envelope) of their own..unlike some other brands that have all the tea bags in one big packet. The packets are great for women to carry in their purses or men to carry in their pockets, making it convenient for a person to make a cup of tea elsewhere(e.g. the office)

review/summary: Spearmint Green Leaves Candy
review/text: Remember those spearmint green leaf candies?  That's the smell that hit me when I opened the sealed individually wrapped envelope at the Hilltop restaurant in Ephrata, PA.  I saved the envelope so I wouldn't forget to write the review.  I can still smell the spearmint the next day.  If you like mint tea, this is a good one.  Bigelow is one of my favorite teas anyway. (Bigelow, Twinings, Stash, Tsao).  I have been a big-time tea drinker since I was a little one.<br /><br />There is a nice hefty taste of spearmint in this tea and it is a full bodied tea--most enjoyable.<br /><br />I like a variety of good quality teas and flavored teas.  I find them probably as enjoyable as many people find a special ale or a special wine.

review/summary: Plantation Mint is One of My Favorites
review/text: I love this Bigelow flavor!  Plantation Mint is a rich basic black tea with a fairly strong spearmint flavor.  One of my favorite moments with this tea is taking a nice deep whiff of the aroma from the tea bag right after opening the foil pouch, before I've placed the bag into the water.  It would be a bit too much for me to have this as my normal flavor for every cup (I drink two or three cups of tea a day), but Plantation Mint is one of several Bigelow flavors that I drink perhaps 3 times or so a week each.  Every time I decide to reach for the bright green Plantation Mint bag my mouth starts to water.  Wonderful stuff!<br /><br />If you're wondering how this compares with other Bigelow Mint flavors, I would say the "mintiness" is similar to that of the Bigelow Green Tea with Mint, or perhaps this Plantation Mint is just a wee bit mintier.  Both are good-- it just depends on whether you're in the mood for a cuppa black tea or green tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.

review/summary: Excellent Mint Tea
review/text: I've enjoyed the Bigelow Plantation Mint tea for years. I've tried other brands of mint, and I always come back to this one. It has a very pleasant, soothing mint flavor. It's the only hot tea I drink without adding sugar. It's hard to find locally, so I decided to check Amazon, and they had it by the pack of six boxes. Each tea bag is in a sealed pouch, so it lasts a long time. Plus, it was cheaper to buy this way than when I could find it by the single box in a store. If you like mint tea, you'll love this one.

review/summary: Excellent tea but should be more obvious that black tea (caffeine) is included!
review/text: I have no complaints about the quality of this tea it is very good. My only complaint is that I do think it is<br />completely misleading to call it plantation mint without stating somehow that black tea (and hence caffeine) is an ingredient.<br />I am always on the look out for something tea-like to drink that does not contain caffeine. I find decaffeinated teas/coffees to taste funny and like to drink something that has not been altered to be caffeine-free. When I see plantation mint I assume that this product is  made with only mint leaves until you read the fine print on the ingredients to find black tea is in it. This is the only thing that bothers me about this product which is otherwise quite nice.

review/summary: Good and good for you.
review/text: There was a commercial that advertised its product as "good and good for you".  Oatmeal Crisp fits that description. High cholesterol is one of my life ills and oatmeal is supposed to be a good tool against it, but I just can't imagine eating a bowl of cooked oatmeal everyday especially during the summer heat in Chicago.  Oatmeal Crisp on the other hand served with cold milk is a crunchy, sweet taste treat.  It holds up well in milk (soggy cereal makes me gag) and the almond slivers are a perfect touch.  Unfortunately, I have had difficulty finding this cereal on store shelves in my area, but Amazon has proven an adequate fix.  6 boxes at a time are a bit much, but I realize too much of a good thing is better than none at all and I place the additional boxes in the freezer.
