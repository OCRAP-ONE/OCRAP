If I knew it was so good and they'd stop marketing it large amounts I'd bought them out.

review/text: I expected the strawberries to be dried, but they were candied or jellied - too sweet, with not much of a strawberry flavor, but I'm sure it was real strawberry, it just didn't taste like it. I didn't care much for the chocolate either - kind of hard and granular. All in all very disappointed, especially for the price.

review/summary: Excellent claw crab meat
review/text: I make a crab dip recipe that was handed down to me by my mother-in-law.  It requires one can of claw crab meat.  The flavor is much less flavorful if you use any type of crabmeat other than claw crab meat.  What I like best about Miller's Select is that I almost never find shell or cartilage in the meat.  Every other brand I have used, I had to carefully feel and examine the entire can of crab and pick out cartilage and shells and I still missed some.  Also, other brands have a few intact claw meat pieces on top and bit and pieces of claw meat underneath ; I opened a can of Miller's Select (my last can from the case I ordered nearly a year ago) this week and the entire can consisted of intact claw crab meat.  In answer to "Very Good Flavor but...," in forty years of making Granny's Crab Dip, the canned claw crabmeat I have used has never been pink. Miller's Select Claw Crab Meat is an excellent product and since I used up the last can this week, I am ordering another case today.

review/summary: Very Good Flavor but...
review/text: I must say, this product has very good flavor although, unlike the picture above, there isn't a trace of pink/red in the entire can...well, two cans, as I've opened that many.  Maybe the color disappears in the cooking process inside the can.  At any rate, I was taken aback that the meat was rather flesh tone.  Good news is that there's plenty of claw meat in there.  If the meat had been pinkish, it would have made a nice decoration on a seafood plate but as it is, it's best to just be used for sandwiches or inside a casserole, etc.  Good flavor.  Great sandwich material here.

review/summary: Didn't last 6 minutes
review/text: I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

One warning: there are very few in a packet, and they are virtually impossible to separate into smaller bits, so you quickly get through the packet. But they are delicious. And they add that essential je-ne-sais-quoi to my desserts.

It tastes like a good smelling candle, and the added herbs and zest are perfect.  I have a sensitivity to oranges, and this blend actually has no orange flavor whatsoever---which is RARE.  It has:<br />chamomile<br />rose hips<br />hibiscus flowers<br />lemon peel<br />and natural mango flavor with other natural flavors<br />barley malt<br />If you like sweet and calm, this blend is perfection... which is why I'm buying a case of it.  I found it in a dinky little shop on the coast and can't find it anywhere else but here.

review/summary: Bittersweet Chocolate With A 60% Cacao Content!
review/text: I'm not much of a candy eater, but I enjoy a bit of chocolate now and then. When I eat chocolate, I've always preferred the somewhat dark and bitter types usually referred to as bittersweet chocolate, but they can be a bit hard to find. My wife is just the opposite. She prefers the much lighter milk chocolate and will use the bittersweet only for baking purposes. Well, one day she offered me a couple pieces of her baking chocolate, and man, was it good!<br /><br />Well. I was doing some shopping in my neighborhood Fresh and Easy Store and bittersweet baking chocolate was on the list. That's how I found the Ghirardelli Premium Chocolate Baking Bar. It wasn't in the candy section. It was in the baking goods section. It was labeled as bittersweet chocolate with a 60% Cacao content and it came in 4-ounce bars. Well, you just know I had to try some when I got home. Mmmm! Man, was it good! I'll take this stuff over the chocolates in the candy section any day. Evidently, most people don't feel that way. Their loss!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Then I found the simply mint and they are perfect.  They taste like mint with a bit of vanilla mixed in- rather like a white tic tac.  But they're stronger and last longer.

review/text: "I Love Lemon" is a good base for a lemon tea. It tastes very mild without the addition of lemon juice. I add a few tablespoons of lemon juice to make it a little more lemony. This does contain rose hips, lemongrass, lemon flavor, lemon peel and lemon verbena so it is an herbal tea. Why they put peppermint and hibiscus in this tea I don't know because you really can't taste it. So I'd only recommend this tea to someone who wants to make the extra effort of squeezing some fresh lemon juice into this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I love their lemon tea with honey and a lemon slice- surprisingly, it is delicious despite all the lemon influences. The tea seeps nicely and has a wonderful scent. I buy one almost everyday on campus. (: Bigelow, unlike Lipton, does not test on animals either- a huge deal in my book. The company is superb and all their teas are perfect. The cold weather has me purchasing tea more frequently so it is nice to have Bigelow here at school.

review/summary: Good Delivery of Product I Know
review/text: My cat really enjoys this Organix flavor, so I decided a bulk purchase from Amazon was most cost-effective.  Fortunately, there weren't any issues with delivery, so everything arrived in a very timely manner without damages.<br /><br />Before ordering, my question was, is this the same can food I have been purchasing through a pet store?  The featured pic has a label and formula description that is slightly different.  I called Organix for clarification.  This featured label (as of August 9, 2010) is the older can, but Organix said it's very unlikely that Amazon would be selling the older cans.  The pic has not been updated.  So, indeed, I received the new cans.  That almost deterred me from purchasing as there's no telling what a formula change to a favorite food can do to a cat's preference!  All is well.

review/summary: Cats love it !!
review/text: All of my cats absolutely LOVE this Castor & Pollux organiz turkey/seafood!!  Best part is that the Castor & Pollux foods have quality ingredients (although it is pricey).<br /><br />I found that slightly warming this product eased the transition for my cats.  After a few servings that way, they now eat it straight from the can.<br /><br />My cats give this food a Tail Up nod of approval to their fellow felines.

review/summary: Great product for anytime snacking
review/text: The first time I tried TMITR granola was at my local Starbucks.  I am far from an organic-only eater and nothing about me says 'vegan for life', but I do like to try to fuel my body with products that I can pronounce the ingredients.  When I saw the words goji berry and granola stamped on the package - I had to try it.  Yeah, so [...] later (nice price gouge, Starbucks) I fell in love.  This is NOT your typical overly sweet, crumbly granola.  It is a semi-chewy bar and it is mildy sweet.  All the sugar comes from the fruit and the agave nectar.  If you are looking for the 'Quaker-type' granola bar - then you will be sadly dissappointed.  If you are looking for a great energy boost, a 'wow-I-feel-good-about-myself-for-eating-this' post nosh feeling, and an overall good taste - this is it.<br /><br />I recommend ordering from either Amazon or the main website ([...]).  The bag costs [...] and has 4 blocks of the granola (at 2oz each).  One block at Starbucks is [...].  Either way is not cheap (you can buy an economy box of twinkies for [...]), but it is good for you.

review/text: I heard about these cakes from the Michael Portillo train journeys through England series.  I was surprised that I could order them through Amazon and am not disappointed.  Very good flavor of currants and mild sweetness and spice, wrapped by a nice flaky unobtrusive pastry.  There are four single portion cakes enclosed by a cellophane wrapper, and they are somehow preserved so they keep and taste good for about 3 months or so.

review/summary: Cha-Soba (perfect) Noodles
review/text: Following the cooking instructions on the package, the noodles cooked perfectly. The package also has the recipe for the dipping sauce.  I plan on buying several packages more. The price is a little bit high and the shipping is extremely high for a 7-ounce package (at the time of this writing the 7-ounce package of noodles cost $3.69 and the shipping was $5.25). I only hope that the shipper does not charge an individual shipping cost for each package. I will be e-mailing the seller this question before I place my next order. The cash involved is the only reason why I did not give these noodles a 5-star rating.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller. The shipping price goes up as the quantity increases. It was not stated by how much per package.

review/text: My husband and I are pretty busy people, and there's nothing I hate more than spending what little free time we have running to the pet store to get pet food. With Amazon Subscribe and Save, we are able to get this delivered right to our front door at the same (or lower) cost of running to the pet store or market.<br /><br />This particular formula seems to be fine for our 2 spoiled felines. We switch them back and forth between this, Chicken and rice, and Indoor formula and I haven't seen an increase or decrease in hairball activities. They seems to still have the occassional hairball, but I think that's pretty typical.<br />For the price I feel that this brand and formula provide a good diet and nutrients that our furbabies need.

review/text: The two star rating is not for the product.  I have not seen my new cat choke up a hairball using thia product, and he seems to like it, so as a product review, I would have given it 5 stars.  The two stars is for the instant price increase after I bought this product using Amazon's Subscribe And Save.  When I purchaed it, the subscription price was 8.97.  Right after I received the first package, the price jumped to 11.82.  The one time delivery price is 12.44.  That's an increase of 2.85!  Wal-Mart's price is 10.98.  Granted, adding tax makes the price almost, but not quite the same, but then you have to wait for delivery.  This is one of the very few time I've ever been disappointed in Amazon,

review/summary: Impressive yet not perfect
review/text: Moulins de la Brague Extra Virgin Oil has an impressive body & texture: It is very rich, fulfilling, and incredibly smooth. However, its rich and fulfilling characteristic is not heavy and dominating at all, which makes this olive oil quite distinct from most other brands with similar products. It is one of the smoothest extra virgin olive oil I have ever tasted, 'silky' would be perfect choice of word to describe such smooth texture. The tin bottle is very French and chic for that matter, if not the prettiest looking tin bottle around.<br /><br />Moulins de la Brague Extra Virgin Oil is made from ripe black olives (of different varieties and from different regions), as opposed to green olives, which is certainly rare and even odd in olive oil industry. This partially explains the expensive price, since the Mediterraneans & Aegeans treat ripe black olives as edible olives instead of pressing them to make oil. This tradition also determines the olive prices in the market due to demand and support equilibrium, keeping the prices of black olives higher than green olives. Olive oil made by black olives generally lacks the fruity flavors, however. This is the biggest downfall according to most olive oil consumers.<br /><br />I have experimented with this olive oil and quite interesting results came out of it: Moulins de la Brague Extra Virgin Oil has the quality of 'bringing out the flavor' of the ingredients in your dish, whereas the majority of olive oils simply add to it. For instance, I have marinated a few slices of smoked Atlantic salmon in this oil with some freshly grinded  black pepper and a much better tasting salmon dish came out of it! Although it has not added any aroma or flavor to my green salads, it simply made every single ingredient in the salad taste better, more vibrant.<br /><br />On the negative side, it does not have any significant aroma (nose) or much of flavor (palate). There is no finish or after-taste either. Thus, it is not the best olive oil for dipping your bread, unless you spice it up with some oregano, red chili pepper and garlic. It is too expensive to cook with, therefore I would not recommend  cooking or sauteing with it. If you like the flavorful Italian-Sicilian, Greek and Turkish oils with rich aroma, this is not your oil. I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009WSCQ8">Frantoia Extra Virgin Olive Oil</a> instead. You will also save big bucks.<br /><br />Another reason for not giving it 5 stars is that my order has arrived in damaged condition, the tin-bottle was bent, which mattered since it is also a decorative item.

review/text: My wife and I love to compare extra virgin olive oils. We put this one up against a very nice product from Italy. We dipped chunks of freshly baked ciabatta bread in each oil. The Italian variety was spicy but it lacked the satiny feel and richness of this French oil. This oil is the real deal.

review/text: There are all brands of olive oil on the market.....from all over the world. I have tried most all of them in my travels. The oil from "Huilerie D'Opio"...in Opio, France...is the BEST ever available.<br />I had the pleasure recently to actually visit the facillity in the town of Opio. This was part of a guided tour associated with Grand Circle Tours. The 17 oz. can is a bit expensive....considering the local price plus shipping to my home in Laguna Beach, California. There are several "flavors" available....mine is the "fruity" one. I am reminded of the saying " Life is too short to drink cheap wine"...the same goes for this olive oil. I use it whenever and wherever I can....and the price is NOT a consideration! When I visited the olive mill in Opio, I tasted the product and bought only one can because I was traveling and had limited space in my luggage.What a mistake....now I have to have it shipped (I get it on line from Amazon) at twice the local price! If you are a true "gourmand" , you MUST try this olive oil. The best of the best!

The product was as discribed and works OK. Just put your coffee in the filter and hit brew. I have read other reviews and agree with most, about coffee grounds causing issues. Be sure to clean any grounds off the rim when closing the filter, also if you use finely ground beans you may end up with some grounds in the cup. Overall this product is a coffee filter and it works as one.<br />Seller: I was not impressed with this seller. I have contacted the seller as requested by Amazon and after two weeks I have not heard anything. Anyway, I received the package containing: 2-Ekobrews and only 1-sample coffee (off-brand not Kirkland).
