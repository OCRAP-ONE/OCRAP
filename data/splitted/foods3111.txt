review/text: Very happy with these; keep them in the fridge to add to granola and yogurt.<br />Helps to get enough fruit in diet without having to worry about rotting and throwing away fruit, or being forced to eat it because it will waste.  Good practical diet option, and I like having more options.

review/summary: WOW! Awesome cranberries!!
review/text: These are the very best dried cranberries you ever tasted! I like to use them in muffins and cookies in place of raisins, add them to a bowl of cereal, or a salad, or eat them right out of the box. A small handful kills the sweet tooth! If you bake with them, mix them into the dry ingredients before you mix them into the batter. This keeps them well distributed in the batter, AND in the finished product. This box is an excellent value, and you'll have no truble using them up. However, if you're concerned, you can freeze them for years. Cranberries high acid content keep them fresh. (I don't thaw them for baking.) FYI: You can get the very best fresh Pecans at Sunnyland Farms dot com, or fresh English Walnuts and Almonds at california-almonds dot com. The prices and shipping are very reasonable, and bigger orders are discounted, PLUS get on their email list for notices of NEW CROPS each year!

review/text: Excellent taste, excellent price. These cranberries are fresh, plump and chewy with a burst of flavor--slightly tart, not too sweet. The best I've ever tasted. As other reviewers have said, they don't all clump together in a sugary mess. I'll be using in my cranberry pistachio biscotti for the holidays and we'll be snacking on the rest--I can't seem to keep my hand out of the bag.

review/summary: Simply the best!!
review/text: I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried cherries and cranberries. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />Dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites and I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years. None of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried cranberries then look no further.<br /><br />5 Stars!

review/text: Excellent product, packaging, shipping and value. These cranberries are the best I've ever tried. I use them in/for everything: cookies, breads, pancakes, on yogurt, on ice cream, in cottage cheese, omelets, in salads, as a snack, thrown in with a pork roast in the crock pot as well as baked with ham/pineapple, etc. Plump and satisfying, very few 'clumps' of several berries stuck together, but if you do find that they break apart very easily with a roll of the fingers. The flavor is wonderful and I keep coming back for more. I do keep them in the frig: they don't last long enough to freeze them! I sure wish I could get these on Subscribe and Save. I'd get them every month!

review/text: The blueberries and cherries I've ordered from this company were great.  This is my first box of cranberries, and I was very disappointed.  They're dry, stuck together, and sugary tasting.  Not near as good as what I've bought in a store.  Maybe a bad batch?<br /><br />UPDATE:  I contacted the supplier, and described the problem.  He said the box I received was from an overdried batch, and he sent me a new box.  The color was brighter and the taste was much better.  I'll definately reorder when this new box is gone.

I was really pleased to see that the flavor was just as good as the more popular and more expensive brand.  Since they are dried, they last a good long time.  I eat a handful at a time and it stops the hunger and is healty.

review/summary: Best Cranberries, Cherries, and Blueberries
review/text: This review covers Traverse Bay dried cranberries, cherries, and blueberries.<br /><br />My wife really enjoys dried cranberries for snacking and for putting in cereal and hot porridge (oatmeal and multi-grain mix).  She often asks me to do the ordering for her and I was curious to find out what she thought were the best of the cranberries we had gotten.  So I asked her to do a taste test on samples of 3 different brands.  Although I'm not a fan of dried cranberries for snacking (I prefer dried cherries), I do eat these too and find them quite enjoyable.  So I went ahead and did the taste test also.  Here's the results:<br /><br />The Wife:<br /><br />Mariani:  Too dry.<br /><br />Sun-Maid:  Too sweet.<br /><br />Traverse Bay:  Just right.<br /><br />Me:<br /><br />Mariani:  Most cranberry flavor.  A drier cranberry that is a bit chewier and has a rougher texture that would not be out of place in a home-made trail mix.<br /><br />Sun-Maid:  Also pleasant, but not so flavorful.  Softest and sweetest.<br /><br />Traverse Bay:  Good cranberry flavor.  Large, plump, moist, medium-soft, and sweet.  Very good for eating straight out of the bag and especially good for cereal and porridge.<br /><br />We've also tried Traverse Bay's dried cherries and like them as well.  The dried cherries are every bit as good as the dried cranberries.  The same drying process seems to be used across all three products: fruit, a little sugar, and some oil to keep them plump and to prevent them from drying out.  The cherries are flavorful and they manage to be tart and sweet while not being overly so.  Very nice.<br /><br />It is particularly hard to find good dried blueberries and Traverse Bay has succeeded there as well.  The dried blueberries are good for all the same uses as the cranberries and cherries.  I was particularly surprised that they are good for eating straight out of the bag.  Before I tried these, I never met a dried blueberry that I liked.  I thought at best they might be good for baking, but they are much better than that.<br /><br />After almost a year of trying a variety Traverse Bay's dried cranberries, cherries, and blueberries, we are very pleased with the consistently high quality.  We buy the 4 lb. bags every few months and that seems to be the perfect size for us.

review/summary: Too Sweet! also too oily
review/text: I have been buying and using dried cranberries every morning in my oatmeal.  These are way too sweet and too oily also.  When I cook them in the water for my oatmeal, there is a lot of little seeds.  When I eat the Oatmeal it is very sweet.  I never add sugar to my cereals as a little dry or fresh fruit is sufficiently sweet.  I rinsed a large amount of these today and am hoping that after drying in my oven for they will be usable.<br /><br />I can not recommend these cranberries!!<br /> If I could give no stars I would.

Plus, I didn't think to check if they were organic, which is a must for me and fruit. However, it's a large amount and goes a long way for the price. Next time I'd order unsweetened organic tart cherries (for inflammation) from another source.

I wouldn't eat them alone, as they are very sweet.  They'd go well with almonds, too, in a fruit/nut mix.  Like other reviewers, mine came in great condition.  I may try the dried cherries next!

review/text: I had been reading the other reviews on these cherries and was deciding whether to purchase four pounds when my brother bought me a small bag of this brand.  They are the best dried cherries I've ever had.  The fruit is moist and chewy and absolutely sweet with a hint of tart in each bite.  I plan on using them in a home-made trail mix, cookies...but mainly to eat as an easy go to treat during the day.

review/summary: The BEST dried cranberries ....
review/text: These are the BEST dried cranberries out there.  They're plump, tender, super high flavor -- and NOT TOO SWEET!  My biggest complaint with many of the supermarket popular brands is the high amount of added sugar.  I want cranberries to taste TART -- Hello!?!?  That's what makes a cranberry a cranberry.  Adding tons of sugar just dilutes the wonderful flavor.<br /><br />These are just about perfect.  I'm single, so I "repackage" the four pounds into 8 oz packages, and toss most of them into the freezer.  I use them several times a week: on my breakfast cereal (I love them on Frosted Mini-Wheats), in rice pilaf (with slivered almonds), chopped and mixed into cream cheese with some chopped walnuts, in homemade apple pie -- and of course right out of the package as a snack.<br /><br />As long as I can find these, I'll keep buying them.  And I'm definitely trying more of Traverse Bay's products.  If they're as good as these, it will be money well spent.

review/summary: Berry Disappointed.
review/text: Within this order there are three heat sensitive items. The cranberries were destroyed, the deodorant was melted, and I have yet to open the toothpaste. This is a result of being left in the mailbox in the triple digit heat of Texas at the height of summer by the USPS. I have filed complaints of this nature regarding damaged packages, stolen packages, and even returned packages which eventually I came to discover were lost in transit all at the hands of the USPS. Amazon has continued to conduct business with a courier who does not provide the same level of service to the customer which Amazon has a reputation for living up to. That reputation is quickly changing. By continuing in this manner Amazon is treading a slippery slope.<br />The cranberries themselves are very lacking in flavor, which is not the usual quality I would use to describe this product. This is a result of being left outside in the mailbox rather than the product itself. Usually, these are the best cranberries I have ever had aside from fresh. They usually arrive at my door handed to me by my regular UPS courier. However, this time they were shipped by the USPS, and strangely came in a clear cheap cellophane package rather than the usual soft plastic blue package. They came from the same retailer in the same box as usual. However, I'm just very disappointed with the manner of disregard with which the shipping was handled.

review/summary: Best (and probably most expensive) carrot cake mix on market
review/text: This product is special as it comes with (I am guessing) freeze dried carrots in a packet and a small packet of raisins.  You put the carrots in warm water and let them sit for 5 minutes while you prepare the mix.  The mix also comes with a small packet of raisins (which I augment with additional raisins and some dried cranberries and put them in hot water also with a touch of imitiation rum) which you stir into the mix.  The cake (assuming you follow the directions carefully and do not deviate much from them) comes out fairly light (not superlight as the raisins make it a little heavier) and very delicious in my opinion.  Yes, I can make as good if not better cake by scratch, but this is an easy one to make and it tastes really good.  A nice cream cheese frosting completes the process. Bon Appetite!

review/text: What a great find !!  This is a very delicious healthy all natural juice.  Other pomegranate juices I have tried in the past have a sort of twang, or bitterness but this is smooth and very good.

review/summary: Pomegranate Delicious Juice
review/text: I was hesitant!  Thought too healthy won't taste good....boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Very delicious and tasteful.  I drank it chilled on ice with my lunch.<br /><br />The flavors are not too strong, just right.  I love pomegranate juice anyway so this was a real pleasure.<br /><br />Very fruity tasting.

review/summary: Great Healthy Juice
review/text: The taste and consistency of this juice is post on.  It wasn't too thick at all and there was absolutely no aftertaste. The flavor was really smooth and I felt an instant energy kick after I drank it. I love the natural ingredients and am confident that I am putting nothing but healthy things in my body when I drink this juice.  It is a great size if you have a few people in your household sharing it, but not as convenient for one person to take on the go.

review/summary: The taste is OK, but it is too light of a snack
review/text: What can I say? I was not impressed. 100-calorie packs are always a bit of a balancing act. 100-calories worth of something rich and delicious would pretty small. To make 100-calorie mini-cupcakes, they made them extremely light. They melt in your mouth, literally, leaving you feeling like you did eat anything.<br /><br />The taste is OK, but it really is too light of a snack.<br /><br />(Review of Hostess 100-Calorie Packs - Chocolate Cake with Creamy Filling)

review/summary: Delicious, rich and not exploitative!
review/text: I was searching for a great hot chocolate mix to replace my beloved Ghiradelli mix. I had recently learned that most American chocolate companies are still buying cocoa from slavers.  (Forbes Magazine ran a recent article about it.)  I couldn't find a good fair trade cocoa in town, but Omanhene was on amazon. I ordered it and loved it! It is not as sweet as i am used to. I use three tablespoons to make a cup.  But it is delicious, and as far as i can ascertain, the farmers involved don't enslave children.

review/summary: Worth Finding
review/text: Omanhene is the best cocoa (also bars, baking chocolate, etc.) one can find - if one can find it.<br /><br />Entirely produced in Ghana - from beans - not manufactured from previously processed components in Europe.  I understand that hard-core chocolate snobs pinpoint this speck of West Africa as the mecca for the best on earth.  One can taste that.<br /><br />The trouble is getting your hands on some.  I'd rather deal with my grocer than Amazon.  Addictive.

review/summary: said to be produced without slavery; helpful product, no fructose corn-syrup' and  tastes great
review/text: Lucky to find this "true and authentic hot cocoa mix". I was looking for cocoa mixes without corn syrup or dry milk.  Think I've found it in this product.<br />The Omanhene organization has a website under that name, and the package label says the company works out of the state of Wisconsin.<br />The label has lots of very interesting facts, such as:<br /><br />A) "In a unique process, our beans are fermented between banana leaves and dried in the warm African sun.  Then we roast, grind and press the beans to extract the finest natural cocoa powder available anywhere....."<br />B). "Omanhene" (OH -mahn-HEE-nee) comes from the Twi language and is the title for the traditional king or chief, the repository of ethical and moral authority in Ghana."<br /><br />We've tried this at our house both with milk and with water, and thought it very good tasting, sugar not overpowering.<br />Our order was a pack of four, 12  ounces each, nice seal under the plastic lid.<br />Some nutrition facts are:  14 servings of 2 tbsp each per 12 ounce-container...<br />Which works out to: 80 calories per serving,<br /> 5 calories fat, zero transfat, zero saturated fat, and 0.5 gram of fat<br />Zero cholesterol;<br /> 5 mg sodium. (Low)<br />20 grams carb<br /> 2 grams fiber<br />16 grams sugar<br /> 1 gram protein<br />Mixing directions are on the label.  Again, lucky to have this alternative to corn syrup, dry milk, and standard cocoa mixes.  Recommended, and hope you like this, too.

review/summary: Just okay...not exactly what I hoped for
review/text: I have been on a quest to find a really good hot cocoa mix. After sifting through many types and reviews I decided to try this one. Sadly, this mix is kind of blah...it is not bad but not anything better than what I buy at the supermarket. I like cocoa that is rich, mildly sweet with a hint of saltiness. I did not find this mix rich at all (yes, I followed the directions) and did not detect any salt, it was mildly sweet--maybe minimally would be more accurate. Perhaps, after trying it a couple more times the taste will grow on me? I will say it does have a uniqueness about it. All and all, I have to say that I would not suggest this product.

Feels like next day or two day delivery most of the time. Packed nicely and always arrives safe. Taste great, organic & raw. I use them in many recipes from green beans to grinding them up in vegan meals as thickener. One of these days I'll get into roasting some with my own seasonings! Highly recommend, worth the price.

review/summary: MY  FAVORITE  CRACKER
review/text: [...] These crackers are far superior to the other brand of big round crackers! No trans-fats! The Milton crackers come out of the package crisp and have a sweet nutty overtone that blends well with many different toppings. My family particularly likes them paired with gourmet cheeses or kipper snacks. The black sesame seeds give these crackers a distinctive appearance. The black and regular sesame seeds and poppy seeds are whole and may be a concern to those sensitive to seeds in their diets.  For readers with allergies, please note these crackers contain wheat, soy, corn and sesame seeds. There are 130 mg of sodium and 70 calories in two crackers. While these won't replace crushed up saltines in my tomato soup, they are my first choice for about every other occasion.

review/text: I was very upset to learn that the only supplier of this product I am aware of in my area no longer carries this product and has substituted a generic product of their own creation. It does not measure up to your product in taste, quality or content.<br />Their cracker is dry, hard, bland and the roasted black seeds are as hard as non popped popcorn kernels. I very much like this cracker with or without toppings. I was very relieved to be able to go on line and discover that I could order them online. Lenora Crenshaw, Riverside, CA

review/text: I bought my mom this tea and I think she's addicted to it. She's real picky about teas, seeing as she'll blow cash on high-end jasmine and oolong teas. I wasn't sure if she'd like this at first so I bought a smaller amount. But she said this particular tea is very fragrant and has a great taste. Green tea is probably one of the best teas: chocked full of antioxidants and benefits if you drink it without cream and excessive sugar. Enjoy.

The size of the pods is pretty decent most of them are between 7-8 inches and I got 112 pods in my bag. I separated them in groups of 5, vacuum seal them and storage them in a dark and dry place, they keep fresh as the first day in that way.<br />After you used the seeds for a pastry cream or any other preparation you can wash the pods and let them dry on top of your refri when they are dry you can pulverize them and use it to flavor sponge cakes or genoise.
