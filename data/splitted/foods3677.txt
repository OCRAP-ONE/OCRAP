review/summary: Look No Further!! Healthy and Delicious.
review/text: Ask an Italian American about pasta... Say no more, look no further. I love the alternative for healthier eating and this is it, we just do not like wheat pasta, too pasty, no resemblance to the pasta I was raised on, so... Buy it, cook according to directions and add most veggies the last 4 minutes to your pasta water while cooking your pasta, drain and either use a tomato sauce or oil and garlic sauce, or a chicken or veggie broth seasoned with sauteed garlic/shallots and herbs as well (healthier version.) Oh, so easy but so elegant. Can add shrimp or broccoli/asparagus, again add to the water or to the broth saute pan, mix and serve. God Bless your efforts!

review/text: This is probably my favorite gluten-free pasta so far.  If I'd known about it before I was diagnosed with celiac, I would have tried it and liked it then too.  Plus, the nutrition on this is excellent--it's high in protein and fiber, and has a much better texture and flavor than whole wheat pasta, so I recommend this to all my health-conscious friends who aren't gluten-free as well.

review/summary: all right by me---with one or two minor drawbacks
review/text: Progresso makes an excellent New England clam chowder in a 19 ounce can. The soup is hearty and makes you feel nice and warm; and this is important since the fall is here and winter shall soon be upon us! This is the best New England clam chowder I've ever had from my grocer's shelf!<br /><br />The can is easy enough to open with its pull off lid; just cook it in a pot and you're ready to serve! Put any leftovers in the refrigerator for the next time; you can also cook this in a microwave using the easy instructions right on the can.<br /><br />There is fat in this soup, so please ignore Amazon's error above that this is 99% fat free. Fortunately, there are no trans fats--great! It is low in cholesterol but pretty high in sodium. The can has two servings; and each serving has a whopping 35% of your daily allowance of sodium. If you are on a low salt diet I would encourage you to find another brand of clam chowder.<br /><br />The soup tastes great on its own; I sometimes add some pepper on top after it's in the bowl cooling down just a minute before I dig in!<br /><br />Use this soup by the expiration date stamped on the bottom end of the can; and ask your doctor if this soup would cause a problem for you if you have trouble handling clam, milk, soy or tuna. These ingredients are in the soup. In addition, because this soup has fat and sodium I will take off one star for that; this will be a four star review.<br /><br />Overall, this is one mighty fine New England clam chowder; and I recommend it highly now that cooler weather is just around the corner. Get some today and enjoy!

review/summary: NO WAY; way too thin to be useful in the kitchen. Lunches, maybe.
review/text: Simply put, this is too thin to use in the kitchen for wrapping pans or roasting. Try getting a cookie of this with a plastic spatula and all you get is torn aluminum and a mangled cookie.<br /><br />I get it: recycled is good, I love recycled things; I really do. But, I also like things to work right so that I don't have to double up the recycled foil just to get to to work. That defeats the purpose and is more wasteful.<br /><br />If you were to wrap a sandwich in this, or maybe use it for light duty, fine, it will work. But not for cooking purposes.  Maybe lining the bottom pan of the toaster or other places where things don;t have to come into contact with it, that might work.<br /><br />I like the idea, but it is just too thin and not a perfect replacement for heavy-duty foil.

The 'sugar free sweetner' after taste is very very low.  It is our favorite of all the EDIET Mousse products. The texture is also the best of all the desserts we have tried from EDIETS.  It is smooth but has more body than some of the other items.  It is the closest to a 'real' mousse. If you like chocolate and coffee together give it a try.

review/summary: LOVE this Mousse!!!
review/text: I love this mousse and have been using it for years.  I am a person that can't leave well enough alone when it comes to directions or recipes. For instance I feel that if you make this according to their directions you get sort of a pudding consistency rather than mousse. I use about half of the milk, making it very thick, then I FOLD in some Cool Whip OR stiffly whipped whipping cream.  You get the sugar with the Cool Whip, but not much.  With the whipping cream you get the fat but no sugar and no carbs. I sweeten it lightly with some Splenda.  Now if you really want to add some luciousness, cut the milk by about a 1/4 C. and add 1/4 C. Coffee Liqueur when you are mixing it all up.  You can adjust to your own taste, but remember it is liquid, so subtract the milk for how much liqueur you add. Beat like crazy! Then FOLD in the cream. Once the mouse is done to your favored consistency, set aside. Take some Nabisco or any other chocolate wafers and into an 8X10 or 8X8 baking dish add one layer of the wafers and then scoop some of the mousse on top of that and smooth. Repeat until you end with at the top with mousse. Cover and refig for several hours (6-or how ever many you can stand, longeer the better) and then cut into pieces. Oh Man is this good!

review/text: The coffee: (Douwe Egberts Aroma Road Whole Bean Coffee,) was disappointing....taste was not better than  commercial coffees available in ordinary grocery stores. We were looking for strong coffee flavor and this coffee did not have it.

review/summary: real coffee
review/text: So glad to have found the Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood Coffee. First, I am a coffee addict, not just any coffee.  A good<br />aromatic, not bitter, delicious coffee. This one is so far the best I've found lately.  I spent over 40 years<br />working, managing and owning reataurants. The good old days had Continental Coffe, Weshlers, and one or two more, but, just like eveything else they were bought out and replaced with sub- standard products. The new kids on the block like Starbucks, and now even Dunkin Donuts, started out vey good but the quality has decreased as sales<br />increase.  The beans look old and dry upon opening the bags.  I must try the other varieties by Douwe .

review/summary: 3.5 Stars
review/text: I have been brewing my own coffee plus grinding the beans for almost a year and a half and I still have not discovered the ultimate coffee bean. I understand now that many aspects control the final results of brewing a cup of coffee. Temperature, water, quality of beans being at the top. This one is a little above average but nothing out of this world, sort of speak. I have been attempting to mix different varieties of beans and see if one of these days I discover the ultimate blend for the best cup of coffee. I do not pretend to be an expert but do enjoy a good cup of coffee, not too bitter not too watery, with the right amount of cream and sugar most of the times, but I do appreciate the taste of black coffee once in a very long while.  Putting creamer (in liquid or powder form), sugar seems to detract from the raw flavor of coffee. One gets used to loading the coffee with the extras and perhaps one day soon I will be able to enjoy a good quality cup of coffee plain black, no disguise of the taste. 3.5 Stars.

review/summary: Way Too Salty
review/text: This sauce would be wonderful, but for our family it's way too salty.  I made a wonderful shrimp and vegetable dish and added the Iron Chef Sesame Garlic sauce to it and served it on top of rice.  I wound up throwing all my rice out to get rid of the sauce.  It was so salty I couldn't stand the taste.  My husband felt the same.  This seems to be a major problem with store bought sauces.  I'm not sure why they don't leave the salt out altogether or put just a small amount in the sauce.  Salt is inexpensive and so easy to add when desired.  However, it's impossible to remove it.  I tried to contact "Iron Chef" but there isn't any contact information on their website. If you like salty sauce, this may be for you.  Otherwise, either look for something else or make your own.

review/summary: Quality? Maybe. Taste? Not so good
review/text: I have tried some pu erh tea that I enjoyed for the unique taste, however this matcha is either bad quality or I would just not recommend this item. I have had red tea matcha and green tea matcha and this does not even come close in taste or the texture whisked in. I would reccomend not getting this type of matcha at all, that's not to say I don't like this tea, I love it, that's why I ordered the medium size one. If I had to rate this tea from one to ten, this would be in the three to four range.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical forking out so much money for this type of tea since I was well aware of the quality it could be and as well as 'fake' or lower grades being sold for good quality matcha. I downright would prefer the lose leaf tea over this.

review/text: The mango is edible once you get past the rubbery dry texture, but the apple and others are just awful! The apple was not only chewy in a bad way, and I like apple rings, but extremely tart- maybe it is because I am used to mrs mays freeze dried fruits but I will not order this set again... No idea what I will do with the rest of the packages...rubbery fruit that cannot be bitten is just the wrong texture for me maybe- very dry too!

review/summary: Quick, very filling with some additions, mild flavor, yummy
review/text: I've bought this item lots of times at my local grocery store so was happy to see it here on amazon and at a better price! The package includes the noodles, sauce mix, and a tiny packet of sesame seeds. I usually add about 6-8 oz. very thinly-sliced chicken or beef (top sirloin works very well), a couple of cups of defrosted-in-the-microwave frozen veggies, and extra sesame seeds sprinkled on top since the included packet is VERY small. It's very quick and easy to make even with the additions, and pretty healthy too. Yes, it's high in sodium as one reviewer pointed out [this was from 2008 -- SEE NOTE BELOW], but then most prepared foods are. With the added chicken and veggies, the 3 listed servings become 4 or 5. Note that the sauce is quite mild - if you like spicier foods, you'll probably need to add some sort of hot sauce to it.  Like the Simply Asia roasted peanut mix, this is overall very easy to make and delicious too!<br /><br />Also, I don't know where the other [current] reviewer shops, but amazon's regular price is slightly cheaper than my local grocery store's, and the subscribe-and-save price is about 20% less.<br /><br />NOTE, the first paragraph above is from my review of this item from January 2008 ... I think amazon stopped carrying it for awhile as my old review now says "this item is currently unavailable," but here it is again (maybe the code changed for some reason, but it's definitely the same product).

review/summary: Great cat treat that is also good for them
review/text: When a locale store started carrying Wellness products, this was one of them. I purchased a bag and my cats loved it. I went back to the store to buy more and guess what; they were sold out. This was almost a year ago!!! They still have not restocked this product because "their corporate computers do all the ordering for them" and not an actual human that knows what sells and what doesn't. Needless to say, this store is a chain pet supply store and well, they have since lost a lot of local business (from me alone) as I have found that I can purchase the same product for much less via Amazon and also get it in as little as a few days.

review/summary: Great,Healthy Cat Treats
review/text: Although a little pricey, these are a great way to give your cat a healthy treat. My cat has a sensitive stomach and cant always eat the treats I have gotten for him without him throwing up. I stopped using grocery store treats and moved to Natural Balance but they were too much for his tummy, but these treats he absolutley loves and he never gets sick afterwards. Also, with the all natural ingredients I feel good about rewarding him.<br />(p.s. since they are natural ingredients they are stinky like salmon.)

review/summary: Not meant for my cat's whiskers
review/text: I really wanted my 2 yr old cat to like these treats because I already feed her Wellness wet food, which is excellent by itself. Perhaps she's too used to the Whiskas Temptations that I normally give her, but she did not like the jerky bits at all. I did notice it was hard for her to pick up because they're pretty flat, and the texture is chewier than what she's used to. The 3rd time I gave her the treats, she vomited it out. Looks like it's back to the less healthy alternative.

review/summary: vet recommended and we agree, natural is the best....
review/text: We recently adopted a shelter kitten and our vet recommended several natural food brands that she felt were superior to our regular supermarket cat food.  As we feel our new addition deserves the best we can give her we not only wanted to make sure her regular food was of high quality and good for her but as our vet said, don't forget to check that her treats are high quality/natural too.  As we were already purchasing the Wellness brand from her list, we tried these treats.<br /><br />On first glance I thought, wow, almost $5.00 for this little bag, that's pricey, but they are very small jerky type treats and they last a long time if you are only giving your pet a few at a time.  My cat loves these and we have found that her coat seems to be very shiny and silky-not sure if these treats contribute, but they could.  We love the fact that they don't have corn, wheat, soy or a bunch of other stuff she really doesn't need.  We also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat....it worked!  People laugh, but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down.  If you don't give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again....smart kitty and she loves those treats.  This is the first flavor we tried, but have since tried others and she loves them all.<br /><br />If you would like to try something more natural for your kitty, I would give these a go.  We have been more than pleased and these are now the only treats we consider buying for her.

review/text: I have discovered the Wellness brand of cat food, and I (and my cat) adore it. I only wish it were easier to afford! Still, Amazon seems to either match PetSmart or have a better deal. (These treats, they only matched the price, but I like Amazon)<br /><br />When I open the bedside drawer that these are stored in, Ariel comes running! She would tear the bag open and eat them all if I were to accidentally leave it out! She LOVES these treats.<br /><br />I am glad that I can spoil my cat with healthy treats/food like the Wellness brand. I highly recommend these treats, although as long as they remain 4.99 you might want to first purchase from a local pet store to make sure your cat likes them.

These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat.

review/text: I got these for my kitten and he loves them.<br /><br />The comment made about the bag being hard to open isn't really that big of a deal, I haven't had any problems closing or opening properly. Though, I would much prefer a container type packaging since those are easier to get into especially if you're training a cat you don't want to hold a bunch of cat treats in your hand because the bag keeps closing on you. But the bag closes/opens like any other zip lock.<br /><br />I feed my kitten chicken flavored cat food, so I try and offset the treats with a different meat and Wellness salmon treats work great and it's healthy without all those fillers.<br /><br />This review is for the treat NOT the bag, so I highly recommended this. 5 stars.

review/text: I found this in my local supermarket (publix - Ilive in FL) for $11.99 if you can believe it.  At that price, has to be the best deal on an estate grown olive oil out there.  Clean olive taste, low acidity (very mild sensation in back of throat, no burning!)<br />They make a similarly priced 10 yr old balsamic too.  Gotta try it!<br /><br />Phil

Unfortunately, I put them out way too early, because they were already half gone by the time the guests arrived... My helpers just couldn't stop eating them!  Needless to say they were the first thing we ran out of.  Next time I would definately order a pound or two more!

review/summary: Fascinating
review/text: I came across these drinks by accident and was intrigued by the unique flavors. Blueberry lime was the most pleasing by far. I was actually disappointed because many of the other reviewers seem to taste mint - that I cannot taste. It smells of blueberries and the taste is a tart berry with a finish of lime (rind?). I did find the flavors were unpleasant if I let the drinks get warm/room temperature, but were fine when cold.<br /><br />If you're used to syrupy sodas attuned more to the American palate - I'd probably skip these. But if you can appreciate bitter notes with hints of sweetness, this drink may be a new treat of varying flavor.

review/summary: Unusual colors, large crystals
review/text: It's a bit pricey with shipping, but I bought this because this brand has unusual colors.  I needed purple for a King Cake, and here in Illinois you just can't find purple sugar.  I actually like this brand quite a bit, and would recommend it.<br /><br />The colors are nice and bright compared to some cheaper brands I've seen.  The first thing I noticed, however, is that the sugar crystals are LARGE compared to the near-shavings I get from the colored sugars I got at the local grocery store.  I guess I'll have to go buy the Green and Gold ones too, so they match next time.

review/summary: Herbal Caffeine-Free Chai, Delicious!
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic rooibos, organic cloves, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic cardamom, organic nutmeg, and organic cinnamon. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Earthy, vanilla organic Rooibos and a sultry blend of spices come together from around the world in Numi's caffeine-free chai. Warmed by the South African sun, Rooibos is lauded for its high anti-oxidant properties. It is full-bodied like black tea, yet soothing any time of day. We've sourced the highest quality cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, mingling them with sweet Indian allspice and vivacious Chinese ginger. A kiss of cardamom unites this fabulous caffeine-free alternative to Numi's Golden Chai. Share in the savory warmth of Ruby Chai."<br /><br />If you are used to black tea or coffee and are wanting to get accustomed to herbal caffeine-free teas, this is a great way to start, since the flavors are stronger and thus less subtle than most herbal teas. Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I purchased these as a Valentine's gift for my wife. I knew she would love them, because they're practically all we ate when we backpacked through Europe years ago. These chocolates are impossible for us to find locally, so she's been getting Hershey, Dove, Godiva, Ghiradelli... for the past few years. Then I checked here. Totally worth it. I'd forgotten how good these chocolates are. Those others pale in comparison to the flavor and super-smooth texture of Milka. She'll be expecting these from now on. I wasn't sure if I ordered in time for Valentine's, but they actually arrived 2 days early. Excellent all around.

review/text: I was born in Serbia, so I grew up eating Milka chocolates.

If anyone has the store World Market close to them, they carry Milka bars. Milk chocolate with WHOLE hazelnuts are my favorite of the MIlka variety!! I highly recommened browsing online and finding a retailer that sells them. YUM!!

review/summary: Milk Chocoholics REJOICE!  One of the BEST tasting EVER!
review/text: I never thought I would actually be reviewing milk chocolate here on 'Amazon', but in this case, I just had to since i'm sitting here salivating like 'Pavlovs dog'.  For years, I have been ranting and raving about how phenomenally great and smooth 'Lacta' milk chocolate (from 'Kraft Foods' division in Greece) tastes, but I could not find it here in the states.  As a milk chocoholic, I would actually have my cousins in Greece send me a box of 24 bars about once a year, until now.  Just today, I randomly discovered this 'Milka' brand on sale at my local 'Giant Eagle' supermarket, and was 'blown away' by the taste!  My immediate reaction was that it tastes just like 'Lacta'... EUREKA!  Upon reading the label, I noticed that it is made by a division of 'Kraft Foods' in Germany.  My guess is that this is the same as a 'Lacta' bar, but it was renamed and repackaged for the German and export market.  In any case, if you love superior tasting milk chocolate, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on 'Milka Alpenmilch'.  I would rank this as the world's BEST TASTING and unique milk chocolate, or in the top 2 or 3 ever.  It's THAT GOOD!

I wondered how they would deliver it without it melting, and when it arrived melted with an ice pack tied to the chocolate bars, I wasn't really surprised!  I refrigerated the package and the chocolate tasted fine cold, but it definitely became a weird, chalk like mess when it thawed.  I decided to heat it and use it to dip strawberries.  SO GOOD.  Will order again, in the dead of winter.

review/text: Milka (Alpine Milk) Chocolate is yummy (in moderation).  My frustration is that it used to be carried by our local Wal-Mart which cut down on the cost.  I shared my chocolate with friends and family for the holidays.  If you can't afford this treat all the time I think Dove chocolates are a reasonable substitute.  Since shipping is so expensive I probably would not purchase this treat on a regular basis.

review/summary: One of the best flavored teas for daily drinking
review/text: I like variety of teas, but my preferences shifted towards green and white teas recently. I like high-end green teas, but do not have time and proper equipment to prepare them at the office. I need quick gratification at the office, i.e. the tea I can prepare in communal kitchen, yet enjoy at my desk.<br />This tea has rich fruity flavor, but it's good: it lets me forget that I'm at the office and think for a while that I'm on some tropical island. The fruits add natural sweetness to the taste of the tea, so no need to add sugar or artificial sweetener.<br />Tea-bags are sealed in air-tight wrapper, so you don't have to worry that your 6-pack purchased at Amazon will lose flavor before you can drink that last one.

review/summary: I Can't Believe I Almost Passed On This One!
review/text: This wasn't going to be one of the many flavored Matcha that I was going to order from Red Leaf Tea.  I mean, I love Matcha, sure, but I do not drink a lot of alcohol, and while I have enjoyed many of the various alcohol-infused flavored teas that I've tried, it just isn't a flavor that I usually go for.  So, I guess, you can consider this a "stepping outside of my comfort zone" moment.<br /><br />And I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />This is amazingly awesome!  It is really good.  The overall flavor is remarkably smooth - and while most Matcha tends to be smooth and creamy - this tastes even smoother than most.  The flavor is more "fruity" than what I'd call "alcohol-like" but it is a very smooth fruity tone, with a very smooth brandy finish.  It is sweet and delicious.  The matcha flavor here is more reserved, with the vegetative tones that usually coat the palate being a bit more in the background rather than front notes.<br /><br />A very enjoyable Matcha - if you're on the fence about this one, I highly recommend taking the plunge and getting it.  It's really very surprisingly good.  I like it a lot.

review/summary: Like Juicy Fruit Gum! Yum yum!
review/text: Okay so for those of you hesitating thinking this is going to taste too much like something a staunch old man sitting in a ritzy Victorian library would drink, its not. Its also not like the stuff the teens would swill behind the bleachers in high school during winter football games. Wait, maybe that was just at my school. Anyway this stuff is GOOOOOD!<br /><br />Someone else said in their review it reminded them of Juicy Fruit gum and they totally hit the nail on the head with that assessment! Had this not been named "Brandy" I would have thought it was a fruit blend - not a punch like Hawaiian Punch, not even a tropical mixture, but just a really yummy sweet fruit blend of some kind. I really wish I could pick out specific fruit flavor elements to relate to you but I can't. Fruit Medley is all I can think of but there is a whipped cream like aspect to it, something that really makes you feel like you bit into some ripe juicy fruit (no pun intended) and it really does taste like that gum! This is one your kids would LOVE! Seriously if you want to get your kids or anyone in the family into matcha I would suggest this or the butterscotch matcha! Just make a latte with some milk, and some vanilla or sweet cream non dairy creamer! Add ice, stir LOVE!<br /><br />Now as for the Brandy aspect here. Its really not all that present to me. Yes I do get a SLIGHT and I mean SLIGHT alcohol effect - sort of a little twang or ting, but not really so much warming as brandy is known for.<br /><br />When I was younger, in my teens, I rode both western and equestrian, and trained horses. That was another life time ago. We would always have some brandy on us to keep warm in the winter wether out on the ranch repairing fences or preparing for a fox hunt (we did not really hunt the foxes I would have no part in that so don't worry) it was more of a Mock Hunt. LOL This matcha does bring back some fond memories of that but its not the same, and I doubt that you really could get the same result from anything but brandy itself but for all intents and purposes this is a very good flavor, a really nice experience, and one I will absolutely be ordering again! I know I say that about a lot of the matcha I have tried, and I have tried a lot of them but this along with about 5 others are THE matcha I can't be without! The "alcohol" effect is just enough for those who have had brandy to recognize but not so much that those who do not like brandy, have never had it, or should not have it, won't even notice. Its like being able to recognize any flavor, you kind of have to have experienced it before to know what it is. Without knowing what it is all you will notice is this AMAZING fruit festival in your mouth!
