review/summary: Good Tasting cup o' joe
review/text: This is a bold blend that has a great taste. The flavor comes bursting through. I usually brew & drink Organic Sumatra Mandeling from BJ's. I use this blend exclusively, so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my Tassimo brewer is fantastic. Come on Amazon add it to the subscription service.

review/summary: Best of the Tassimo's
review/text: We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere.

review/summary: great coffee - terrible price
review/text: This is one of the best choices, in my opinion.  I also adore Amazon, but they need to negotiate a better price for their Tassimo Disks.  These are available at BedBath & Beyond for $10. and I always get 20% off which brings it down to $8.00 --- they were $7.50 (before the 20% off readily available coupons) until about 3 months ago.  Again, this is an excellent blend with full flavor - not bitter - I think it's my favorite.

review/summary: One of the better T-Discs
review/text: I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.

review/summary: Note: Rating both coffee and seller
review/text: This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this "Kona coffee" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.

review/summary: Perfect Sampler of Milka Chocolate
review/text: The Milka Naps Mix Gift Box is a fun, unique gift for those tired of Whitman's and the usual American brands. Nothing wrong with Whitman's, but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nice.<br /><br />As a sampler, it provides only a few of the Milka options. Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I don't like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.<br /><br />Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate.<br /><br />I fully recommend the Milka Naps Mix Gift Box.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com

Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality.

He didn't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all--I feared for the worse.  Determined to be polite, I agreed to have a sandwich using the bread.  It was amazing.  Apparently it rises during the baking or something.<br /><br />Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.<br /><br />We've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; I'm sure that will be delicious as well.

review/text: My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...

review/summary: Not one but twice came broken.
review/text: I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one.

After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.

I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product.

And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you.

review/text: This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli.

review/text: This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is "definitely a keeper." What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be.

review/text: Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time.

review/text: If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- "De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight.

It is specially designed for their teeth and health needs, and she loves it.  And it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store!  What more could you ask?

review/text: I bought this for my one year old Cocker. However all the dogs love it. All their coats look better, they all shed less, eat less, use the bathroom less, my Cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time I have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems. It seems to have cleared up, no more smell. Her eyes give her less problems. And my 7yr old Yorkie he eats less, he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy. Our black lab mix, hot spots and she would just lick her fur off. All these great changes in a matter of a month.  I do mix it roughly 50/50 with Naturals dog food blend.  They are doing great.<br /><br />Sept 2012<br />I love this breed specific food, however I just went to place my next bi-monthly order and I am shocked at the price hike in just over a month!  I paid<br />$41.79 on Aug 3 for a 25lb bag and here it is Sept 20Th and the price has is now $53.94, a difference of $12.15 in price!  This is a huge amount to go up considering that I am assuming this is a price gouge; due to the speculation over crops :( I will look to my local vet for this product. I can get a large bag now less at Petco as well with the discounts they offer. They will order a larger bag if you ask.

review/text: My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some "loose" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh.

This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore.

I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.

review/text: If you are concerned with an aluminum free product, then this is the product for you.  Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum.  This is, however a concern for baking POWDER which can, depending on manufacturer, contain aluminum.  Save your hard earned money and buy Bob's Red Mill regular baking soda.  Arm & Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes, but for natural beauty and health care, this brand is perfect.<br /><br />Just thought you'd all like to know. I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around. :)<br /><br />P.S- So as not to let all of amazon.com-land feel I am one of those "haters who don't really know what they're talking about", I LOVE Bob's Red Mill Co. and shall continue purchasing their excellent products.

review/summary: Excellent quality product, fast delivery...
review/text: The product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.<br /><br />Delivery was unexpectedly fast.<br /><br />The only negative I would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. While this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}. I am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  Long term storage is a big issue with people like me.<br /><br />Thom (Missouri)

review/summary: I love this snack!
review/text: I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)

review/summary: Great tasting snack...if you get the Japanese Pocky
review/text: I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't "terrible" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.

review/summary: Fun "popping-crispy" sticks dipped in chocolate, special treat for manga fans, but find local or wait till fall
review/text: Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: Pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, I was impressed with Very Asia's packaging. I had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer. On top of that the package of dessert pocky I ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo. T_T So of course I was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away, but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading "PROTECT FROM HEAT" and my pocky arriving in perfect condition! (Well, they did stick together just a bit). I love Very Asia more than anything now.

review/summary: Really wanted to like these...
review/text: This product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a "normal" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had. The "clusters" are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend Enjoy Life foods.

review/summary: Something has changed
review/text: My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!

review/summary: Cheaper Ingredients, Lowered Quality
review/text: I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients.

review/text: With all the allergies in our family, these ended up working out great.  We don't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we don't buy many pre packaged foods, these work for 'on-the-go'. Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars; they're almost like a Tootsie Roll to me-though I can't eat Tootsie Rolls, so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving.  My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast, need a healthy snack, or my son will take them on his cross country running meets.  They are very dense and filling-not a 'soft bar' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time.

review/summary: Pretty good overall
review/text: I'm new to food allergies.  My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.<br /><br />Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded.

review/text: They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He won't eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.<br />  We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I don't know.<br />  We DO like Enjoy Life's other products.<br />  They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates.

review/summary: Highly recomended!
review/text: Great taste. Great ingredients. Great texture. Absolutely delicious! They are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. I give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. Either that or they taste so good he wants more.
