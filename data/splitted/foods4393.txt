review/summary: Popped Cheese is not good`
review/text: We bought 2 of the 6 paks for Just the Cheese Butter Flavor Popped Cheese.  The 6 individual bags held about 15-18 pieces of the popped cheese.  Thank goodness the popped cheese pieces were flavored in butter an did have that buttery flavor.  However, when the butter flavors go, you feel like you are eating rice cakes with zero taste. I'll not make this mistake again.

review/summary: Loved 'em!  But they're still pretty salty.
review/text: These things are incredible-tasting, something like super-concentrated real butter flavor.  I could eat these until I exploded, except for the salt.  They claim to be lower salt, but they are saltier-tasting than any other snack I've ever had!!  Normally, I like lots of salt--I even put salt on macaroni and cheese--but these are just overloaded with it.  Even so, I have to order a case of these now and then because the aroma and flavor is so amazing.

review/summary: CHEESE CURDS
review/text: ORIGINAL REVIEW (Jan 2008): I don't know what it is about these, but I LOVE THEM. I wasn't sure at first, but they have an addictive quality ... crunchy at first, then they melt & dissolve in your mouth. And then it hit me. These taste like CHEESE CURDS. As a Wisconsin native, all I can say is YUMMY! If you don't know what CHEESE CURDS, you might not want this to be your first experience. Just sayin'.<br /><br />But, four-stars, rather than 5 due to saltiness -- even the lower salt is a bit too salty.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />UPDATE (Aug 2010): I just ordered again, my third or fourth time placing an order with Amazon. This time the Popped Cheese was STALE, soft, and old although expiration is for May-2011. Clearly, this food product is not being stored properly and/or the manufacturing has changed. I won't order them again.<br /><br />I have changed my rating. Now, 1 star for unacceptable, barely edible, food product.

review/text: Just the Cheese Butter Flavor Popped Cheese actually smells and tastes like buttered popcorn.  The consistency is different then real popcorn, it's crunchier, but then you get this buttery flavor burst that's great for an afternoon snack or during a movie.  The pack of 6 worked out very well since I keep some at the office and some at home.  That's kept me on track when I see other people around me snack in the afternoon... now I have a salty, crunchy snack, too!

review/text: First off let me say for that tiny amount of snack these are way overpriced...especially after you try them.  These were SO disgusting...my husband and I both tried these and at first the taste was just mildly bad but as we chewed the more gross it got until we were both scrambling for a trash can.  And that's not a normal response for either of us when something tastes bad...it was just so horrible that it was spit it out or gag on it.

review/text: I have a dog who loves to chew and goes through other rawhide and chew sticks very quickly. These last much longer and are "odorfree" to a point. They still have a bit of a gamey smell.

review/text: Bully sticks are such a great alternative to raw hides.  The dogs love them and I feel comfortable in knowing they are 100% digestable.  Pricey compared to raw hides but I will pay that anyday vs trips to the vet from treats that are bad for them.  I do ALWAYS buy odor free since the smell from the ones that aren't drained are just stomach turning and tend to induce my gag reflex.  These bully sticks are exactly what I was expecting and have 3 very happy pups chewing on them as we speak!

review/summary: Awesome substitute for coffee!
review/text: I stopped drinking coffee 2 years ago because I only liked to drink it with a ton of cream and sugar.  I had a "light bulb moment" one day, and realized all the damage I was doing to my body by consuming all that sugar, so I tried drinking my coffee black.  DISGUSTING!!  I then went cold turkey.  I've never missed not drinking the coffee, but a friend of mine told me about Teeccino, so I thought I might try it.  I must admit, I don't like it by itself because it does taste A LOT like coffee, but I add a little honey and almond milk to a hot mug of Teeccino and it reminds me of a cross between coffee and hot chocolate.  DELICIOUS!!!

I am using like 3cups a day.<br />This one and the vanilla nut one is good too. The choc. I wouldn't recommend. Haven't tried any others but would like to. Very close to the real taste of coffee if not some kind of treat. If you squeeze the tea bag pouch then it can rip and send grounds into your cup. Had to waste one today. Threw it away and got another one. Kind of makes a mess with the tea bag though. Plus when you squish it the tea bag is hot. They do have grounds too but I don't know what type of coffee maker you could buy that would be great. Then how much of it to use. The tea bags are great for strength. You can almost get more than one cup but the 2nd will taste watered down or less strong.

This company also makes Koala Crisp Cereal, if we have that, my kids will mix the Panda Puffs with the Koala Crisp (which has a chocolate flavor) as they think it tastes like a Reese Cup. I like that there are only 7g of sugar per serving (much less than many kids cereals) and all the ingredients are organic. Once in milk this cereal will also stay crispy a little longer than Rice Crispies, but not much. If you have to make Rice Crispy treats for the school bake sale - use these cereals instead for an extra yummy treat.

review/summary: Tastes great but it's BARELY peanut buttery :-(
review/text: This tasted more like a corn puffs cereal than a peanut butter puffs cereal.  Well, there's a strong "hint" of peanut butter, but they definitely could've increased the taste.<br /><br />Also, it didn't get soggy at all...in fact it didn't even soften up!  Barely absorbed any milk. That was a little bit of a disappointment actually.  I like my cereals to soften up a little and I like to taste the milk in them (it kinda felt like I was eating cereal out of the box and then taking a sip of milk after :-)  Not a real problem though.  Still delicious.<br /><br />I tried having them with fresh bananas (as the box picture suggests) and that was fabulous!<br /><br />The Best part is that the ingredients are so awesome!! I hate cereals with 5 kinds of sugar and weird chemicals.  This tasted great and wasn't unhealthy.  I recommend it!

review/summary: SO goooood!
review/text: I'm not a kid, (25yrs), but my BF calls me a baby when I eat this. He is not allowed to finish the box and if I get low, I rush to the store for another box. I love that this is organic! My mom bought Frosted Flakes, Fruity Pebbles, and all that sugary stuff when I was little. I was a little sugar addict. Anyways, I've been eating this for a year, bought some of that other stuff a couple of times, but it tasted horrible. Tasted bland to me now. I'm also on medication that heightens your taste buds, and anything non-organic, has a high chemical aftertaste, including those old cereals. I will never buy anything non-organic for my kids. It's just not worth it! Also, I lived off this cereal for a week and didn't feel all gross and sick from a sugar high. What can I say, poor college student but I didn't mind. Also, this is perfect blend of peanut butter taste, I added actual peanut butter to it, and it was too much. Perfect blend! I just ate it!

review/summary: No peanut butter taste at all.
review/text: I love me some peanut butter, and anything with peanut butter in it always has me excited to try.  I had heard great things from this cereal so I decided to give it a try while it was on sale at my local health food store.  I smelled peanut butter when I opened the bag and was so very excited to dig in.  I taste this cereal and detected no peanut butter flavor at all, to me this cereal just tasted like Kix cereal.  No peanut butter flavor to be had which left me disappointed.  So if you expect a strong peanut butter flavor, or any peanut butter flavor at all you are not going to get anything like that with this cereal.  It is good but when you are expecting peanut butter and you get none it does not leave me feeling like I can trust the flavors of the other cereals by this company. These would go great in peanut butter rice crispy like treats but for just snacking on or having as a bowl of cereal would not be that great.  They are a healthier version of kix so if you love the flavor of kix you will love these.

review/summary: Best Peanut Butter Gluten Free Cereal on the Market!
review/text: One of my favorite gluten free cereals.  Amazon's subscribe and save program allows me to have the PB Panda Puffs on hand and at an affordable price.  I would have to drive a good 20 minutes to the grocery store in the next town over to find them locally, if they are in-stock.  I like to mix them with a bag of Rice Krispies to help them last just a bit longer and to cut down on the amount of sugar (7g per serving). I normally eat these at least six days a week, simply the best!

But it was good and it is HARD to find good, and good for you, gluten free cereals.

review/text: I have Celiac disease, and have found this to be the most "normal" tasting cereal. The peanut butter flavor is not too strong, and the puffs don't get soggy as fast as regular cereal. I was thrilled to see it offered on Amazon in bulk, only to see the price. I can buy this cereal off the shelf at my grocery store for under $5 a box. Here they're charging more than $8 per box, plus shipping.<br /><br />If you're dealing with Celiac, this is a great tasting cereal that's doesn't have too much sugar. However, check out your local grocery and health food stores before paying these prices.

review/text: These are regular dried blackberries.  I was looking for freeze dried for use in cereal and I bought these thinking they might be freeze dried.<br /><br />I tried them in cereal and they were pretty good anyway, but not stellar.<br /><br />Regular dried blackberries are rather heavy, chewy, and when the fruit is dried, the ratio of fruit to seed is pretty low.  This makes me believe that these would be best reconstituted in cooking, such as baking.<br /><br />Also, both regular dried blackberries and freeze dried blackberries seem to take on an aromatic floral, slightly spicy taste that is not familiar in fresh blackberries.<br /><br />If you are looking for blackberries to reconstitute or use in baking, these are worth a try.<br /><br />If you are looking for freeze dried, then Just Blackberries brand or Harmony House brand both turned out to be very good.

review/summary: I like this shampoo OK - but find the smell too strong
review/text: This shampoo is OK and it doesn't bother me that it doesn't "tingle" as other reviewers have stated.  What's all this desire for tingling anyway?  Your fingers tingle and you worry you have a medical problem, but oh if your head tingles, you think your dandruff shampoo is working?  I even googled tingling dandruff shampoo as I thought I had read somewhere that the tingle is actually caused by an ingredient that has nothing to do with the anti-dandruff properties of other shampoos.  Seems to control itching and dandruff/dry scalp.  I usually use Nature's Gate tea tree shampoo <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6P6MQ">Nature's Gate Tea Tree Calming Shampoo for Irritated, Flaky Scalp, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a> and really prefer that... more of a tea tree smell, feels gentler, and doesn't seem to have all the chemicals that Unilever has loaded into this potion.<br /><br />It seems to me if you want the chemicals, just go with Head 'n Shoulders and call it a day.  If you want more of an organic solution which is gentler on your scalp and contains less chemicals, try Nature's Gate.  This shampoo seems sort of like the worst of both worlds.<br /><br />And as other reviewers have commented, the smell is too strong by just a notch or two.  And isn't really pleasant enough to want to smell more of it, so the manufacturer should either dial back the fragrance or change it to something more pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate this shampoo as so-so.... not something I'd purchase in the future.  Hope this helps.

review/text: I have used this 6 to 7 times so far and the dandruff control is very good. The conditioner is good but the smell of the shampoo is a bit strong for my taste. To my surprise I did not get that tingling feeling after using say "Selsum Blue" or "Head and Shoulders". Thus I did not get that clean refreshing feeling of having had a good shampoo. Nevertheless the product lives up to its claims quite well.<br /><br />The item did leak quite a bit in transit as some other reviewers have stated. But that does not reflect upon the quality of the product just the shipping department so I just ignored that in my rating. What would make this a 5 star product? For me that would be a less pronounced smell and a tingling feeling while shampooing.<br />Comment |<br />Looking for voting buttons? Sorry, we don't let customers vote on their own reviews.

review/summary: Thick and Rich
review/text: I have used dandruff shampoo for most of my life.  It seems as though I have tried most of the dandruff shampoos that exist.  Though it seems like some of them occasionally work, they do not seem to work all the time.  Consequently, I have used Head & Shoulders literally for decades.  When the opportunity came to try a new dandruff shampoo, I was all for it.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed about this shampoo is that it seems very thick, much thicker than any shampoo I can recall using.  I tried trusty Head & Shoulders for comparison a couple of times.  My perception seems to be reality.  Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo is noticeably, pleasurably thicker than Head & Shoulders shampoo.<br /><br />The next thing I wondered about is the smell.  Head & Shoulders smells like - well - shampoo.  While the smell is relatively mild, it is nothing special.  In contrast, I think Clear Men Scalp Therapy has a pleasant fragrance.  I did have to hold the shampoo close to my nose to smell it because the smell is not overly strong and does not fill a room with its odor, which is a positive attribute in my mind.<br /><br />I could say something about how well the shampoo cleans, but it cleans like shampoo.  My hair felt soft and clean, which is how it should feel.  It also felt clean a second day after I used it.<br /><br />The magic question with respect to this shampoo is how well it does with respect to dandruff.  Well, it seems to work about the same as Head & Shoulders.  Since the dandruff-fighting ingredient in Clear Men Scalp Therapy is the same ingredient that is in Head & Shoulders, it should hardly be surprising that both shampoos work the same with respect to fighting dandruff.<br /><br />This shampoo also has a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that falls under the heading of nutrients and botanicals.  I am unable to tell much about the effectiveness of these various ingredients.  The ingredients sound impressive, but your hair is dead and I am unsure as to the effectiveness of fertilizing your skin.<br /><br />There remains one important aspect to this shampoo, and that is price.  After comparing the price of this shampoo to my standby, Head & Shoulders, I have concluded that this shampoo is relatively expensive.  I looked at several sizes of Head & Shoulders and without pulling out a calculator, it seems like this shampoo is about 50% more expensive than Head & Shoulders, give or take 10 or 20%.  I love the thickness of the shampoo and the smell, but I am unable to justify the price.  I know more expensive shampoos exist, but think about it, shampoo is essentially soap for your hair.  I struggle to think one soap that costs approximately 50% more than another soap is really worth 50% more unless the more expensive shampoo does something magical.  I am missing the magic here.<br /><br />Shampoo serves a useful and important function.  Dandruff shampoo serves two important functions, cleaning your hair and reducing or eliminating the dry skin that is dandruff.  This shampoo does the first quite well and the second about as well as Head & Shoulders.  The only question I have is whether a shampoo significantly more expensive than another shampoo is value added in my life, or any other person's life.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Clear Men Therapy: a 2-in-1 solution that seems to work
review/text: For most of my life, I've looked at shampoo as being just that: a hair care product used for removal of dirt, oils, pool chlorine, dandruff, skin particles, and other small debris that builds up in hair. In the 1970s we began to hear of environmental pollutants, so out came the classic Prell in the green tube, just like our parents used, the one that left the hair "squeaky clean" for a longer period of time than most other shampoos.<br /><br />I liked the feel, but it also left my hair extremely dry, with my head looking like a walking haystack. So then came the experiments with conditioner, and learning how one can use too much, leaving a very greasy appearance even though the hair was freshly clean. Not long after that, I tried one of the off the self "2-in-1" products that was being heavily advertised in the '70s, a green bottle that combined shampoo with hair conditioner.<br /><br />It seemed OK, but when I went to get a haircut, the woman who was the stylist asked what I was using in my hair, and when I answered, she told me: "Keep using that and you'll grow bald within the next ten years!" I then watched a video that outlined all of the things that could cause damage to hair, such as baldness, scalp diseases and such. The video then recommended a 'salon-only' product that would make the hair richer, fuller, and about half a dozen other adjectives designed to zing in on the ego.<br /><br />I didn't buy it, still have a full head of hair, and as time and marketing progressed, that 'salon-only' brand appeared on drugstore shelves everywhere.<br /><br />Moving to now: I tried this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIA">Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration</a> product based on experience with one of their other products. This one claims to be proven "to help eliminate dandruff symptoms at the source with pyrithione zinc" and that it is prepared with "Bio-Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 nutrients and botanical actives, including ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins b5 and e, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils to nourish deeply."  These statements are enough to raise an eyebrow, and as I have a closely trimmed beard, finding a good all in one solution is important. On a first person basis, I can only say that this one seems to work.<br /><br />I had previously tried their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo</a> with mint, ginseng and tea tree, and found it to be quite good for dandruff control as a daily shampoo. But I also found that I needed to use a bit of conditioner afterwards to eliminate the haystack look. Now using this Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2-in-1 product every other day seems to be a good balance, as it seems to have just the right amount of conditioner to keep things in balance.<br /><br />All things considered, these Clear Men Scalp Therapy products feel good, and leave the hair feeling clean and without extra added smells. They've proven to be good solutions, and ones that will be ordered again.<br /><br />7/25/2012

When he told me his scalp was itchy, I was concerned about giving him something different than his usual shampoo, but gave him Clear Men Scalp Therapy to try - warning him to be sure to rinse well.<br /><br />Clear Men Scalp Therapy is very thick, like a cream. It has a slight manly scent which is appealing to a soon to be teen boy. He was very pleased with his clean scalp after using it. It also left his hair smooth and soft.

This product recommends that, but it's better to wash every 2-3 days. Your natural oils are there for a reason, stripping them away does more harm than good.

review/text: This Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 anti-dandruff and conditioner shampoo has given me immediate dandruff relief for the past month. Using this product every other day, I enjoy the smell, massaging for my scalp, and the results.<br /><br />Though this is a good product, I would not necessarily say it's any better than other affordable brands like dove, Head & shoulders, and Garnier. It definitely better than products like Suave and Axe. What makes it different is the higher number of natural ingredients. Among the ingredients used in this shampoo are Bio-Nutrium 10, ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins b5 and e, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils.<br /><br />I see this product like Head & Shoulders, but without the bland scentless sensation. The Clear men scalp therapy just makes the whole process with a nicer scent. The product has given me immediate dandruff relief. Now, whether or not the price is worth it, that is up to you. There are cheaper shampoos that does the same thing, namely Head & Shoulders. Again, the main difference is the smell and massage-like sensation.

review/text: Hard to find a dandruff shampoo for people like me with psoriasis who have to constantly moisturize their scalps to avoid flaking and dryness. I've tried the store brands, big-name brands, and everything in-between, and this truly is one of the tops on my list.<br /><br />The bottle design is cool, easy to fit into most spots, and the top opens easily with wet hands.<br /><br />It doesn't do quite as great of a job on the moisturizing as the bigger brands (just slightly less), but the benefits of how great your hair feels after drying off is worth it! All the others leave my dry hair... slightly less dry than normal; this actually got into the follicle it seems and made it soft to the touch and easier to comb thru.

review/text: I very much liked this shampoo, it smelled quite pleasant (Selsun blue, I'm looking at you!), and it didn't dry my hair out like some other dandruff shampoo's I've tried. I plan to use this in the future-- and you should too.<br /><br />Dandruff 101:<br />Unfortunately there's quite a few things that can cause dandruff, and it's nearly impossible to tell what the cause is. You should try a few different medications until something works. The active ingredient in this medication is Zinc Pyrithione which can treat fungal infections and seborrhoeic dermatitis -- making it an excellent starting point.<br /><br />The key to getting rid of dandruff is to move on to another type of medication if the kind you're using isn't helping, and to stick with the medication *LONG* after your dandruff is gone. Fungal infections *appear* to be gone after a few applications of an anti-fungal, but they'll stick around for weeks afterwords. Keep medicating!<br /><br />You should also wash your bedding regularly, and try to sanitize anything your head comes into contact with on a regular basis to kill any fungus you might have left there.<br /><br />Vinegar also makes an excellent anti-fungal, but its a bit rough on the scalp.<br /><br />If your dandruff seems to correspond with a eating a particular food or using a particular product you might have a food allergy or contact dermatitis.

He has tried most of the products out there relying heavily on Head & Shoulders as his go-to shampoo of choice. According to my 16-year-old, he much prefers this shampoo for the following reasons. First, the scent is not overpowering. It's a clean-smelling fragrance that lasts throughout the day. Secondly, it doesn't tingle when applied. He is not a big fan of those types of shampoos. Finally, the product works. His dandruff is under control and his hair looks and smells clean. Two thumbs up from my son.

review/summary: Weaker mixture of Head and Shoulders and Tea Tree
review/text: Clear Men Scalp Therapy has the same ingredient as Head and Shoulders for dandruff control, Zinc pyrithione, and the ingredients from Paul Mitchell Tea Tree, menthol and ginger. However this product has a weaker mixture of the two, so you do not get the same dandruff control of Head and Shoulders and the tingling clean feeling of Tea Tree.<br /><br />I have jet black hair and once a friend who was in beauty school needed a victim...I mean a volunteer to do a hair coloring. Well I got a real good chemical burn on my scalp and had to go to a dermatologist. She told me that for scalp treatment the over the counter brands contain the following: Head and Shoulders: Zinc pyrithione, Selsun Blue:Selenium sulfide, and T-Gel:coal tar. These are the most common anti dandruff shampoos and there are store brands of each one. She prescribed for me Nizoral Shampoo which has Ketoconazole as the active ingredient. Since then there is a non-prescription version of Nizoral for sale at stores.<br /><br />So, as far as this product goes, it will be good as a mild scalp conditioner and hydrator, but if you have serious scalp issues then the Nizoral is the best of all brands on the shelf. If you are looking for a shampoo that really leaves your scalp tingling and cool feeling then Paul Mitchell Tea Tree is what you should use. This product is fine if you are looking for something that has the mild qualities of those shampoos. It does leave you with a nice clean feeling and the price is reasonable.

review/summary: Works Great. Concentrated.
review/text: In addition to dandruff, I have a small patch of psoriasis on my scalp. I've used prescription shampoo for it, which seems to help a bit, but does not eliminate it. This works at least as well, and seems to work a bit better than my prescription shampoo. It's concentrated, so for a guy with average length hair you only need to use a dollop about the size of a quarter. The 12.9 ounce bottle seems equivalent to approximately 18 ounces of your typical brand name shampoo. No perfume that I can smell--not that I have the best smeller. Hair looks good after use, and for me at least, the itching goes away.

review/text: I like this shampoo. It has a pleasent sent. It's pretty thick so I only use about half as much as I would with head and shoulders. But it does seem pricy, so I'm not sure I would buy it again.  I got it on Amazon for $3.73 and free shipping.  It was on sale, I used a $1.00 coupon and used subscribe and save.  I'll see how long this bottle lasts me then I'll decide if I want to cancell the subscription.

review/text: As far as shampoo-and-conditioners-in-one products, this is a good one. It has a nice smell, a nice consistency, and it seems to work well...though it should be said that I don't really have issues with dandruff in the first place, just a bit of dry scalp from time to time. I do prefer the individual products (shampoo and conditioner), though, to the all-in-ones...hence the 4 star rating. If you like them combined, this product is great.

review/summary: Excellent Shampoo
review/text: For years I've used the more famous brand of dandruff shampoo, but after trying several different versions of this brand, I have to conclude that this shampoo is equally if not more effect than the famous brand. I love that there is big lather out of a little drop of shampoo, that the length of time my hair feels clean is much longer with this shampoo than with "the other brand", and that my dandruff is actually very controlled and my scalp does not itch at all when using this brand. I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it. I think I'm going to permanently switch to this shampoo.

review/text: This 2 in 1 shampoo with conditioner is amazing at reducing dandruff.  I liked that it was also very good at reducing itching, which is particularly helpful for those like me with sensitive, itchy skin.  It has a very neutral smell and lathers very easily. As wonderful as the product was, it's also very affordable and much cheaper than the numerous inferior dandruff control shampoos out there. I highly enjoyed this shampoo and highly recommend it to all men who suffer from dandruff and/or an itchy scalp.

review/summary: Leaves my hair super soft and prevents itchy scalp
review/text: I am forced to be very selective about what type of shampoo and conditioner that I use because many do not agree with my hair and scalp. If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. Some shampoo will make my hair feel very oily as well.<br /><br />I usually use Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. This  2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner has a nice scent and lathers very well. It's thinner consistency than most shampoo but it doesn't matter much to me. It is also competitively priced.<br /><br />It has twice the Pyrithione Zinc that most Anti-Dandruff shampoo has, which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it super soft and manageable. I can't say that I noticed any specific benefit to my scalp when compared to some of their other types of shampoo but it certainly leaves my hair softer than any other shampoo / conditioner combo that I have used so far. I believe this will become a regular shampoo for me.

review/summary: Works very well
review/text: This 2in1 shampoo & conditioner works surprisingly well. It makes your hair so shiny and smooth and it does moisturize the scalp and make the dryness go away. It makes the itch go away as well. More severe cases may need more than a few uses, but you should see an improvement after the 1st use for slight cases.<br /><br />The scent is fairly strong, but does smell nice and fresh. It lathers well and rinses well. It doesn't leave any residue behind. It doesn't make your hair feel greasy or way. You hair will look and feel healthy.<br /><br />As an additional bonus, I actually used this fo my dog because he broke out with some serious dandruff and was constantly scratching and itching after trying a mostly grain based dog food (Beneful). I had read that Head and Shoulders works for pets, so I figured i'd give this one a try since we had it on hand. It did an amazing job! He smelled great for days, his fur was SO shiny, soft and sleek and his dandruff decreased dramatically after the first bath with it. He stopped scratching and itching too. It was pretty amazing. I will remember to use this again if we ever have any skin issue with him. He had been scratching and flaking with dandruff for about 4 days. The day we used it, he was still scratching and flaking everywhere right before the bath. Immediately after the bath it was such a drastic change for the better.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for human and pet use!

review/summary: effective anti-dandruff properties
review/text: This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.<br />I've heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out. There seem to be quite a few anti-dandruff products from Clear and I'm not sure this is necessary. My family has tried most of them and have not really noticed any difference.

review/text: So far this has been great, it is always hard to say if this has been the problem solver for dandruff.<br /><br />It has a nice, rich, silky smooth and creamy shampoo and conditioner. A small amount goes a long way. It has a very pleasant smell, hard to describe but i guess "clean" sums it up.<br />The bottle is somewhat ergonomic and has a slight grip feel so it doesn't slip from wet or soapy hands.<br />The closure method leaves some residual shampoo on the edge of the bottle.<br />My scalp does feel better and not as dry as with other shampoos in the market. I guess it returns some amount of moisture to my scalp even if its temporarily short lived in 100+ degree weather.<br />A good buy for half the price of other shampoos that deliver the same "quality" as this one.

review/summary: Too thick and sudsy for my taste
review/text: While I occasionally have problems with dandruff and dry scalp, I don't typically use a anti-dandruff shampoo. I also rarely use all in one shampoos.<br /><br />In this case, unlike the other Clear Men's product, this shampoo was way too thick and produced too many suds.  I didn't notice any conditioning benefits from the product.  I generally get a softer, more manageable head of hair after using conditioner.  The shampoo got my hair clean but not much more.<br /><br />Additionally, the bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn't fit easily into existing holders.

review/text: This shampoo does a great job hydrating your scalp.  I wash my hair sometimes 2-3 times in a 24 hour time interval due to my active lifestyle (gym, running, swimming, etc...) and can sometimes develop sensitive/dry scalp.  The only disadvantage that I've noticed is that it tends to make my roots a little oily.  This would probably be best suited for men with very short hair and/or women with thin-textured short hair.

review/summary: Works well to help control your dandruff or just as a everyday shampoo if you don't
review/text: I have never had a problem with dry scalp or dandruff, but I consider myself lucky because most everyone else in my household experiences it to some degree.<br /><br />My daughter has issues with dry itchy scalp during the winter months, while my boyfriend has the same problem during the summer.  Both gave this shampoo a try for over a week each and both saw improvement.  My daughter of course didn't care as much for the scent since it's geared towards men, but her conditioner and hair products covered it up. My boyfriend liked it better than what he had been using and the smell was okay with him because it wasn't overpowering. Of course while this was in our shower I found myself out of my normal shampoos so I gave it a try and I thought it was okay.  Because it has the added conditioner it didn't dry out my hair like some shampoos do and it actually tingled a bit, which I liked. I would have no problem using this as a regular shampoo, but I would like a different scent for me.<br /><br />Overall I've been asked to buy this in the future to replace another name brand that we had always bought, of course for my daughter I will switch it up and get her the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIK">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo</a> and hope that it works just as well.

review/summary: This Works Well and a Little Goes a Long Way.
review/text: I am pretty old fashioned when it comes to my hair. I usually use a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo with a shampoo that has coal tar in it to treat my dandruff. I don't use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have "pretty smells." In short I want to keep my dandruff under control and that is about it.<br /><br />I figured I would try this shampoo based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my other two shampoos. I will admit I the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the "pretty smell" but I figured it was worth a try.<br /><br />I am pleased so far. This seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product. The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when i am done I don't notice it. A little of this product goes a long way. This is labled as a daily shampoo and I use it every day.<br /><br />So far i am pleased with this. If I can use this instead of my other two shampoos I will save money as well.

review/text: It was seredipity that this showed up in the Vine program on the very day I had determined to buy this product over the counter. I had been having some bouts with itchy scalp that my current shampoo was not able to tackle. No flakes or dandruff, just itchyness. Thankfully it worked!<br /><br />The label describes the content as "tea tree, natural mint, vitamins b5 and e, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils" as well as the standard zinc pyrithione dandruff ingredient. Not sure what 'tea tree' is... leaves, bark or roots from the Camillia (tea) family, or melaleuca oil from the Australian tree from the Myrtle family. The latter I suspect; the product has a distinct and pleasant odor.<br /><br />The product stings the eyes if you ae not careful; I have experienced this even after substantial rinsing and suspect that warm water may volatilize which ever ingredient causes this. In any event, it seems to work well.

review/text: This shampoo smells fantastic, I like it as well as my husband. I would compare the smell to an axe or old spice variety shampoo that is almost like a cologne, it is pleasant and not overpowering. The intense part comes in with the sensation of the tingle, if you have a sensitive scalp or any sort of open scratch the sensation is overwhelming and can be unpleasant. After using this shampoo hair feels clean and the moisturizing seems to work well. We haven't had any problems with dandruff since starting to use this product.

review/summary: Man vs. woman shampoo
review/text: We have tried several of the Clear brand of shampoos, both the men and woman's varieties and both the men and women in our family have used both. There seems to be no real clear difference in the results. All of them, as this does, smell fresh and clean.  The dandruff ones seem to work, but then none of us have a horrendous dandruff problem. Some of the shampoos, mainly the women's are extremely thick and take longer to wash out of your hair.<br />The overwhelming consensus of women vs. men is that we all preferred the men's line of Clear shampoo. We think it works better and gives a better feel and condition - as this one did.<br /><br />This particular variety was... as the others nice, and it worked, but also we have the same 2 complaints. The bottles that are designed to leave upside down in your shower have a tendency to leak and as good as these shampoos are they are about 3 times as expensive as other shampoos we have used that have achieved the same results.

review/text: The concept of an all in one shampoo and conditioner is appealing although previously, I found suchproducts lacking.  This shampoo is designed for men(is there really a difference between male and female scalps?) and is reputed to address both dandruff and dry scalp.<br /><br /> Five of us tried it, three men and two women.  All of us liked the fresh, clean scent. Our hair was clean and soft although I personally would have preferred more conditioning.  My brother was most impressed as he spends alot of time outdoors and suffers from dry scalp.  He appreciated the time saving element of the two in one and thought it worked as well as Head n shoulders.  The consensus was that this is a good product although not necessarily better than any other that is out there.  My brother prides himself on being a savvy shopper and generally buys whatever is least expensive. This is certainly a product he would buy but not one he would go out of his way for.

review/text: he Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and conditioning.<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Dry Scalp Hydration), with a price between the two extremes, also has a fragrance somewhere in the middle. It smells good, but is also very subtle.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />Another review nailed the texture as "melted ice cream." More importantly, it lathers well and is easy to spread through even long hair.<br /><br />CONDITIONING<br /><br />Shampoo+conditioner sometimes fails to do more than shampoo alone in my experience, and this is also true for the Complete Care version of this shampoo.  However, this Dry Scalp version does a good job of both cleaning and conditioning.  Ironically, my scalp does feel a little dry, but overall I am happy with it.  I may prefer a separate conditioner in the winter when my hair can get dryer and start looking frizzy.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Dry Scalp Therapy shampoo+conditioner is pretty good and likely worth a small premium over traditional brands.  Since it uses the same ingredient for dandruff control, there is not much risk in trying it.

review/summary: Clear Men is a better alternative to H&S - great smell and feel on the scalp - no need for separate conditioner either
review/text: I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCUTKI">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KN8UA">Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043OYFJQ">Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> watched in fear.<br /><br />All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised "bio nutrium 10", a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.<br /><br />The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  This formulation advertises it is "Dry Scalp Hydration".  It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, and does not smell as strong as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.  It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.<br /><br />The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  There was no real lasting smell or feel to it.  I didn't need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.<br /><br />I like the Clear Men's line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  They are all recommended, or get whichever one is the cheapest at the time.

review/summary: Moisturizes well
review/text: I am a woman and have been trying out these Clear shampoos for men.  I've liked them all.  This variety. with the ginseng/mint aroma, is expecially nice. As in all other Clear shampoos, it doesn't require much to get the hair lathered up, and afterwards the hair combs out nicely.  I don't find the aroma all too strong, either.  I find it more subtle than women's shampoos, and that's why I like it. I feel no itchiness or oiliness, either.<br /><br />What I've noticed with all the Clear shampoos is how much longer my hair looks clean as compared to my non-Clear women's shampoos.  The only negative is that this shampoo is rather pricy, but for a nice variety from my standard shampoo, this stuff works very well.

review/summary: Smells great
review/text: I actually really liked this shampoo. It smells great, not like medicine and not strong at all. I thought it conditioned better than a shampoo without conditioner and my hair came out clean and fresh. It also still seemed clean the next day. No sign of flakes, itching, or dandruff. This seems like an inexpensive, time-saving shampoo.

review/text: The bottle fits the hand and the goop is dispensed efficiently. It lathers up and rinses off. What more do you want? Whether it cures dandruff and hydrates the scalp, who knows? You would need controlled trials to test those things.<br /><br />I buy shampoo based on price and get whatever I can find. They all seem to work just as well.

review/summary: Works good but like the CLEAR Sport Mint  better
review/text: I had the chance to try multiple types of the CLEAR shampoos for men, and while this one works good at controlling dandruff, some of the brands other varities seem to work better. For me I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> more then I like this one. This shampoo does leave your hair clean and I believe it helps with dandruff control, but I like the Mint shampoo better.<br /><br />I did have a major shipping issue on this one though. The shampoo was wrapped in a plastic bag and this shampoo was leaking all over the place. I'll add a picture of what it looked like to this product page.

review/summary: LIke it
review/text: I use Head and Shoulders b/c I have moderate dandruff.  This 2-in-1 works just as well against the dandruff.  It is thicker than Head and Shoulders, so I only had to use a small amount (about the size of a dime-I have a short haircut).  It smells less like soap/shampoo and more like cologne, which is nice.  It lathers VERY well and leaves my hair clean feeling, even a day after. Overall, I think I am going to switch from Head and Shoulders!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/summary: I used it as I would a body wash
review/text: In addition to washing my hair, I used it on my whole body. The white cream comes out slowly and I used small amounts at a time. I would guess that I used less than a tablespoon for my shower. Although it has conditioner, it does not create the slickness of a dedicated conditioner. I like the pleasing scent which is stronger than I expected. My overall opinion is that I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the product. I am giving it 4 stars until I see if over time it keeps my skin from drying out (that would boost it to 5 stars).

review/summary: Strong Smell, but Decent Results
review/text: I am updating my review. Initially, when I opened this bottle and smelled the contents, I was overcome by the extremely strong smell that really discouraged me from allowing my son to use this product on his hair. So, it sat on the bathroom counter. Tonight, my son opened it up again and asked me about it.  I took another whiff...super strong, but not as disturbing as my initial exposure.<br /><br />So, we decided to give this product another chance...<br /><br />I'm giving it 3-stars because it was one of the only 2 CLEAR MEN products (the other was clear sport mint) that didn't leave his straighter hair coarse. I'm still turned-off by the smell and would not be thrilled about him using (what seems to be strong chemicals) long term, but it appears to work better on my teenager's hair than most of the others.

review/summary: We Both Liked It
review/text: My husband has heavy dandruff and liked this product because he thought it was a little kinder than his usual product (Head and Shoulders) and had the added benefit of a conditioner. The smell was fresh and a bit on the masculine side. It provided a rich lather, did not require an excessive amount of product, and was easy to use.<br />I tried it out, also. Thought it worked just fine, but the scent definitely isn't girly. Since my dandruff is at bay and manageable using a dandruff shampoo once a week, I am going with my husband's assessment that this product is effective. By the way, I like the scent.

review/summary: Good Anti-Dandruff Hair Care
review/text: "Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration" is a very good shampoo/conditioner for those who suffer from dandruff and dry scalp. The product is very thick, and has a good fragrance that isn't overpowering. I suffer from dry scalp and mild dandruff. After using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for a couple of days, I haven't noticed any dandruff at all. If there is a negative, the price is a little higher than similar products that work just as well for me. With that being said, I give it 4 stars and recommend it.

review/summary: Can't see a difference
review/text: Extract of tea leaves doesn't impress me, but results do.  Unfortunately, I don't really see any difference after using this shampoo vs. the cheap stuff from Wallyworld.  Admittedly, my hair is very short so there isn't much 'result' to notice but I would think it should do something different.  Everyone's hare is different so if this stuff interests you try it out.  For me, it didn't do much.

review/summary: Works, Smells Good
review/text: Like several products this dandruff shampoo really works.  A difference between most others is that have that clinical smell, while Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 does not.  As an added bonus, this product also contains conditioner, taking care of your dandruff problem but leaving your hair  clean and fluffy.  If there is one thing I don't like is the container - it's just a better of personal preference but I would prefer a more stable base.

review/summary: Not good for my hair or scalp
review/text: Ok so I have dandruff and always have flakes if I don't use shampoo everyday. For my problem H&S worked best for me but I had to use it everyday. However, my hair never felt dried or barely see any flakes when continue to use it. Few weeks ago I saw commercial on CLEAR (Yes I fell for the shiny bottle lol) Anyways I ordered it here and started using it for couple of weeks. First issue: I'm noticing more than usual amount of hair fall! 2nd issue: I see flakes! and it is clear that this shampoo is causing more dandruff because when I was using H&S I never seen so much flakes! 3rd issue: my hair seems to get really dry and thinner) At first I thought It will get better but same thing happening. I'm going back to H&S again :(

review/summary: Switching to Clear Men
review/text: Had never used or heard of Clear Men before receiving this bottle through the Vine program. I've struggled with Dandruff for years, trying everything on the market but to little avail. I noticed a considerable improvement after a few days with this shampoo. Further, when I ran out, I went back to a Gillette brand and the dandruff started back. So I'm switching to this brand.

review/summary: Does the job
review/text: In general I liked this shampoo.  It doesn't have an overwhelming scent, it feels good on the scalp and above all it does the job.  And I like the combined shampoo and conditioner in one.  To me, though, it seems a bit pricey vs. the normal products I buy locally and I'm not sure I see enough of an incentive to switch to it on a regular basis.  But price considerations aside it's a good product that I believe most people would like.

review/summary: OK, but there is better out there.
review/text: I got this just to try it out. I think it is ok, but head & shoulders men active sport works a whole lot better. I use (h&s) it mostly cause it feels like it gets my hair & scalp clean. The clear brand does a fair job, but I will just use up what I have & use h&s from now on.
