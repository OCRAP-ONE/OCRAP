review/text: Last time I checked, water based products such as Poop aren't really frozen at 62 degrees F.<br /><br />Personally I try to catch the poop in a zip-lock bag and take it straight to the deep freeze. This prevents freezer burn and that white crusty layer.

review/text: I don't know about you but there is nothing like a warm poo in your hand first thing in the morning.<br /><br />I don't think I'd even be interested in having a dog anymore if there wasn't the thought of being able to scoop up the warm poo after intently watching him give waste to his kibble every morning. How would I know I was still alive if not for the warm embrace?<br /><br />This product is absolutely brilliant but what about the fecal freaks... Where is our product?

review/summary: Evil.
review/text: These pretzels are evil. When my snacking comes to an end, I see flashes of myself laying on the unkempt wooden floor of an abandoned house. Scant beams of light burn between the cracks in the boards on the lone window frame, illuminating my tattered and orange-stained clothes. The sound of my body writhing over a pool of empty yellow aluminum bags, a half foot high up the empty broken walls, is quieted only by the echo of my cries of longing and despair.

review/summary: These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.
review/text: These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack.

review/text: I love buffalo wings; not just the heat, but the flavor! This product, while not offering tongue-burning, sinus-clearing heat, has good bite to it. The flavor--how can I describe it? It's very addictive! I can down a whole 10 ounce package in no time. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a hint of a bleu cheese taste in there as well, which adds to the whole "hot wing" experience of the snack, in my opinion.<br />My kids like these as well. I have to hide the bag from them sometimes just to ensure that I get my fair share.

review/summary: Maybe too delicious?
review/text: Snyder's Honey Mustard & Onion Prezel Pieces might very well hold the title for most delicious non-candy snack item.  A large bag rarely lasts a day in my house, which isn't a good thing when they're pretty caloric.  They're so delicious you just want to stuff a whole handful in your mouth and slowly suck the flavor out of them, crunching on the remains as you look like a mad squirrel.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say that you could eat these every day and not get tired of them.  I would replace every meal of the day with these things if I wasn't afriad of them giving me heart disease.<br /><br />Try them once and you'll be hooked.  I have tried the other flavors since some stores run discounts, none of the other flavors were anywhere near as good as the Honey Mustard & Onion.  Buttermillk Ranch is ok, but you can't top Cool Ranch Doritos.  Cheddar Cheese wasn't good at all, and Buffalo Wing was hard to eat (flavor makes your hands all nasty).

They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.  These have the heat and the vinegar tang of actual buffalo chicken wings.  I love them.  Unfortunately they don't last long at our house.  Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.  But that is a small price to pay for entrance into flavor heaven.

review/summary: Salty,Salty,Salty,Salty and more salty
review/text: Very flavorful, jalapeno is a fantastic concept for Pretzels. Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.<br /><br />But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag.

review/summary: Not the best Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels
review/text: Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  "Hot Buffalo Wing" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones.

review/text: I have read that Community Coffee is good and beloved around New Orleans. I'm a regular Kona and Blue Mountain drinker so I had tempered expectations but boy I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I like full flavored coffee and my brewing of choice is a dark roast through an aeropress followed by sugar and cream. The Community dark roast is very tasty. A nice full flavor with a sweet/non-bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Obviously everybody's taste is different, but I'm very pleased with this one.

When you can taste the smell of coffee beans, then you know you have great coffee. I got it here at a great price too. May purchase if it goes on sale again.

review/summary: Awesome coffee
review/text: I used to roast my own coffee beans to make the freshest tasting coffee.  But, ever since my local roaster upped their prices of the raw green beans, I decided to try this coffee out.  Community Coffee often goes on sale, and you can sometimes find it as low as $2 a bag!  At those prices, I could not resist.<br /><br />The coffee comes with a brew by date, and that tells me a lot about the quality of the roasters.  The bags also have a one way air bag seal to keep the coffee fresh.  The quality of the beans is 100% Arabica, and that's important for flavor.<br /><br />Overall, really good coffee, especially for the price!

review/summary: not fresh, no aroma, chicory flavor
review/text: The box arrived on July 22, the date on the coffee bag is Sept 30.  So that doesn't leave much shelf time here.  Thing is, most vacpac coffee has at least a 6 month shelf life, so that is worrisome.<br /><br />Opened the bag, no smell.  That in itself tells the whole story.  Coffee is aromatic.  You open a bag of bean, particularly french roast bean and you're going to smell coffee, even before you grind it.  It's the nature of the oils on the roasted coffee beans, and it definitely affects the flavor and experience.<br /><br />no smell.<br /><br />Brewed up a pot this morning in my cuisinart coffee grinder/brewer:<br />beans were not consistant in roasting, some darker than others<br />no aroma when brewing whatsoever<br />coffee turned out very dark<br />med chicory like flavor<br />coffee flavor not strong or rich.<br /><br />I've been playing with this coffee for a couple of days and after a while it's not terrible.  Compared to a stronger flavored French Roast, it pales.  But on it's own, if this is how you like your coffee, okay.<br /><br />I can't say if it's the blend of bean or if it's fact that it was roasted a long time ago and it's lost it's strength.  But it lacks a rich coffee flavor.  except it has that mild chicory backtaste going.<br /><br />so if you want a mild coffee with a hint of chicory, you found it.

review/text: I normally use Illy whole coffee beans medium roast for my Jura Capresso S8 machine.  Sometimes I use Illy dark roast which has a richer and stronger taste plus no aftertaste, but of course I can't always justify spending that much money all the time.  Then I found this Community Coffee Whole Bean Dark Roast.  I'm very happy with it because it is similar in taste to the Illy dark roast and is much, much less expensive.  I'm sticking with this product from now on.

review/text: Ever since I can remember, Community Coffee has been a staple in not only my family, but my husbands as well. We drink it, our kids drink it - it's a crowd pleaser. Since my husband can only drink decaffeinated coffee, he sticks with Community Decaf. However, every once and a while I'll buy my own bag of Dark Roast. I've been introduced to others in the Community family recently and have found Huehue Tenango and Cafe' Special are two very delicious coffees. There are many blends I still haven't tried, but rest assured I would recommend Community Coffee to anyone.<br /><br />Faithful Community drinker,<br /><br />Connie

review/text: This is a really great tasting coffee.  I brew my coffee using fresh ground beans and a press every morning, so I am a bit particular about coffee.  Actually, I am insane about preparation and quality of the coffee bean and I am always looking for the best bean with the best taste for the best price.  After reading all of the other wonderful reviews (thank you reviewers), I decided to give this inexpensive brand a shot.  Well, I am so very happy to say that it is delicious.  The aroma is full, taste is bold and rich with a very long lasting lingering flavor after the last drop has been drunk.  I am so happy with this that I became a subscribe and save member for it.  My next purchase will be the French Roast for my daughter, but I can tell you that I am going to be staying with the Dark Roast for a very, very pleasantly long time.  Yum

review/text: I'm on a bit of a Southern food cooking kick, so when I saw a great deal for this coffee, I jumped on it! 3 bags of specialty coffee for the same price as 1 bag of Starbucks is amazing, in my opinion. The bag is cute and more importantly, easy to open and close securely as opposed to some coffee bags. The beans smell lovely and my first cup was delicious. I subtracted a star b/c the bags are dated 12/13/11, which is not that far in the distant future. I will probably just be finishing up the last bag around that time, so it won't be expired, but I'd never purposely buy nearly expired coffee in the store--it just isn't fresh. If you go through more than one bag a month then I wouldn't worry about it--either way, it's good to support this smaller producer and put a little extra flair and "flava" in your day :)

review/text: This coffee is a great bargain. It is fresh, and rich, with no bitterness. I really enjoy a good, dark-roasted coffee, and was very happy to discover Community Coffee. People who favor a dark roast coffee should know that this blend of dark roast does not have a smokey flavor. Some people prefer the smokey flavor to their coffee (myself included), so I want to be sure potential buyers are aware of this. It still makes a fine cup of coffee, so I would definitely recommend that someone buys it at least once to try it, especially if they do not have it regularly available in their part of the country (myself included, again).

review/text: I expect my dark roast to be exactly that. DARK. This was not. It was a dried-out, light brown mess that wasn't even as good as Maxwell House. One pot was more than enough to come to a conclusion about this. We're using the remainder as lawn fertilizer.

review/summary: I've struck gold, gold I say!
review/text: It all started when I was working late at night, no food left, and no place open to get food in the building. I stumbled across a snack machine wanting cookies, but the only cookies they had were golden oreos. I opted to try them since I loved regular oreos, and they were the most delicious cookies I've ever eaten.<br /><br />Now i get the full size packs for at home snacking, and they're delicious. They taste similar to regular oreos, but are vanilla flavor. The creme in the center is still the same, so no flavor change there.<br /><br />The new packaging is also great, no more opening one side and having all the cookies go stale. You can lift up the tab on the top of the packaging, and you can see all the cookies in plain view. When you're done, just reseal it, and it magically closes perfectly and air tight each time.<br /><br />I haven't tried eating them with milk, or dunking them in milk yet, but I'm sure they're just as delicious as the regular Oreos. Another nice bonus is the fact that they don't turn your teeth and tongue black like regular oreos do. I always opted out of eating regular oreos in public because I didn't want people to think I had bad teeth, but these leave no marks or stains all over your mouth.<br /><br />Buy them on amazon, they're delicious cheap, and you cant just have one!

review/summary: Vanilla oreo... yum
review/text: For those of you who wondered what a vanilla Oreo might taste like, look no further. I love original Oreo cookies, but I also really like vanilla/yellow, and when this cookie came out, I tried it, and it did not disappoint. Uh-Oh Oreos (vanilla cookie with chocolate frosting) is also really good.

review/summary: Great fruit snacks, too bad they are soo expensive!
review/text: I bought these as part of a promotion they were having at our Costco over the weekend (8-28/8-29) in Lakewood, CA and these fruit snacks are great. The Tasty staff at the store wasn't kidding me when they said that 24 for $9.99 Costco promo was 60% off the retail price. I thought to myself even with ship and save I thought oh they can't be that bad, but the price is $23 even with ship and save. Now I wish I would've bought a few more of these yesterday to get my 4 yr. old through a few months of eating them once a week at preschool. I seriously hope Costco gets these and or they lower the price on them because honestly even here in the LA area where people don't care what and how much they spend on food I don't think the idea of $2.00 pouches of fruit snacks is going to last.

review/summary: Fantastic candy, stinky packaging
review/text: I'd give this candy five stars (great texture, great flavor, pretty colors, no corn syrup!) except for the fact that the packaging it comes in has a distinct chemical smell - very like silicone, but with an edge of something else.  I don't know if it's the plastic or the printing or what, but if you have multiple chemical sensitivities, you may want to have someone else open this up for you and put the candy in another container so you don't have to deal with the chemical stink.  FWIW, the candy itself doesn't seem to pick up the smell, so maybe it is the ink on the outside of the pack after all.<br /><br />I don't have MCS, but I found the smell so offensive that I dumped all the candy into a bowl and got rid of the packaging ASAP.  Just too stinky.  Sorry Tasty people, you make a great gummy, no question about it, but your packaging may taint the experience for some.

review/text: Being Greek and loving cooking I bought this ot make some dolmades. Now let me tell you, 90% of a dolma success is about getting good leaves. Best leaves must be young fresh leaves that grom on top of the vine and are cabbage-like green. The leaves growing on lower part of the plant are way hard and useless for cooking. Well this product was 99% these leaves. Even after boiling these for 1 hour they were useless. Do NOT buy.

review/summary: Best Bottled Beet Juice
review/text: Dynamic Health Organic Beetroot Juice comes closer to fresh than any other bottled beet juice I have tried. It's also a little more expensive.  When I am traveling and can't make my shake, I usually drink about sixteen ounces a day.  I have found the plastic bottles sturdy enough to travel safely in checked luggage.<br /><br />Most mornings, I add fresh, diced beets to a shake in the blender.  No bottled beet juice even comes close to the strong taste and intense color of fresh beets.  Even though they are only about one sixth by volume, the fresh beets impart a vivid red-violet color to the shake.  The color and taste of beet root juice in bottled products is pale by comparison. Lacking scientific research, it is hard to know how much, if any nutritional value is also lost in bottling.

I usually like the "Brazilian" caramel (not sure if that is the correct name or just the name that was given by the store. They said it was authentic); something cooked a lot and salted for me, intensifies the flavors a lot.<br /><br />The caramel from here tasted like regular caramel to me, like any other spread.

review/summary: Tasty, low cal snack - low in sodium, too.
review/text: I like cheetos, cheese curls, etc. but most are too high in sodium/salt and calories for me, now.  So I gave these a try.  I actually like these better.  They are low in sodium, low in calories, still have a cheesy flavor, and are not greasy/oily like many of the others.  No, they do not taste exactly like salty cheetos/cheese curls!  And on my first taste, I was not sure...but by the time I had finished the first (small) bag, I was hooked. Your brain just has to get over that "hey, these aren't cheetos!" moment.  Only 100 calories per bag (3/4 oz.), 30 from fat.  And only 160mg of sodium! Zero Cholesterol. 15g carbs. 1 g fiber.  Darn good for this kind of snack food.<br /><br />A 3/4 oz pack is pretty small for a big guy, but not too bad.  They're pretty satisfying.  The texture, crunchiness, cheese flavor, and so on all seemed fine to me.  I really like 'em.  Taste is very subjective, of course, but I think most kids would be fine with these and they are very definitely a healthier choice.<br /><br />So thumbs up from me for these tasty baked cheese curl snacks!

review/text: Not sure if they were ot not but they didn't have the great crunch the 'real' full fat product they resemble has.  They are like that product after it has gotten stale.  It looks like it but the artificial cheese taste, which never bothers me in other lite products, just makes it worse. If they could work on the stale-like texture I could get used to the taste. I am totally sold on the Snikiddy Grilled Puffs so there is no reason to ever order these again.  Big disappointment.  I can eat them so they don't get wasted but no point in spending good mney if there is an alternative in my opinion and I am a HUGE fan of lite snacks.

review/text: My family is organic and gluten free and we have found genuinely tasty snacks, but this isn't one.  The taste is not ANYWHERE remotely close to real Cheetos. They actually tasted like they'd turned. They don't even look like the picture on the outside. I can't even imagine how someone else WOULD like them so I'm really thinking the rave reviews are fake. Or written by someone who's never had a real Cheeto.  ugh. I may give them to the squirrels out back but I might get charged with cruelty to animals. YES, THEY ARE THAT BAD.
