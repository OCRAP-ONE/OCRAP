review/summary: makes a proper pancake
review/text: In trying to eat a little healthier I'm reducing my gluten intake (gluten/wheat may not be the best for arthritis/inflammation) so I gave this gluten free Bisquick a try. Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.<br /><br />I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.<br /><br />The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right.<br /><br />I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!<br /><br />The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more "plain" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves, and with either of the two toppings I had a very good, very tasty short stack. See photo added.<br /><br />My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but I'd rather buy this mix than other GF products I've tried that are just as pricey and don't taste nearly as good.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/text: Having been Gluten Free for the last 15 months, I've really missed Sunday morning pancakes! I've tried other brands and even attempted to "do it from scratch," but the pancakes were HORRIBLE! This brand is so close to "real" pancakes...you wouldn't know the difference! My non GF husband tried a bite (or two) and gave his thumbs up! It's back to Sunday morning pancakes for me!! Thanks Bisquick!!

review/summary: love the product, but it took way too long to get it
review/text: I was pleased with the flavor and ease of use of the Gluten-Free Bisquick.  I made a pizza crust with it, and it was pretty tasty.  I used the recipe from the Betty Crocker Gluten-Free Cookbook.  The crust was golden brown with a little crunch to it.  My teenager even finished off the last two pieces that I had been looking forward to eating when I got home from Mass.  He normally won't eat anything gluten free that I make unless it's cake!  I was very disappointed with the amount of time it took the vendor to get me the product though.  It took just over of 2 weeks.  I will look for another vendor from now on!

review/summary: Tastier than rice cakes!
review/text: I first discovered these wonderful Kamut cakes in a health food store in the Boston area. I got so addicted to them, that I have been ordering them by the case from Amazon (I can't find them in any stores in Southern California). The flavor of the cakes is much like the smoky flavor of Kashi puffed cereal. They are no fat, and high fiber, making them perfect for Weight Watchers who want a tasty treat that will fill you up. If I want them a bit sweeter, I put a touch of jam on them, but they are great just "naked". If you want less salt, try the regular puffed cakes. Also available lightly sweetened with agave.

review/text: I really enjoyed Green Mountain's seasonal coconut flavored brew but also put off that it's, well, seasonal.  So I began a search for a new flavored coffee and ended up ordering this.  The flavor is nice, subtle, and lingering.  The coffee itself seems somewhat uneven in grind, but using the Aeropress negates that.  Consider this my replacement.  Will order again!

review/summary: Beautiful in your mouth
review/text: The Kauai Koloa Coconut Caramel Crunch is amazing. I drink a pot of coffee a day and I was getting bored of my usual name brands. I buy those little single pot bags every so often for a change and they're okay, but THIS is some amazing coffee that I will be buying more of when it comes back in stock. The aroma is so powerful and delicious that I can smell it on the other side of the house. It's not cloyingly sweet and doesn't taste artificial, with a crisp coffee flavor that simply hints at the coconut and caramel. One of the best cuppas I've ever had.<br /><br />UPDATE: Since I first reviewed this coffee, I've tried 8 different other brands and bought an 8-cup french press for brewing a pot and an aeropress for the one-cup pick-me-up. This is still far and away my favorite tasting coffee, EVER. It's even better in the two press brewers.<br /><br />My only problem is that this coffee doesn't come in a whole-bean or at least in a special grind for french press. Even so, you're missing out if you haven't tried this.

review/text: I try to eat non-meat meals several times a week.  I tried this as a patty and as sausage pieces mixed in scrambled eggs.  Neither attempts were very successful.  It kind of had a sausage taste and it kind of had a sausage texture.  At this price, it is expensive for what you get.  My suggestion is to purchase non-meat products from Trader Joe or Whole Foods instead.  Their product tastes more like actual meat with a meat texture...especially the meatless meatballs at TJs.  If you do try the meatballs, the instructions say to heat it for 5 minutes--this is too long and the meatballs tend to get mushy.  Heat it for 3 minutes and try it; heat it longer if you prefer but I would not suggest you cook it for the entire 5 minutes.

Once I got back home from our vacation the first thing I did was order their faux sausage and also ordered the burger mix they have as well.  For any vegan out there who is disappointed in finding a good faux sausage that is also easy to make- look no further!!!  Also, this would be great for campers too :)

review/summary: Great chewy centipedes not too soft or too hard!
review/text: Amazingly chewy and addicting! The blue ones are nasty tasting though, a bit like washing up detergent! But, the other flavours make up for that. I even gave up smoking due to these chewies! I preferred to have a chewy in my mouth than light up a cigar, so now I am a non-smoker! Thanks Haribo! Occasionally, I puff on an electronic cigar, and am doing fine. So far, have not put on weight, but will step up the weight training if that occurs!

review/text: The item arrived in good condition.  We opened and the kids were all excited.  Unfortunately the centapedes were so hard the kids refused to eat.  I tried pouting them in microwave for 10 seconds.  Worked ok.  There were a dozen kids at my house so I put the bag out.  I found several around the house.  These were not popular with the kids.  Too hard.  I canceled this item from my shop and save account.  I'm not returning item but will not purchase again.  The shelf life was in 2013.

review/text: The package arrived slit open and the gummy centipedes were so hard that it would have been impossible to bite into them (not that we would, given that the package was previously opened).  They might have worked for an art project (they look pretty cool), but because they were intended for being eaten at a school event, I had to just throw them out.

review/summary: Yummy, But Tough
review/text: I checked the package delivery service twice daily and two days before I received my item, it was already in Missouri. Less than 5 miles from me. So why did it take an additional two days for the package to arrive? But, considering that I was expecting to receive the package on the 24th and it arrived on thr 22nd instead, I guess I have no room to complain. When first opening the package, I was happy to discover that it was the specified weight. Through the plastic the gummies appear softer than they actually are. It took great effort for me to take a bite into one of them. But the tough texture wasn't enough for me to be completely put off. I love the flavors, as varying as they are. The red and white don't taste as "soapy" as other people have claimed. I think the taste is just very different than what most popular candy tastes like nowadays.

review/summary: Not Bad But Just The Same As Gummi Worms
review/text: When I ordered the gummi fish I also decided to order this item as well to try out,  and while I found the gummi fish to be truly enjoyable the gummi centipedes while alright tasting weren't anything to shout about as they tasted just the same almost as regular gummi worms you can buy anywhere.  I felt the only difference between the two was that the centipede ones had little legs and some were different colors but in all that was about it really.  It's not bad or bad tasting candy but it just felt like why bother getting this when I can get the same thing with a 5lb bag of regular gummi worms at the candy store nearby.....

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped
review/text: The problem with this 5 lb bag is that it only has 6 different flavors, and they're mixed in set pairs, so there are only really 3 flavors. That bugged me at first, but the real problem lies within the red flavor. Red is traditionally one of the best tasting flavors in gummies. Even if everything else was terrible, you could always depend on the red to come through for you. It is a sad day when find myself biting off half a white/red gummy, and dumping the red  half right into the rubbish. Honestly, it is so ridiculously bad. I don't know how, I don't know why, and I don't know who's idea of a sick joke it was, but the red flavor is unacceptable. And it is even worse since it is joined with the white so you can't just take them all out and dump them without getting rid of another flavor in the process. The other flavors are all fine, but it took me a while to really like them, probably because I was still trying to eat the red ones at first. I don't even know what flavor the red is supposed to be; blood I suppose.

review/text: Out of all the artisan blends this is the nastiest one. I am not sure the term flavor applies. Unless you dunk it in something. It is not satisfying. And it is a bit on the spicy side because of the garlic. I have tried them all. Being a lime tostito fan I have discovered the three cheese artisan blend to be a substitute. Yeah I know you are thinking lime to cheese? Well the blend included not only cheese, but garlic, oregeno, red pepper, and jalepeno amongst other spices. It has just that right Wang to it and the flavor is li,e a super dorito. And of course the southwestern blend is also a great choice, but the flame factor increase on this one. Not too hot, but as a non spicy person I had to put them away.

review/text: After living in Japan for 7 years one gets cravings for certain items.  One day it was for soba.  With no local sellers I tried this.  Bad move.  This is very generic, run of the mill, brand X.  Nothing special about this at all.  Japanese cuisine is supposed to be subtle and not overpowering, but even by those standards this was bland.  Better luck next time.<br /><br />If you were going to eat the soba with tempura or onions or something else that imparts some flavor it might be good enough to get by in a pinch,  but for plain-vanila "zaru-soba" it's not quite good enough.

review/text: Ordered these for a macadamia-lover who thoroughly enjoyed all the varieties (including the Kona!). Tried the company's website first, but they were sold out. It's still worth the $ to order from Amazon.

review/text: This soup is terribly sweet. It tastes like liquid pumpkin pie and is very runny. Why oh why did Campbell's V8 discontinue their butternut squash soup? It had texture, tasted great and it was something I could depend on when I was rushed.

review/summary: perfect as a base for a much heartier soup
review/text: I don't know if I would eat this soup without additions.  Some Pacific Soups are made to eat right out of the carton (try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FYI6QY">Pacific Natural Foods Organic Soup, Creamy Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato, 32-Ounce Cartons (Pack of 12)</a> for a real treat).  This butternut squash soup has a very mild taste and lends itself to more of a soup base.  What I do with it is the following:<br /><br />1) Cut a butternut squash does the center, scoop out seeds and bake for about 45 minutes until insides are soft and removable.<br />2) Remove insides of squash.  I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SO8TJ2">Calphalon Seed Remover</a> so that I get all the flesh and none of the skin.  While removing flesh, empty contents of one 32 ounce Pacific Foods butternut squash container into a pot and begin heating on the stove.<br />3) Add butternut squash flesh to the pot<br />4) Add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. sage, 1/2 tsp. rosemary, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp white pepper<br />5) Add some apple juice, to taste<br /><br />The soup at this point will be chunky.  Use a whisk to mix contents.  If chunky soups are not to your liking, deposit contents of pot into a blender and blend until smooth.<br /><br />Top the soup with salted pumpkin seeds, salted and roasted butternut squash seeds, or sauteed apple cubes.  The soup would perfectly accompany some fresh made bread, wild rice, and a side salad.<br /><br />This soup is delicious, comforting, and perfect for a chilly winter day.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044QYG2E">Haribo TropiFrutti, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I just got these and read that there was Carnauba wax in them, so I was afraid that meant gluten, however a seach of Google told me otherwise and I decided to brave them.  After all I had just bought 12 bags.<br /><br />I gengerly bit ito a banana (banana flavor) and it almost  immediately melted in my mouth.  Then I braved a palm (watermelon flavor) and then I moved on to the pineapple (white pineapple).  I had to force myself to stop -- I am diabetic, after all, and had to be more reasonable than I felt, but OMG!!! (To quote a cliche my kids use.)  These are more than yummy; they are SPECTACULAR!  Treat yourself!  From what I could tell, no dairy, no gluten, no soy, just a YUMMY, YUMMY treat for my after dinner apertif!  YAY!<br />That and a great AMZ S & S price - - can't beat that!

review/summary: Different but fairly good, made in Spain.  Might grow on me.
review/text: The first thing to know about these candies is that they are not gummies in the typical sense.  I'd classify them more as jellies.  They are much softer than gummi bears, so soft that they would all be merged together into one blob by the time you bought them, _except_ that they have a stiffer "shell" on the outside to help them keep their shapes and remain separate.  That part works fine, and even in warmer temperatures they hold up well and don't get sticky.<br /><br />The combination of the stiffer outer shell and soft center (similar center consistency to sunkist fruit gems) make the overall texture kind of interesting, and I think it might grow on me over time, but I still prefer the good old Gold Bears I grew up on.  For a change, these would be good on occasion though.  They also don't stick to your teeth like Jujyfruits do, so that's another plus.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty good, and a little more interesting than typical gummi flavors, but it seems like there's something missing in the flavor mix, perhaps another tart flavor in there would better round things out, or a more intense flavor of some kind.<br /><br />Of the four family members that tried them, one hated them, two loved them, and I'm still kind of on the fence, so I'd rate them 3-3.5 stars overall.  Good, but not exceptional unless you have a particular liking for the texture and flavors, or if you remember them from childhood or a memorable trip overseas, etc.<br /><br />Also note that the packages I received (Aug 2011) actually said "Made in Spain," while the Amazon product description still says Made in Germany as of right now.  Unfortunately, it seems very difficult to purchase any Haribo products in the US that are actually made in Germany anymore.

review/text: This is the only fruity/gummy candy that I eat.  Very delicious!!  I can't describe the texture; it's not a typical gummy texture; it's not a hard chew.  Not sticky either, but very pleasing.  And the flavors are unique and tasty.  The green palm tree watermelon is my favorite.

review/summary: Reminds Me of Good Candy
review/text: Being born and growing up in Europe I got to experience the taste of great candies and chocolates (think Jelly Babies, Kinder Surprise, etc). These candies are of similar texture to Jelly Babies and the only candies I've found in the US that are similar at all.<br /><br />By all accounts these aren't spectacular candy or anything but compared to most US brand candies I would rate these 5 stars. They just remind me of my childhood and of great candies not easily available in US. Some people dislike the texture but that's strange to me because that's the reason I like them so much (they're just like Jelly Babies). But I'm surprised this is the only candy available in the US with this texture.<br /><br />I like them. Not as good as Jelly Babies but cheaper and easier to find.

review/text: Even though this product is not made in Germany but in Spain it tastes (almost) the same to me, unlike many other Haribo Candies produced in Spain that are much sweeter and have less aroma than the German originals. If you like the original German version you will not go wrong with these. And if you like any kind of gummy candy - these are definitely worth a try.<br />They taste very fruity, and their consistency is soft and chewy, yet not as chewy as gummibears are.

review/text: This was the first kind of True Chew that was given to me to give to my "new" 5 month old shihpoo.  These things are GREAT, and were the first chew that didn't make him sick or bother his tummy.  Like the last reviewer stated, I have tried a few other bully sticks and they made his breath absolutely unbearable, however not an issue with these :D!  The only reason I gave it one less star is because I have come across a few that had their ends break apart easy and my pup had to throw it up.

review/summary: A BIG hit here.  Just don't ask what they're made from
review/text: Oscar, the Toller, jumped (literally) on the first one we got him and he nursed it all evening.  The spiral shape was surprisingly a good idea because it gave him a good grip and maybe it helps to keep the teeth clean.  Regardless, purchasing one at PetSmart led me to order a bunch from Amazon.<br /><br />One additional benefit is the lack of smell when he chews.  I know because a few days later we gave him a different brand bully stick and OH MY GOD WAS HIS BREATH AWFUL.  JUST AWFUL.  Knowing what the bully stick is made from makes it even worse.<br /><br />These are great.
