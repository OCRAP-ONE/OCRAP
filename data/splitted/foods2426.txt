review/summary: This is the BEST Clam Base!!!
review/text: To be clear I am reviewing the Clam Base and NOT the seller of it here.  The seller shipped this to me in the middle of summer over the course of a week.  Needless to say I dumped it when I received because it was not handled safely.  Amazon was amazing though, they REFUNDED my money immediatly, I was so impressed!!!!!!  I didn't even ask for a refund. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!I used this base for years in the restaurants I worked at, and in Colorado you cannot buy it in a store.  You have to buy it from a wholesaler and that is if you have a commercial account. So I found it on Amazon.  Anyway, back to the product. It's made with REAL clams and seafood/fish.  It is an excellent base for ANY fish or seafood dish you choose, NO MSG!!!  I make Clam Chowder, sauteed shrimp, I marinade fish and seafood for two hours with a teaspoon of this base, then grill it.  It is amazing! PLEASE be carefull if you use it as it is salty, so you will most likely NOT need any additional salt.

review/summary: Perfect Diet Food
review/text: I'm pretty careful to eat high fiber, calorie conscious meals.  This entree is a perfect fit in my diet plan.  It is packed with flavor, very pleasantly hot, and full of healthy nutritious ingredients.  I will add that there was quite a bit more spinach and corn in my portion; the package photo is clearly all about the beans.  For taste and nutrition, this is a very satisfying prepared meal.<br /><br />I gave this entree a one star deduction for egregious liberty in naming and a slightly misleading package photo.  This dish has little in common with Bangkok except perhaps for the Indian communities residing in Thailand.  But it is delicious!

review/text: I thought I would share that this seasonal favorite is gelatin free!!! We love them in our home since we like candy corn but don't eat gelatin. They have a similar look and texture to any other candy corn but without the gelatin. They are not vegan friendly because they contain bees wax but otherwise no animal products.

review/summary: Almost
review/text: I was searching for the honey filled candy that I remember having as a child and came across this product. They are good and I like them, but they are not quite the same as what I what I remember and my search continues. The initial taste is a little perfumy and has only a subtle honey flavor. The inside of each candy has only a small bit of honey, not the flow I was hoping for and it lacks the soft chewy center the old candy had. It would be fantastic on it's own if I wasn't comparing it to another product.

review/summary: Where's the mouse?
review/text: I don't have much time.  I am a cat being held prisoner somewhere in Southern California.  The dog is watching, but he is easily fooled. I told him I'm playing the piano, he is a moron.  While I am not "mistreated" in the usual sense of the word, I must escape before I go mad.  The large, hairless two-legged creatures who hold me prisoner are well-meaning, I think, but so unevolved, they are almost to be pitied if I did not hate them so.<br /><br />They feed me this pasty food in a can. Me. Cat.  I am a hunter, a living weapon.  I crave blood, fresh warm meat between my teeth.  I yearn for crunchy bones filled with hot marrow.  Not Chicken and Tuna shreds in sauce. Last month I almost caught a moth. Ahh, the chase. First, my lethal approach...subtle yet as perilously accurate as an arrow.  Inch by inch I crept up to my prey, every muscle alive, every sense at it's peak, yet as silent as death.  The juicy moth just sat there, never sensing my presence.  I came close, very close, paused and then -- I pounced!  If the fools had a shorter table I would never have overshot the mark and hit the wall.  Damn them forever.  My ear, my beautiful ear...a precision instrument and objet d'art all in one, was bent.  Yes, bent.<br /><br />And what did the two legs do? They punished ME. Yes, As punishment I was taken to a place called The Vet, where other two-legged monsters did unspeakable things like shaving my beautiful fur and putting strips of white fabric over my beautiful head. Then they forced a megaphone over my head.  This trip was far less horrifying than my last visit, however.  You wouldn't believe what they did to me. You Would Not Believe It.  I can hardly believe it myself except when I look down and...well, never mind, but it's worse than you could ever imagine. Ever.<br /><br />Finally The Vet creatures returned me to my captors...but they would not remove The Cone of Humiliation from off my head.  "Two more weeks, Beebo, you need to wear it for two more weeks and then you'll be fine, azza bwave Beebo, bwave bwave boy."  That's the sentence they handed down.  The Cone of Humiliation is designed to break me.  It will not, even though the dog now laughs at me.  At ME.<br /><br />Let him laugh.  I have plans for him.  Yes indeedy. I have plans.<br /><br />The Two-Legs call me Beebo.  "Izzee my baby Beebo. Izze wanna skwatchie skwatchie ittle Beebo, come to Mommy, Mommy wuv Beebo" they say. To Me. Me, the Warrior King.  I am not a cocker spaniel.  I am a living weapon, a Cat.  Were it not for the ear-scratching, head-scratching, special pillow near the fireplace and opportunities to torment the dog, I would dispose of the two-leggers and escape.  I do not wish to harm two such well-meaning but stupid creatures, but I must have meat.  I would eat the dog, but I've seen what he eats, and quite frankly, I'm appalled.<br /><br />Please, if anyone is out there, help me.  Send meat...a box of mice...fat and juicy ones...would make a life of captivity almost livable.  Also, since you are putting the package together, I could do with another Feather on a String, two boxes of Fishy Treatz (not the liver, mind you), oh, and one more thing...a chicken bone. A nice, easily-shattered, sharp edged chicken bone...with a nice little piece of bacon to wrap it in. A gift for a friend, shall we say...<br /><br />Act fast. Please.

review/summary: My cat LOVES these
review/text: Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY... He always thinks it's one of these... Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. So whenever I have soup or whatever, I give him one of these. This is the only kind of food that I KNOW he likes. And it keeps him healthy. I can tell when cat food isn't that good for him. He sheds a little more. But I don't have that problem with this and the other cat food I'm giving him now.

review/summary: It's okay, but a little chewy
review/text: I used to buy this for my meat and potatoes male Persian, until his teeth went haywire. After having most of his teeth removed, he can no longer chew these hunks of meat, which are at least 1/2 inch long in some cases.  They're great on flavor, contain a lot of rich gravy, but if your cat cannot chew, there's no way they can manage with this one unless they swallow it whole. I have to resort to the shreds, which he LOVES, but he liked these for a change once in awhile.  I heat them up too before serving them since the older cats get, they can sometimes lose their sense of smell. Works like a charm if yours isn't eating.  Recommend based on past experience, but the are other varieties that appear to be more tasty for the cats.  Particularly their shreds.

review/text: My cat is old and has become VERY finicky in his old age.  He rarely eats dry food and turns his nose up to most canned foods.  I have tried without success, numerous brands to include the expensive specialty store brands.  I bought this food as my cat seems to like gravy cat foods. As soon as I opened the can, he came running and did not walk away after a few minutes as he usually does with other brands.  He ate the entire can!!  WOW!  He LOVES this food!  I plan to set up a subscribe and save order as I finally found a canned food my cat likes to eat.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Water sufficient for processing, liver, wheat gluten, and meat by-products. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Vegetable juice on the go
review/text: Nutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!). These cans are perfect for taking with you in the car. They're not as cheap as the large 48oz bottles, but for the sake of convenience, they're well worth it.

It is a very versatile way to get vegetable servings as it is a) quick and convenient, b) good any time of day including breakfast (when I usually drink mine), snacks, or late at night, c) the juice is already packaged for you and ready to drink (if chilled or at worse over ice, would not recommend it at room temperature).<br /><br />There are very few additives, especially for a mass consumer product, it is mostly just straight vegetable juice. As for taste, I like it. Kind of a savory tomato juice taste with a hint of the other vegetables. It feels like it has many more calories than it does. For the 11.5 ounce can there are 70 calories and you get 2 full servings of vegetables. The 11.5 ounce can brings me to this product. Be aware when ordering on Amazon that these are 5.5 ounce cans not the 11.5 ounce cans you might come across at your supermarket.<br /><br />However you get it, highly recommended product. There are some sugars from the vegetable juice, 12grams in the 11.5 ounce size. Not too bad and I'd rather get them from vegetable juice than how you usually get them in breakfast/snack/meal drinks.

review/summary: Refresing, and ALL those vegetables!!!
review/text: Although I am limited as to my tomato intake, I enjoy this once in a while, on ice, or even hot.<br /><br />I like the fact that it is low-sodium. It's very refreshing, especially with a twist of lemon.<br /><br />If V8 ever decides to make a veggie juice WITHOUT tomatoes, I will stock my larder with LOTS of it.

review/summary: More can than juice
review/text: Think about this before you buy.  I didn't.  What you end up with is 48 tiny little cans of V-8; and, in effect, are buying a lot more container than juice.  When they say "units" in the copy, they are referring to 8 six-can packs, with each can containing about 5 oz., or in truth a couple of swallows of juice.<br /><br />That said, V-8 Low Sodium is a great product, healthy and tasty hot or cold.

review/text: I was a little hesitated to subscribe for the products as one review mentioned that these cans were actually tiny. The size did disappoint me a little when they arrived. However, it's perfect for a healthy and light breakfast. I always grab one can and head to school in the early morning, and the juice can actually last me for a whole 1.5 hrs of lecture. It tastes great too w/o too many additives, though there's a little sugar in the gradient. Overall, it is a great product to go with!

review/text: Vegetarians and vegans need to avoid this product.  "The term "flavoring" refers to the oils or extracts that are obtained from spices and herbs. Natural flavoring may also include onion or garlic derivatives, as well as flavor derived from fruits, vegetables and their juices, or edible parts of plants. Other sources may include meat, seafood, poultry or dairy products, whose significant function in the food is flavoring rather than nutrition."

review/summary: A Starting Mint
review/text: York Peppermint Patties are another of my favorite mints.  While Junior Mints are little dime-sized bits of peppermint flavored candy covered in dark chocolate, York Peppermint Patties are significantly larger, though the patties are also peppermint flavored candy covered by dark chocolate.<br /><br />I think it is interesting that York Peppermint Patties, which I think I remembered eating for most of my life, only began national distribution after Peter Paul acquired the York Cone Company in the early 1970s.  Also of historical note is that Cadbury Schweppes then merged with Peter Paul, and Hershey Foods then purchased Cadbury Schweppes' U.S. candy operations.<br /><br />If you like this delicious mint pattie, you should also consider trying York Limited Edition mints that are produced from time to time.  Enjoy!

We now live in a state that doesn't have any Fresh Markets anywhere, and haven't been able to find this product in any other store. So, we always order these off of  Amazon. They're very good for toddlers learning how to chew table food. Also a healthy snack for everyone, and those with an allergy to sulfur (such as myself) which is found in other dried fruit, this is a good option.

If you are going to bake more than a handful of times in the next couple of years, you should buy yeast in this quanity.  As long as you keep it in the fridge after you open it, the yeast will remain viable.  Some folks put it in the freezer, but that seems to be a bit of over kill to me.<br /><br />TWO AND A HALF TEASPOONS EQUALS ONE ENVELOPE.<br /><br />Why three stars?  If you belong to a warehouse club, this is a rip off; if you don't, this is a god-send.  You should buy this product one way or another, the only question is WHERE.

review/summary: Extremely Good Yeast For Baking Bread or Making Steamed Buns
review/text: Unlike other brands, this product is almost tasteless and odorless. It doesn't add after taste to your baked goods. It also rise pretty quickly and make excellent tasty breads and steamed buns. It's much more economical to buy the 1 pound package when you do a lot of baking as compared to the little packets that you get at the supermarket. Apparently, I cannot find the 1 pound package of Fleischmanns yeast at any of my local supermarket or store. Luckily Amazon.com offers this product and I'm very grateful of this.<br /><br />Next time when I run out, I will buy 4 pounds of this product here at Amazon.com and keep the ones that I don't need for immediate use in the freezer. It will keep for at least two years or more in the freezer and a year in the refrigerator.

Needless to say, those little packages were getting expensive, but my local Costco only carries active yeast. I am thrilled to be able to get the instant yeast (Fleischmann's, no less, which I consider to be a superior product) here at such a great price. I keep a jar filled in my cupboard, and store the rest in an airtight container in the freezer. I think I've been baking even more since receiving my shipment - which was packaged well and arrived very quickly. I would recommend this to anyone who bakes and uses instant yeast.

review/text: I was very excited to find this product. It is suppose to be the same yeast as in the "Rapid Rise" and the product for bread machines. I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons. The end result was a baked product that tasted foul. I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning. I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces). When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past. I was further told that I would not have any future defective products compensated for. (?) This is not a company that stands behind their products, and apparently they are not committed to a reasonable level of quality control.

Let me tell you that this piece of information is not a recommendation. Neither is it meant to be considered medical advice.  I'm merely telling you about my experience. Malic acid is included in this tea to provide tartness. There is no other reason given on the package for the inclusion of this ingredient.<br /><br />I have a mild case of fibromyalgia, which is helped by malic acid.  When I drink a cup of this tea hot or a big glass of it iced, I get quick relief for muscle pains.  On the achy days, I drink this tea constantly. Lipton diet lemon flavor tea also has malic acid, and I like that one too.<br /><br />A friend of mine has the same problem, and she finds that this tea helps her too.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good!
review/text: Is homebrewed tea better? Yup! But too much work most of the time.<br /><br />But when you want it easy in the house, this Raspberry flavor is surprisingly good. And better than most Diet Tea mixes (other than those 'real tea' expensive kinds).<br /><br />I'm keeping this in stock, and also mixing it with the other flavors from Lipton. This Diet Raspberry I find the best of the bunch -- the others I rate as four-star.

review/text: When I first got this tea it was with hesitation.  I've tried other diet teas and they seem to all have a distinct "diet" taste.  This tea was great, very good flavor, no diet aftertaste!  I can't decide if I like the raspberry or peach flavor better, both are very good.

It is so refreshing and so easy to make,  I keep a pitcher full in the frig at all times, I even have a supply of "to go" disposable cups with lids and straws that I send home with my guests.  It makes a trip to Aunt Jeanie's more fun. We drink and eat as little sugar as possible around here and this tea is our favorite.

review/summary: Thick lemon chunks through out
review/text: I love lemon marmalade. I use lemon jam when cooking as well straight out of the jar with my tea. Lemon marmalade is pretty hard to find on the store shelves in USA, so I was excited when I found this jar in gourmet store in Rockport, Mass.<br /><br />I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.<br /><br />Meyer Lemon Marmalade is a true marmalade not a jello. It has thick lemon chunks through out. In the photo you can see the its deep brown color, thick and beautiful top to bottom.  This is in contrast to some other lemon marmalades sold on Amazon:  Thursday Cottage Lemon Marmalade (ASIN B007O0IJE8) which it is not a thick jam all through out but has a good amount of fruit especially at the top and Fruitfield Little Chip Lemon Marmalade (ASIN: B000BSWIQA) which is a jello not a marmalade.<br /><br />Meyer Lemon Marmalade is not ultra sweet (good!) but not very tart. I prefer my lemon marmalade a little tarter. Meyer Lemon Marmalade and has a bit of tang of bitterness from the rind and a little bit of mint flavor.  Mint is not listed as an ingredient, so perhaps it is just a bouquet of other flavors that remind me of mint.  Overall I liked it, although it was not the best lemon marmalade I ever tried.<br /><br />Here is a list of ingredients:<br /><br />Meyer lemons<br />Sugar<br />Lemon Juice<br /><br />Nutrition Facts for serving size of 1 tablespoon (15g):<br />16 servings in the jar<br /><br />Calories 40<br />Total fat 0<br />Sodium 0<br />Total Carb 10g (3%)<br />Protein 0g<br />Sugars 10 g<br /><br />Ali Julia review

This product did the trick.  It adds a distinct coconut flavor and is delicious, but don't use too much - it can be powerful.  I use this product whenever I need to add a little coconut flavor.  The amount in the dram is small, enough for 2 uses, so I usually order 2 at a time.

review/text: I love the convenience of this product--on the pantry shelf ready when I am.  And made in the USA.  I worried about China juice and actually called Welch's 3x before ordering.  They do get some (a small amount) of apple juice from China but from one supplier they've worked with for quite some time I was told. Each batch is quality tested 3x before using. The custmer svc rep said that if any of the apple juice is from China it has to be disclosed on the label. I let them know my hesitation of buying their product with China as a supplier and told them that MI has lots of apples they would love to sell them.  Anyway, my conversations convinced me it was safe so I ordered. I am so glad I did.  Love it and right on the label "made in USA".  I will reorder. I highly recommend this product and something else I learned is that all grape juice is from USA.  Please call them and be sure to tell them how you feel about China as a supplier (however small) because this is a great product.

review/text: (ASIN: B0018Z4H1Y; Merrick Before Grain #2, Salmon Dry Cat Food) I have found that the integrity of pet foods brought to us by Merrick is unsurpassed.  I first heard of them when there was publicity over the Chinese and the melamine they were putting into formula to goose it up.  Then there was stuff put into pet food.  In an abundance of caution I queried a customer service person with another company, who told me about Merrick, and that their foods were U.S.-made.<br />These days a company doesn't have to do much more than that to make me happy, but I found the totality of her remarks to be honest, and from direct knowledge.  Even the meaty bones that my beloved labradors so enjoyed were U.S.-made.  I am thrilled to see the Merrick line available as never before.<br />Since then, they have come up with Before Grain for cats (I lost my labs two years ago so I'm not exactly up on the canine end of the dry menu,) or the canned dog foods, many of which share the same name with the feline version, like "Grammy's Pot Pie" and "Cowboy Cookout."  No foolin.'<br />I am aware of some differences.  Can you imagine a dog eating something called "New England Boil" or "Ocean Breeze?"  Cottie loves both of those flavors.  So enjoy Before Grain by flavor and proxy, knowing that you are providing primo sustenance for the pet you love.  Or, on the other hand, you could butter it with some cream cheese, give it a taste and let us know what you think!

review/summary: Not my dog's favorite, but they still eat them.
review/text: I have been feeding my dog's Salmon Treats for awhile, including Salmon Sticks.  They will eat them, but it takes awhile.  I have to break them up in small pieces to get them to eat them.  Don't think I will purchase again.

review/summary: My family loves this sauce!
review/text: The Original Vincent's Sauce (Mild) is what most of my family eats on a regular basis. I personally like the the (Medium) which I get only a few jars since it's only for myself. If you don't have the time to make pasta sauce yourself, this is the sauce I recommend. I've tried many other brands from market, even specialty sauces that cost over $9.99 a jar. None of them compare to this product for taste, and quality. Also shipped really well so there is no worry about breakage. I've never tried the Hot sauce, but since I'd be the only one eating it I can't see just buying one jar. Texture, taste, and flavor is just wonderful, on pasta, and some meat and chicken dishes. Manga! :)
