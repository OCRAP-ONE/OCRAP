review/text: I wanted something a little stronger than the Dark Roast Pods and found that the Senseo Sumatra Blend Coffee Pods fill the bill! It is a wonderfully strong coffee flavor that is very smooth. I recommend it if you are looking for a deeper coffee flavor.

review/text: The Senseo, which is a great machine, has recently added some varietals to their coffee pod line.  Although superior to their Dark Roast, it still doesn't come up to the standards of really good varietals or even the better Italian/French Roast blends.

review/summary: Senseo Coffee Pods
review/text: I received a Senseo coffee machine as a present 2 years ago and use it every morning to make my coffee.  Amazon is the most reliable source for the Senseo coffee pods.  I like the medium brew, I find this to be the best brew for my palate.  I usually purchase 3 boxes at a time, each box contains four bags of pods and this amount keeps me happy for quite some time.  The coffee these pods make is excellent, with a froth on top.  I can only say that this is a great product.

review/summary: EXCELLENT COFFEE
review/text: Until we got our Senseo, we had never heard of this brand of coffee.  Now that we've had our system for a few months, it surpasses any coffee from our regular drip pot.  The flavor is exceptional, full bodied & fresh tasting & no messy grounds to clean up.  However, the pods are a little pricey.  We use them as adjunct coffee ------ regular drip for morning wake up, & Senseo for evening & relax time coffee.  You'd just have to decide for yourself whether the extra expense is worth an extra great cup of coffee ----- for special times, we do.

review/summary: THE BEST COFFEE
review/text: I found this coffee at - would you believe - Burger King?  Yes.  I tracked down the brand they served and it was Douwe Egberts.  I bought the Senseo coffee maker and have used Douwe Egberts ever since.  I'm not the only who loves it, either.  Whenever I serve coffee to guests they rave about it too.  My daughter's mother-in-law bought a Senseo because she thought it was the best coffee she'd ever had.  She drinks decaf.  You can keep Starbucks. It tastes burnt.  You can have "Blue Mountain" and all the other premium brands.  Douwe Egbert's is the best, bar none!

review/text: All right, we today became beneficiaries of a free coffee maker from Senseo, thanks to a generous tip from a favorite of my Amazon friends.<br /><br />But this brand of coffee packets that came with the machine is nothing to write home about. At retail, the packs cost about 23 cents, if we order enough to avoid shipping charges.<br /><br />The smell of this fresh-brewed coffee is fantastic. The taste is less than I had hoped for. I think I'll try Target's Archer Farms, as suggested by another reviewer.

review/text: I  recently tried Senseo's hazelnut, irish creme and french vanilla coffees. Overall the taste was pretty good -- rather mild. I didn't find any of the flavors that distinctive, however.  Yet I still maintain that for a quick, easy cup of decent coffee, Senseo is a good way to go.  And I'm the type that would rather drink flavored coffee than regular, so all else being the same, I recommend giving the flavor pods a try.

"the weakest coffee ever except for when I forgot to add the coffee to the coffee maker." I was really disappointed.<br /><br />After reading the package I discovered I could use two pods to improve the flavor. Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all. Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste. Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med. It was VERY, VERY mild!<br /><br />In all fairness to this product, I purchased these pods to use with my EZ-Cup in my Keurig. So perhaps they would make better tasting coffee in the Senseo pod coffee maker.

review/summary: Get the dark roast instead!
review/text: The Senseo machine shipped with two 18-pod samples packs, light roast and medium roast.  Excited about my new machine, I brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed, not by the machine itself (awesome!), but by the quality of the coffee.  The light roast was so-so, and the medium TERRIBLE.  I quickly ordered the dark to compare, and can now HIGHLY recommend the dark roast over the other two options.  The dark also works the best in espresso-like brewing mode, using two-pods with the 1-cup setting.  It's still not the best coffee out there, and I'm looking forward to comparing with the upcoming podhead.com pods.

review/summary: Great Machine - Horrible Coffee
review/text: These machines are great, unfortunately the coffee used in the Douwe Egberts pods is horrible.  I was going to get rid of my machine until a friend brought over some different pods.  I suggest spending a little extra money and buying quality pods - the difference is markedly different.  I personally buy mine from www.familyroast.com as they have a cool story but lots of people are making pods that fit this machine now.  For what its worth - I hope it helps.

review/summary: Full-bodied, but harsh!
review/text: Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system, and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods. Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee, and even though I'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee, I can drink that with just dairy, no sugar. I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee--and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee. It was so bitter I almost couldn't drink it. It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt. And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.<br /><br />The problem was, I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process (the Toddy's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter, less acidic, less caffeinated coffee than normal) or the coffee brand. So, I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods (2 to a pack, very inexpensive) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy. It tasted slightly weak, oddly; however, it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee. If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees, which I don't, I think you'll enjoy it. But if you have acid stomach problems or just don't like bitter coffee, I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo.

review/summary: HOORIBLE I WANT MY MONEY BACK
review/text: I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store.

review/summary: Senseo Coffee Pods
review/text: The coffee by Senseo is very tasty.  The only problem I have is that it is messy getting rid of the pods after you use them.  Clean up is the "pain."  You also have to rinse out the pod holder each time.  Coffee machines with the K cups are better for 2 reasons - easier to clean plus there isn't a "residue" flavor left from the coffee you've made.  I used a tea bag (following another reviewer's suggestion) and was able to make tea using the Senseo machine but it tasted like coffee.  This is the problem with all pods because the oils from the coffee remain.  I've tried other brands of coffee pods but have found the Senseo to be the best.

review/summary: My Name is Jodi and I am a Senseo Addict
review/text: Ok, so my cousin stole his mom's idea for a Xmas gift for me in 2004. I had lived with a bunch of roomies at the time, where drama ensued whenever someone used the wrong coffeemaker... out of the three on our teeny counter... Now that I am living in my itty bitty studio, I make my senseo coffee every morning. Great taste, nice foam. MMMMMMMM. Now be aware that if you want to fill a mug, you need to use 2 of these pods at the same time. So if you have a big ol' cup o joe in the morn, divide the total pods in the package by 2 to see how long it will last you. I bought them in bulk because they are not as easy to find locally. But I am really glad I did. Enjoy!

review/summary: The Best Pods for the best machine !
review/text: I have used the senseo machine for over a year along with the Douwe Egberts pods. I have tried others like from Java one but I must admit that Douwe Egberts are the best bet for the machine both from a nice fit and taste. Every morning I wake up and look forward for an exciting frothy coffee from senseo. What was I doing all these years with other coffee drippers? Simply a waste of time, material and not so good coffee !<br /><br />Also I want to mention that I had quite a bit of difficulty fitting coffee pods from Java one with Senseo machine. But pods from Douwe Egberts work like charm and are the perfect fit for the machine.<br /><br />Cannot wait to drink that fresh true coffee again !

review/text: "Someone gave me a Senseo machine, so I bought this coffee.  I'm very disappointed with the taste!  It's bland and dull tasting.  Too bad, as I have 4 bags now!"<br /><br />This was my previous review.  Since then, I gave away the Senseo machine, but I kept the coffee and use it in a cup of hot water I do in the microwave.  The coffee is actually good.  I guess somehow the machine flavored it.  Maybe it's because the water doesn't sit in the coffee for long enough.  Using my microwave method, I let the coffee bag brew awhile before pressing it and removing it -- very good taste.  Go figure!  Anyway, I'd recommend this coffee as microwavable bags.

review/summary: If you own a senseo machine you HAVE TO USE THESE PODS!
review/text: I have used a Senseo Home Brew Coffee machine now for over 6 months. This makes, without a doubt, the best coffee I have ever had. Honestly, I find myself hording the genuine senseo pods for myself and using Starbucks coffee in an adaptor for most guests :).<br /><br />Now as I am typing this reiew I am drinking a cup of the medium roast. It is full bodied without and after bite. The froth that is generated while making the coffee is 1/2" to 3/4" thick. I have found that using other pods decreases not only the froth, but often leaves a slightly sour after taste (many of the Java pods do this for me).<br /><br />You simply can't go wrong with any of the Senseo Pods. Truely, an amazing cup of coffee....does wonders for your roses as well! I ripped open used pods and spread the grounds on my Roses tree...It went from near leafless state to one covered in Roses within a week and a 1/2!

review/summary: Folgers is the SAME STUFF
review/text: It's a blizzardy night in Boston (we're getting 18 inches this evening) and on a whim, my wife and I bought every type of Folgers & Senseo coffee -- determined to figure out which one is the best, and then we'll just buy that one.  Just once and for all.<br /><br />Anyway, the results are subjective, and I'm not even done yet.  But one thing became clear to me and my wife: the Folger's Home Cafe (something like that) is COMPLETELY IDENTICAL to the Senseo Medium Roast Coffee Pods.  I kid you not!  It looked the same, it smelled the same, it tasted the same.  And the Folger's is a dollar cheaper (at least, at Bed Bath and Beyond).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not above paying more if the coffee's better.  I don't really care that much.  But it's almost *comical* to pay more once you realize that they appear to be the exact same product (probably some sort of mild roast Columbian, ground to a specific textures).<br /><br />Anyway, the Senseo rules either way!

review/summary: Nice, full-bodied flavor in these Sumatra pods
review/text: We normally brew a full pot of coffee in our home each morning as there are enough coffee drinkers to make it worthwhile. But in the afternoon, sometimes one of us wants a cup and it is not worthwhile to brew another pot or grind up the beans to make a smaller pot. That's what we have our Senseo for. We keep a couple different kinds of pods around to suit various tastes, and this one suits mine.<br /><br />These are a little stronger, and more full-bodied than the basic medium roast Senseo pods, yet the flavor is not quite as acidic as their dark roast pods. I use one pod for a "double" serving (the button with the 2 cups), which is (I know) not the recommended way, but I still seem to get good results. If I happen to be making one first thing in the morning and need a little more strength, I will use 2 pods and press the double first, and then the single to get a slightly larger and stronger cup.

She has tried several other types to see how they are, but this is the one she always goes for and always makes one of those "yum" noises when she drinks it, and, still, about two years later, often thanks me for buying her this gift.  (I know it's funny, but I'm just happy I figured out how to avert "the crankies.")  And, on Amazon, it's as inexpensive as I have found it.  Plus, they deliver!  I usually order a month's worth at a time and keep it in the freezer.  A coffee addict's perfect fix.

review/text: We got our first Senseo during their Drop the Drip online promotion in December.  My husband loved the coffee, especially the Medium Roast.  We ended up buying another Senseo for him to use at work.  I don't drink coffee, so this was the perfect solution.  No more making a pot and tossing the rest.  He can get a cup of joe or make two if he wants.  The pods were a little pricey though... at Walmart they average around $3.84 for 10 or .38 each.  Buying bulk like this, it makes them .25 each at the current price of $17.96.  They come each in their own bag of 18, so no worries about freshness.  My Dad also got a Senseo via Drop the Drip and we just sent him some Medium Roast because he loves it too.  It is a great gift for Senseo lovers.  He lives in a small town and never thought to look to Amazon for his Senseo coffee needs!  I think when he runs out, he will be on Amazon looking to buy the multi-pack.

review/summary: Luscious!
review/text: I just tried this one, too, and also the new Irish Cream and the Vanilla flavors. WOW. In short, I can't rave enough about the Senseo to begin with, then these rich new flavors come along. The hazelnut has just the barest hint of mocha, and the subtlety is captivating. Never thought I'd wax poetic about a cup o' joe, but I've gone from being a rare-occasional-cup drinker to a daily addict since I got the Senseo, and the new flavors are turning me into a 2-3 cup per day gal. These things make Senseo very easy to love.

review/text: Medium Roast is 'ok' and 100% arabica. In the dark roast it seems they added robusta in it . There are better European coffee (carte noire for instance) , but not available in US.<br /><br />Bought it at Amazon (as other reviewers indicate, At Target availability is random ....). You may try other brands , as pods are also available for Senseo from maxwell , home of coffee, folgers... .

review/summary: Okay but there is better out there for less
review/text: I used to have no problem with these, until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try (breakfast blend aka medium roast).  They cost less, are bigger, individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee.  Now I can't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms.

review/summary: Sensational Senseo!
review/text: After spending 2 weeks in the Netherlands last year, I was hooked on Douwe Egberts coffee and found one place in all of Dallas/Ft. Worth that sold it. Finally! America gets Senseo! The coffee I woke up to for 2 weeks and loved. The medium and dark roast are my favorites. Douwe Egbert is excellent coffee. Once you've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee, you'll never go back to American/Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores. Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down. For now, it's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland (package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro) than to buy it here in the States or online. Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY, the day I received my Senseo machine (tho it arrived without the free coffee cups) every year!

review/summary: I keep going back to the classic.
review/text: I've tried several other Senseo varieties but have found the medium roast to be my go-to.  My only real complaint is the difficulty to find these lately but it looks like that should ease up soon.  I still prefer the more custom coffees that I grind at home. (Regretting that I only brought back 2 lbs of Polcari's coffee beans from Boston).  I brew this at work with a Hamilton Beach single brew machine.  I'll drink the fresh ground at home and keep the convenience at work.

review/summary: Meeehhh not so good
review/text: I'm really not a coffee snob and only drink about 1 cup or so a day but this coffee was not so great. I do not like strong coffee but found I needed to use two pods for an 8oz cup and it still had a "watery" taste even though the coffee in the cup was very dark and appeared rich tasting. I wish they made a reusable pod for my Hamilton Beach model #49970 so I could grind my own coffee. I cannot recommend this coffee. Very disappointed. I'm going to try a different blend and hope for a better cup of coffee to start my day. Boo-hiss on this one!

review/summary: Good, but a liitle weak
review/text: I really enjoy the basic flavor of the Senseo coffee, however, I find the pods to be a little weak. Being a "serious" coffee drinker, I usually like a large mug of the stuff, and I expect a nice kick when I've finished.  With this product, I have to use two pods every time I make a mug of coffee, which causes me to run through my supply very quickly. And while it tastes good, I do find it rather a weak brew even using the two pods.<br /><br />I'll continue to use this product, because my machine calls for it.  But I do wish Senseo would make their pods a bit stronger.  Those who like a weaker brew can always add more cream or water!

review/text: I have been using the Senseo coffee pods for a few months now, and have been very satisfied with the flavor and the convenience.  For the first month I purchased the variety pack.  Then I purchased the Columbian, and now I'm drinking the Kona blend.  The Columbian and the Kona were the types I liked best from the variety pack, and I believe I will alternate between them for future purchases.  I now receive the Senseo coffee by subscription which I have found to be a good way to make sure I don't run out of coffee.

My favorite way to drink this is to take about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream (whipping cream) and heat it in a saucepan just to boiling and mix with a cup of this lovely hazelnut coffee.  It makes a wonderful, rich and aromatic cup of joe. Yum!! The Paris Vanilla<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBDKII">Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee, 16-Count Pods (Pack of 6)</a> is equally as good, but for you fellow hazelnut lovers, the drink I just described as my fav is worth trying.

review/text: We have been using senseo pods for 2 years now and love them.  We have tried other brands of pods like: Maxwell house, Folgers, etc. but they were not as strong tasting as senseo.  I have used Gevalia pods in the senseo machine and they work great also.  I didn't have any luck with the Gevalia pod machine.  We did purchase the larger water tank for the back of the machine which is well worth the money.  I also love the vienna waltz pods they are a great flavor of Hazelnut and Vanilla.
