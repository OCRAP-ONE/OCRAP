review/summary: Great Seller, Shipping & Price.  Don't like Cytomax
review/text: I used Cytomax for about a month and didn't like it.  It gets great reviews from the majority of people that use it & I beleive most of them are cyclists & long-distance runners.  I play hockey, do interval sprinting, & weight training so I thought it would be good for me. I guess it was okay, but I find for my type of training that Gatorade G-2 PRO Series works better.  I do NOT use the pre-workout or the post-workout G-2 PRO Series, I use just the "Perform" which is for during the workouts. I have other supplements that I use for pre & post workout. The Seller, Shipping & Price Get 5 STARS *****.  The product, for me particularly & my experience gets 2 Stars.

review/text: I read directions wrong and first batch so sweet.  When I put powder in bottle, there's smoke rising from the powder, not a good thing I thought.  It tastes great, but if it sits in bottle too long, the stuff will turn into gel, so that also tells me something.  Think I'll stick to Heed products.

review/summary: DID THE FORMULA CHANGE WITH THE NEW PACKAGING?
review/text: I have been using the tropical fruit for years. Still has the same great taste and exercise benefits for cycling, cross-country skiing, etc.  HOWEVER, THE LAST TWO 4.5 LB JARS I HAVE RECEIVED FROM AMAZON UNDER THE NEW LABEL ALWAYS LEAVE CLUMPS OF UNDISSOLVED CYTOMAX IN THE WATER BOTTLE NO MATTER HOW I MIX IT OR HOW MUCH I SHAKE IT.  NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST.  ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM?

review/text: First, great value for this sport drink and second, the tropical fruit flavor is good (even better cold). I used it to train for a marathon and I will continue to use it; I always feel great and keeps me hydrated on those long runs. Seems to give me the energy and hydration I need.  Also I switched it from FRS, which is also good but the citros powder on the FRS seemed to stay longer on your mouth, not this one.  Mixes very well too-fast with no lumps.

review/summary: Still tastes fine
review/text: I have been a loyal user of the Cool Citrus flavor for years, but recently tried the Fruit Punch in the new formula. The old formula Cool Citrus always had a bit of a soapy taste, but the flavoring was good, much better than gross Accelerade. I don't notice any soapiness with the new formula Fruit Punch, nor do I find it to have any kind of off-taste, which I normally notice with artificial sweeteners. I have always been a fan of Cytomax due to its lack of sugar in favor or more complex carbohydrates, plus the easy mixing. Many people swear by Accelerade, but the foul taste, pour mixing, and crazy amount of foaming have always turned me off. Looks like I will stay a Cytomax user with the new formula.

review/summary: Absolutely THE best athletic performance drink on the market
review/text: As a family, we started using Cytomax while training for a backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon, back in the Winter/Spring of 2006.  It was recommended to us by the owner of the local high-end bicycle store.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and the drink doesn't leave you with that cotton-mouth feeling that even water can produce, especially when it's hot.  I'll warn you up front, this stuff is addicting.  Once your body gets a taste of it, you WILL NOT exersise again without it. In fact, just the smell of the powder while you're mixing it will trigger a pavlovian response that you suddenly have the urge to go do something strenouos, and, you just want a huge drink of Cytomax.  Weird, I know, but true.<br /><br />About the flavors.  We've found the Cool Citrus to be the smoothest, truest, taste.  Sort of a nice lemonade flavor.  To us, all of the other flavors have some sort of a weird before, or after taste.  For example, the Tangy Orange has sort of a powdery thing going on.  The fruit flavors like the punch and the grape have a perfume thing going on.  We haven't tried the apple or the chocolate, and won't.<br /><br />I'll be honest and say that I'm not loving the "Natural" and now I see it's coming with "Stevia" as the sweetner.  Haven't tried the stevia version yet, and really, I'm not interested.  Personally, I don't think the "natural" is as good as the original, definately doesn't taste as good.<br /><br />Now for my "Cytomax Story."<br /><br />In August of 2006 we did our first backpacking trip into the Grand Canyon.  We didn't drink anything but Cytomax.  It was brutally hot down in the gorge, and being first timers, we not only brought a ton of stuff, but we brought a ton of heavy stuff.  We just about got laughed off the shuttle bus because our packs (especially mine) were so stupid huge.  Seriously, picture a Low Alpine 75L pack filled to the brim, to the point that it has to be bear hugged, lifted up onto a rock, and then backed into, in order to put it on! What can I say, we were rookies.<br /><br />The cytomax kept us alive and well, but the real story is that during the hike out, we came across a young couple on the Bright Angel Trail, somewhere below 3mi House.  As is typical for the Bright Angel, they were in tank tops, tennis shoes, no hats, and had come down with a 16oz bottle of water, each.  It was 100*F+, and the girlfriend was broke down on the side of the trail with heat stroke.  The boyfriend was talking about how he was going to run to the top to get her a soda.  She was angrily complaining about what she would and wouldn't drink (one of the signs of heat stroke is lack of good judgement).  I filled her 16 water bottle with Cytomax, and told her she could drink it, or wait for a helicopter.  She decided to drink, and in about 10 minutes her lights came back on.  We gave them both some snacks that we had, saw them one more time at one of the other rest houses, and I think they beat us out to the top!  Seriously, that's how great Cytomax is.<br /><br />We use it year round now, for whatever exersise or sport we are doing, whether individually, or as a family.  It's gone with us to the Grand Canyon, 5 years in a row, including just last week where my 70 year old mom went with us, rim-to-rim in 3 days, fueled by Cool Citrus Cytomax!

review/text: I was looking for an improvement over others I've tried. I liked this better than Gu Brew or the other two I tried (can't remember the name right now) I would say Hammer Heed is a little better than Cytomax imo. Neither Cytomax or Heed left that nasty film in my mouth, but Heed was very light in flavor and texture and no stomach problems at all<br /><br />I thought this size container would last longer. I went through it pretty fast

review/summary: Energy!
review/text: I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that.

review/text: I started using this product in 1994. Wasn't really sure if it worked until I smoked my friends that I rode with 5 days a week at a MTB time trail. Miss the heydays of MTB races. I use it on long rides by mixing 2 bottles. first one to drink from and second one that is 4X concentrated. beats carrying around a a bag of powder. =When Bottle 1 use empty I fill bottle 1/4 full with x strong mix. Again, I swear by it. Don't train or race wit out it. plus these prices rock! Happy trails and safe roads><br />Justin

review/summary: Good Hydrations
review/text: I've used Cytomax for the past couple of years now and have found it to be the best rehydration product I've used. Everyone is different but this product has by far worked the best for me at keeping myself going on those long or difficult rides, hikes, cross country ski and snowshoe outings. This also helps to prevent cramping and bonking on those hot humid days when your tend to lose more fluids. I've only had the cool citrus flavor as that is the flavor I've used for years with other hydration products as well, and the flavor though a bit sweet for me is more than acceptable. While cycling I always alternate between a bottle of Cytomax and one of water. For other activities where I carry only one bottle I use a little less the recommended amount of powder per X ounces of water. This product like others like it, require a bit more time to mix than the original hydration powders, but it's more than worth the few extra seconds it takes to get it to properly mix.

review/text: Here in Louisiana, we get hot during the summer. I started taking Cytomax about 10 years ago when I was preparing for a 100 mile ride. I trained for months riding longer and longer distances but would deplete my bodies energy. I would just run out of gas and cramp. With Cytomax, I was able to extend my miles without cramping. Because of the expense, I tried many other brands but for my body, Cytomax was the best.

There is not a better product on the market that literally and completely defeats any and all lactic acid buildup in your muscles. I would have paid twice this much too have had this product when I was still bodybuilding and powerlifting. Now my workouts consist of bike riding, Muay Thai, boxing and some light to medium circuit weight training. Cytomax never fails to alleviate the lactic acid build up from any and all of my workouts. I think it tastes great. These whiners are lucky they do not have to drink the swill that us older athletes had to drink back in the 70's & 80's when your only choice was Weider products or making your own shakes at home (which was the best option)

review/summary: New formula fails
review/text: I started using Cytomax back around 2001, and it was the most amazing sports drink I had ever had. Taste, performance, ease of use; it had it all. I read the reviews here discussing a formula change, and went ahead and gave it a shot. I'm halfway through my newest container, and it's just not working. The taste is subtly off, and viscosity/texture of it is subtly off as well. Finally, and I have no way of explaining this at all, I think it actually gives me a light headache when I'm drinking it. Performance-wise, I think it generally still works, in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts. But I don't like drinking it. All said, I will never buy it again. I will test out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054S4HMK">Accelerade Lemon Lime 60 servings</a> and hammer products, etc, and see which one is the best, and go with that. New formula fails.

review/summary: Works good, tastes not so good
review/text: Like the product, dislike the tangy orange flavor. Like the cool citrus flavor quite a bit and it doesn't have the herbal lift. Some reviewers comment that it doesnt dissolve easy in cold water. Easy solution: Dissolves well in a little hot water, then dilute to the preferred strength. Used on a 100 km bike ride and finished with energy left over. Product works well.

review/summary: This stuff is fantastic!
review/text: I started using this product after a cycling buddy told me about it at the gym.  It helps great with muscle recovery after a hard workout.  So instead of feeling just sore, I feel more loose.  I drink one shake about 15 minutes before my workout and this stuff just gives me the fuel to keep me going.  I highly recommend this product.  I bought the 4.5 lb container and it lasts a long time.  Just one scoop (scooper provided) is all you need.  The orange flavor is great too, my kids (5 and 3) always want a sip before I drink it down.

review/summary: Didn't work for me
review/text: This product did not work for me. I live in New Orleans and purchased this product with the intent of increasing my electrolyte intake during/following my Crossfit workouts. We workout in a renovated warehouse w/o AC, so it's hot and I lose TONS of liquid/electrolytes daily.<br /><br />I think that there are a few reasons that this product did not work for me.<br />1) I was using it for Crossfit, not bike riding. The advertisement of this product mainly states that it's for riders.<br />2) I eat about 90% paleo. There is simply way too much sugar in this product for my body. It literally made me exhausted because my body was spending so much energy digesting the sugar.<br /><br />So, I am not sure whether or not this is a good product. I have friends who love it who ride for triathlons and Iron Man events. A few of them use a more natural product called Nun (noon: not sure of the correct spelling), which they say is amazing. All I can tell you is that if you're like me and don't take in a lot of processed sugar...ever... this will send your body out of whack.

review/summary: Tastes great?  Really?
review/text: OK, let's start with the most important aspect of a performance drink - does it do what it advertises to do.  For me, the answer is a resounding YES.  Cytomax does everything the marketing department says it does for beating the burn and fast recovery.  I've been using this stuff off and on since the product came out, first discovering it in a local bike shop.  Once in a while, I tried another brand because of their marketing or the advice of a cyclist/athlete.  Every time, I came back to Cytomax; it's the only one that seems to do the job (for me).  The one disagreement I have with the other reviewers, and this is a matter of personal preferences, is that it does not "taste great".  Not even close to great.  Orange?  Really?  Whatever.  Tangy?  Pffft.  To me, it tastes like a flat diet soda. If that sounds appealing to you, dive in.  I mix it with green tea instead of water, my version of an Arnold Palmer, and it is reasonably presentable to the palate.  Use Luzianne Green Tea and you get the added benefit of antioxidants.  Yep, Amazon has it.  The 1.5lb Cytomax container provides 27 servings, or about 9 rides, so you may need to buy more than one.  Additionally, if you live in a humid locale, like I do, it has a short shelf-life once opened, turning quickly into a big rock.  Buy a size that will get you through a month.  You might pay a little more for three 1.5lb containers, but that's better than throwing away half of a 4.5lb because it soaked up all that moisture and is now useless.  Yep, I've been there.  Grrr.  Get the big bottle if you are an animal, share with others, or live in Colorado.  Where it's dry.  Now go ride!

Unlike others, the nice thing about this drink is that it helps to flush the lactic acid from your muscles -- the stuff that makes you muscles ache after working out and the stuff that makes your muscles give out while you are working out.  The different drinks tasts good and because you mix them yourself you can make it as strong or weak as you like.  Try this product.

review/summary: Tastes nasty
review/text: I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.

review/summary: Colored with insect soup! Carmine!
review/text: GREAT just dandy Frickin' Cytomax uses carmine as a color additive. Here's how carmine is made:<br /><br />To prepare carmine, the powdered scale INSECT BODIES are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum is added to the clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt, called "carmine lake" or "crimson lake."<br /><br />Carmine is insect soup. Yummy!<br /><br />For crying out loud Cytomax. take the danged bugs out of your mix!<br /><br />And AMAZON posts what appears to be a list of ingredients that does not list carmine.<br /><br />Cytomax, most of us are adults and aren't overly concerned with color of our drink. We are not children squawking about the color of our kool-aid being off and refusing to drink it.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about Cytomax, besides the bug soup, it would be the color is ridiculous! Who needs such a fluorescent orange color to drink it! It goes is an opaque bottle anyway...who really looks at it.<br /><br />Cytomax is another company that has over thought the entire deal and basically ruined an other wise great product.<br /><br />Sending mine back.<br /><br />W

review/summary: Engineered for Runners, Cyclists and Athletes of all types...
review/text: As a distance runner, I have been a dedicated user of Cytomax since 1994. It's smooth, tastes great and delivers an even dose of the right blend of carbohydrates to help sustain energy levels. More importantly, it doesn't leave me with a "sugar crash" the way that some other popular name brands do.<br /><br />The effect of Cytomax and reduction of perceived exertion/lactic acid buildup is evident anytime; however, it is most pronounced during summertime, when the body is working harder during longer training sessions. I would recommend following the product's directions to consume this before, during and after the training periods to obtain maximum effect.<br /><br />Before the advent of the Internet and E-Commerce, I had tried others that were popular and commercially available, when I could not obtain Cytomax. Even recently, I obtained a sample of the EAS equivalent, which was highly touted. The bottom line is that all else pales in comparison to this product.

review/summary: Cytomax, a runners best friend.
review/text: I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now.  I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough.  It really does beat the burn.  The percieved exertion levels, the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package.  I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep (i.e. 3-5 hrs) and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated.  It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates.  I have been encouraging other fellow runners, triathletes, cyclist, backpackers, mountaineers, etc to try the product and have recieved similiar feedback.  Many nice climbing/outdoor gear shops have the individual packets available if you wanted to demo the product.

review/summary: Bring back Cytomax Classic!!!
review/text: Remember when Coke came out with their new formula. It was a disaster for them. The company finally relented and brought back the original formula after losing significant market share. This is the same situation. I have been using this drink for years (Cool Citrus and Tropical Fruit) and I have been very happy with it. I am even subscribed to these mixes through Amazon's subscription program. I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption "Now with Stevia". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy.

review/summary: Not an improvement
review/text: I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars.

I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it.  That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else.

review/summary: Definitely reduces cramping while giving you energy
review/text: I've been using Cytomax while bicycling for about 10 years and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Before Cytomax, I mainly used Gatorade and I would often get very painful leg cramps on long rides, especially on hot days. Since switching to Cytomax, I get cramps only occasionally, usually when I'm not drinking enough.<br /><br />I mix 1.5 measures of Cytomax in a 24 ounce water bottle, which is less than the recommended amount. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that Cytomax doesn't dissolve easily, but if you should not have a problem if you add the Cytomax to a bottle that is half filled with water so that it doesn't clump, then shake the bottle vigorously, and then add water to fill the bottle. Before drinking give the bottle a few shakes to distribute anything that's settled to the bottom.<br /><br />Taste is the most important thing when selecting an energy drink. Whatever your choice, it doesn't have to taste great, but it does have to be acceptable. If you don't like the taste, then you probably won't be drinking enough and your performance will definitely suffer as a result. I use the Cool Citrus flavor. Over the years, I've gotten samples of other flavors, some of which were OK and some that I did like at all. So if you're unsure about the flavor, try to get a sample from someone before you buy a 1.5 or 4.5 pound container.<br /><br />On long rides, I carry two bottles on my bike. For very long rides, I'll also carry zip lock bags with measured amounts of Cytomax so I can refuel as needed.<br /><br />In Summary: A great product.

It's thicker than most sports drinks, a lot more like drinking juice.  I thought it tasted great, but the important thing was being able to stomach it on the long haul.<br /><br />It was noticeably helpful.  I did one six mile loop without a drink along from miles 15-21, and I crashed for the last 2 miles of that loop.  Some Cytomax and Oreos and I was recovered and ready to pick the pace back up in 15 min.

review/summary: Tastes Ok...works well
review/text: I usually carry a bottle of Cytomax when running in the hot Hawaiian sun...does a great job at replenishing fluids and electrolytes.  Works well as a recovery drink too.  Cool citrus isn't a bad flavor.  I can't say that Cytomax would stand on its own as a tasty beverage.  Nevertheless, it's a decent taste that's palatable.

review/summary: Great until they added Stevia
review/text: As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes.  I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach.  However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes "Stevia".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and "messed with" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.  It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products.

review/summary: Cytomax drink good, cranberry grapefruit flavor taste like medicine
review/text: Cytomax is a good recovery drink that doesn't have as much sugar as Gatorade.  I like the fact that it reduces the lactic acid build up.  I ran the San Francisco marathon and they gave out Cytomax.  After the marathon, I was not as sore as I usually am the day after.  I think it was due to the Cytomax.  The bottled form is better than the powdered form.  I don't like the cranberry grapefruit flavor.  Try the tropical punch or the bottled form of orange or citris is better.

review/summary: Best Flavor, little Salt
review/text: There is a misunderstanding of what drinks should include and that can be best answered by choosing the drink that best suits your sport.  Long distance, high intensity sports need calories, salts and proteins. Weekenders rarely need calories and salts, unless they live in a high humidity area and sweat considerably.  Salts should include potassium, calcium but little sodium.  Sugars in the form of glucose or sucrose should be added but not to excess.  Stay away from corn syrups and corn additives. Having said all that, most drinks that are low in sodium salts, and neutral on calories (sugars/proteins) will provide enough nutritive additions to you while you exercise.  Keep in mind that one of the reasons you exercise is to loose weight.  If you add a bunch of calories while your exercising, your weight loss will be for naught. Stay away from sugar bars and  caffeine unless your a long distance runner and or cyclist. This CytoSport drink is a good choice for the average sportive  who does not need to supplement their diet on a routine basis.  It is also good for the high intensity sportive when they also supplement their diets with high energy food while they exercise.

review/summary: THE sports drink
review/text: I have been using this product for several years since I discovered it on Amazon.  I have GERD (esophageal reflux disease) and I can't drink formulations that either have too much sugar or too much acid.  This drink does not set me off like some of the other flavors do.  I has a very pleasant apple flavor, that you swear is real apple juice.  I usually mix two measuring cups (included) into a 70oz Camelback and place it into the fridge for my next day's ride.  The drink will stay cool for two hours.  This product does have sugars, although not much.  It has about 90 calories per measure, which is enough for a good ride around town.  If you are a marathoner, then you will need more calories and may need to suppliment your drink with power bars.  But this is enough for us casual riders.  If you don't want the calories, then you can decrease your measurements accordingly.  This is the only drink for me and I hope they never take it off the market.

review/summary: Cytomax is a great product.
review/text: I have used every energy drink and mix, every refreshing drink and mix, every replacement of salts and minerals drinks and mixes I have been able to find.  I have searched the Internet and found many drinks and mixes that claim they can replace what your body used while exercising and or in some hot athletic endeavor.  I get cramps throughout my body when I exercise, play racquetball, or am exercising on a 100+ degree day. All other products have failed in different degrees and I would still cramp up at some time. Cytomax is the only product I have used that will keep the cramps away and keep me active and playing. For me, there is no other product to use.

review/summary: How To Not Cramp
review/text: PROS:<br />- Works to prevent cramps from lactic acid.<br />- Tastes good.<br />- Dissolves easily.<br />- Lower sodium than other electrolyte products.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- More expensive than water.<br />- Heavier to carry than electrolyte pills.<br /><br />As an avid athlete for the past 30 years (mountain biker, long distance trail runner, backpacker), I didn't need an electrolyte replacement supplement until I was diagnosed with congenital hypertension and had to take a diuretic along with BP meds. The diuretic did me in on hot, sunny days during a long run or long mountain bike ride. U suffered cramps from built-up lactic acid in my muscles, a new experience for me. I could no longer run 10 miles or mountain bike 20-25 miles without replenishing my electrolytes. Even eating every half hour with water didn't cut it.<br /><br />Enter CytoMax, which I initially received as a freebie at triathlons and races. What a difference! It works great! During the summer, I'll bring along a water bottle filled with CytoMax. Its sodium content is lower than other electrolyte drinks. Its taste is easy to swallow and refreshing, unlike some of the others, too. I haven't suffered another cramp since I started using CytoMax. As recommended by the manufacturer, I drink it 30 min into my activity, and then sip it every so often till it's gone.<br /><br />I've not have a single problem with dissolving or clumping using this technique. The night before, I add about 1/4 cup of chilled water to my water bottle. I add 2 scoops Cytomax. I add more chilled water to make 14 oz fluid. Shake ~30 sec. Refrigerate overnight. The CytoMax granules completely dissolve, leaving no residue using this method. The next morning, if it's hot & sunny, I might add a few ice cubes before I hit the trails.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE: It works. It tastes good. I'd buy it again.

The grape flavor is pleasant and dissolves easily.  Much better than the citrus I tried previously.  I will continue to try other flavors, but likely will buy the grape again.

I give it a 1 star for taste and 5 stars for how it works.  If they wanted to introduce a low calorie option then they should have created a new product and not change the old product.<br /><br />My solution for the taste is to add some sugar... tastes great.  Every 32oz of water I use 3 scoops of cytomax and then I ad 1 TBSP of sugar (2 if you want it super sweet).  Hope it helps you too.

review/summary: Really helps me - 42 year old weekend warrior
review/text: I'm a bit out of shape and getting back into shape hasn't been easy with all the soreness. A friend recommended Cytomax and it has really helped. While exercising I can do more reps than in the past and when I get 6 or 7 sets deep into my workout my reps only fall off slightly compared to before I was trying Cytomax. The other day I did a workout that I'd done 2 weeks before but this time I did not use Cytomax and the soreness that I am experiencing today is unpleasant to say the least. My experiment showed me that without using Cytomax I get considerable soreness the following day(s) whereas when I did use Cytomax I had relatively little soreness. Until I get back in shape I think I'm going to need this crutch. I'm 42 years old so that means that I experience a lot more soreness than a younger athlete. Someone younger and in better shape may not notice such a difference.

review/text: I'm not an endurance cyclist/runner, but I was pointed to this by one. I was looking for a carbohydrate/electrolyte product more effective than Gatorade, mainly for lifting, and occasionally cardio-intensive sports.<br /><br />I don't have any grand insight to offer, but can vouch that it does what it's supposed to do. I'm able to work out longer (~2 hours on a consistent basis) without experiencing symptoms of dehydration now, than when I didn't take this and either drank only water, or water and Gatorade (feeling mild nausea + dizziness past ~1.5 hours).<br /><br />It should also be noted that there's drastically less sugar/sodium per gram of carbs in this than Gatorade. This might not be important to everybody, but another of the reasons I wanted an alternative to Gatorade is that sodium is a migraine trigger for me.<br /><br />Cool Citrus tastes like soap, Tropical Fruit tastes like shampoo. Both of these tastes are mild, and between them I prefer the Tropical Fruit.

review/summary: Great Product ... poor followthrough by Seller
review/text: I have used several energy/recovery/hydration drinks in the past (Gatorade, Heed, etc.), and Cytomax seems to provide the best solution for me.  I play soccer regularly and am older (in my 50's).  Since moving to Phoenix I have found that I am pretty much nutrient starved and dehydrated by the end of play and suffer from lactic acid build up.  The night I play and the next day take their toll on me.  I've found that these effects are greatly reduced if I drink Cytomax during and shortly after play.  For post recovery I usually take in 30 to 40 grams of protein (muscle milk or protein powders) and find this definitely reduces post-exercise "pain."  I believe in this product. It also keeps my energy level up as I play.<br /><br />However, I recently purchased Cytomax from Direct Supercenter.  I made the purchase on May 2.  On May 9, I received a note from Amazon that no shipment had yet been made.  I contacted the seller through Amazon asking about shipment and an expected delivery date, only to get a request asking about my experience in purchasing the product.  Okay ... two-and-a-half  weeks later, still no word from the seller about shipping, so I finally cancelled the order (May 18). This is a common product.  I am greatly dissatisfied with the seller and will no longer conduct business with them.  As for Cytomax, I think it's a great product.

The GoGrape is a little less present.  They're both tasty though.  With the orange I use 1 scoop for training and the recommended 2 scoops for races and flavor is great - 1 scoop doesn't taste weak or watered down (despite actually being watered down).  With grape, unless I use 2 scoops it tastes weak.

It's one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee (which I like), for caffeine, and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout, plus ease the acid build-up in the muscles that can make you want to puke. Make leg and intense workouts easier. I don't see the point in having the caffeine in the drink when the caffeine will not really get into the system until your workout is almost done. I tend to drink some caffeine half an hour before the workout and then use the Cytomax during the workout.

review/summary: Taste Good, Not Filling
review/text: The one thing that I look for in a drink is that it tastes good.  I know you take that for granted when you buy anything that has flavor, but I have purchased some drinks that taste like swamp water, or worse.  All of the Cytomax drinks that I have tried taste good.  Now some exercise aficionado's will swear that you need this ingredient or that protein in your drinks.  For most weekend warriors and part-time athletes all you need is a good replacement drink without a lot of salt.  Being a heart patient, I need to restrict salt in my diet. While there is still quite a bit of sodium in this drink, it is not overpowering and doesn't stay with you when you stop exercising. A little bit of salt in your drinks goes a long ways.  The Cytomax company may not be as famous as some of the big boy's, but I have used they're products for 20 years and swear by them.  And I think you will too. The other great flavor is apple.  I really like that one.

review/summary: Cytomax Performance Drink
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G72384">CytoSport Cytomax Performance  Drink Mix, Cool Citrus, 4.5-Pound Jar</a> Cytomax performance drink is a good multi purpose sports drink for before, during and after excercise. It provides electrolytes without adding a lot of sugar. There are other drinks that may be better at energy or recovery but the cytomax is a good value. It's cheap enough to drink everyday; mix it in a gallon water container and leave in the refrigerator. It doesn't break down or get sticky.

review/summary: Acid buffering works wonders
review/text: I'm 6'7 with a very short torso, mostly legs. When doing weight training on leg days, I would literally get sick to my stomach after heavy leg presses. I suspected it was do to acidification of the muscles moving into the blood stream. I did some research and found cytomax. I don't think it tastes very bad at all, if you don't like it, try a different flavor. I start drinking it about 30 minutes before workout on an empty stomach, and it seems to assimilate into the blood quickly.<br /><br />I've definitely noticed that workouts are less painful, more productive and I don't get sick to my stomach anymore. This is one product that delivers on it's promises and then some.

review/summary: Sports drink replacement!
review/text: I started drinking cytomax at a friend's recommendation and I've never gone back to gatorade or the similar drinks.  The first thing I noticed is that its not packed with the high fructose corn syrup that's found in so many popular drinks.  Keeps me going through hours of workout or basketball with the same hydration as gatorade, if not better.  And as you're mixing it yourself at home, it ends up costing a lot less as well.

review/summary: Great Flavor- Throw out the Gels
review/text: This flavor is the best I have tried so far and I do not get sick of drinking it.  Almost through my first 4.5 lbs and ready to reorder.  Other flavor tried was orange which did nothing for me.  If you use cytomax you will not need to wash down those clumpy gels.  Try mixing two bottles and freezing one of them.  It is a tasty treat about one hour into a long bike ride.

review/summary: It does what it says
review/text: I have used this product for about 9 months now. I got it originally for high-altitude hikes in the backcountry during the winter months. It allowed me to ride and hike longer than originally.<br /><br />In the gym it works very well too. I am in the gym around 6am and it will help you get through a hard workout and even maybe let you work harder than you want at times because the lactic acid isn't building up as quick.<br /><br />I believe it is a wonderful product. I have tried both the tangy orange and lemonade. Both taste great but prefer the lemonade because it's a bit more subtle in taste.

review/text: Cytomax really helps cut the burn and gives you more energy during work outs, and helps with recovery afterwards. Great for those returning to a regular workout routine after a layoff. Tangy Orange is low-cal and tastes great.

review/summary: Better than Gatorade!
review/text: I love to cycle, and I love to go long distances.  I have always hated the way Gatorade/Powerade/ect. tastes.  It tastes too sweet, too salty, and unless I was extremely dehydrated I have always prefered water.  Cytomax does exactly what it says it does, it does cut the burn, and definately helps you even out your peformance in those longer workouts.  Best of all it tastes pretty good.  I have no complaints in the taste, and I love the boost to the performance I receive.

review/summary: Cytomax is very misleading in stating and not stating ingredients
review/text: I just canceled an order for Cytomax because after researching it more on various sites, including their own, I find Cytomax to be very misleading concerning ingredients in their product.  I contacted their customer service department and the words "herbal lift" mean caffeine.  Why don't they just say what it is....caffeine?  Why do they hide the fact that certain flavors have caffeine in them?  Reason:  Some people won't buy sports drinks with caffeine in them.....me being one of those people.  Some flavors contain guarana extract.  Look it up...it has a very high caffeine content.  In summary, I simply don't trust Cytomax as a company.  If I have to search for the truth, it's the same as them not telling the truth to me.  To try to bring my impressions to conclusion, I called Cytomax on the number listed on their website and their customer service people are very evasive or not able to address my questions about what is in their product to back up their anecdotal evidence listed on their website.  They transferred me to their sales manager who is an "avid cyclist", got voicemail and no return phone call.  If you want to know what you're really putting in your body, don't buy Cytomax.
