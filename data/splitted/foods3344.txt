review/summary: Easy to make and mMm delicious!
review/text: I love curry. It's so simple and tastes delicious with rice, some vegetables (carrots, potatoes), and meat. The packaging says that beef is the recommended meat, but chicken, pork, and other meats also tastes good with this Rendang Curry. With my Asian heritage, I was skeptical at first regarding the "authentic" taste, but I am thoroughly convinced that Prima Taste has done a wonderful job creating a delicious, easy-to-make Rendang Curry. The curry is fresh, has the perfect blend of spices, and all the ingredients are combined just right.<br /><br />For about one box (One Rendang paste pouch and one coconut mix pouch), I was able to serve between 3-4 people.<br /><br />Here are some of the ingredients that I added to curry (One 12.7 ounce box):<br />1) 1 - 2 cups of carrots<br />2) 3 - 4 potatoes<br />3) About 16 ounces of chicken breast<br /><br />I'm drooling just typing this out.<br /><br />Served with rice, carrots, potatoes, and your choice of meat, you've got yourself a delicious dinner. Amazing Rendang Curry sauce kit. Well done, Prima taste.<br /><br />P.S. Make sure you eat this with couple or several other people. Not that one could eat this by themselves, but the curry is VERY hearty and has a large percentage of daily intake of saturated fat in one 12.7 ounce box. Cheers

review/summary: Yummy Singapore Cuisine
review/text: We have enjoyed Rendang Curry before at restaurants, but never prepared it at home. This product is as good or better than any restaurant version we have experienced. In the box are two pouches, one with the Rendang paste, and the other a dry coconut pre-mix.  You just cook up 28 onces of thinly sliced beef tenderloin (we used tri-tip)and then stir in the content of the two pouches along with 4/5 cup water. Done!  We served our Rendang Curry over a bed of brown rice.  I would have given this product 5 stars but there were two things that detracted from giving it the highest marks.  First, I felt the instructions were a little to simple and lacked some needed detail.  I also found that 4/5 cup of water was a little strange.  Who measures in fifths? I actually found that I needed to add just a little more water to make enough sauce. Second, the mix contains chunks lemon grass, which are woody.  I kept having to remove these woody chunks from my mouth during the meal.  My wife on the other hand ate them.  But, I didn't like that aspect of the meal.  Otherwise, this was a very easily prepared and enjoyable dining-in experience. Yummy!

review/summary: Great Curry At Home!
review/text: This is probably hands down the best curry I have ever made at home from a kit. I made it using Tofu instead of beef and it was still amazing.  We loved how easy it was to make and how great it smelled. The biggest negative was when we opened the box the packaging inside looked like an MRE. When you opened the packages to add to your pan/pot it still looked like MRE type food, but once it started cooking it started to look like and smell like a real meal.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to make<br />Doesn't take long<br />Tastes great! Tastes like something you would pay fifteen dollars for at a restaurant.<br />Smells wonderful<br /><br />Cons:<br />Looks like an MRE when you open the box and still looks like one when you are pouring out the contents.<br />The powdered milk is a pain to mix in and keep from clumping.<br /><br />My final thought, everyone should give this curry a try! Our family is actually going to try some of the other options that Prima Taste has soon and if they are even half as good as this one then we will have some great meals.

review/summary: No Problems with Coconut Powder If Done Right
review/text: If you're cooking for two, I suggest using only half of the coconut and curry sauce packets. The biggest headache was trying to figure out what the heck is half of a 4/5 cup of water. Clearly the instructions are British in terms of measurements. I guessed that halving it amounts to just under a 1/2 cup of water. As for meat, I had a nearly 1 lb. package of beef. I didn't want to end up with too much sauce and not enough meat, which some reviewers here seemed to have gotten stuck with.<br /><br />If you want to make sure the coconut powder melts, make sure your saucepan is very hot. I did this by first stir-frying some vegetables (onions, mushrooms, whatever) using a non-stick cooking spray (less fat) then used that same pan to fry the meat (this time adding veggie oil). Once the meat was almost done, I put it aside and the poured the coconut and water together. Since the pan was already very hot from frying the meat AND the veggies, the coconut powder melted easily with the water. No grains left whatsoever. I added the paste and it didn't take long to boil. Then I poured the veggies and meat into the sauce and mixed it up together.<br /><br />Tip: some reviewers have commented that the paste sticks to the inside of the foil packet. For the stuck paste, I used a narrow silicone spatula, the kind you use for frosting cakes. It removed a lot of it easily and cleanly.<br /><br />The rice was done, and so I just added it all together. It wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be, which I fear may be due to my adding too much water :( Still, it had lots of complex flavors in it. The package says to use any leftover sauce packets within 3 days, so I look forward to making another meal out of it pretty soon. Either way the taste was very pleasing, and I would buy it again.

review/summary: Fast, tasy, and a great alternative to standard boxed meals.
review/text: Just-add-meat style box meals are great for a hectic work week when food needs to get on the table quick, but there's only so many times Hamburger Helper or broccoli and chicken casseroles can be eaten before they get boring.  Prima Taste's Rendang Curry kit spices up your fast meal options by throwing in the taste of Singapore style cuisine.<br /><br />The meal is easy and quick to cook, only requiring you to brown beef before throwing in the Rendang paste and coconut seasoning.  The seasoned beef and sauce mixture is fantastic over rice or pasta, and throwing in any of a variety of vegetables makes it more of a complete meal.<br /><br />Although a curry, this particular meal isn't spicy at all and shouldn't scare off anyone who doesn't like food overly hot.  In fact the end result is a very subtle and pleasant flavor.  Personally I'm not a fan of sweet foods that should be savory (Pineapple on pizza?  Utter blasphemy.) but the level of coconut flavor is perfectly balanced and doesn't make the dish too sweet.  This boxed meal is highly recommended if you want to try something different from the norm that's still a snap to prepare for a family.

review/summary: Lick The Plate Delicious!
review/text: What a delight this product is! Just mix the two pouches included in the box with water, bring to a boil, and add some cooked pieces of beef (or chicken, vegetables, whatever). The resulting dish tastes like restaurant quality! The Rendang Curry sauce is a perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and a bit exotic - not too challenging for the timid eater, but not unrewarding for those who like new tastes. And I wasn't kidding about licking the plate afterwards (and the spoon I stirred things with, and the pan I cooked everything in). Seriously delicious!<br /><br />The only reason that I've knocked off one star is that some of the larger bits of herbs and spices are tough to chew and are a distraction. Not enough to be a real problem, but it's a bit annoying to be chewing away at a piece of dried leaf when you're anxious for the next bite of meat and sauce.<br /><br />The box is labeled as "family size" and that's no lie - you can add plenty of meat and veggies and have ample sauce. I'm definitely going to make this a staple in my pantry!

review/text: I wanted to cook something fun and easy this weekend for my friends and I, so I decided to take a chance and order this Curry Kit and wasn't disappointed.  Was able to prepare while talking, getting drinks, answering the door, etc. and came out tasting amazing.  Although you could use just about anything, I used a whole onion, a pasilla pepper, a full skinless chicken breast, and for spice I used a small amount of Sriracha "Rooster" sauce as well.  Came out great!

review/summary: Ten stars! Restaurant quality, incredibly good!!
review/text: I loved this so much that I am actually writing this review while EATING it!!<br /><br />To begin, I have never had really great curry. It's usually too grainy or too cheap-spice flavored or too sweet. But I love the smell of curry and I have had good curry at vendors etc. Well, this is by far my favorite of all time! It's so good, you could serve this to friends, to impress your boss at dinner, for a romantic evening (okay, it's still curry...) or just to enjoy a night off. The absolute only issue I have with it is the stalks/leaves that are in it. I found them super tasty, but tough and distracting to the dish. I would suggest pulling them out as I did, easy enough.<br /><br />The flavor is just the best curry. It doesn't taste like a quick 'I want restaurant curry at home..." at all. This could be some very expensive take out. It's super quick to make. I used beef and cooked it up to pretty much done. Then finished the sauce, which thickened up almost instantly. Personally, next time I'm using chicken or tofu or may just make the sauce alone! It's a bit spicy, my super-sensative hubby thought it was borderline too spicy, but he ate an entire bowl nonetheless.  It's got an almost fruity side note in the flavor, just the right amount of sweetness. Also, it has this wonderful texture and thickness! Not too runny, covers my jasmine rice well but not thick.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the Prima Taste Rendang Curry sauce kit. Let's just say that I am going to try their entire line of kits.

review/summary: Very tasty, very different
review/text: I was intrigued.  I had never tasted food from Singapore before and couldn't resist.  It was exceedingly simple to make, with easy instructions only made a bit puzzling by odd measurements:  28 ounces of beef is specified, along with 4/5 cup water (does anyone actually have a measuring cup for fifths?).  I just purchased a piece of meat in that general range without worrying too much about it and cut it up into bite-size chunks (the instructions specified one centimeter) and browned it.  Then I removed the meat from the pan.  The next instruction was to add 4/5 cup water, which I just estimated.  It's not important.  You can cook it off or add more if needed.  I stirred in the coconut milk powder -- no problems with clumps.  I added the paste.  When that was boiling nicely, I added the meat back in.  It was all done in no time at all.<br /><br />I served it with some jasmine rice and some mixed vegetables.  Not being familiar with Singapore cuisine, I wish the package had offered some suggestions for sides.  I went to the website hoping it would offer suggestions, but no.<br /><br />The package makes about five adult-size portions.  Leftovers stored and rewarmed well.<br /><br />Taste?  Well, it is different.  How can I describe it?  The first taste is sweet, but like many curries, the flavors change in your mouth.  The sweetness is not very noticeable after that first bite and you can taste the other flavors blending.  It is quite tasty and we all enjoyed it.  It is mildly spicy, and it left just a slight tingle in my mouth.<br /><br />Our general opinion was that it was very good.  It's not something we will be eating every week, or even every month.  But when you are tired of the same old same old, it's a pleasant change, and the fact that it is so very easy to make is a plus.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, the Amazon page says the product contains "Crustaceans, Tree nuts.  Manufactured on equipment that also process peanutes, sesame, fish, soy beans, wheat, milk and egg products."  In fact, the actual package says only that the product is manufactured on equipment that processes crustaceans and the other items.  I did not read the Amazon page before eating this product and was not aware of the crustaceans notice; I am allergic and would not have eaten it if I had read the Amazon page.  However, I had no allergy problems with this product whatsoever.<br /><br />Update:  June 2012<br /><br />I have fixed this many more times since the initial review and recommended it to several people.  This stuff is addictive.  I have serious cravings.  It's that good.

The spice factor, for me, was only medium. I fought the urge to add a fresh chili, more spices.<br />cook the beef slowly, with some broth, before adding the packets. I enjoyed it over rice.<br />Will buy for camping this summer.

I always feel that spices should enhance the flavor of the original product and not be over-bearing. Such is the delicate balance of this Curry sauce kit. Usually curry often falls in the over-bearing department ; not so with this kit.The balance was very satisfying and enhanced our meal.

review/summary: Made a Curry Convert!
review/text: I have never been a huge fan of curry.  I think it has more to do with my taste buds being drowned in Italian food most of my life, but I continue to enjoy the cuisines of the world.  I received a package of the Prima Taste of Rendang Curry and found it to be a perfect match for the stew beef that was slow cooked.  One of the things that sold me was that the sauce has a slightly sweet taste, which cut the feeling of the curry being its usual overpowering self for me.  I will definitely purchase more of this in the future.

review/summary: Satisfactory but hardly amazing
review/text: Caveat: As a vegetarian, I ate this dish prepared with tofu rather than beef. Maybe that mattered more with this sauce than it would with others. But it was OK, without any special or redeeming qualities. The preparation was certainly easy, though that 4/5 of a cup of water (with the instruction printed in 2 point type) stumped me...what measuring cup comes in fifths? I got out a magnifying glass to be sure that's what they wanted. But the flavor just didn't punch as I thought it should, and there was a vague chemical flavor way in the back that left me unimpressed. A bit of tang and hot, but I've had better mixes and far better sauces. Shared with my son and grandson, and their feelings were the same.

review/summary: Curry in a hurry.
review/text: I love curry, in its many different forms and preparations. I love the powdery yellow curry, Red Curry, Green Curry, Massaman Curry...Indian, Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, South African...and in the case of this product...Rendang Curry, which is Indonesian.<br /><br />Rendang is traditionally made with coconut milk, galangal, tumeric, ginger root, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chilis, and other spices. Making this dish usually takes hours, but with this box you can cut down that time a bit.<br /><br />You brown your meat, whether its lamb or beef, pour in the curry mixture (which I added coconut milk to instead of water like other reviewers) then cook for another 15 to 20 minutes and let it get all married together and smelling magnificent. And although this is an Indonesian dish I paired it with Jasmine rice to bring out more flavors and add another aromatic layer. I also recommend serving with some cold sides like chopped tomato, cucumber, carrot, and red onion.

review/text: This was dinner last night and it was delicious!<br /><br />My family made it with beef as suggested. The ingredients were very easy to follow and it ended up tasting fantastic. We typically visit and Indian restaurant once or twice a month for the curry and we all agreed that this product was a great replacement for the curry fix that we need.<br /><br />When I think of buying a boxed dinner I get nightmares of the days of hamburger helper but Prima Tasting has created a product that is simple yet still delicious.<br /><br />I would purchase this product again especially because I would like to make this dish with mutton. If you like curry but do not have the time to build the flavor profiles over a few hours consider picking up the Prima Tasting kit. I would recommend that if you are not familiar with curry that you use more beef, pork, chicken, or mutton than recommended on the side of the box. This will dilute a bit the potent spices. The spice kit is a bit heavy with cumin but when I usually order at an Indian style restaurant I would ask them to go light on the spices so this might be a personal preference of mine.

review/summary: So flavorful it can easily be stretched to flavor more meat
review/text: Normally, when I review a product, I'm careful to use it as specified. This time, I made an exception. The reason is because I love curries, especially Indonesian curries, but I'm currently following a low-carbohydrate regimen, and most premade curries are a little too carb-heavy -- including this one. It's got a fair amount of sugar in the ingredients, so the whole box contains 75 grams of carbs, which is a lot for 28 oz of meat, the amount of meat specified on the box.<br /><br />But I just *had* to try this curry. So my solution was to make a lot more meat, thus stretching the sauce so each serving had less sauce.<br /><br />This one box flavored 4-1/4 pounds of stew meat and 2-1/4 pounds of lamb. That's about three times the serving suggested on the box. You'd think the result might be thin flavors, but I have to say each bite was delicious and highly flavored. Absolutely restaurant-quality, as others have said. And I love the bits of pandan leaf that populate the sauce. It's just a great, pleasurable, satisfying meal.<br /><br />I did notice that the coconut doesn't break up easily, but if you wait until the mixture is just about boiling, it breaks up eventually. I wish I had used coconut milk instead of water, and sauteed the meat in coconut oil, as another reviewer has cleverly suggested -- I think those options should be mentioned on the box.<br /><br />What I did do was fry the stew meat in batches in a large frying pan. When all the meat was fried till nearly done. I put it back in the pan and poured in the curry mixture, which deglazed the pan, and cooked the whole thing for another 15 minutes or so. For the lamb, I did something different; after sauteeing the lamb, I put it in a pressure cooker with about 2/3 cup of the sauce and cooked it for 12 minutes. Unbelievable flavor and tenderness. I think I'm going to use the sautee-till-brown/pressure-cook-with-sauce method every time I make this kind of curry from now on.<br /><br />I really highly recommend this kit to anyone who doesn't mind a little sugar in their curry (and I admit it wouldn't have that "restaurant flavor" without the sugar). Now that I know one box can flavor 6 pounds of meat, easy, I regard this is both an economical purchase and a relatively low-carb treat.

review/summary: Easy to Make, Taste OK
review/text: I frequently make curry dishes from scratch.  I was looking for this box meal to make an easy version of that.  It succeeded in the easy department.  Making this meal was as easy as making Hamburger Helper.  Just cooking the meet, start the rice cooker, and add the sauces.  I was very pleased with the ease in cooking.  The flavor, however, left me a little disappointed.  It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't as good as homemade.  My family ate it all and said it was okay but gave it the thumbs down for future purchases.  They'd much rather eat my homemade.  I'm afraid I have to agree.  Although this was all right, it's worth the extra effort for better flavor.  I would be interested in buying other flavors from this company, and I would recommend this product to anyone that struggles in the kitchen.  It does make decent curry very easy.

review/text: Most packaged sauces are pretty boring and light on taste, but this is no ordinary packaged sauce.  This sauce is delicate and flavorful - it tastes like I spent hours working on the perfect spice blend.  I decided to make it with a lean London broil that I purchased on sale.  I sliced the meat thin and followed the package directions exactly.  The only thing I would do differently next time (and there WILL be a next time) would be to knock all the lumps out of the coconut premix first since it took sometime to work them out during the cooking process.  I served it over jasmine rice, topped with grated carrot, and with a side of steamed broccoli.  Next time I think I will try it with lamb.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that allergen safety information for this product is listed completely on the product page.  For those of us who do deal with food allergies this is very important.<br /><br />The serving size of this product is 2 tablespoons and the box contains about 15 servings.  One serving has 110 calories, 9 grams of fat, 5 grams of carbohydrates, and 230 milligrams of sodium.  So you do want to be careful if you are watching your sodium.

review/summary: Easy to make and add to, you can make it more cost effective with sirloin
review/text: I made a very tasty Valentine's Day meal for my boyfriend tonight.  Well, also for myself.  This kit contains everything except the meat, so it is nice for someone like me who forgets to buy a can of coconut milk or can't find one at the store when I want to make this type of curry.  I substituted sirloin for the beef tenderloin.  I was surprised that the copy on the box read that this curry was used at one time to disguise not so great beef, only to add a very expensive cut of meat to their preparing recipe.  Being that my boyfriend and I have bought 28 oz or so beef tenderloins for two dinner parties in the last three months, we weren't up to blowing another $30 on a meal.  The $8 pound and a half of sirloin worked just as well in this dish, even though it was less meat.<br /><br />I prepared it a bit differently than how they say.  I had a few hours so I cooked the sirloin to medium rare in cubes and then blended the rendang sauce packet into the meat and let that marinate and cool before adding the coconut milk packet about 30 minutes later.  I feel the old method of making curry and then cooking it for a while and then letting it sit, makes a better curry.  I didn't think I could do this with the coconut milk, so I added it a half hour before I thought I would serve it.  But before I added it to the sauce and beef, I heated up boiling water and dissolved the coconut premix into it, getting the lumps out of it.<br /><br />Of course, the boyfriend was held at work an extra hour, but no matter, I still cooked the meat and sauce on low, for an extra hour, making the sauce thicker and even more tasty.  I didn't add the 4/5 cup of water as they said to do, more like 1/2 cup and then I had to cook it for a long time in order for it to get thick. I did this on low or 2 on my stove top.  I don't believe in cooking curry too high because it can scorch.  When my boyfriend got home, we decided to stir fry some vegetables like onion, red pepper and carrot to add to the sauce and I cooked it 5 more minutes.  So it had been cooking for a total of two hours.  I served it with rice and it was really good.  The extra cooking bought out the spices and made the sauce more gravy-like.  I find this curry to be spicy in the tasty sense, more than in the hot chili pepper sense.  It's a good combo of ginger, lime leaves, nuts, chili pepper and other warming spices. I tastes similar to curries I have had in restaurants. I think for all the ingredients you'd have to get fresh to make this yourself, like candlenuts and lime leaves, it's most likely worth the $6.63 in price to make.  Some items in the ingredients list for this box are hard to come by at times and I don't normally stock them in my kitchen.  So buying this kit, even though it is pricey, would save me a lot of time trying to find the ingredients or ending up empty handed with most of the items used, but not all.  My boyfriend did dig out the tiny lemongrass stems from the sauce, at least we thought they were either sugar cane or lemongrass stems.  I ate mine, I didn't mind the extra texture and taste they gave the meal.<br /><br />One package makes about four big servings, even more if you wanted smaller servings and more still if you added more veggies.  You could probably feed eight people off of one box if you proportioned it right.  My boyfriend and I get to eat this for lunch tomorrow as well, so with the meat and veggies it was roughly $4 or so a serving, which beats going to a restaurant for the same thing.  Or see could add more veggies and only pay $2 a serving and have four meals a piece.  I might consider buying a pack of these in the future to have on hand if I want to make a coconut based curry, since sometimes it is iffy if I will find coconut milk in stock at my local store at a decant price.  Sometimes a can is $3 and that seems, with buying all the other items in this curry, fair that the kit is at the price point it is.

review/summary: Surprisingly similar to a restaurant dish, and very easy
review/text: The Prima Taste rendang curry was very easy to make.  All you add is beef, or whatever else you like.  There is plenty for four people.  The moderate spicy flavor will satisfy most taste buds.  The heat is mild but flavorful, like a 2.5 on a 1-10 scale (10 being hottest).  The color is great, and it looks indistinguishable from most restaurants.<br /><br />Please note that each box is one meal.  Also, there are 110 calories per serving (80 from fat), but 15 servings per box.  Two tablespoons equal one serving, and that's excluding the protein.  It's not a health dish and it's not intended to be, but it is hard to see how a box could be 15 servings.<br /><br />Overall, it meets all the criterion for a great easy meal.  I would recommend it.

review/summary: Easy to make and tastes good too
review/text: I'm not a big fan of curry. I have to be in the mood for it and usually I never make it. Mostly because I'm not the best cook.<br /><br />But this was easy to make. It thickened faster than I expected but I added some water and it smoothed it out. I used beef as instructed but I also added carrots, celery, onion and potatoes for a curry stew.<br /><br />It was also spicier than I expected but I like spicy foods because it makes me watch my portions better.<br /><br />It definitely made a good size amount and that surprised me. I had enough for two more meals so I felt like I got a good bang for the buck.

review/summary: Excellent, easy to prepare
review/text: This kit has everything you need to make a delicious curry dish. Although it is labeled for beef, we used chicken and it was quite good. The flavor is strong, spicy and a little sweet. Everything you need is in the box. You simply brown your beef (or chicken, lamb, whatever) and add the two packets (one is a dried coconut mix and the other is the spices mix) and finish cooking your meat. This could also be done in a crockpot. The total prep time was less than 20 minutes. The only thing I did not like were the large leaves in the spice mix. I also don't really like the smell of curry and it does linger.

review/summary: Amazing taste & perfect flavor combination-just WOW!
review/text: We generally are fans of Indian and Thai curries, and like to experiment with different flavors/ethnic cuisines. Unfortunately, many of the pre-mixed curry sauces win up providing a decent 'base' but often require additional 'enhancements' based on our tastes. This 'Prima Taste Rendang Curry' needed absolutely nothing to enhance the flavor. We could not believe how perfectly balanced, smooth, savory and sweet/spicey this combination tasted. While 'beef' was the listed ingredient to be added, we already had chicken thawed out, so we used that instead. This was literally the perfect weeknight 'quick and easy meal' that provided for a surprise ethnic burst, without a lot of fuss. We cooked the whole meal, including rice, and the chicken/sauce in a very short amount of time-the rice in the rice cooker took longer than the chicken/sauce. I would DEFINITELY keep this in the cabinet to prepare again for ourselves and for guests...and soon! Highly recommended and yummy!

review/summary: Not bad and quite easy!
review/text: I have been a curry fan ever since I lived for a few years in England. Now that I'm back in the US, I make it at home probably at least once a month. I like the curry recipe Jamie Oliver makes to music on YouTube but I have also found a few other recipes here and there on the web which are also simple, tasty and reliable. Most curries seem to have a base of either yogurt, tomatoes, or coconut milk. This one is based on coconut milk.<br /><br />As to this Rendang Curry Sauce mix, I have mixed feeling but mostly positive ones. First, the flavor is pleasant with a little heat from the peppers but not too much. It's very easy to make. There is a package of curry paste and a package of powdered coconut milk in the box. Just brown your meat or whatever you are currying, then add the two packages and some water. Bring to a boil and then simmer till the everything is cooked through. If you use a tender meat it will be ready really quickly, though rendang is often made with tougher cuts of beef which are simmered a long time in order to become tender and to soak up the flavor of the sauce. When its ready, serve it over rice or with naan bread.<br /><br />Though I liked the taste and found it easy to make I am only giving it four stars for a couple of reasons. First is because of the instant coconut milk. I think it would have been nicer if I'd used a can of real coconut milk instead. That would also give the option to use low fat coconut milk if preferred, because the one that comes in the package is very high in calories. The second reason is price. Though I enjoyed it, I found it a little expensive for what you get. I typically buy a small can of Mae Ploy curry paste in one of a variety of flavors along with a can of coconut milk at my local Asian grocery and then do almost exactly the same preparation with similar results for about half of what this costs. Still, if you don't live near an Asian grocery, and you feel like making something which is quick, easy, and a little out of the ordinary, this could be an agreable choice.

review/text: This turned out to be a very tasty dish. It says just add beef, but you will also need to supply the rice or potatoes for it to go over, there is quite a bit of sauce. It has a thick spicy curry flavor and I found the longer the rice sat in it the better the taste, so you might want to add the cooked rice right to the pan instead of over the top. Very good, will make this again.

review/summary: easy to make, tastes very good -- but definitely decadent
review/text: I quite liked the flavor of this Rendang Curry Sauce.  I used part of the kit to make a beef curry and the other part to make a chicken curry, and both were delicious.  Though I believe beef is the more traditional choice, I actually preferred this sauce on boneless, skinless chicken breasts.<br /><br />I have had Rendang curry in a few restaurants and found this kit to be close to restaurant quality.  My major complaint is that instead of using coconut milk this uses dehydrated coconut in a separate pouch, and the resulting curry sauce has a little bit of a gritty consistency because of this.  My only other issue is the amount of oil in the curry mix.  If you have leftovers (like I did), you'll definitely notice the oil since some of it separates out during refrigeration.  While the nutritional information here and on the box make it seem like this product isn't that decadent, the serving sized used is unrealistically small.  It's more reasonable to double the values listed, meaning that each serving of meat will have an additional 200+ calories from the sauce.  Because of this, I would suggest that this makes a better treat for a rare occasion than something to be eaten frequently.

review/summary: To Die For
review/text: This is some seriously good curry sauce. I made it at around 3 p.m. and left it cooking in the crockpot. Six hours later my family and some neighbors attacked it, and every single one of the seven who tried it gave it 5/5 stars for taste.<br /><br />There are two packets to mix into your browned beef cubes -- the first one is a dried coconut milk powder and the second one has all the seasonings: chili, galangal, palm sugar, onion, shallot, sugar, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, lemongrass, soy sauce, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper and cinnamon. The box says it contains wheat, too, but I can't see evidence of that in the ingredient list.<br /><br />You simply brown the beef or chicken, add in the contents of both packets, mix well and cook it all until the meat's done. I highly recommend the crockpot method; you can throw it together pretty quickly in the morning and then just steam some rice with it for dinner. Our meat was beautifully easy to shred and spread out the flavor even more.<br /><br />The taste the mix brings to the curry is not your usual/expected taste -- it's a mild, slightly sweet, slightly spicy and extremely flavorful blend. I appreciated the fact that it had no chemical-sounding ingredients, but there is a warning on the label that it in manufactured on equipment that also processes seafood, peanuts, sesame and egg products.<br /><br />The box says a serving size is two tablespoons (15 servings altogether). I highly doubt that would work for US portions, but we still got a good 7 servings out of it. I'm definitely going to order some more.

review/summary: Better if it were just the curry paste, and not a kit
review/text: I love curry. Thai curry.  Indian curry.  Japanese curry.  But I have never had curry from Singapore before.  This was my first taste of rendang, and I loved it.  But I didn't really love this sauce kit.<br /><br />The kit is easy to make, if all you want to do is follow instructions.  Just brown some meat of your choice--the box recommends beef but anything will do--then boil up the curry paste and coconut milk powder with some water, and the browned meat and simmer, and you are done.  Made directly this way, it is easy, if not a little boring.<br /><br />Whenever I try something new, I try to follow the instructions explicitly to see how it turns out, which is what I did this with this curry sauce kit.  The results were nice.  The curry has a good flavor, with nice lemongrass and a good blend of spicy and sweet.  I generally like my curries a bit more fierce, so I would probably add something to give it more of a kick, but it wasn't too wimpy.<br /><br />This was my first time experiencing powdered coconut milk--normally when I make curry I buy it by the can.  I really didn't like it, and don't much see the point of it.  I suppose there was a time and place when canned coconut milk was hard to come by, and a package of powdered coconut milk would be a necessary addition to a curry spice paste, but those days are behind us.<br /><br />Eating this has gotten me interested in trying to make some rendang myself, but I probably wouldn't buy this sauce kit again.  Because making curry paste from scratch can be time consuming, I often buy premade Thai and Indian curry pastes, then prepare everything else myself.  I would be more interested in this if it were just a premixed rendang paste, but I really don't need the powdered coconut milk.

review/summary: A very tasty curry - easy to prepare
review/text: I really wasn't sure how this was going to turn out when I received the sauce kit. The recipe calls for beef - I used lamb as I prefer it - I think the overall effect was the same.<br /><br />Bottom line up front - The curry sauce kit is easy to make, very tasty, with simple instructions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The directions are straight forward and simple. Total prep and cook time was approximately 20 minutes.<br />- Flavors are excellent and reminiscent of going to an curry restauarant and asking for the coconut curry. The flavors were very nice, if a little sweet. Perhaps a bit too much coconut - personal taste for that one.<br />- makes a LOT of curry. I used two pounds of cubed lamb and made two cups of rice to go with it. There was MORE than enough. I would actually recommend making three cups of rice and perhaps up to three pounds of meat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The coconut powder was a little bit challenging to get completely dissolved. Once everything started boiling, this was fairly well taken care of.<br />- I would have liked to have known the amount of curry to expect. I think the recommendation was OK - yet as stated above, it made a LOT.<br /><br />Overall - quite tasty, simple to make, good quality.

review/summary: Yum! Just as tasty with chicken!
review/text: I've had Japanese, Indian, Thai and Jamaican curry, but I don't think I've ever tried rendang before, which Wikipedia describes as "West Sumatran caramelized beef curry". This stuff made me want to hop on a plane to Singapore.<br /><br />The box contains two large packets, one with curry-spice paste and one with coconut powder. The directions say to brown 28 oz of beef, remove it from the pan, add the contents of the 2 packets and 4/5 cup water, heat to boiling, add the browned beef and heat through. I took the advice given by reviewers and mixed the coconut powder with 1 cup (easier to measure!) water in a large bowl before adding it and the spice paste to the pan. Then I added browned white meat chicken bits, chopped caramelized onion and chopped sauteed green pepper and let it cook at low heat for about 30 minutes before serving it on hot steamed Japanese rice.<br /><br />I almost added extra red curry paste after reading complaints that it was too mild, but I'm so glad I didn't! My husband loves 5-alarm hot food, and we both agreed that this is JUST right in spiciness. It's hot enough without overwhelming the flavors. It's different from any curry I've had before, and hard for me to describe - I guess it's like Thai panang curry but without the dominating coconut or peanut flavors. We all loved it! Just watch out for the little unchewable green leaves in the spice mixture.

review/summary: Almost perfect with a few tweaks
review/text: After having been in Singapore for a while, I miss the regional cuisine. Making fresh spice pastes every time I'm cooking is just not practical, which means that I don't get to make the dishes as often as I might like, so I jumped at the opportunity to try a pre-packaged version of a dish that typically takes several hours to make.<br /><br />Rendang is usually a slow cooking dish. The directions here make it easy to make on a weeknight at home. Overall, the sauce makes a generous portion. While the "safety information" (allergy alert) mentions "crustacean", the ingredient list doesn't include belechan (shrimp paste), which is typically used for rendang. I also didn't taste it in the packaged sauce, so it is lacking a bit of authentic taste. However, that's easy enough to rememdy by adding your own when heating the spice paste. It was not as spicy as I would've liked, or as I expected.<br /><br />For the record, I also tried it as a slow cooker with beef stew pieces. That makes the taste slightly more authentic, as the beef was more thoroughly infused with the rendang flavor. I'd definitely substitute the coconut milk powder with a can (I used two) of coconut milk. I also added some more oelek sambal (chili) to give it more kick and some belechan. Those changes produced something that was almost perfection.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, I'd prefer for this to be sold as a paste packet or  similar to Mae Ploy/Aroy-D/Asian Home Gourmet  so that I can add my own milk (and belechan). However, for the ease of making the dish and for relatively authentic flavor, I give this four stars.

review/summary: Surprisingly Great Taste
review/text: I enjoy cooking meals from scratch, but I understand that curry can be somewhat of a hassle because it often requires a lot of specialty spices like white pepper and candlenut. So it makes a lot of sense to prepackage these ingredients into a simple curry kit like this Prima Taste product, and they've definitely done a good job of making it easy.<br /><br />The box includes a rendering paste and a coconut premix, and the only extra ingredients you need is beef (they suggest 28oz of sliced beef tenderloin) and water. After cooking the beef, you just need to bring the water, with included rendering paste and coconut premix, to a boil. Add the beef, then serve - you'll need to supply your own side of rice. Pretty simple.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredient list, I was also pleasantly surprised. The rendering paste doesn't seem to have any additives at all. The coconut pre-mix, on the other hand, does contain maltodextrin and sodium caseinate, but it mostly just seems to be powdered coconut milk - if this is a problem, I suppose you substitute some canned (or homemade) coconut milk (though you'd probably want to nix the water too).<br /><br />I'm no expert on curry, but it smells and tastes very much like I'd expected. Perhaps somebody who grew up eating curry all their life might be able to tell the difference, but I sure wasn't. It had a nice coconut flavor and wasn't very spicy. If I were to make this again, I would probably add some fresh vegetables - maybe onion, garlic, and peppers - but overall I was very happy with this product.

Added the finished chicken to the sauce, served over white rice and had a great meal. This is about as easy as it gets. I'm used to a beef rendang served at a local Malaysian restaurant and their version is a very thick paste. This is more of medium thickness sauce and the kit makes quite a bit. I had enough left over to save for lunch the next day. If you need a quick meal this will do quite nicely. My one complaint is that either the onion shallots or pandan leaf that is in the mix (not sure which) is a little chewy/tough. I would purchase this again.

review/text: I love this and will buy it again!  I had beef stew meat in my freezer, so that's what I used and it worked fabulously.  I cooked the beef to about 2/3 done, then added it to the curry mix when it was ready.  Because it was stew meat, I turned the heat down and covered it and let it simmer for awhile so the meat would get more tender.  When it was ready, the stew meat was VERY tender.  The curry has a wonderful flavor and there is plenty of sauce so that you could add veggies if you wanted to.  I added peas.  Next time I may add potatoes and onions as well.<br /><br />I have never had Singapore curry before, but it really made me think of Thai curry, which I love.  I thought the lime leaves in the curry could have been smaller as they are a bit chewy, but they impart such a fantastic flavor!  It is delicious and I'm guessing, since I just made it last night, that it will be even better today when I have it for lunch!

review/summary: Comments from a gourmet chef
review/text: This is a great tasting Rendang with the flavors of the spices coming through. First some comments to earlier reviews. Usually the amount of lemon grass is more pronounced, with some chefs preferring to include a lot more pieces than this mix has in it. If you wish to cut the sweetness or have a stronger lemon bite, I suggest that you add some lemon juice.<br /><br />To add volume and vegetables to the dish without changing the flavor, I chunked up a can of whole bamboo shoots and cut a whole red bell pepper into chunks. This tasted great on a full plate of rice and made 6 large servings- creating an all-in-one dish and cost effective. If you want something crunchy, small pieces of celery would do fine. If you would prefer something soft, you can use a can of straw mushrooms.<br /><br />I prefer to cut vegetables into 1/3" cubes and meat into 3/4" strips so that every forkful has all the ingredients when the sauce is potent like this one. I did use a full cup of water and mixed the coconut before adding the seasoning. After reaching boiling, I added the vegetables and meat.

review/summary: the taste of curry
review/text: The flavor is strong curry with a bit of spicy hot. I decided to try the Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce with venison instead of beef. We primarily eat venison and elk so I felt this would be a better test for us. Following the very simple directions,I started by cutting the roast into thin strips and some chunks, nothing bigger than a silver dollar. I then stir fried the venison in oil in a steel wok until done since my wife does not care for any pink in her meat. The recipe calls for frying the meat in a pan until half done. As I finished the meat I put in the 4/5 cup of water into a pan and added the two sauce packets. One held a solid and liquid while the other a white power. (no MSG) A french whip was required to mix the white power into the water. A semi-soft material that looked like very small pieces of green corn husk were present in the sauce. I am not at all familiar with food from Singapore and have no idea what this was. My wife and I both remarked that this was the only thing we didn't like about the sauce, but it was not bad just unusual for us. When the sauce came to a boil I added the venison and let it cook as I prepared the rice and a salad. We both found the dish very tasty, my wife found it to be almost at the limit for her in "hot" taste. We had the leftovers  the next day, I found it even more delicious. She found it hotter. We both decided that we would buy it again since it was a big change of pace for our usual venison dishes. It was very easy to make and was good with rice though I would like it with noodles as well. If you like the taste of curry this is your dish.

review/text: This curry is on the high end of mild, just enough heat to make it interesting.  It depends much more on a rich mix of flavors, which are well-balanced and delicious.  Only a couple things to keep in mind.  The coconut mix got a little lumpy when prepared as described.  You probably want to mix it alone with a small amount of water to make a smooth paste before adding it.  Also, I prefer to remove the leaves before eating.  Those are minor issues compared to the great taste, and I will definitely be getting this again.

review/summary: Superb Malaysian Curry
review/text: I almost thought that I'd made this myself as it was so good!  That such flavor came not from my chopping up galanga, lime leaf, turmeric, etc., all of which are part of my pantry, but from a pouch, well, I was really impressed.  I do have one complaint, however.  The instructions on the box said to add 4/5 cup of water to the mixture.  At first, I thought my eyes were deceiving me as I'd never heard of a 4/5 cup measure.  Google to the rescue.  4/5 cup is the equivalent of 2/3 cup minus three tablespoons. though I doubt that I'll ever see that measure again until I order more of this curry.

review/summary: Wow, smells like restaurant quality food!
review/text: Was very pleased to see the ingredients list was all natural, no MSG that I could recollect.  Just mix the two packets together, and add some water.  The coconut powder clumped together after adding water, even with stirring, but dissipated once I added into my proteins.  I used coarsely cut chicken breast instead of beef, and it turned out excellent.  My stomach growled mightily while stirring it, smelled like restaurant quality food.  They really nailed the coconut curry flavor, in a good, natural smelling way.<br /><br />Minus one star because of the pandan leaves; I appreciated that the manufacturer included pandan, BUT, they appeared to be hard and inedible, and were difficult to fish out of the sauce.  I had some whole pandan leaves that I used instead; these were much easier to work with and remove post-cooking.  I ended up straining my sauce, but more trouble than necessary.  Perhaps Prima Taste can make a bouquet garni with the pandan next time.<br /><br />Now I'm eager to check out Prima's other tasty products.

review/summary: Rendang Curry Kit
review/text: I've never had much food from Singapore, so I can't say whether or not this was authentic.  But I liked it, and it seemed to taste "exotic" anyway.  Not your standard burger and fries at the very least.<br /><br />It was extremely easy to prepare.  All you do is mix the two pouches with water, and add in some beef chunks that you've been cooking.  And pour on top or rice (or mashed potatoes the box suggests).  Its that simple.  I think in total, with cooking the meat, it took maybe a half hour, and most of that was just it simmering on the stove while I was cooking the rice.  Sure I probably could have added some veggies, but the box didn't say that you really needed to, and there were some green things in the sauce, so hey, its all good.  The sauce itself was kind of an orangey-brown color and it was thicker like a gravy.<br /><br />The taste was a little bit spicy, but I just threw some plain yogurt on top and that cooled it down.  The coconut came threw quite strongly and that was the dominant taste for the dish.  The chili was also quite strong and that was probably the second most dominant taste.  There were other flavors of course, but they all melded together and to be honest I couldn't really distinguish what precisely they were.  Except maybe the lime leaf, I did taste a bit of lime.  But it was tasty, and with the exception of one in the household, not too spicy.<br /><br />I like that the ingredients didn't have preservatives or coloring though.  It seemed somewhat healthy.  And while there are a lot of ingredients, they all seem to be fairly normal and pronounceable.  So that's good.  The fat content could be considered a little high, but I do think that its probably healthy fats considering most of it is from the coconut.<br /><br />I liked it, and I'll probably eat it again.  I might even try some of their other flavors as well.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Easy and had good taste..
review/text: This was so simple to make and the ingredients pretty exotic to me. I wasn't sure if it would be something I'd really like.  It turned out a really flavorful sauce which had kaffir lime leaves, coriander, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and many other spices.  The coconut powders that you mix in are rich and smooth..and that's the way the sauce turns out.  I used chicken breast instead of beef and it was just fine.  The package says serve with rice or mashed potatoes..do the rice..mashed potatoes would be too weird with this.  Everything included but yr meat and it really is something different to serve and tastes good!

review/summary: A very nice, flavorful, mild curry
review/text: Having had Rendang curry only a couple of times (and then at Indonesian restaurants) I did not know what to expect when I tried this curry paste, looking at it as something of a culinary adventure.  I love curry, and, time permitting,  make my own paste (for Indian curries).  I also *love* Patak's pastes, particularly the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SBB8M4">Patak's Vindaloo Curry Paste, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMBE4A">Pataks Korma Paste 10oz</a> and have become very fond of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (so I know that you can make a very nice curry with prepared pastes).  All of the above take minutes to prepare and are very flavorful.  As someone who has tried many many prepared curry pastes, I'd say that the Prima taste Rendang is among the very best i have tried!  It makes a very rich, mild, coconut-based curry which tastes very fresh.  The "kit" I received contained a good deal more paste than any of thee Kitchens of India varieties (the Pataks come in jars, and so you can very the amount you use).  I believe there was more bulk because the ingredients aren't dried (most of the other pastes I have used require the addition of tomatoes or coconut milk).  The Rendang is complete.  In fact, my whole family enjoyed this! (My 14 year old tends not to eat things as hot as I, so he is less enthused about the vindaloo, for example).<br /><br />It is quick and easy to prepare, BUT, I believe they compromised when it came to directions.  This is a beef-based curry, and beef gets tough when it is sir fried or simmered in a pan for a short time.  This is the first time I have seen a curry paste specify tenderloin! and, I believe it was for the sake of keeping cooking time low.  Curry is more or less a stew, and beef curries are usually slow cooked (braised) for a long time at a low simmer.  When I make stew, and sometimes when I make curry, I will use a pressure cooker if I do not have the time to cook it for an hour or more.  I would recommend the same when using this paste.  That is, you may opt to use tenderloin as the directions on the box specify, *OR* if you are using a lesser cut of meat (and honestly, I have never had curry based on filet mingnon!) then gently brown the meat, coat with paste and either cooks at a low simmer (for an hour or more) in a tightly covered pot, or for a quicker version, prepare in a pressure cooker.<br /><br />You should know before ordering that the directions specify tenderloin.  Go ahead and make it that way if it is a realistic option for you, but know that it can be prepared with round, or ? another cut.  It just requires a more traditional slow braise if you are using a lesser cut of meat, or it can be sped with the use of a pressure cooker.<br /><br />The paste itself, though, is very very good, and I will be ordering more :)  In fact, I'd say this is already among my favorite (along with Patak's Vindaloo, and Kitchens of India Butter curry), not too spicy, but very very flavorful.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Very good flavor; a bit mild, but it's easier to add heat than to subtract it.
review/text: I have regular cravings for coconut-base curries, and this one is delicious. I let it simmer in my crockery cooker for a while, and the fragrance filled the whole house. It is pretty mild, but I can easily at hot seasonings, but not so easily take them away; I'd rather have a milder product and then add my own heat to taste. It was easy to brown the meat and add the contents of the two packets, and then we had everything but the rice. I would definitely recommend this for people who crave curries but aren't always up to making them from scratch.

review/summary: Try it vegetarian - the right amount of savory/spicy/sweet
review/text: This was a breeze to make.  I added a very large boneless chicken breast in bite-sized pieces (much less in quantity than the recommended amount of beef) and added diced onions, sliced carrots, peas, and diced sweet potato.  I was tempted to make it a totally vegetarian meal, because my husband will not eat beef, and he really does not like meat much at all.  but for flavor, and to cut fat, I cooked the chicken and veggies in a bit of coconut oil.  Delicious.  It's true that the coconut powder gets lumpy, but I followed some advice to whisk it up prior to adding it.  Tasted similar to the veggie curry I make with curry paste and coconut milk, but not quite as creamy.  The added crunchiness of some of the ingredients (peanuts, coconut) added to that made it even more appealing.<br /><br />I just love coconut curry.  There is something about the savory/spicy/sweetness that is appealing to me.  I added more chili from a spice bottle.  I don't have experience with the "real thing", as I don't travel to other countries, or try many ethnic restaurants.  I just knew this was a coconut curry, and that is how I prepare it.  The chicken was so flavorful, as were the vegetables. (the sweet potato -- WOW!) The sauce permeates everything.  Very fragrant.<br /><br />I have been going back and forth in my mind about the price.  I decided that since I am the only curry lover in this house, it just doesn't pay to get the curry paste jars and store them.  Coconut milk, which IS creamier, I do buy the premium brand.  So, it is costly to buy the ingredients to make it by scratch if you aren't going to use the rest of the curry paste before it goes bad.  If you add the peanuts and such to the cost per package, you are talking bucks!<br /><br />So, for a novelty, I believe the price is justified.  This package makes quite a bit, so after two people eating, there are leftovers, and I froze them immediately after cooling.  Heated back up, the consistency isn't as good, but passable.<br /><br />I would buy this, but just not in a case.  I have no room.  The only cases I buy from Amazon (and I shop here a lot) are of bottles of a name brand jalapeno sauce.  I go through that fast!  But if you want a good curry, and you eat it a lot, I recommend buying it from Amazon.

review/summary: Rendang Curry Very Tasty
review/text: Rendang Curry by Prima Taste is a Dry Beef Curry sauce kit. The box says Best Singapore Favorites. Lately I've been trying out a couple of exotic food kits, this one piqued my interest. Although 28 oz of beef tenderloins  were required, I'm not a beef person and decided to try using tofu instead. I invited two other people to join me for this experience. All of us like rich, spicy food and all the better if it is restaurant quality at home.<br /><br />To start, I took two packages of extra firm tofu (packaged in water) and sliced each into eight or nine slabs like a loaf of bread. I laid these between clean dishtowels to drain off excess moisture which aids in absorbing the flavors of the sauce.<br />Choosing toasted sesame oil, I coated the bottom of an iron skillet until the oil was fragrant. I cut each slab of tofu in to eight chunks and laid them in the pan, letting them brown slightly. Then took those out and set aside until all of the tofu was browned.<br />Meanwhile, basmati rice (not part of the kit) simmered in another pan. The box says it also goes well with mashed potatoes, something I'd like to try next time.<br />One of two enormous packets contained a slightly oily red paste that upon first inspection looks like tomatoes, but turns out to be an exotic blend of Galangal, Palm Sugar, Pandan Leaf, Candlenut, Ginger Salt and Lemon grass to name a few. The minute it hit the hot skillet a pleasing, fragrant aroma wafted through the house. Each of the guests commented about it.<br />The second packet held a dry, powdered mix of coconut milk and solids. I hadn't seen coconut processed this way before, but after adding the required amount of water, the sauce began to look much more like a curry. After following the cooking instructions on the box, I added the tofu to the sauce. When it was heated through, I served it over rice. Each of us had a small plate, and there was enough left over for each of us to have 2 more meals.<br />It made an abundance of sauce as well. We were all satisfied with the flavor and talked about having seconds, but were full.<br />I found it a bit on the sweet side, as mentioned above palm sugar contributed to this. I'm not a fan of sweet curries. Although the taste was sensational, the spicy kick was surprising but not overwhelming. For a bit of variation, the addition of baby green beans, julienned carrots, or saut&eacute;ed onions would be welcome.<br />All in all, we found Rendang Curry very tasty, and everyone enjoyed it. I'll be looking for this on store shelves.

review/summary: Not quite rendang taste, but good
review/text: Taste : 4 stars<br />Convenience : 4 stars<br />Authenticity : 2.5 stars<br />Healthiness : 1 star!<br /><br />Rendang is an Indonesian style meat curry. I've eaten the dish in restaurants in Singapore (though never in Indonesia), and I've also tried this exact sauce mix a few years ago, and I thought it turned out better the last time. For rendang, it was too wet, and too sweet. However, if you don't try to compare it for authenticity, it does taste very good.<br /><br />The coconut power was a bit difficult to mix well. I should have tried what another reviewer suggested - to whisk it with water separately before mixing it. Perhaps I should have tried cooking it longer to allow more of the liquid to evaporate. The instructions only said to cook till it reached the desired doneness.<br /><br />You can substitute the beef with lamb as well if that's your preference. It doesn't make it any healthier, but it gives it a different flavor.<br /><br />I wish I can eat this more often, but one look at the nutritional information will tell you why that's not a good idea. It doesn't look too bad, until you reach "Servings per container : 15"! A previous reviewer mentioned that it is impossible to eat the entire packet in one sitting. I agree, but I can eat half a packet without too much effort, which should be enough saturated fat and cholesterol to last me through a week.

review/text: This is fast and good. If you like curry this works. It is like a lot of the bottled Indian and Asian sauces, which sure makes for fast cooking. If you like it hotter go add red pepper paste or dry spice flakes. I think frozen peas go well with curry and naturally work with a white rice base.

review/summary: Delicious and easy!
review/text: My husband and I agreed that this is one of the best curries we've had in a long time. Curries vary greatly and so does individual taste. We particularly liked Prima Taste's Rendang Curry because it was not very hot, but had just enough heat to make it interesting, and the subtle coconut flavor. The spices blend well together and nothing overpowers the others. And, it smells wonderful when cooking! It tasted fresh, probably since it was not just a dry mix.<br /><br />Making this was super easy. Using a whisk, I mixed the paste and dry coconut packages together along with the water, then added the browned meat. I did have to add water every so often as the meat simmered in the mix, but, I was using 2 lbs of big chunks of meat. If you use smaller cuts that cook to tender more quickly or less meat, you might not have to. I liked the large pieces of spices in the sauce, but others might prefer to pick them out. We added green peas to the dish just before serving it over rice. Chopped peanuts might make a nice topping, and you can use your imagination for other additions.

review/summary: Fastest way to great beef curry
review/text: I love curries and I was anxious to try the Rendang Curry that promoted itself as quick and easy. When I read through the instructions, I was somewhat surprised that the type of beef called for in this recipe was 28oz of pricey beef tenderloin (think filet mignon). Although I'm trying to watch my family's cholesterol levels, I wanted to stay true to the recipe and use beef, but felt I could substitute chuck steak at $4/lb on sale. When stir-frying chuck, the secret is to cut across the grain and to not overcook, meaning I could still see the pink in the meat when I remove it from the pan. The result: my family loved it! Admittedly, my end product does not look like the photo on the box because I have more gravy which is probably due to the excess moisture that the beef produced when I pan-fried it. I did simmer the sauce for 10 minutes to reduce it. After the sauce was reduced, I turned off the stove and added the beef. Next time, the part I might change is to measure the juice that the beef produces and add water to make 4/5 of a cup of liquid that the recipe calls for. Actually, I liked having the gravy with my rice. At $7/box plus $10 for the beef, the entr&eacute;e with rice would serve about 6-7 people and not the 15 that the box states, unless you have other dishes, of course. My family would love for me to make this curry again.

review/summary: Not exactly *dry* rendang, but wow, is this good!
review/text: I've wanted to try dry rendang for a long time.  I've heard it's wonderful.  This wasn't dry, but that's OK--it left me lots of sauce to pour over rice.  If I licked the bowl when I was done, I would never admit it here.<br /><br />I didn't follow the instructions.  (I'm terrible at following instructions.)  I started at the supermarket, while choosing the beef.  This calls for thin slices of beef tenderloin, but that's not exactly in my budget.  I went with chunks of a fairly tough cut of beef.  That meant long simmering, which is not what the instructions call for.<br /><br />I lightly browned the beef and set it aside. (The instructions tell you to pan-fry until medium-done.)  I added the paste and coconut and brought it to a boil.  (Hey, I got something right!)  The "coconut premix" was a powder that clumped pretty badly.  I think next time I'll add the coconut premix and the water, so I can see the clumps to break them up, then add the paste.<br /><br />I added the beef back to the pan and covered (which you're not supposed to do,) and let it cook for about an hour and a half.  With tenderloin it would be ready in a few minutes, but if you're broke like me, the sauce holds up well to cheap beef and a long slow simmer.<br /><br />The smell in the house was absolutely wonderful.  The flavor was wonderful as well.  It was a good blend of spices, with no one spice stealing the show.  I know that rendang is supposed to have hot peppers, but I don't know exactly how hot it's supposed to be.  This was extremely mild.  Leftovers may meet a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LO40AG">Sriracha</a> to warm things up a bit.  Next time I make this I may introduce some hot peppers before simmering.<br /><br />But oh yes, there will be a next time.

review/summary: Dang good rendang
review/text: Having once been a twenty one year old student on a budget living in Tokyo Japan, I've eaten my share (and more )of wholesome, filling curry. From the two hundred yen plates under the railroad tracks, to twenty-two hundred yen plates at posh Tops Saxon, I know good curry (and bad curry) when I taste it. In general, when making curry at home, I tend to stick with Japanese brands (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ITQAK">S&B - Golden Curry Sauce Mix - Mild 3.5 Oz.</a>) that require a big pot and lots of cooking time, so Prima Taste's rendang offering looked interesting to me, not only because I'm partial to southeast Asian curries that use fruit, coconut, and such, but also because it looked like it would not be hard to cook. And it wasn't. I browned about a pound and a half of cut up top broil and steak (mixed) and just for kicks threw in two small potatoes and two small carrots. This rendang comes with two pouches. One is a super fine coconut powder, and the other is a traditional red chili based curry paste. Mix the two with a little water, bring to a boil, add the meat, and you're ready to throw it over noodles, rice, potatoes, whatever. I added some extra water and cooked mine for a little over an hour, and the meat got very tender and tasty. The potatoes and carrots were good and soft too. The flavor of the curry is just right. It's punchy but not scorchingly hot, and the coconut adds just the right consistency and flavorful edge. Over rice, it had the perfect balance of flavor and sauciness, and with the extra tender meat, a smooth and satisfying mouth feel. I think what helps make this curry so good is the ingredients are kept separate, vacuum packed, and the paste itself is not dried. It makes for easy prep and a very tasty meal. At $6.50 a box or so, it seems a little pricey, but it makes enough to feed a family of four, or a couple for one night with microwavable lunches for two the next day. I'm definitely going to pick up some more of this stuff at the first opportunity. It's really good.

review/summary: Quick And Easy Curry
review/text: Even people who aren't crazy about curry may like this. I myself love curry, but I lean toward the Madras type, so this Rendang curry from Singapore is pretty mild for my taste. Overall, the flavor reminds me of certain Thai curries, probably due to the coconut. What you actually get here are two foil envelopes of curry mixture and coconut powder. Chile peppers are certainly there, but hot pepper fans will want to add more. Officially, this kit is for Rendang Curry with beef, but the back of the box states that chicken or lamb would be equally appropriate. I used beef, and made only half of the recipe, as I was the only one eating...the package says that the opened envelopes will keep for three days, so I froze the remainder for future use.  The full recipe calls for nearly two pounds of meat and no added vegetables; if you choose to add vegetables you will have enough curry to feed a small family, so I'd advise that. In any case, this dish can be prepared very quickly, and has a pleasant flavor served with rice. Whether or not the Prima Taste is worth its price is a judgment call, but I probably wouldn't get it again, just because I like to make my own curry. But you can prepare a quick, easy and tasty meal with this product. Prima Taste offers several such sauce kits, and they may be worth a try as well.

review/summary: Tasty but not exciting
review/text: As packaged curries go, this one isn't bad.  And in fact if I was rating it against most curry mixes, it'd rate pretty high. (As it is, I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't let us do that.)  It has a nice amount of heat, a reasonable amount of flavor and it's easy to make.  It does, however, have a couple of problems, at least as far as my tastes run.<br /><br />First, the coconut mix is a kind of coconut flour affair, which blends easily but tastes a little chalky, so there's always a bit of a dry, dusty quality to each bite.  Second, one of the ingredients is a leaf or piece of grass that simply doesn't soften up very well.  Getting a bit of hard, fibrous plant material in a bite of curry isn't high on my list of tasty treats.  Still, these are fairly minor problems, and working on different methods of preparation might help alleviate them.  I honestly think the company would be better off selling this in a jar, straining out the leafy bits and using whole coconut and coconut oil instead of that coconut flour packet.<br /><br />The recipe calls for beef tenderloin which is odd because the box explains that Rendang curry was originally developed to disguise tough cuts of meat.  I chose to use ground beef, which has more flavor, and I sauteed it in coconut oil instead of something neutral like canola. Both choices upped the flavor ante.  The box does say that it's also good for lamb or chicken, and it's good enough that I might try it again with chicken, or even use it as the base for a vegetable curry.<br /><br />I think if you're going to make curry at home and not make it from scratch, this is a good option.

review/text: I've never cooked with curry, although I have eaten various items with curry at restaurants. This kit made it very easy to make the sauce. Add water and cook the Rendang Paste and Prima Coconut until it comes to a boil. The taste is a little spicy, but too sweet for my likening. The packets that the sauce mixtures come in did nothing to make me confident about trying the sauce. They reminded me of the packets you get when you buy wet cat food. It was very unappealing to squeeze out the Rendang Paste. Once everything was mixed together it didn't seem too bad, but the overall taste and appearance (before cooking) were poor.

Apparently, the manufacturer thinks it's OK to switch to using the "Big 8" allergens; there's no milk listed in the published ingredients, but there it is on the side of the box.<br /><br />Two differences that will seem trivial to anyone who doesn't care about milk products: the ingredients list online says, "coconut milk solids," and the list on the box reads, "coconut, milk solids." The allergen statement on the box clearly indicates it contains milk products.<br /><br />Since I am allergic to milk, I couldn't try the actual product; I have no opinion of its quality.<br /><br />:( And I love curry!!

review/summary: Awesome, but expensive.
review/text: This curry was awesome. It made a big batch, easily enough for four adults. It was tasty, spicy enough, and not too sweet. We added beef and some veggies and it made a great dinner. Rich flavor, utterly delicious. This isn't a curry I've had before but it's similar to a penang. At any rate, we all loved it and it was super easy.<br /><br />The thing is, it's like $9 per meal, not including meat or veggies. For nine bucks, I can get a jar of curry paste and three cans of coconut milk and make 3 meals of curry once I add meat and veggies. And, using the paste isn't really any harder. Is this more delicious than curry paste? It's better than most that I've used, but no better than some. To me it isn't a good value unless you were traveling and needed self contained meals.

review/summary: Currying Favor?
review/text: This is the fourth attempt to post this review, I can only assume I mentioned a country or person or something, so I'll keep it simple.<br />I like curry, any curry (no countries or ethnic groups mentioned)<br /><br />This curry is: -<br /><br />The exact recipe calls for Beef, if you prefer chicken go for it.<br />Cook the meat (whichever you choose) shallow fry, or wok flash fry until cooked through, rare is OK for beef, but obviously not for pork or chicken, cook these thoroughly.<br />Second stage is mix paste and spices with fluid, cook on their own until simmered.<br />Finally add meat, and simmer to taste? That could mean 20 minutes, or 6 hours - I know when I make curry I prefer slow cooked soft meat that has had plenty of time to absorb all he spices, so longer is better. But if you're in a hurry that's fine, it just won't be as fully flavored.<br /><br />So taste?<br />Well that's subjective and personal but I found it hot (spicy) in a white pepper way, and top heavy on the cumin flavor, but this is not uncommon for that part of the World.<br />I guess I was disappointed, I used one mix on three pounds of meat (not the 1-2 pound as suggested) and it was still pretty fiery.

review/summary: Too sweet for a curry
review/text: I used this product with chicken, Bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms and zucchini squash. Saut&eacute; the mixture and to this add the sauce and coconut milk which comes in two separate pouches. First mix them together and heat it to gentle boil and then add to the cooked chicken and veggies. Serve with rice or pita bread. You could also use this with just vegetables, if you are vegetarian. I found this stuff to be too sweet for a curry. Generally I prefer Indian curries but I recommend this product if you like mild curries.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SKT5Z0">Sukhi's Gourmet Indian Foods Gluten-Free Classic Indian Curry Sauce, 3-Ounce Packets  (Pack of 6)</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J4GKZG">Patak's Rogan Josh Curry Sauce 283g</a>

review/text: This Redang Curry sauce tastes really good. Either Missus 1rude or I would have been pleased with a restaurant dish that delivered the flavor this box did.<br /><br />We were amazed at the high sugar, fat and sodium content of just the contents of the package. We prepared a veggie version that worked really well to try and mitigate that (try it with tofu instead of beef, the Missus sauteed it with onions, cabbage and carrots - yum!), but that and cost would be the reasons why we wouldn't make this a regular pantry item.

review/summary: Restaurant quality taste....(updated)
review/text: I am a curry FIEND, if it's curry I almost always like it. My fridge has just about every Mae Ploy I could find at our local store. When I saw the Prima Rendang, I was anxious to try it, as I've made this before from recipes I found online.<br /><br />If I found a restaurant that served this, I would buy it, weekly. It's SO tasty, a nice fresh bright clean tasting curry, flavorful without tasting like it has too much salt or sugary sweetness. It tastes like I ground the spices and made the paste myself, it's THAT fresh. I have never made a curry this good at home before.<br /><br />PRO<br />*Easy to make (see tips below) with a payout that is restaurant-quality. You could serve this to guests and they would want to marry you!<br /><br />*The sauce is generous enough that you could easily feed 4 people or a little more if you put in some extra veggies. I sliced up some green onions and I think peas would be good in it, or some grated radish or even a little potato if that's your thing.<br /><br />*Prep time is very fast<br /><br />*Everything you need for the sauce is in the box<br /><br />*All the spices and chilies are so perfectly balanced, you get a total experience of the curry and not just a few spices standing out more than others. It was honestly hard for me to pick out separate flavors, such was the harmonious balance. If I had to guess what spices were in it, that would be hard to do. Wonderful blend. They are listed on the box as: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon. I think they forgot to add "crack" into their list, I'm already jonesing for another bowl of this.<br /><br />CONS<br />*The bits of leaves in the sauce kept interfering with my enjoyment of the dish. I know they are important to impart that fresh bright taste, but I felt like I was chewing my cud. It was like having bits of lawn clippings in my food and was annoying. I think this could be offset by using more veggies than I did.<br /><br />*The coconut powder can be lumpy and grainy, see tips below<br /><br />COOKING TIPS<br /><br />*The sauce thickens quickly and wants to stick to bottom of pan, I'd cook the meat to ALMOST done and then combine with the sauce.<br /><br />*Mix the coconut powder and water together, and then whisk in the paste. My coconut powder was lumpy as heck and left a grainy texture and bits in my gravy. Or, save the coconut powder for another use and just sub in a can of your favorite coconut milk. Eliminate or drastically reduce the water if you do this, try the can of coconut milk first and if you need more moisture add in a little water.<br /><br />*Use coconut oil to cook the meat in, it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.<br /><br />*this makes a LOT of food. Especially if you add more than just meat, you could easily feed over 4 people with it. I froze an extra serving to see how it stood up to the process, and it didn't separate. Package your leftovers into lunches or future dinners<br /><br />NUTRITION INFO: Typically I see coconut powder with sugar of some kind added, but this only lists maltodextrin. The Rendang Paste does have palm sugar and sugar listed in the first few ingredients. Just the box ingredients have 75 grams of carbohydrate, with 45 grams of that coming from sugar. That's a lot of sugar bang for the buck.  The entire box also has 1650 calories, 135 g. of fat, with 105 of that being non-animal saturated fat from the coconut. The entire box also has 3450 mg of sodium. Let's face it though folks, no one is going to sit and eat the entire box. (I know, I tried!)<br /><br />If the sauce weren't grainy from the bits of coconut powder, I would give this a 5-star rating. I would love to see this sold as a paste packet or jar, so that I could use my own coconut milk brand. This curry paste is SO amazing, I would love to be able to buy it by the jar and use it on ribs, burgers, chicken, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE: Using the tips to preblend the coconut powder, my second batch was smooth. This also does work with a can of coconut milk, omit the water. This product is available on Subscribe and Save, and it was so good that I signed up to get regular shipments of it. When I have bad bad food cravings and am tempted to go drive out to get something, now I always have this on hand and it is so satisfying! It's good with chicken, beef, and pork. I haven't tried any other meats. But d*mn, you gotta try this.

review/summary: Restauraunt Quality Beef Rendang - Easy to make
review/text: I lived in Asia for 3 years and one of my favorite cuisines was Indonesian/Malaysian.  Both countries serve-up slightly different versions of Beef Rendang, which is one of my all-time favorites.  When I first moved back to Chicago I didn't know of any restaurants that served this dish (I've since found two) so I attempted to make my own sauce, from scratch, following a recipe I'd found on-line.  I don't know what I did wrong, but what came out didn't very closely resemble true Beef Rendang.  A little later on I purchased a sauce packet in an asian grocery. No... it didn't quite have the same flavor either.  Well,  it's been 6 or 7 years since those failed attempts and low and behold, I stumbled upon the Prima Rendang Curry.  De-licious! I followed the simple instructions and ... I have to say. It's pretty darn good!

review/text: The cuisine of Singapore/Malaysia is my favorite in the world. And rendang is one of my favorite foods. This was pretty tasty, and very easy to make. It was hard to empty the packets, but I just rinsed them out with some of the cooking water. The kit is very large, though, I wish it came in a smaller size. It was just mildly spicy, not hot at all. The ingredients are authentic. I found it a bit on the sweet side. It's not as good as my daughter's (who is married to an Indonesian, and lived there for years...rendang is both Malay and Indonesian). But as I live in an area where I can't possibly get even half of the ingredients required, it was a treat to have this again.

review/summary: Tasty, fast and easy- what more can you ask for?
review/text: Was not sure what to expect, as the box was a little basic and the instructions were pretty short.  Just brown your beef in oil, remove, and then add the coconut powder, water and the solid curry paste and then stir.  Once the mix was boiling, I reduced the heat and added the beef back in.  Very simple and easy.<br /><br />But, surprise of surprises-- its really good.  I served it up over brown rice and green beans, and received rave reviews on the meal.  The curry and coconut milk flavors are strong, and the big chucks of spices really pay off in the taste of the curry.  If I had been served this in a restaurant I would have been happy.  To make it at home in about 20-30 minutes was really nice.  I think the sauce kit also would have been good with chicken or pork as well.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying more Prima Taste stuff based on how good this was.  Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Easy to prepare and makes a tasty meal
review/text: I have made beef rendang from scratch in the past, but very rarely-I don't have the 6+ hours it takes to make the dish.  That said, this is an adequate substitute for a quicker version.<br />Following the instructions, I first seared the beef, then removed it from the pan before putting in the paste packet (difficult to get out of the foil envelope), coconut powder and water, brought it to a boil before adding in the beef.  Whisking out the lumps of coconut powder took a minute or two, but other than that the process of preparing the meal was simple.  I used stew meat (just like I do for homemade rendang), and cooked it for about 45 minutes on a low simmer.  The sauce was thick and tasted good, not as spicy as I make it (but it suits my children's palates), with a nice heat and a decent coconut taste.  The meal would likely come together a lot faster if tenderloin is used, as suggested on the packet.

review/summary: Truly Delicious
review/text: I am a pescetarian, have been for a long time. I don't eat meat, ever, however on occasion I'll eat fish. I've been on that diet for years and it suits me. Not eating meat and not drinking alcohol or soft drinks has turned out to be a terrific way to keep myself slim and looking good.<br /><br />So when I got this curry mix, naturally I made it with fish instead of beef. I used a cheap white fish from Vietnam that I bought frozen. The fish was okay, pan friend with nothing but butter and lemon, nothing extraordinary, but when used with this sauce, it was delicious. I'd swear I was eating off the street in Thailand or at an expensive Thai restaurant in the States.<br /><br />Yes, it's a tiny bit pricy and yes I could make up a curry sauce just as good from scratch, but not in the small amount of time it took me to make up a meal using this. And this, cooked with fish in it and served over a bed of rice, is truly delicious. I will have this curry mix in my house forever and will use it on a regular basis.

review/summary: Delicious Spicy and best of all Easy!
review/text: So you're having company or want to impress a special person with a nice meal, if you're cooking-challenged like me this Rendang Curry makes a great impression. The box contains the sauce and spices that you will need. All you must provide is the beef and rice.<br /><br />The instructions are so easy even I made a great meal! After cooking the meat, simply add the packets to boiling water. Add the beef. Serve over rice.<br /><br />The coconut flavor is subtle. I would say the curry is a medium level of spicy hot. The sauce is tasty and would be delicious simply over rice and would work well with alternative ingredients such as tofu or even lamb. The only part of the mix that my dinner companion didn't like was the lime leaves: within the spice packet there are quarter inch pieces of leaf. They have a particular, distinct flavor. I thought the leaves were fine, but they do have a distinct flavor and texture that some people may not like.<br /><br />This curry mix is not exactly healthy. Two tablespoons are listed at 110 calories, 7 grams of saturated fat, and 230mg of sodium.  However for a delicious tasty spicy treat that can be prepared from start to finish in 15min I rate this as a 5-star product. It was as delicious as going out to a restaurant and a whole lot more affordable.

review/text: I live in the sticks and good curry is impossible to get here.  Theoretically I could make it but I don't.  I often purchase packaged curries and sauces since I just don't want to cook them.<br /><br />This was quick and easy to whip up.  It made a lot more than I thought it would.  I ended up cooking 2 whole round steaks for the sauce.  The coconut powder took a minute to whisk in but other than that it was fine.  It tastes great and the price is comparable to the other package curries and sauces I but regularly.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is pretty oily.  Fully cooked, there were still little pools of oil across the top of the dish.

review/summary: 9 grams  fat in 2 Tablespoons...and lots of sugar. This is mostly palm oil and seasonings.
review/text: Ah, it's the old rule that things that taste good are rarely good for you...well, they can be made healthier but the nutritional label on this one is sketchy.<br /><br />I think it's highly misleading to say a serving size it 2 Tablespoons. You couldn't do anything with 2 Tablespoons of sauce except for put it atop one baby red potato.  However, in just that small of serving size you are already weighing it at 7 grams SATURATED fat and 9 grams total fat.  In those 2 tablespoons you also have 100 calories...this is without the protein and rice you might add as a consumer. Tack on 230 mg of sodium in those two tiny spoonfuls and 3 grams sugar and you are likely to finish this meal wondering why you didn't have a Big Mac.<br /><br />The label says it's "family size" and you'd best have a big family who plans on cooking other dishes for dinner if everyone is only supposed to eat 2 Tablespoons.<br /><br />This rates a D minus on the health websites.<br /><br />That said, until you add meat, it has no cholesterol.  There is some good. Unless you, of course, do plan to add meat...then you are consuming basically a Big Mac and fries if you eat normal portions.<br /><br />For me that's just too much. Taste isn't everything...I believe in everything in moderation, but even in moderation with two spoonfuls of sauce you just have too much saturated fat here from the oil.<br /><br />So let's look at the ingredients. Normally coconut milk is used in curry which is a good fat...instead they used PALM OIL (vegetable oil: bad fat) as the main ingredients and then added in the flavor of coconut as a spice:<br /><br />ngredients<br />Rendang Paste (heat sterilized) Vegetable Oil (palm olein), Chili, Galangal, Palm Sugar, Onion,Shallot, Sugar,Pandan Leaf (Pandanus Amaryllifolius), Garlic, Salt, Lemon Grass, Soya Sauce (extract of soya bean, wheat, salt, sugar, carmel color), Fennel, Coriander, Cumin, Kaffer Lime Leaf, Cloves, Turmeric, white Pepper, Cinnamon Prima Coconut Premix (dehydrated) Coconut Milk Powder (coconut milk solids, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate), maltodextrin<br /><br />So basically this is a big ol' packet of vegetable oil with seasonings to make it taste more like a regular curry...and a whole lotta sugar to make ya love it.<br /><br />Not my thing.

review/summary: Hot?  Not for me, but for my guest it was...
review/text: I LOVE cooking with new flavors, and pride myself on being an adventurous cook.  I don't do beef much (a few times a year), but happened to have some primo beef that was perfect for this.<br /><br />I seared my beef in a cast iron skillet on all sides, then cooked partway through.<br /><br />I mixed the coconut powder, water, and oil in a Pyrex measuring cup, and added it to the pan, then added the paste.  It blended together perfectly!  No lumps or issues.  *BUT, I am not a fan of the dehydrated vegetable pieces--those were a distraction and we picked them out in the end.*<br /><br />I cooked the meat through with the lid on, at a med-low heat, stirring every few minutes, and turning the beef.<br /><br />To go with it, I made a mixture of different colors of quinoa and a side of lightly sauteed asparagus with garlic.<br /><br />The beef took on the color of the sauce (all the way through the meat).  I found this interesting.<br /><br />The flavor, I thought, was VERY good, especially with the quinoa.  I actually could have just eaten it with the vegetables and quinoa, and opted out of the beef altogether.  My guest, on the other hand, found it spicy (hot-spicy) and although he liked the flavor of the dish, said he would not order it for himself due to how his particular tastebuds perceived that hot-ness.  My mother and her husband would have found it altogether inedible, because they cannot handle any "spice" in their foods.  Just an FYI, in case you have sensitive people to feed.<br /><br />It made a LOT of food.  We two adults ate about 1/3 of the dish.<br /><br />I personally would order this for me, but since he can't enjoy it, it puts a damper on my recommendation.  I hate making a dinner that ends up too spicy for my guest(s).  I know that I have a system that loves spicy foods, so I tend to overlook this part of creating a menu.  It's not like you can opt out of that sauce with this dinner.  ;)<br />I guess I'll just order similar dishes for myself when we go out to eat ;)

review/summary: Very tasty, but rather expensive
review/text: I had never eaten Rendang curry before, but I love curry so I thought I'd try it. It very tasty and felt like a restaurant quality dish. I had some left over slow cooked beef that I simply heated up and added to the sauce (tip: mix the coconut powder and water together before adding the curry paste) and let it heat a bit more. It took me less than ten minutes to throw together, certainly the quickest dinner I've ever made. I cooked for two and we had enough leftovers for another dinner. Note: keep an eye out for the kaffer lime leaves, they are not meant to be eaten.<br />The reason I demote this kit to 4 stars, is that I really don't see it as all that great a deal. Its about $7 a box and all you are really making is a sauce. I would much rather buy the curry paste and coconut milk separately. On Amazon you can get a set of 12 Rendang curry paste packages for $25. Coconut milk ranges from about $2-3. So about $4-5 a meal instead of $7. Plus you have the advantage of the less processed coconut milk.

review/text: Overall this was an OK curry. On the plus side, it's very easy to make - basically cook the beef, then add in the curry mix (2 pouches), simmer and serve.  I added in some vegetables and served it over Jasmine rice.<br /><br />My complaints are that it had more of a sweet taste than I was expecting or cared for. It's a bit oily as well, and could also use a somewhat greater kick with regard to spices. It also had larger pieces of leaves that were not all that appealing.<br /><br />Although I made this with beef, I think it would be as good, and perhaps better, with lamb or pork. The sauce alone is workable over rice and veggies should you prefer not to eat meat.<br /><br />It made for an interesting dish that everyone ate, but I probably would not get this again. I prefer the taste of Indian curries (ideally from scratch, but in a pinch the Taste of India pouches are pretty good).

review/summary: Love it, but don't have a comparison
review/text: I have never been anywhere to eat native curries.  I have ate a few Indian restaurants that my immigrant friends told me were GREAT.  So, just saying, I cannot compare this to 'authentic.'  I'm a Kitchen's of India fan.  This is a lot like those packs, in my opinion.<br /><br />It said to use beef loin.  I wasn't sure about that, so I got top sirlion.  I cubed it. I used olive oil to brown it because I always do.  It's an incredibly easy dish to make.  I served mine with mashed potatoes.  I usually serve curries with rice, but it was on the box and I thought what the heck.  It was good, and offered my non-curry eating child something he liked too.<br /><br />It's good and well balanced.  It tastes fairly bright.  It's spicy hot without being painful.  Like perhaps a medium salsa.  The smooth creaminess of the coconut gives it just a hint of sweetness, without seeming at all sugary.  I can tell the turmeric in it is potent - I have chronic hives and after a big bowl they went away, so it must have a fair bit of good strong turmeric in it.  Kitchens of India's curries also has that effect.<br /><br />One tip is to use a pair of scissors to open the pouches - the coconut is powdery and it will go everywhere if you aren't careful, and the pouches do not tear easily at all.  I tried to grab a knife to open mine- that was a messy mistake.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the lemon grass.  The flavor was great but the pieces were just particular stem-y and dry.  They are easy to avoid though.<br /><br />I like it and would eat it again.  I'd add green peppers and onions next time.  I usually put those in my curries.  I don't know about traditional or whatever, I just know what I like.<br /><br />It was *really* good with top sirlion.  I'm sure it would be great with round steak or mock tenderloin as well.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: This is my first venture into trying Prima Taste Rendang Curry.<br /><br />Pros<br />Very easy to prepare<br />Instructions were simple<br />Sauce was very good<br />Only need to add water and beef<br /><br />Cons<br />Although the flavor was wonderful, I had more than my share of leaves (?)/spice chunks in my portion as did my dinner partner.<br />The coconut powder was a bit lumpy, but I see another reviewer suggested mixing coconut powder and water first and whisk in the paste.  Probably a good idea.<br /><br />I did cook my beef until almost done (rather than to medium done as the directions suggest)and then added to the sauce because the sauce thickens very quickly.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was easy and good.

review/summary: A premium quality kit
review/text: This is a nice pack of dried coconut milk (that mixes very easily) and a generous packet of curry (curry is simply the word for "sauce" in Tamil).  This is typical redang curry, flavored with cinnamon, coriander, cumin, onion, fennel, cloves, ginger, and tumeric.<br /><br />In my opinion, it tastes great.  None of the flavors dominate, but the coconut, lime, tumeric, and cinnamon are the most evident (and in that order) aside from the flavor of the meat (they say mix beef, and it really does complement beef much better than it would duck or pork).  I used a relatively lean cut of roast, and it really helped tenderize the meat while enhancing its flavor.<br /><br />In my opinion, the difference between good curry and great curry is the gravy's consistency.  You want just the right thickness.  It helps to add a little more water than seems right, and then cook in a reduction pan until it's just right.  Patience pays off, as does keeping the heat on the low side after you detect boiling.<br /><br />I want to note that I was impressed with the quality of the product.  When I order a box of food mix over the internet, my expectations are quite low, but apparently I was mistaken.  This is probably not restaurant quality per se, but it's much better curry than I'm used to at restaurants.  I love it, and I'll buy it.<br /><br />I used two pounds of beef, and this fed six people.  I snapped a photo and I'll add it to the product page.

review/summary: Not bad for a 30 minute meal prep time
review/text: Preparation: very easy, but the authentic method requires the meat to be stewed for at least 2 hours; hence if you follow the instructions, chicken would be a better choice otherwise use a good cut of meat; otherwise stew the red meat until it is tender.  All it requires is to pre-cook the meat and then part two is mixing the two packages (curry paste and refined coconut milk powder with a cup of water and then bring the meat back into the fold.<br />End product: quite a thick consistency and I added another 1/3 cup of water to thin it out a bit<br />Taste and texture: not sure about the green lemon grass as that was a distraction, but the curry delivered a good heat and taste, and if you prefer it hotter then add a few flakes of red chilies.<br />Authentic: as close as you could cooking it from scratch, but nothing beats the real fresh ingredients.  But as a 30 minute preparation for a busy work night: it was not bad, and I would substitute a softer meat than using beef.

review/summary: I wish I could give this more stars. Truly delish!
review/text: I love curry dishes. This one from Prima is terrific. It's a little spicy hot, has a nice coconut flavor, and is fairly sweet, which I love. I have a sweet tooth and cook a lot of main dishes with a little sugar and/or splenda. Keep this in mind because if you don't like sweet food, you might find this too sweet.<br /><br />I prepared this with an inexpensive cut of beef, cooked it longer than the instructions called for to tenderize the beef, and put it over rice. One thing I did was to put a little more water than called for -- 1-1/2 cups instead of 4/5's. This way you get a less pasty sauce that pours more easily over rice. I also think if you made this with chicken it would be just as good.<br /><br />The leaves? I guess I'm a little unusual but I actually liked them. I like crunchy foods such as soft shell crabs. So I had no issue with the leaves. If you don't like them, take them out after cooking but before serving.<br /><br />I would say this is enough to serve about 4 hearty eaters, or 2 with leftovers. The suggestion on the box that this serves 15 is unreasonable.<br /><br />I often buy curry and Indian meals prepackaged by Kitchens of India. I love those for the convenience, low cost, and taste ... but the Prima Rendang Curry is significantly better tasting. I think Prima is more restaurant quality whereas Kitchens of India is more akin to fast food.  That's a good way to compare them.  Kitchens of India is a lot cheaper but you get more product with Prima and the taste is considerably better. I would not hesitate to serve Prima to dinner guests but I wouldn't with Kitchens of India unless it was the most casual of circumstances.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this in the future and can't wait to have it again.

review/summary: Prepared in under a half hour: it tastes great!
review/text: My wife and I love many kinds of curries. We either make our own or eat out for curries at least once a month. Rendang style was new to us as was the broad concept of "dry curry." I have since learned that Indonesian style Rendang curries are prepared across a scale ranging from wet and juicy to ultra-dry. Among dry styles, in the very driest form all the moisture in an Indonesian Rendang Curry is absorbed into the hunks of beef, with no remaining sauce for rice to soak up.<br /><br />I watched and kibitzed as my wife first cut two boneless, skinless chicken breasts (approximately one pound) into one inch cubes, then followed the instructions on the box for beef. The quantity of water to be added was 4/5 cup.<br /><br />First she cooked the chicken cubes till about 90% done -- sauteed in a frying pan using pan spray. She then set the chicken aside. She next mixed inside the same still hot pan the full content of the two pouches (paste and dried coconut powder) enclosed inside the cardboard box labeled as Ready-to-Cook Sauce Kit for Rendang Curry as well as the recommended 4/5 cup of water. She then mixed it all very thoroughly and without haste into a finished sauce and then added the chicken back into the frying pan. She cooked the whole combined brew for another ten minutes. Then she served us both the Rendang curry over brown rice. My wife added no other ingredients beyond what the instructions on the box called for.<br /><br />We both enjoyed the resulting product very much. Each of us easily detected and distinguished a variety of delicious ingredients. Striking was the size and texture of some of the larger leaves (which, however, had little detectable flavor). The quantity of sauce that my wife mixed left far more sauce than the chicken absorbed. At table we added, if we cared to, yogurt and shredded coconut.<br /><br />My wife and I have since tried the warmed up leftover curry twice (adding peas and onions) and it tasted just as good as when first made. There was definitely a "fresh" homemade feel both to the first prepared final mix and, surprisingly, to the leftovers as well. The "heat" from pepper perceived by tongue and palate was toward the low to mid level on any  spectrum of hot peppers. I found Rendang curry just a tiny bit sweeter than I prefer. To my wife, however, it was perfect.<br /><br />There was nothing "dry" about our our curry chicken. But it tasted great! And we look forward to buying more.<br /><br />-OOO-

I think the meat's absorption of the flavor is what makes a difference.

review/summary: Great "authentic" flavor, a bit too sweet
review/text: In the box are two envelopes: the curry paste and coconut powder. There is enough to make quite a lot of curry sauce. You can add stuff like fresh bananas, peppers, spinach, chickpeas, raisins, apple chunks, etc. to make enough for more than 6 people. Adding more veggies will make the result more of a stew with more liquid than the picture on the box. I served this curry on top of a mix of brown and wild rice and with sambals (cashew nuts, chutney, mango slices...) on the side. I adjusted the sweetness by adding a bit of cayenne, ginger... whatever spices you like.<br /><br />The box said it's a beef curry but I used lamb instead. You can use any meat or fish that will stand up to the strong flavor of the curry. The flavor is very 'authentic' but it should be because it's a product of Singapore. Singaporeans are proud to be a nation of Foodies.<br /><br />The illustrated instructions are very clear, easy to follow, only 2 steps: saute the meat, mix water with the paste and coconut, put on top of the meat.<br /><br />The two reasons I did not give this curry sauce 5 stars are it's hard to get all the paste out of the envelope. I squeezed out as much as I can, then squeezed the envelope between two chopsticks to squeeze out the rest. The coconut powder was easy. The other reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is it's too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />My guests loved the flavor so the flavor is 5 stars.<br /><br />Oh the nutritional value given on the box is 110 calories for 2 tablespoons presumably of the sauce alone, without meat, etc. Coconut is what makes it so high in calories. Remember that a single serving of the 'final' curry probably doesn't have more than 2 tablespoons of sauce on it.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I had high hopes for this product.  Having spent a fair bit of time in Singapore & Malaysia I have come to love the regional cuisine.  Especially Beef Redang which if you have never had it is a very tasty (muslim) dry style curry.  It is a process to make at home - lots of ingredients and slow cooking to yield a savory curry of tender beef.  When prepared correctly it is a knockout dish.  When I saw this product and the great reviews I thought it might be a good way to make a quicker version when the mood strikes.  Having said that  I cannot recommend this to anyone who has had this great dish nor anyone who would like to try it for the first time.  The kit is easy enough - stir fry beef and then add spice paste, coconut milk powder and water.  Simmer until tender and then voila beef redang.  If only - the mix gave off a faintly chemical odor which i found disturbing and off putting.  Beef Redang usually (like many dishes of the region) has a funky (good) smell from the use of fermented shrimp paste or belachan. its strong but pleasant - this in no way smelled of that.  putting aside the off smell I tried the curry and found it to be not just mild but flavorless.  Maybe this was an issue with this batch but I could no way recommend this product to anyone.

I love the flavor, and the texture is nice too.<br />It does have a couple issues.  The heat was a little light for me.  I want my curry hot, and this was too weak for me.  I did appreciate that the curry taste wasn't too light.  Some of that curry powder you buy in the store forces you to use a pound of it because it has very little flavor.  But this was a good pack.<br /><br />So why the low star rating then?  The price!  I think this is outrageous!  There is no way it's worth what it lists for.  It's good, but not that good!  I'll stick with my "have-to-use-a-pound-in-it" powder.  Thanks.

This may be someone's choice, but it's not mine...decent flavor, great that the spices and sauce are all together and easy to make, but it's a tad pricey for what you get...

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I found this curry sauce kit to be really tasty and able to create a large amount of sauce from one kit.<br /><br />Instead of using the recommended beef I used oven roasted chicken thighs and about 3 lbs of sauteed vegetables.  My veggie mix consisted of yellow onion, cauliflower, broccoli, pasilla chile peppers, and jalepeno peppers.  All cut into 1" - 1.5" pieces except for the chiles which were sliced into 0.25" rings.<br /><br />I roasted the chicken and removed the skin.  I then sauteed the veggies in a large wok with some olive oil.  Once the veggies were near done I added the large bag of Rendang curry sauce, the packet of dried coconut milk powder, and a cup of water.  The sauce mixed with the ingredients well and when all the veggies were thoroughly coated I added the chicken thighs and gently mixed to coated them as well.  Although I did not have rice on my plates there would have been enough sauce to drizzle on the rice without the sauce being watery.  A pasta would have worked well in place of rice.<br /><br />The sauce came out very flavorful without overwhelming the the vegetables or chicken.  The coconut powder -- of which I had some reservations -- added a rich coconut flavor without any chemical or chalkiness.<br /><br />This curry sauce kit made a delicious curry stir-fry dinner last night that was good enough to have again for lunch today.  I would certainly buy this curry kit in the future.

review/summary: Too mild and sweet, but not bad
review/text: I received a single box of Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />We lived in Malaysia and India, so we love curry and enjoy it at home on a regular basis.  I usually use lamb or chicken, but this time I used beef as directed on the box.  We enjoyed the flavors of lemongrass and coconut in this sauce, although it wasn't quite spicy enough for us.  I actually added some extra curry powder to it before it was done cooking.  We all thought it was a little too sweet, but overall was very tasty when served over rice.<br /><br />The current price for this product is around $6.50 per box.  That seems a little on the expensive side when I am adding my own meat, vegetables and rice.  The box made six very small servings (we have six in our family).  If you're looking for an authentic tasting and less expensive curry mix, try Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry.<br /><br />This was nice to try just for the experience, but I will continue to make my own curries because I can do it much cheaper without the mix.

review/text: For full disclosure, I am nearly an idiot in the kitchen.  I can short-order cook some stuff on a griddle and boil water but that's about it.  Mercifully, that's pretty much the skill set needed to make a really tasty dish with this kit!<br /><br />If you're a fan of coconut curries, this one will be a hit.  The flavors are bold and complex, far more tasty than any boxed dinner I've ever eaten.  It's got a little zip in the sauce but certainly isn't "Thai hot".  If you can handle "medium" at most far eastern restaurants, it won't pose any problems for you, as it would certainly be considered less than "medium".<br /><br />Two tips:  1)  Do make sure you pick up (or make) some favorite fried rice or noodles to serve with your curry.<br /><br />2)  The recipe calls for beef tenderloin.  Don't skimp here if you want the "WOW" factor.  I used a cheaper cut of beef on my first try and while it remained tasty was chewier than intended.<br /><br />3)  If you're lactose intolerant, this product may cause you some issues.  One family member (possibly even yours truly) didn't think to take his Lactaid ahead of time and had some minor tummy trouble later.  I wouldn't let that dissuade you from trying, just be aware.<br /><br />I've got another box on my "Wish List" already and can't wait to order it again.  ENJOY!

This was more than enough curry for a family of three (probably ideal for four people) and a great introduction to Indonesian/Malaysian cuisine. This will occasionally be on my shopping list.

review/text: Rendang is a Malay curry dish not easily found in the US so I was surprised to see it offered on Amazon. This package mix is easy to make and produces a lot of flavor. The sauce mix (after adding in the coconut mix) is so concentrated and flavorful that I was able to mix in almost twice as much beef as required and still get good flavor through out. One package definitely produces a lot. There was a bit too much coconut 'milk' in the package so I reduced it when cooking this. The green 'grass' like pieces in the mix are pandan leaves. This ingredient is actually uncommon for this dish, as pandan generally gets added to desserts, like vanilla. Interestingly, I wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't seen it on the ingredient list. All in all, this is a good mix and with S&S, it's less than $6 per pack. That's not a bad deal at all for this hard to find dish.

review/text: I love Thai curries but have never had a curry from Singapore so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was very similar (extremely delicious!!!) to the Thai curries I am addicted to but without having to pay as much and with the added bonus of picking what veggies I want (no cabbage!).  I thinly sliced and sauteed chicken, frozen yellow squash, frozen crinkle carrots and frozen crinkle zucchini and I would not change a thing!  It makes a ton so I invited family over and they all asked for the recipe.  I had to admit that it required no work as I just pulled stuff out of the freezer and used a box curry. No one could believe it and they ended up ordering the curry for themselves.  I didn't share the leftovers and ate them all week at work.  That is saying something as I don't like leftovers!<br /><br />I whisked together the coconut powder, water and paste in a separate bowl before adding it to the meat.  No lumps and a beautiful, and amazing, "homemade" curry! Next time I want to try it with shrimp and bay scallops.  Great.. now I'm hungry.

review/text: This was my first time cooking with a Prima Taste kit and was impressed by the full flavor when making curry.  I opted to use shrimp since I didn't have beef on hand and it still came out very delicious.  The flavors are complex and remind me of Thai and Malay foods I've eaten at restaurants.  For those who don't like spicy foods, this does pack quite a punch but not too over the top.  Only slight negatives - there are a bunch of little leaves (keffir lime leaves, I believe) which need to be picked out before serving or while eating as they are not really chewable.  Also, when mixing in the coconut powder blend which comes in a paper pouch, it can be messy.  It left a bit of powder around the stovetop so take extra care to open slowly and/or over the pot/pan where you are mixing the curry to avoid the extra cleanup.  Bon appetit!

review/text: What can I say?  This is a delicious curry sauce that is easy to use so makes a great addition to the pantry.  Who isn't busy these days?  With running kids to sports practices, school events and music lessons, it feels like we are always on the go and I don't often (okay, never) have time to spend hours cooking.  Having a kit like this in the pantry really does make it easier to feed my family good food in a short space of time.<br /><br />To use it, I get some rice going in the rice cooker, then grab a pack of seafood mix from the freezer.  The seafood thaws quite quickly in a bowl of water so when the rice is almost done, I can add a little oil to the frypan, saute the seafood, add the curry mix....and serve.  The entire meal is ready in the time it takes the rice cooker to cook the rice - couldn't be easier, and the meal is enjoyed by all.

review/summary: savored every drop
review/text: I am lucky to live in an area with a large Asian community, and we have an excellent Malaysian restaurant that we visit frequently, and many Asian groceries.  Therefore, I've been able to try several varieties of randang curry, from both of these types of places.  This is the best version of homemade that I have ever tried.  I'm sure that the addition of several of the traditional spices of the region (pandan leaf, lemongrass, and kafir lime leaf, among others) is what gives it that restaurant quality taste. What is also similar to a restaurant version, unfortunately is the calorie and fat content...and this doesn't even include the meat, approximately 1600 per box, so take that into consideration when determining portion size.  I would suggest you stretch it with some vegetables, potatoes, peas or broccoli would all go well with this.  Also read the allergy  advisory on the packaging if you have any issues with nuts, shellfish, fish sesame , eggs, soy or mik.  I am pleased that they do not add MSG to this high quality product.  Enjoy, but not too much~

review/text: And this was her report:<br /><br />We ate the Rendang Curry last night and it was delicious.  My only negative was a dark leaf in the sauce which was a little tough to eat.  I added chicken instead of beef and also added green peppers and onions to give it more substance, then served it with rice.  I would buy this product.<br /><br />I dock one star fir the tough green leaf, but sounds like a winner!

review/summary: The Bad Out Weighs the Good
review/text: Yes, I have to conclude that the bad wins here.<br /><br />But first the good. It was very easy to make, quick and tasted quite good, surprisingly. Just a little hot..you can always make it hotter if you wish...but very flavorful, very tasty.<br /><br />But the bad..<br />First, this is not going to be a cheap meal. One box would cost about $7. Then you need the meat. 28 ozs. of beef tenderloin, as they suggest, at what, $15-20 a pound and you would be looking at $30-$40-$50 dollars. It is good, but not that good. I used maybe half that amount of beef, because that is what I had on hand and added a lot of veggies, but it still would not be cheap.<br /><br />Then, there is the nutritional values. The box contains almost 1700 calories. Add in meat and serve with rice..Of course they get around that, in their minds but listing the box as containing 15 serving! Really? Well, that would be one very, very small serving. Realistically it contains 4-5 serving. Calculate 20% of the 135g of fat, 20% of the 3450mg of salt..and that is without the fat to cook the meat and/or veggies in or the meat itself...and this is not a healthy dish.

Not so with "Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit, 12.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)", which was a real surprise for me. Easy to prepare as directed, the taste is comparable to that of restaurant-quality Indian food. The spices are well balanced, while the taste and texture of the meat when prepared in this kit is both rich and succulent.<br /><br />For Indian food lovers, "Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit" is a real treat and well worth snapping up.

I mixed the coconut powder with water before combining it; was afraid it might not blend well (has a tendency to do so). Otherwise, all very easy and a great meal served with fresh pita.<br /><br />The flavor is bright and full of zip.

review/summary: Good Curry Taste
review/text: This is an excellent curry sauce and makes for a quick dinner with rice and vegetables.  The intention of this curry sauce kit is to make dry beef curry.  The original idea is for the traditional Singapore dry curry to tenderize tough cuts of meat.  Included in this kit is the Rendang paste and premium coconut mix which is dry.  You are to provide 28oz of sliced beef, chicken or lamb and cook it, then make the gravy and put them together and serve with rice or mashed potatoes.  Since we are vegetarians, I substituted sliced soy meat.  The kit makes a plentiful amount of gravy.  The curry gravy is full of flavor since it contains so many spices and not too hot for our taste.

review/summary: Awesome Curry
review/text: I have never eaten or tasted Singaporean food, but I have tried Thai coconut curry, and this is somewhat Singaporean coconut curry is somewhat similar.<br /><br />A box has enough curry for 4 people (about 2 adults, and 2 children). I recommend using all the curry in one setting, as the curry is in plastic bags and therefore hard to refrigerate unless you put them in plastic container.<br /><br />Ingredients: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon.<br /><br />Preparation: Cut open the two plastic bags into a pan with some water (4/5 cup of water), mix it well, and bring it to a boil.<br /><br />If you dont like your curry too sweet, just add less of the coconut part (the coconut curry is separated from the spicy curry)<br /><br />Like how another reviewer mentioned, this curry is high in fat and sugar, so it should not be the main part of your meal but more like to coat your meats and veggies in something delicious.<br /><br />It was very tasty and I really did enjoy it!<br /><br />The package says there is no added MSG, artificial coloring, or added preservatives.<br /><br />For those with allergens, it contains: soybeans, wheat, tree nuts, and milk products

I did mix it well before adding it in because I prefer to add liquids without lumps (I followed the advice from one of the reviewers).<br /><br />I also used stew meat which was easily available. Next time I do this dish, I will be using lamb.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for anyone who likes curry and has little time to cook.

review/summary: Delicious, Easy Curry Kit
review/text: I admit it, I am a huge of fan of easy-to-use curry kits.  Yes, it is not as authentic, as starting from curry spices, coconut milk, etc.  But, when all you need to do is cook some meat (and vegetables), reconstitute the curry, cook a little longer, and enjoy, what's not to like.  Although the instructions call for beef, the Rendang Curry Sauce kit is very flexible.  You can use any meat you want, add vegetables, tofu, you choose it.  There are 2 packets, the Rendang Curry paste and dried coconut milk powder.  Besides the meat and vegetables, you need to add some water.  It is a little on the sweet side, and for those fans of flaming curry, not hot at all, but that is easy to remedy.<br />If you want a flavorful, simple curry kit, look no further.

review/summary: A Tasty Alternative to Making Beef Rendang from Scratch
review/text: WHAT IS BEEF RENDANG?<br /><br />Beef Rendang, or Daging Rendang in bahasa, is a "dry curry" from Sumatra, Indonesia. It may be popular in Singapore, but they did not invent it. According to wikipedia, the Minangkabau migrated from Sumatra to the Malay peninsula, bringing this recipe with them, and now it is popular all the way up into southern Thailand. If you have never had it, the flavors are reminiscent of a Thai curry, especially Masaman curry, which wikipedia says is a Thai version of a Sumatran recipe, quite likely this one. In fact, the name "Masaman" could well be derived from "Muslim".<br /><br />While this dish can be called a curry, it won't taste like anything you'll find in most Indian restaurants. It has some of the same ingredients as South India, and a number of others that are more commonly used in Southeast Asia. The dish is called "dry" because the practice is to cook it down until the sauce no longer flows, instead clinging to the chunks of meat.<br /><br />YOU COULD MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH...<br /><br />Beef rendang is a reasonably easy dish to make from scratch - IF you have access to the ingredients. Cities like Boston, New York, and many others have groceries that carry things like fresh lemongrass, galanga, kaffir lime leaf, pandan leaf, and palm sugar. There is a wealth of recipes available on the Web by searching for "rendang recipe" (without quotes), and with a modest amount of prep time, you could easily do this from scratch and make something that tastes very close to what your average Indonesian cook would make. That is, it would be "authentic," whatever that means.<br /><br />...BUT YOU BUY THIS MIX IS FOR CONVENIENCE.<br /><br />But maybe you don't have access to the ingredients. Maybe you don't want to take the time to mince all the various ingredients into a spice paste. Or make coconut milk from a whole coconut (something few people do these days, anyway). But you still like the spicy and unique flavor, or just want to try something new.<br /><br />This mix has two envelopes inside. One is a pre-made spice paste mix that has most of the strong flavors. The other is a powdered coconut milk. Buy some beef, and with some water and vegetable oil, and this mix, you're in business.<br /><br />COMMENTS ON THE PREPARATION<br /><br />The recipe is an odd translation from Singaporean measurements. It tells you to buy 28 ounces of beef tenderloin, but then tells you to cut it into pieces 1 cm thick, and requires 4/5 cup of water, measures that are uncommon in an American kitchen. So here is MY version of the recipe, which is basically what is on the box but with some adjustments to the directions, not just the measurements, but also the procedure.<br /><br />Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces, a bit less than 1/2" thick, but it is not critical. Fry it in a wide pan or a wok in some vegetable oil (they say 2 1/2 Tbsp) until it is brown all over. I found that in doing this, there was a fair amount of water in the wok that came from the beef while it was cooking.<br /><br />Now mix in the rendang paste. When you open the coconut milk powder envelope, and you'll see that it has lumps. The easiest path to a smooth sauce is to put it into a sieve or use a strainer with a spoon, shaking the dust and crushing the lumps until it all goes through. The water needed is close to 3/4 cup, but I suggest you start with about half of that, and add more later only if you need to. Stir it well.<br /><br />The package says to cook to the desired doneness. If you want it authentic, you'll need to cook it for a good while, especially if you added as much water as they suggest, in order to get the sauce to dry out. Perhaps you can add less water and save some time. You need to stir it at least every 5 minutes, scraping the bottom to keep it from burning on. Of course, if you get tired of waiting, or too hungry, you can also eat it "wet."<br /><br />An instant mix is supposed to save time and effort. This one does that, but in truth most of the time in making this dish is waiting for it to cook down to thicken, and you have to do that with the mix version, too.<br /><br />You could use stew beef instead of the expensive steak they suggest. That would be a reason to use the full amount of liquid, then slow-cook to make the beef tender and the sauce thick. After all, curries are really a kind of stew.<br /><br />While this mix calls for beef, rendang is commonly made with chicken and lamb, too. I think the original probably used for tougher beef, and perhaps less choice parts than the tenderloin; the long cooking time makes it more tender. You could even make it vegetarian if you like; it would be good that way too. It normally is not made with pork, at least not in Indonesian or Malaysia, because it is a Muslim recipe.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT TASTE?<br /><br />Very good. Not as good as my Indonesian friend Rosita makes it from scratch, or as good as the ones I've had in Indonesia, but very good. My only complaint is that it is a bit too sweet for my taste. The ingredients list both palm sugar and "sugar", presumably the white kind. I could have done without some of the white sugar; you could taste it and perhaps add some lemon juice. The dish could be spicier, but usually Indonesian food is not that out of the pot; instead they have spicy condiments (sambal) on the table for those who like it hot.<br /><br />The box says to serve it with rice (authentic) or mashed potatoes (not authentic, but sounds like a nice idea).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />4 stars. It's a bit too sweet, in my opinion. And the recipe isn't perfect, such as the odd measurements and a bit too much water.<br /><br />ABOUT ME<br /><br />I am a Vine reviewer and got this mix free for reviewing it. My reviews are my own opinions and are not influenced by getting it for free. I taught a Southeast Asian cooking class for 10 years, and have spent a lot of time all over Southeast Asia studying foods first hand.

review/summary: Okay, yes.  I want more.  Happy now?
review/text: I think I must agree with the reviewer who opined that they forgot to include some kind of opiate in the list of ingredients.  Not literally, but boy, the one family sized serving of this got eaten up fast, even by a teenager who is perversely focused on moving the food on the plate around, more than eating it - usually.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of asian cuisine: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian... but have to admit that I'm less conversant with the cuisines of Singapore and Malaysia.  So I didn't bring many expectation to this Rendang curry, other than a vague recollection of a few Malay restaurants years and years ago.  To me, the sauce tasted vaguely Satay-sauce like, but with a gentler peanut flavor and far more complexity in the spicing.  Yes, the lemon grass and other leafy herbs tend to clump up a bit and be overly "chewy", but that's to a Western palate. Asian cultures, which prize such "challenging" textures as beef tendons, would call it authentic, and in any case, there's only a little of that to contend with.<br /><br />The coconut wasn't grainy at all for my family, but then I did cook the pork -- which substituted deliciously for beef -- for 25 to 30 minutes in the sauce, and stirred very thoroughly. (This makes the dish more authentic, as I understand that Rendang curry is suppposed to poach the meat, then fry it as the liquid boils off at the end.)<br /><br />Being cheap, I'd be thrilled actually to be able to buy the sauce packets alone and provide my own can of coconut milk.  I cook mostly from scratch and a near-entree price just for the stuff that goes ON the meal is a little rich for my family's budget.  On the other hand, it's dead simple to make the meal with the sauce so perfectly seasoned - I could see spicing it up to taste, but am kind of glad I didn't succumb to the temptation to add a bit of fresh grated ginger or lime or whatever else I had on hand to "brighten" it - for once, here's a prepared food brand that actually tastes like it hasn't been sitting on a shelf since the last Presidential election.  Convenience and not being tempted to take the family out for a (much more expensive) dinner of the same quality are pretty good arguments for this little kit.<br /><br />If you aren't near Asian Markets, here's your fix.  A bit costly but oh-my-gosh-I-want-some-right-NOW good.

review/summary: Authentic Singaporean curry-in-a-packet.
review/text: Having spent a decent amount on time in SE Asia (and Singapore specifically) during my childhood, I frequently get cravings for Singaporean-style curry, hawker food and snacks.  As a result I am constantly on a hunt for fresh and authentic ingredients when and where I can get them to attempt to reproduce those dishes at home.  I even have friends send spice mixes and tinned pastes  from Singapore when the markets here fail me.<br /><br />What makes this curry-in-a-packet so good is that it has 2 separate pouches for the spice mix and for the coconut mix. This ensures freshness and authentic flavour when the coconut is added to the mix at the correct moment during the cooking process.  Also, other Singaporean brands do not include the coconut  mixture (requiring additional purchases) or the coconut is already added (affecting flavour).  Prima Taste is one of many curry packets available in Singapore and has a loyal following for its authentic spices.  This is one of the brands that I am sent if my Singaporean friends don't use it all up first!<br /><br />Needless to say, I am really happy that Prima Taste is now available in N. America and through Amazon.<br /><br />To sum:<br />+ Authentic spices in a vacuum-packed pouch<br />+ Pouch of correct amount of coconut mixture (coconut milk plus fresh shredded coconut). So there is no need to buy a separate can of coconut milk and shredded coconut to be partially used.<br />+ All-in-one - just add meat<br />+ No need to hunt down separate ingredients.<br /><br />The only CON is that the prices are double that of Singapore but hopefully should come down as more people discover Prima Taste.

review/summary: Fairly simple, very mild, quite pleasant
review/text: This curry kit is simple to prepare - just one level of complexity up from simply using a jar of curry paste.  You mix the coconut powder with water (not easy to get it lump-free) add the curry paste and bring to the boil.  Add fried beef.  Stir and simmer.<br /><br />The result is far too bland for my taste.  I fried some onions with the beef and chomped on some jalape&ntilde;o peppers when I ate the meal, to add some kick to it.  If you like very mild curries, this one may suit you.<br /><br />I had it with steamed white rice and a nan bread.  The sauce is creamy and delicately flavored.  It was runnier than it should have been.  If you try it, I suggest using less water than recommended - perhaps half as much - because you can always add more if it threatens to boil dry.  It does after all describe itself as a 'dry beef curry'.

review/summary: Redolent of kaffir lime and coconut.  Pretty good, but not spectacular
review/text: I am a big fan of Thai and Indian curries, and even like that curious yellowy-brown curry that can be found at some Japanese restaurants.  Therefore, my eyes lit up when I spied this curry sauce mix on the list of items that I could obtain free through the Amazon Vine program.  "Ah!" I thought. "A new taste adventure."<br /><br />Sadly, it was not to be so. This sauce is strongly fragrant of kaffir lime leaves and coconut.  The lime turned out to be the dominant flavor.  While I do like kaffir lime, I have come to expect a complexity of flavors in a good curry sauce, and that's where this mix fell short. I was waiting for that "Ahhh...curry....mmmmm..." moment, but it didn't come.  The flavor was oddly pedestrian, almost (but not quite) flat.  While it was a satisfactory dinner for me on an ordinary night, it's certainly not one that I will put on my short list to serve to guests.  Or even my long list, for that matter.<br /><br />To be fair, sometimes dishes with a blend of spices require a bit of time for the flavors to come out.  I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator, reheated it, tasted it with hope in my heart, but detected little appreciable change in the flavor.<br /><br />The recipe called for beef tenderloin, but I used regular old stew meat, and it came out fine.<br /><br />Singles, take note:  Although it yields less than the 15 servings promised by the nutritional label, the recipe makes a generous amount of sauce. It calls for 28 oz of beef, so be prepared for leftovers.  Dividing the contents of the envelopes in half would probably be messy.<br /><br />Amazon does carry some very good curry mixes.  I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1D19A">Kitchens Of India Curry Paste For Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Both of these pastes are on the greasy side (I skim the grease off the top before serving), but dang are they good!

It's probably sacrilege, but I liked it better with seafood (scallops!) and chicken than with beef, and I added vegetables, too.

review/summary: Easy-to-prepare curry dinner
review/text: This curry sauce mix from Singapore makes for an easy-to-prepare dinner that's nice for weekday evenings. The directions call for you to pan-fry beef with vegetable oil and cook it until it's nearly done. In a saucepan, you mix the contents of the two packets included with the mix with water and bring the mixture to a boil. Then you simply add the beef to the sauce and simmer it until it's done. It was easy to make and did not require additional ingredients other than the meat, cooking oil, and water. One thing I did notice was that the coconut power was very lumpy. Of course, I added it to the water so I had to spend some time squishing the lumps before I added the curry sauce. You might want to put the powder in the saucepan first and whisk the water into it before adding the sauce. Anyway, it mixed up well and I didn't have lumps in the final product.<br /><br />The kit contains two packets: one is a powdered coconut mix and the other is the curry sauce mix. The ingredients are fairly basic, although the coconut mix contains sodium caseinate, which I find tends to dry me out when I encounter it in coffee creamer. I did not notice any ill effects from it in the curry, so perhaps it's a matter of how much sodium caseinate is in the products.<br /><br />The flavor was very nice and the curry was more sweet than hot. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd rate it about a 3, so if your tastebuds aren't up to the heat I think you'd still enjoy this. It's not bland by any means, but it's not overwhelming, and I think most children would probably eat it, too. There are pandan leaves in the sauce, which had a very mild flavor (not oniony or anything like that). I made plain rice to go with this and just put the meat and sauce over the rice.<br /><br />This makes a nice one-dish meal and would keep well for leftovers if you can avoid eating all of it at once. I used three small steaks, or about 12 ounces of meat, to go with this. Of course you can stretch this out if you want with more meat, or you could substitute chicken for the beef. Also, using quinoa or barley or some other grain instead the rice would bump up the versatility of the mix.

review/summary: Sweet after taste, easy to make
review/text: We're a house of curry eaters, no doubt. What I learned with this Rendang Curry mix is that I prefer Japanese and Indian curries. This Rendang was too sweet for me and there is NO heat in this at all. My parents both liked it and said it was correct compared to rendang style sauce they have had elsewhere over the years. Preparation was very easy and pretty fast. I used very thin sliced top round steak and browned it in canola oil per the directions. The sauce and coconut milk come in seperate pouches and mix together to a boil before you add the meat. In less than 30 minutes we had everything and rice on the dinner table. The only other complaint was from my Mother who felt the dried green onion pieces were bitter and took away from the overall taste of the curry sauce. If you perfer more "savory" than "sweet" in your curry, this is probably not for you. Otherwise, our family enjoyed this product.
