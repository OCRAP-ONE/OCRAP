review/summary: Good hot chocolate
review/text: To me, nothing beats homemade hot chocolate created with milk, a molinillo (for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVREHK">Vasconia Molinillo</a>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U5GWWY">Callebaut Extra Bitter (70%) - 11lb Block [Item: 7030</a>] chocolate in a clay pot on the stove.  However, this hot chocolate is very good compared to the powdered packaged hot chocolates I mixed with water in the past.  A 16 count package really only creates eight 6oz hot chocolates because there are two DISCs; one for the milk and the other for the syrup. My only complaint is that the 6 oz. serving size is too small for the price.

review/text: I bought this for my husband and boy were we disappointed, to say the least. My two sons, 5 and 3, even didn't like it. The after-taste is just odd and was so unpleasant we just tossed it out. Spending $.99 on Swiss Miss would be a tons better, even though thats pretty bad stuff too. If you're willing to spend the $8-10 on this stuff, go and try Land O Lakes Supreme Chocolate or Godiva's Milk Chocolate and enjoy a nice cup!

review/summary: Love them!!!
review/text: The Honey Nut flavor is my favorite, with Apple Cinnamon next.  When comparing these to a popular national brand that starts with "Q", the Lundberg rice cakes are crisp, while the national brand is soggy by comparison.  Rice cakes are not going to blow your socks off, they're just rice cakes.  But for those who enjoy rice cakes, the flavoring of the honey nut is just sweet enough when I have them with my morning coffee.  An excellent product.  My only gripe is that, as with other organic or gluten-free items, Amazon Grocery does a terrible job keeping these things available for ordering.  On 11/2/07, the Honey Nut Rice Cake is "Unavailable for ordering".  That's the most frustrating aspect of Amazon's grocery business.  I LOVE the service they provide, and their prices are great, but they just don't carry things consistently.<br />10/9/2008 UPDATE - Once again, amazon is out of stock on this item.  They have it listed with a 3rd party seller, and the price is over $8 higher than amazon's price.  I would love to continue ordering my favorite grocery items from amazon, but they are absolutely HORRIBLE with managing their suppliers and inventory on grocery items.<br />4/23/09 UPDATE - Amazon out of stock again, I last ordered these March 2009.<br />8/22/09 - Was able to order them, showed in stock with no limits.  Cool!!  Trust me, if you want a sweet tasting snack that is free of the common allergens, this is well worth the try.  I recently ordered the buttery caramel flavor when the honey nut was out of stock, and I still find the honey nut to be my favorite.  The buttery caramel is good too, but I love the honey nut.<br />10/30/09 - Out of stock from amazon again.  Emailed the outsourced customer service in India, got a generic reply.  I hope these come back in stock soon.<br />6/30/10 - Amazon seems to be on a roll.  I've been able to order these consistently since November 2009.  Thanks, Amazon, much appreciated!!

review/text: These things are a very healthy alternative to nearly any other munchy. If you have a hole in your belly... these thing fill it with nearly no health consequences. Plus, they are cheaper by the oz. and MUCH better tasting than anything found in local stores (sorry Kroger and Food City!). They do crumble from time to time... in a sleeve of 12... perhaps 0.5 to 1.0 will end up as crumbage. But we all eat the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of chips anyway. Besides, that's what teeth are for.<br /><br />Let's just say I am here for my second purchase.

review/summary: decent, but not very 'dental.'
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. It also doesn't have any breath freshening ingredients. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. These are MUCH better than the pounce soft and chewy varieties or any soft and chewy treat that can stick to cat teeth and cause bad breath and tooth decay. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have many beneficial dental ingredients either, but they are another pretty good one as they too contain vitamins but with a little bit of added breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. This treat my not help teeth, but they definitely won't hurt them. Also there are vitamins in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 3 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have at least one dental ingredient.

Lately, I've been forgetful and last time they didn't have the kind I wanted, so I've picked up a few small bags (3.25 ounces) of Jack Link's Jerky at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The first one was Turkey Jerky and it was excellent. Today, I picked up a bag of Teriyaki Beef Jerky. This stuff is just excellent! It's very lean and thin cut, nice and dry, wonderful tasting and has a very low fat content. The nutritional specs are sensational for a snack item and the calories are not particularly high. This is just about the best jerky I can recall. I may have to switch brands.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

For example, great in fajitas, meats used for cheese steaks, salsas and asian dishes~ just to name a few. You will always find a canister of Redfish Magic in our spice cabinet and all of our visitors ask me to write down the name of the product so that they can order it when they get home.

I rub lemon juice all over the fish, cover it in the Blackened Redfish Magic seasoning and place it in my hard anondized skillet with no oil, butter or cooking spray.  I cover the fish and let it cook for 3 minutes on each side.  It is fabulous.  I also sprinkle it on the asparagus I bake with lemon and it is super delicious too!  Bravo!!!

review/summary: My favorite since childhood
review/text: YES we will never run out of this again !<br /><br />I cook a lot of shall we say "robust" foods at home - from smoking my own BBQ with chili's flown in from New Mexico (the Dixon Hatch, can't be beat) to making my own gumbo.  One of our favorite dishes is blackened salmon - it's healthy, very flavorful and most importantly the kids love it.  Paul Prudhomme's spices have always been my favorite although I have to admit I was raised on them (as now are my kids) so I'm probably biased.  I've tried other seasonings (even by other 'celebrity chefs') and I have found them to be too flavorless, or waaaaay too salty.  Mr. P's is definitely my favorite, and for decades we've been buying the teeny glass bottles in the grocery store.  I go heavy on the spice, and these jars would only last 2 meals and all too frequently the wife would come home with giant filets of salmon from Costco only to find out we're out of seasoning.  We like salmon, but honestly once you have blackened salmon it's as hard to revert back to plain salmon as it is to go from home-smoked brisket back to burgers.  Recently I've made several purchases on Amazon and have been totally impressed, so when I saw they carried these giant jars, at a great price, I immediately purchased them.  Now we'll never run out - I'm stoked !<br /><br />Here's how I use this:<br /><br />- cast iron on medium heat, or in the smoker with coals in the meatbox.  Medium because in the past I've used high as recommended and had too much trouble controlling the cooking (flipping before burning, etc) and generated way too much smoke.  cooking on medium doesn't produce as much of a crust as on high, but the kids like it.  I could potentially smoke it with the blackened seasoning, but I actually prefer to grill it instead to at least get a little bit of a crust, and just to get it going.  salmon doesn't need the tenderizing of a low and slow, and I actually don't want the hickory in this dish.<br /><br />- i don't dredge the salmon in butter.  this is also part of why I don't get the nice crust I should, but again the kids like it.  I just coat the pan or grilles with Pam, place the fillets on a plate, and smother both sides with the spice.<br /><br />- throw it on the heat, and cook normally.<br /><br />Like I said, this won't get you the great crust.  I do get some caramelizing action, but nowhere near as much as if I dredged the fish in butter first and flash fried them.<br /><br />A couple notes on the spice itself:<br /><br />1. This is NOT a hot spice.  It's a very flavorful spice.  If you want to heat it up you can add your own ground pepper to the mix (may I suggest the Dixon Hatch).  However, if British food livens up your taste buds, you may consider this to be hot.<br />2. Like any spice, this will last much longer in much better shape if you store it carefully.  Most people put their spices right by the stove, where they are subjected to heat and humidity.  I'm guilty of this, but I'm aware that both are destroyers of spice.  If you can, keep this spice away from both heat and humidity and seal the cans well.  I'll probably place them in a large zip lock once I crack one open.<br />3. If you're new to spicy foods in general, or to cajun/creole spices I suggest you try a small bottle first and make sure it's for you.<br />4. If you're on a low sodium diet, check the specifications first as Cajun/Creole spice blends tend to have quite a bit of salt in them although the Chef Paul brand has much less (by flavor at least) than many other brands I've tried.<br />5. Don't forget the Blackened Steak Magic !!<br />6. I haven't actually received this spice yet.  Chef Paul is a large, very established brand and I presume consistent quality across their product line, but everything I'm writing is based on my usage of the teeny glass bottles.  I've been purchasing Chef Paul for 20 years now though and have no reason to believe that there would be any difference between this giant spice-head sized container and the teeny containers.<br /><br />If you're into spicier foods, or venturing for the first time into Blackened Redfish, you honestly can't go wrong with this guy.  Try a tiny bottle and find out - then get this can, stock up, and never run out again.  I'm stoked at the possibility of being able to blacken up fish on demand without ever having to make another last-minute run for the seasoning.  Thank you Chef Paul and Amazon !

review/text: This is a must-have for me.  I use it as a rub, mostly for chicken, despite the fact that it's marketed for fish.  Using it as a rub, it's easy to blow-through a standard sized jar pretty quickly,  so I was happy to find that I could buy a canister instead of relying on the grocery store spice jar size.  I've been using it for years, and, despite trying other brands in a pinch, I haven't found any cajun spice blend that even comes close to this one.

review/text: I won't use any other commercially-produced brand ever again. This is all I'll ever need. This stuff is great for making blackened fish. It's nice on chicken, pork and vegetables too, as a general seasoning. A decent amount of heat, but not too spicy...adds flavor without being overpowering for mild foods. These are big, honking cans! Even if you use this stuff frequently (and I do) it'll last you a while. I got fed up buying the tiny 2 oz. glass bottles from my local grocery store. These 2 24 oz. canisters will last me a while. 4 stars instead of 5 because my shipment was delayed...nothing to do with the product, though.

review/summary: The Best Cat Litter Ever!
review/text: I have used this litter for 4 years and I wouldn't use anything else. I have 3 cats, and because I use this litter, there is no cat smell at all in my apartment. I know why this litter is the #1 selling cat litter in Japan! In addition, this litter really doesn't track much at all and it is environmentally-friendly.<br /><br />I buy the largest bag of litter, and it lasts a month for my 3 cats. Several things help this litter last: 1) use the litter scoop that's made for this litter; 2) pour the litter only 1.5" deep at a time; 3) be sure to scoop and stir the litter -- the stirring is very important -- at least once a day so that it can do its work; 4) keep the rest of the fresh litter in an air-tight container so that it doesn't absorb moisture from the air before you use it.<br /><br />This litter works so well that my cats happily use only one litter box. That's an added benefit!

review/summary: My favorite non-clay litter
review/text: I have tried just about all the more 'natural' litter options, including the pine pellets, pine clumping, and corn products. The pellets are good but with 2 cats we go through them quickly. The pine clumping is hard to scoop and we also go through it lightning fast, and it tracks like crazy; my whole house was covered in pine flakes. The corn smells awful to me so I can't tolerate my house smelling like that.<br /><br />This litter is the best of the bunch. It absorbs odors, dries poo so it's easy to scoop, lasts quite a long time, and doesn't track much. I didn't really experience the 'cloud' when I poured this litter, at least nothing like clay. None of the natural litters really cover the odor of a fresh man-cat poo, so that doesn't really bother me. It dries quickly and the odor dissipates.<br /><br />I'm continuing to use this litter indefinitely, I really like it!

This stuff can soak up a lot before it needs to be thrown out. As far as tracking...it definetly doesn't track like regular litter but you will find some a few feet from the box, but we do keep our box pretty full of litter. As the name says Litter Pearls, they are not really pearls, they are jagged edged more like little rocks. My cat is pretty picky and I thought she might not like them but she has had no problems.

review/summary: Best Natural and Quick Flea Control
review/text: An odd spin on this product is that it rapidly de-fleas an infested home (or apartment), with ongoing maintenance of combing pets for fleas, etc. I researched everything out there and found one small lone reference to silica as a solution. I also learned that fleas reproduce in stool (thus, the litter box). An infestation that rapidly progressed in my daughter's family home was finally cleared, in a very short time, with improvement (my infant grandson's bites) noted overnight, after adding this to the cat box (along with regular litter) and sprinkled around the home in corners, where walls met carpet, and any place that could be "damp" and a breeding ground. In the sprinkling, we were generous and left it there. It has to be silica (in this case, gel), though. The round litter product (sand) does not work. The initial recommendation I found mentioned products available through hardware stores that I was unable to locally find and were very expensive and large purchases online. The base was silica, which is why this product did the trick. We keep the boxes sprinkled each week as a precaution.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I bought several bags of this and signed up for auto-ship based on reviews on the product's website. Big mistake. The pellets / crystals / pearls / whatever do track through the house. And if I step on one, they hurt. So I can only imagine they hurt the cat's paws as well. Dust, dust, and more dust.  When I fill the litter box, there is a cloud. A cloud that I can taste in my mouth. And then, I sneeze. Not so good. I have to cover my mouth when I clean the litterbox.  And, no matter how hard the cats try to cover the solids, it doesn't happen.  So the "aroma" lingers in the air.<br /><br />I opened another bag thinking maybe I had a bad batch, but no. I had such high hopes for this. But, no go. Money wasted, which annoys the heck out of me.<br /><br />Maybe I am expecting too much, but the hunt for a better litter goes on. Overall, there are no "cheap" litters especially for the purpose for which they are being used! I cannot believe it is sooooo hard to find 1 litter that does the following:<br /><br />1)  Doesn't track throughout the house<br />2)  Doesn't create a dust cloud when the litter box is being used (if it's not healthy for me, it surely isn't healthy for my cat that is right there using the litter).<br />3)  Covers up odors<br />4)  Doesn't need a gas mask worn when cleaning the litter box.<br /><br />Like I said, I really wanted to like this litter, but I have to give it a negative review. Sorry!

review/text: We were looking for actual pearls, or semi-spherical litter pearls like this product USED TO BE.  But this is no longer available in the USA it seems.  However, if you were looking for plain jane crystals, you found them.  And they are the originals without useless scents or whatever.  Except for the texture which is jagged enough to rip up the skin of cat and kitten paws.  We've gone back to clay litter until we can find a source for the gentle stuff.<br /><br />Ref the person who didn't bother to clean the litter for 22 days and expected it not to smell... duh.  Read the instructions.  You should clean it at least once every three days , and throw it away once a month and put all new in.  I was using it for years before they turned it into this broken safety glass texture stuff.  All it does is stop the stink, it does not mean you have zero maintenance.

review/text: I tried this litter because I LOVE Ultra Pets original formula, but hoped this one would solve some of the tracking problems that I had with the other.  I was disappointed in a number of ways. I don't think it tracked any less (and boy are these crystals hard on the feet!).  The odor control was not as great and although I didn't have quite as terrible a problem with the absorbency leaving an occasional wet slurry, it was not as good as the original, either.  And if your scoop is anything like mine, you'll be throwing away some perfectly good litter with every scoop because some of the crystals are simply too large to go through.<br /><br />  Using this formula confirmed my theory as to why the absorbency and odor control was so much better int he original than in any of the other litters I have used that are out there.  The round crystals in the original formula do not pack so tightly together and allow air to circulate so that the silica crystals can release moisture.  Any of the tiny crystal litters out there can't compete in this aspect, no matter what brand they are.<br /><br />I'm going back to the orignal Ultra Pet cat litter.

review/summary: Love it! (with a caveat)
review/text: There are several types advertised by the same producers but I find they are not all alike. In the first place I ordered the pearls but these are crystals--and they are large and leave a mess unlike the smaller weight bag called Ultra pearls. This brand is confusing as I subscribed to the Ultra Pearls and then accidentally cancelled the subscription. I've re-enrolled two times before, and received something other than what I'd originally ordered. So I cancelled again.<br />I really liked the Ultra pearls but it's apparently not available as a subscription program so I ordered two bags to take advantage of free shipping.<br />Although it does release dust when poured out of the bag, this product does the best in covering odors and drying out solids so that I can spoon out and throw away. I freshen the litter box every two weeks and I find for my one adult cat, that 1 5-lb bag (or 7? it's the small bag) will last at least a month, sometimes 5 weeks so it's comparable to the other popular crystals option that offers two bags that I HAVE to change every two weeks.<br />I really love this product. :D

Daily use seemed less dusty than other brands, and it did a decent job at odor control.<br /><br />However, cleaning and refilling the cat's box with this product raised a silica cloud that bothered my lungs. Also, our cat tracked it all over the place -- stepping on litter pearls is like stepping on bits of broken safety glass. The cat's box emitted alarmingly loud crunching noises when the cat used it.<br /><br />We've gone back to ordinary clumping. My hubby still sneezes, but on average, lung irritation in the house has gone down. We feel safe walking barefoot again, and the cat is once again a stealthy poo-er.

I am pretty sure you could tell it was not chocolate balls inside of a package, but one chunk of chocolate.)<br />I had bought this many times in Hawaii. I missed Hawaii so much so, I was so happy to find this on Amazon.<br />I will NEVER order any food from this seller and Amazon. Their quality control apparently some issues.

review/summary: Great Lentils
review/text: Palouse Brand lentils are the best brown lentil I've found. Lentils are my favorite bean/pea and I use various varieties (red, green, brown, and black) in pilafs, veggie burgers, soups, and casseroles. The Spanish Pardina variety from Palouse has a nutty, richer flavor than regular brown lentils usually found in grocery stores. As other reviewers have noted, they hold their shape well when cooked, more like French green lentils, and are less "mushy" than regular browns after cooking. All of which makes them easier to add to recipes and provide great flavor.<br /><br />Palouse Brand split green peas were also of great quality.  Nothing can imitate fresh green peas for a true green pea soup flavor, but Palouse's split green peas are the closest I've found. They also cook up easily and hold some of their shape and remain a vibrant green color when cooked.  I use these in a "faux" guacamole dip, and, occasionally, as an additive to regular guacamole which cuts the calorie content.  I've also make some healthy and tasty sandwich spreads using these in combination with basil, tofu and avocados.  Great flavor without the fat and chemicals in commercial mayonnaise spreads.<br /><br />Packing was an unsealed plastic bag (which did allow for some loose lentils and green peas) inside a burlap/hopsack cloth outer bag which was firmly stitched closed. The outer bag fully contained any loose products and makes a unique presentation. The bags can be reused.  I haven't found any rocks, or debris in either the lentils, or the the split green peas.  The product was very clean.<br /><br />Finally, with the drive to reduce the chemical processing and additives added to our foods, GMO free products help fit the bill. I live in the Pacific Northwest and Palouse is, figuratively speaking, in my backyard.  It's nice to support a local producer and to know where and how my food is produced and by whom.  Great product.  Hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

review/summary: Ignore the Ignorant
review/text: Unlike the other review that suspects Twinings is the British version of Lipton's, Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. Earl Grey tea was named after Charles Grey, Second Earl Grey (1764-1845), and is a mixture of black tea and oil of bergamot (a small acidic orange). It is said that Earl Grey learned the recipe of this delicious tea from a Chinese Mandarin and brought it home to England, where it has been a favorite ever since.<br /><br />Now, it is debated that Twinings was the first to blend the tea, during the time of Charles Grey, but even if it is not, it has a long tradition of blending it just the same.  Like anything else in life, you have people that think they're experts on a subject just because they like something a lot, and they're quick with guesswork.  I will only drink Twinings tea, as other companies insult the name of tea, such as Tazo, who have all their teas blessed by a shaman, and Bigalow, who have no idea what they're doing.

review/summary: Heaven in a cup of tea
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/summary: Exactly what I expected
review/text: I purchased the Eagle Creek ProTech Cube, size medium, to hold a portable air pump I purchased from VIAIR (Model 85P).  The pump only arrived only with its outer packaging/box.  I searched for something to accomodate the pump and came up with the ProTech Cube which encases/holds the pump perfectly.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the case lacks rigidity.  With the zippers and outer casing having some give to them, it allowed me to squeeze the case and enclosed pump into a space next to my spare tire.  I more rigid case would have not allowed for that.<br /><br />The case is tough enough to protect the contents but again, flexible enough to allow it to fit into some tigher spaces.<br /><br />The case is a bit on the pricey side but definitely does its job well.

review/text: I bought the medium size for the purpose of protecting and carrying my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KFONIU">Bose SoundLink Wireless Mobile Speaker - Nylon</a>..Well, I was not disappointed!! The case space is wide enough for the speaker and the  wire/plug. The medium size measures about 10.5" (L) x 7.5" (W) x 3"(D).  The dividers(2) inside the case are detachable and can be velcroed either on top or bottom or on the sides to add cushion and protection. The handle is a very big plus for portability.  When I unzip the case open and lay it down on top of a table, the space inside is roomy enough to accommodate my upright Soundlink with its speaker cover flipped down, without taking it out of the case, thus keeping the Bose stand/cover clean.  This will definitely protect my new Bose inside my luggage when I travel next time and keep it dust-free when I am not using it.  Bought mine in Bark color from another website for &lt;$20, so, shop around.

review/text: I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me.

review/text: I absolutely love this product especially the malted milk and the vanilla variety. 3 stars though for the sugar/chemical content....its a shame that with this premixed variety, it contains over 7 teaspoons of sugar per bottle, not to mention cholesterol and saturated fat! Not only that it is packaged in #7 plastic which contains BPA.  The powder variety contains less sugar plus you can package it yourself in non-bpa containers if you like. As a note, #3, #5, and #7 containers have BPA in them. I doubt that carnation will stop selling their product in nonBPA containers since they are useful to them and also since its not unlawful for them to use this harmful chemical in their packaging. BPA is an endocrine disruptor, and it is linked to obesity among other health problems. At lest recycle your bottle when you are done with it so that it does not sit in a landfill for over 100 years, leaching BPA into the groundwater like so many other companies bottles do.

review/summary: Eating away
review/text: I put i my first order for Tender Turkey Tuscany for my cats in 2009. I have two kitties and one was 3 mo and one 9 mo when I first began ordering this for them. The 9 month old was already a wet food eater, but the little 3 month old had lived in a rescue situation most of her life and was only familiar with kibble. The older kitten began to gobble it up immediately. The little female was not so sure what this stuff was. The first night she had it, she had two or three bites and went back to her kibble. But she soon learned that life was better with a mixture and she began to eat the Turkey also. I could have stayed with the less expensive kibble, but I feed wet food because I want the male to get all the fluid in him that he can to avoid urinary tract problems. So I feed wet and dry.<br />This food lasts for a long time. Both of my kitties are "free feeders." Their wet food is put out and left for 24 hours until the next day when two new cans magically appear for them. The kibble is always available. The get to go outside a little while each day while I watch them, and we play with Da Bird and other toys almost daily. So, even if food is out, they stay trim. But the food stays good for longer than 24 hours. They eat all they want and then I leave left over wet and some dry food for the ferals who live around in the back yard. The ferals eat the Turkey after it is 24 hours old and they do not turn up their noses. When they are through, the birds come in and finish the plate.<br />It is now July 2011 and the kitties still eat the Turkey Tuscany. They don't get it every night, but they do get it about once a week. It has remained a mainstay of their diet while other things have come and gone.<br />So I am really pleased with the Turkey Tuscany. My kitties eat abot 7/8 of a can and leave a few bites for the ferals who gobble it down with their dry food. With my kitties, the feral kitties, and then the birds finishing up any stray bite, it certainly never goes to waste. I recommend it highly as it has a long lasting tradition of being well eaten at my house.

review/summary: Good Ramen, but Can't Beat Original
review/text: Although, I understand that the Goreng part of the name means noodles without broth, I'll never stop calling this ramen (meaning noodles with broth). The Indomie products that I've tried (original, satay, and pedas) are all delicious. Make no mistake, not all oriental noodles do it for me. When our local Asian market ran out of Indomie, the owner told me to get a different brand that he promised I'd like better. I ended up throwing it out, because the taste was just awful. Indomie original, has a mellow taste, with enough spice to keep you interested.<br /><br />This Satay version maintains the classic flavor, adding a strong nutty notes along with a crunchy fried onion packet for more texture and flavor. This is by far the most acquired taste of the 3 varieties that I've tried so far. While it's still a good choice to mix things up, I could not eat Satay every night.

review/summary: concentrated means multipurpose
review/text: Since this vinegar is concentrated, you can dilute it to whatever strength you desire for cooking, or you can use it full-strength as a power solvent for cleaning tough stuff.

review/summary: Great as mulled cider for holiday tree lighting in work place
review/text: We used this at work for our hospital holiday tree lighting and it was a big hit.  It made the large room smell great and surprised everyone that it was something hot and perfect for a holiday touch! This was our first official tree lighting ceremony and this will be a nice addition each year!

review/summary: yummy
review/text: Quite tasty; mild chocolate flavor, good crunch, the right sweetness.  Maybe a teeny bit sandy, but that doesn't stop them from being a good snack or dessert.  Probably perfect for someone who doesn't like too rich a chocolate flavor. Also very tasty with peanut butter spread on them.

review/summary: Love these cookies!
review/text: My son absolutely adores these cookies (I prefer the chocolate)!  These are the first tasty gluten-free animal cookie I've found and I love that he can now have the same snack as the kids at day care on animal cookie days!  (In fact, the daycare kids prefer his animal cookies over their own!)

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: My son has life threatening allergies to milk, eggs, and peanuts. He also cannot eat wheat. These cookies are great for snacks and he really enjoys them. I don't have allergies, and I think these have a bit of a grainy texture, but they aren't bad. Perfect for kids with allergies, especially since they look similar to the teddy or animal snacks kids without allergies eat.

review/summary: Expire in less than three months!!!
review/text: I ordered this product for my 6-year-old who has allergy to wheat. The order was placed on Jan 31. I received eight boxes of cookies with expiration date in early April 08. I do not expect my son to eat up 8 boxes of cookies in less than three month!  The cookies do taste OLD and STALE. My son refuse to eat them. It was a total waste. The good part about the cookies is that they are not too sweet. I really wish Amazon could post and update expiration date information on the web.

review/summary: looks & tastes similar to nonGF
review/text: My son loves these animal crackers.  They have been such a great treat for us to have!!<br /><br />Although he is picky, he will alternate b.t liking them and not liking them, solely b.c he will "burn out" and get bored w. the snack.  When that happens we switch to the chocolate ones.<br /><br />Another awesome animal cracker that is GF is Kinnikinick (sp?) brand.<br />I wish Amazon carried that in the subscribe and save program too.

review/text: My boys love these little cookies and the mini-bags are easy to take on the go.  I like that they are GMO-free as well as allergen free, including no soy!  Wish they were organic, but you can't have everything!  These are a must-have in our house.

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I really love these tiny little cookies.  Someone mentioned in their review that they liked them but they were a little "grainy".  Personally, I like the grainy texture so like everything, it's a matter of taste and preferences.  I recently had to take an unexpected trip out of town and it was so nice to be able to grab a few packs of these cookies to throw in my bag.  The individual bags are small but are the perfect size for "one serving".  I have missed animal cookies ever since I had to start eating gluten free.  I might be 65 years old, but yes, I still eat animal cookies :-)). I was so glad to find some good tasting gluten free animal cookies finally!
