review/summary: shake diet
review/text: Okay, I bought this product to do a shake diet. Instead of two scopes, I use one unless I was going to exercise, then I use two scoops. This is real good. I use water for my shakes so it won't be more calories. If you ever decide to do a shake diet, just know you're going to piss it off if you use water, milk have you on the toilet so it's best to do the water. I love this product! I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain. I even feel it once I'm done but later that day or the next day, the pain is gone! If you buy this product, you'll love it! Great taste too if you know what you're doing.

review/summary: Great taste, Great Results
review/text: This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results.  This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake.  It fills me up, it can be used as a meal replacement.  It also has helped me increased muscle size much faster then previously.  This product is great and I recommend it for anyone from an everyday Joe just trying to get into shape to people who are very serious about working out.

review/summary: Very nice flavor
review/text: I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.

review/summary: I use it as chocolate dessert replacement.
review/text: If one loves chocolate, this works great in a very low carb diet instead of sugar laden cake one can buy. I use 1 1/2 of the enclosed measuring spoon full of it and add very little water to it. Have it with my afternoon coffee like a small bowl of chocolate. My cravings for sweets have vanished. (1) Have taken the glamor out of chocolate. (2) Have made it practical. (3) In spite of being near the fridge all day working from home, I restrained myself to looking forward to this one dessert once a day. Now I'm used to it and feeling in charge.

review/summary: Alright
review/text: I have just started using this supplement after workouts and it has taken me a bit to figure out a taste combo that I can live with. The milk-shake flavor may be a little bit overboard. I would probably like just a normal chocolate flavor. The recommendation is two scoops but I use one and I still feel the taste is quite strong. I mix one scope of this with 2 cups of almond breeze almond milk and sometimes some frozen strawberries - blend it in my blender and it is a great drink. It also provides enough chocolately flavor to cure any possible sweet tooth I might have.

It tastes great and mixes completely.  No clumping.  I have only tried the chocolate ice cream flavor ( and the chocolate peanut butter in the packets) so I can't speak on the taste of the vanilla or strawberry.  If you are looking for a good MRP, this is it.  Don't waste your money on anything else.

I usually make a drink after exercising but with classes starting back up, I plan on switching to mornings since I'll be preoccupied during class.  The only downside to the product for me was trying to find the perfect amount of 10oz. of water to get the shake to taste perfect (I think I managed that feat twice), but nonetheless, it's still good.

I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe. Get the chocolate and give it a little more water than it calls for, it's great.<br /><br />Gonna try the strawberry one next, hopefully it's like the chocolate one.

review/text: I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.  But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point.  After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it.  I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters.  I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low.

I noticed a distinct difference int he flavor when baking cookies.. So I ordered this and baked some of my own cookies, gave them to friends and they too were amazed.  I have used a drop of this vanilla even in my water or coffee or tea and it perks up the flavor.  There is no added sugar and yet it adds a bit of sweetness perhaps because of the vanilla beans inside.. The aroma is delightful

review/text: There is absolutely nowhere to find Goya's Adobo (seasoned salt) within an hour of where I live, and I grew up with it so what a relief to buy it in bulk and know I don't have to go on an expedition to hunt it down. Like our Supreme Court Justice nominee, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, I'm a Nuyorican, and yep, we're nuts for our special food, prepped just the way Mom did. Bet you anything she's got bottles of this stocked in her kitchen, too! The flavor's a must for Spanish rice with anything you like to add to it, and for stews, roasts and fried meats, and to make black beans (and any other kind you love. Garbanzo beans? Ummm!). It comes with lots of different added spices, but Cumin's my favorite. And free shipping when ordering $25 or more? Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: fine substitute for the hard to find Senseo
review/text: The Senseo pods are, at the time of this writing, unavailable anywhere.  Not in stores, not from Amazon, not from Senseo.  According to Senseo customer service, they will be available "this summer", but only through Amazon and Senseo.com.  No longer in retail stores in the US market. These Melitta pods work fine in my Senseo machine.  Good froth on top, look just like the senseo pods.  I have a few senseo pods left; might do a side by side taste comparison.  Anyway, at time of writing Amazon is out of stock on these Melitta pods; everyone else must have heard they'd work in their Senseo machines and are buying them up.  If you look in most retail stores you won't find them; currently they are only available in Walmarts. Walmart's website will tell you if the store nearest you has these in stock.  Melitta's website says they will expand into other retail stores soon.  Good news, because I have lost all confidence in Senseo for making their pods online only.  I've always ordered them online but not everyone wants to buy 6 bags/case at a time, especially if they like to have a bag of regular and a bag of decaf going.  Then they'd have 12 bags in the pantry.  How silly.<br /><br />Editd to add: Melitta makes two kinds of pods, this one in a bag like Senseo's, and another in a box.  If you are shopping for Senseo replacements, buy this one (in bag). The boxed variety don't fit.

review/summary: It replaces Senseo coffee pods and is a fine alternative!
review/text: Senseo coffee pods are frequently difficult to find in stock at our local stores and now that Amazon no longer offers subscription service, I decided to try the MELITTA Coffee pods because they fit the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker Machine.  Guess I should stock up to avoid "out-of-stock" or "discontinued" situations again because we use our Phillips Coffee Pod Maker Machine several times every day.  That said, if the cost of these coffee pods keep rising, we just may switch to another brand of coffee pod machine or depend entirely on our automatic coffee maker for a good hot cup of java.

review/summary: Bitter and not as good as Senseo Dark
review/text: I don't like these near as much as the Senseo dark pods.  I noticed immediately they have a more bitter taste and require half and half to taste decent.  They do make a nice froth and I got used to the taste after a couple packages.  However, I was going in expecting them to taste the same and they definitely do not.  Unfortunately Senseo has pulled out of the US market so these are what we get.  It is better than nothing though, and at least they are available locally.  It looks like the Senseo pods are back in stock but they went up by 33%.

review/summary: Made for Senseo
review/text: The Senseo pods made by Sarah Lee have reportedly been discontinued and are almost impossible to find. Melitta has introduced a new series of pods that are designed to be used in the Senseo and fit perfectly.The packaging and appearance of the pods are very similar to the former Senseo pods. Melitta has also produced a series of pods in the past which are too big for the Senseo machines and do not fit without forcing. Please be sure to order the Melitta pods which are designed to be used in the Senseo. The Keurig machine completely dominates the market for single serve coffee makers and most coffee producers have discontinued making pods for the Senseo. Just when I thought I would have to junk my Senseo machine, Melitta introduced a new line of pods for the Senseo.

I either needed to find an alternative or retire my trusty Senseo machine.  This was on sale, so I decided to give it a try.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I thought it had a great rich taste, and it fit my machine perfectly. This is available in Subscribe & Save, making it an even better price.  All-in-all I have been quite pleased.

review/text: Used to use Senseo dark roast and loved it.  When Senseo left us high and dry, I tried several other options, including the coffee duck, it was ok, just a little more work and mess.  Wolfgang puck was good but didn't fit exactly right to get the double cup.  Then I found Melitta, BETTER than Senseo.  I hope Melitta doesn't fade away or jack up the price, Senseo did that before it disappeared. That will send me back to perking a pot.  Try it, it's delicious, full bodied, satisfying, rich dark roast with the creamy foam we love..  Love it.  Also, love having it delivered automatically once a month, another great perk when you shop at Amazon.

I also feel that when I am making coffee for others, specially my mom, they tend to like their coffee on the weak side, and even one coffee pod is too strong for them when used with 10oz of water. I prefer my coffee strong and 2 coffee pods used with 10oz is just amazing.

review/text: I still have about 8 pods of Senseo Columbian left. Not sure why Columbian packaging since it was the last one left in my Sumatran batch. Never noticed when I placed in storage after purchase. Obviously I like dark roasts, and I usually buy Trader Joe's Dark Roast beans for another residence. I have tried many Senseo pods and ended liking Sumatra best from them. Then the price went up. So...I did order this six-pack of Melitta dark roast to give it a trial run. I brewed my Senseo Columbian and enjoyed. Then I brewed the Melitta Dark Roast to compare in one sitting. At first taste I thought, ugh! Then, after letting it sit a bit I quite enjoyed the Melitta. Good thing, eh, since I have the six pack. It's quite likely I shall order again - unless lured by some deal. this product definitely stands up to comparison, and arrived in perfect order with nothing wrong.

review/text: I was excited to try this product as I was missing my Senseo pods and couldn't find them for a decent price.<br /><br />I received my box and when I opened the first package of coffee it was a mess. Grounds fell out all over the counter. About 6 pods were partially sealed and have busted open to leave a mess to clean up. Now I am feeling upset over this purchase as I thought I was getting a good deal. I am scared to see what mess I am going to find in the remaining 5 unopened packages. If 6 pods are bad and a mess in each package...Mama's not gonna be happy at all.<br /><br />As for the taste it is good. It is a bit bitter but still tastes good with my creamer and stevia. Amazon is great as always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am very dissatisfied with this purchase and will not continue my subscribe and save option. I will be taking this to the manufacturer as well.

review/summary: Great Substitute for Senseo Medium Roast
review/text: The Melitta Coffee Pods are a great substitute for the original Senseo pods, which became so expensive, if and when available. The coffee taste is pretty much the same, maybe a bit milder, which for me is a good thing. The packaging is the same as the Senseo, just with a different brand name. This is my first experience with the Melitta coffee and it is all positive. I will be happy to use these pods from now on, instead of paying almost 50% more for the Senseo. There is no difference in the quality, and the price is much better. The pods fit perfectly in the Senseo coffee maker.

Gave them a shot, and very pleased, will definately get these again, they are every bit as good as the Senseo, pod, and I did a side by side test, no significant differance, might even be a little more frothe with the melitta.

review/text: Very hard coating and the flavor is mediocre. Not as good as expected. I've found jordan almonds at Target (not my favorite store by any means-but credit where credit is due) that had a much nicer taste and were not so break your teeth hard... they were also less than half the price of these. Will not buy these again sadly, because I liked that they were supposedly made by a family owned company.

review/summary: Recommend Bequet But Not This Flavor
review/text: The Celtic Sea Salt flavor was the least favorite among the men I work with. One thought it was too salty, one said it tasted less sweet, I thought it tasted like caramel.<br /><br />Most of the men liked the Apple flavor the best. They said it tasted like a candied apple, the state fair, and Halloween. I thought it tasted like caramel.<br /><br />One said the Chocolate flavor was the best.<br /><br />I think the Espresso tasted less like caramel so I liked it better.<br /><br />My husband said the chipolte flavor was best with a slow, pleasant afterburn. That was the only one I kind of liked.<br /><br />Buy the variety pack and try them all out before you settle on your favorite.

review/text: Just seeing a picture of this bag of decadent caramels makes me drool!  These are the most wonderfully soft, rich, buttery caramels ever, and the added deliciousness of the Celtic sea salt is nothing but sinful!  I am finally getting to buy another bag now because of a promise to myself that I would only buy one bag a month - otherwise, I would probably be ordering these heavenly goodies by the case!  And by the way, it is possible to get two of them in your mouth at the same time! :o)

review/summary: Paprika, Glorious Paprika
review/text: I have used this paprika for years.  Originally I used the one that was sold specifically by the name Szeged.  Could not find this and stumbled across this in an Hungarian food store in Chicago. I have used it ever since.<br />It gives your food a zesty taste, wonderful color, not overpowering, and all around good.  It is great on any type of meat, in soups, green peppers, in goulash, stews, cabbage and noodles - you name it.  I'm allergic to tomatoes, so this does the trick - gives color and wonderful flavor.<br />My husband loves it and is a great believer in it as a seasoning.  We use it for everything.  Well worth the price and the length of time one can keep it.<br />Go PAPRIKA!

review/text: This is nice, fresh, flavorful paprika with real Hungarian flavor.  I use quite a bit and it is not bitter or sour tasting at all.  The lid slides on but it is nice and tight and keeps the air out. There is a shaker inside so you can use the paprika right out of the tin rather than having to transfer it to another container. I keep the tins in my freezer to preserve freshness and they do not show any signs of rust or corrosion.  I like to use one of the empty tins on my desk because it is exactly the right size to hold pens.

They are about 75% longer than a normal one so not quite double length. There are no other differences. Makes a good gift.

review/text: This syrup makes wonderful shave ice. If you are used to sugar-free sweeteners, you won't taste a difference between this version and the sugar-loaded one. I bought this because I wanted to try the flavor, and now prefer this syrup over the sugar-free DaVinci and Torani that I had been using for shave ice. (I still like those for flavoring water and soda, but this makes more authentic shave ice.) I just wish Paragon made more sugar-free flavors.

review/summary: One of the Best Microwavable Meals, but Beware of Trans Fat
review/text: This was one of my college staples. I had at least 5 of these a week for years.<br />After a while my parents said that it contained trans fat.<br />I initially ignored their claim after reading the package and seeing "0g Trans Fat."<br /><br />However, I later read that food manufacturers may put 0g if it contains up to .5g. There are two servings in this package, which is why they can say that it is "trans fat free." If it only listed one serving, this product would have to say 1g trans fat.<br /><br />This is still my favorite microwavable noodle product, but I no longer purchase it. Unnaturally occurring trans fat is simply not good for you, no matter how delicious. Should this product ever remove the trans fat, I would rate it 5 stars and go back to eating it every day.<br /><br />Look for partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients. It's not worth it.

review/text: Unlike the countless other mint green teas I have tried, the flavor of Twinings mint green tea leans more on the spearmint side than peppermint which makes it more palatable to me.  I don't want to experience drinking a breath-mint and this tea delivers in both taste and quality.  It is a refreshing tea with 100% natural ingredients; not artificial nor bitter.  Often, I'll amp up the flavor by adding some fresh mint I have growing in my garden.  It's a real treat and actually livens me up if I have a case of the blahs or an upset stomach!  Although I mainly drink it iced, serving it hot with a splash of milk is also delicious! I like this tea so much, I have it on subscription. :)

review/text: After having this green tea/mint mix in a small dosage (included in a pack with Lemon, Jasmine, Earl Grey, Green tea variants), it started as my favorite mix.<br /><br />I decided to buy a whole pack of green tea with mint mix to enjoy the taste more often but with time, the flavor that fascinated me, started to faint. Probably because I've started to taste tea without sugar at all.<br /><br />Overall the tea is great. The quality of the green tea is great, and mixing it with mint it's even better.
