review/summary: Homemade, in India that is!
review/text: In the summer of 2000, I stayed with various families in India and most all served me excellent dishes with various spices to make me smile. Well, since my trip, I've not had a Indian meal served with such excellence until my dear ol' mother had me try a can of Madras Sambar! What a surprise!!! In addition, this is probably the best canned food meal ever!<br /><br />She made mention too how with this 12 pack, each can is only $2.50 with the free shipping off Amazon. That's cheaper than what most stores sell them for. And it's delivered to your doorstep! Thanks mom!

review/summary: The first disappointment for me from Jyoti
review/text: As someone who loves Indian/Bangladeshi food, I have been trying various JYOTI foods, given the good reviews here on amazon.<br /><br />Well, this is the third item I tried and I didn't even finish my serving. I found a rather offputting flavor in the stew/soup. Maybe it's the tamarind. Not sure. (And I say this as someone from the Caribbean who used to eat tamarind sno cones and as of last year had some homemade tamarind honeyed-juice my sister made--she has a tamarind tree. I'm not anti-tamarind.)<br /><br />Whatever it was, this was not like ANY lentils or lentil stew or lentil soup I've had in assorted Indian restaurants in the last 30 years. It tasted overly earthy and odd. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Dunno. But I wish I could be as enthusiastic and give a thumbs up like the others here. I do. But I can't. I really didn't love this.<br /><br />I'm gonna open another can later on and try again. But this has been the one major letdown for me from Jyoti. I almost made this one star, but since I give room to the fact that the problem may lie with a batch or with something askew in the can I opened, I'll leave it at two stars.<br /><br />Now, I'm afraid to try another Jyoti from amazon. I may head to my local Indian supermarket and see if they have the saag and try one can. After this experience, I won't pay for a whole case again. Bummer.

review/text: Sambar out of the can isn't very great, but cooking it with some water, tamarind and onions for another 10-15 minutes turns it into really delicious authentic south indian sambar. I would say after cooking it tastes as good as sambar at any good south Indian restaurant here in LA.

review/summary: You will smell like Urine!!!!
review/text: Madras Sambar from Jyoti is really tasty stuff. Its made of special a type of lentil and eggplant which gives it its unique tang taste. The taste is acquired and i loved the Madras sambar when i had it in childhood the first and only time with rice cake idlis.I have been craving it ever since but never could reproduce the same taste in several sambar dishes i tried till now. Very Good with rice foods!<br /><br />The bad part of this particular product is if you have a little too much, say 1 whole can in a day, the thing will digest and produce ammonia or ammonia smelling thing. I think it comes out through sweat glands. You know what that will remind you of ? Urine!! lol. So have this in medium amounts only in my opinion.

review/summary: Intense Ginger Experience and Digestive Aid
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the six pack of Organic Ginger Teas, an amazing savings on Amazon by buying in bulk!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the "universal medicine."  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy."<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Ginger Too Far
review/text: I have purchased Yogi tea for years now.  This tea is fine, but I was disappointed by the slight misinformation.  I'm not sure why they simply call this tea "Ginger" at least on the front of the package.  I am now paying much more attention to the actual ingredients of Yogi teas because this has 4 other ingredients of which 3 are in greater amount in this one.  I just wanted plain ginger tea and this has licorice, lemongrass, peppermint & black pepper.  Black pepper & licorice are very strong flavors especially if you aren't aware they are steeping in your cup.  It's a fine tea, yet holds a misleading title.  That's all.  Thank you.

review/summary: A yogi tea with a hint of ginger
review/text: The Yogi brand "Ginger Tea" has a whole lot of flavors other than ginger.  It reminded me of the Yogi Kombucha and the another Yogi tea that was called 'relax' or 'stress relief'.  I guess if you like how those tasted, you'll like this one.  I'm used to the Thai or Malaysian brand ginger mixes that contain only ginger and perhaps some sweetener, and those will reward you with the real gingery heat, punch, and bite.<br /><br />I would call this a "Ginger-flavored Yogi Tea." Kind of like how Cherry Coke was more Coke than Cherry.  If you like the taste and character of ginger, you'll be dissatisfied with this.  I should have read the fine print on the box which proclaimed, "a unique blend of herbs and spices to complement ginger's piquant flavor."  The Triple Leaf ginger tea product at least claims 100% ginger.<br /><br />Come to think of it, if you grate fresh/frozen ginger and steep in boiling water, the flavor is a lot better than any of these packaged products.  But that would be too easy...

review/summary: Spicy Soothing Ginger Tea.
review/text: This is my favorite Yogi tea so far. I've tried two of the detoxes and the Relaxation one. I've also tried other ginger teas. But I always come back to Yogi Ginger. (Twinnings has a good one too but I can never find it).<br />I love this tea. It's gingery, spicy, and sweet with a hint of other complementary herbs. This tea is so relaxing and soothes my stomach after not-so-great menu choices. I love ginger so I like to let it steep for a long time with hot hot water to get it extra spicy. It can also be made for very light and delicate flavor if that is what you like. Just adjust the steeping time.<br />Ginger is good for the body but I don't always have time to buy and boil fresh ginger to make myself tea that way. And honestly I'll only take time to do that when I'm sick. Also, I doubt anyone wants to bring a bag of fresh ginger root to work to make tea at the office. So this tea is perfect. It has great flavor--you can really taste the ginger. It's totally portable so it nice way to get my ginger any time, any where.<br />Try it. If you're not sure whether you'll like it or not, try steeping it for only a short while and gradually amping it up until you decide how intense you like to take your ginger tea.

review/text: I'm in my 8th week of pregnancy, and I'm currently experiencing the dreaded morning sickness (which is really all day sickness).  I have read that ginger helps with nausea, so I've ordered crystallized ginger, and this ginger tea.  I can't stand the crystallized ginger, but the tea has been very helpful.  Early afternoon, when my nausea is at its peak I make a cup of this, and my sickness is all but gone.  I don't like the smell, but I hate the smell of everything nowadays.  It's pretty spicy and it warms my mouth, throat and chest, and when it hits my stomach it neutralizes the nausea.  Love it.  It's awesome.  Not sure if I'll drink it once my sickness is over, I don't like the taste, but my taste buds are off because of the pregnancy.

This tea reminds me of that, although the spicy bite is probably due to the black pepper added. I've tried other ginger teas, lemon ginger teas, green ginger teas - they all seem to have a dry/dull ginger flavor, and I always come back to this one. I love this tea with a dash of honey. It's sweet and spicy and gingery goodness.

review/text: While I do like this product I must say it is NOT for the person looking for something that is a delicate ginger flavor. You MIGHT get that if you just run hot water over the bag and not let it actually steep in the mug. I went by the directions that say steep 5 to 10 minutes and boy I wish I had not done so! It was so strong that instead of fighting migraine like ginger is supposed to, it made it worse for a little while. I suggest if you want something light in ginger flavor that you go for sweet ginger peach instead of this product. If you want STRONG knock you off your chair ginger flavor that feels like a kick in the face, get this one.

review/summary: Great tea during my pregnancy!
review/text: I've been an avid fan of yogi teas for years, especially the green teas. I've experimented with quite a few other brands, like stash, celestial, etc, but this brand always seemed to work best, be it the green teas, relaxing teas, cold seasons, etc. I tried the lemon ginger tea while pregnant, especially since I had constant heartburn and indigestion. A cup of this tea with some honey worked so much better than popping tums in my mouth. It's very soothing to your stomach. It also helped relax me enough to be able to sleep in my 3rd trimester. There were times I would pass out even before I finished my cup. When I got sick in my 7th month, I drank this tea with the cold season one, and it worked wonders. Since it helps with clearing out your stomach, I'm assuming it also kept my weight in check as well, though I ate a lot during this pregnancy. My sister-in-law is pregnant right now, and she claims it really helps her with her indigestion as well. I highly recommend this tea.

review/text: When it comes to tea, I really can't get enough flavor. I love the various spices, so I was thrilled when I found this tea. It is intensely ginger, but also amped up with several other spices (Ginger Root, Lemongrass, Licorice Root, Peppermint Leaf, Black Pepper). Trust me, it isn't for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Though there are only 16 bags (less than the usual 20 for most brands) per box, each bag lasts two full (large) mugs without becoming weak. So I find it worth the money. Though I frequently buy tea on Amazon, I actually buy the Yogi Ginger tea from Trader Joe's as it is typically quite a bit less expensive there ($2.29 in my area at this time).

review/summary: Organic ginger
review/text: Ginger is excellent for many things that ail you and this product is reasonably priced and suits my purpose.  Nothing thrilling to say, if you want to get some ginger and you can't trek to the supermarket to get fresh ginger then this is just what the doctor ordered.  Also it can be used to make multiple ginger beverages.

review/summary: Great tea at a reasonable price
review/text: Ginger tea is a great drink at any hour of the day. Gives the tongue that little tingle which is a catalyst of synapses in one's brain or a digestive panacea for one's stomach. Refreshing in the summer and warming in the winter, it is an all-seasons drink. In a pack of 6 boxes, can be purchased at almost 1/2 the price one would pay in a retail store. Great deal!

review/text: These were perfect for medium-sized canned escarot.  I could bake them in these shells, so it makes an impressive treat.  Be aware most cans of snails this size (appropriate for these shells) will contain 20 or so snails.  One of the shells I received was rather brittle, and I am concerned about serving it, afraid some could come off into the food.

review/summary: Cheap price, cheap product
review/text: Bought these to replace some old shells.  They were in worse condition than my old used ones.  So brittle and most broke with the first use. Unless making it for 2 people you'll need more more than a dozen to serve.  Also, If only making it for 2 people, how do you find a can of snails with only 12?  I find they always come in 20-24 quantities.  The ones that do come in 12 count are GIANT snails (read: way too large to fit in these shells, you'd have to halve the snail to fit, leaving you with 24 snails) So either buy multiple bags of crappy shells, throw away half your can of snails, or serve it 2 days in a row.  None of which I'd recommend. I found the shell size to be small, I enjoy a large shell that can hold lots of butter. Mmmmmm<br /><br />I would recommend these if you are a 1 time shell use person, but honestly who does that!. They are cheap and will last you a setting or 2.  Once a shell cracks I find them useless as they wont hold the buttery good stuff.<br /><br />I would recommend checking out this product.  Great price, good quality, and some cans of snails to boot!:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7G76">Roland Snails & Shells, Giant , 12-Count Tubes (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: I usually buy my Charms lollipops at BJ's, but they only sell the assorted box.  That is why I was willing to pay more for this product. When I received the package the box looked old.  Like it had been setting around a warehouse for some time.  I decided to try one and regretted it. The lollipops are way past their "freshness" date.  They are nasty.  Don't waste your money purchasing from this seller.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I spent my money.  I requested a refund.  I think I'll stick to buying them at BJ's where the lollipops look and taste fresh.

Secondly, as I opened the first blow pop, it looked pretty old but I was expecting some to be in that condition. But basically every single one I opened so far, each one looked very old and not fresh. I am very disappointed that this company would send off the product in this kind of condition. I will never order from this seller again and very disappointed. Wish I could receive my money back but I know that will not happen. Save your money and purchase somewhere else.

Big mistake the first package was all dirty with bugs, corn silk, and mold. I expect the package to have some corn silk and some (2 or 3 ) molded husks, but when I have to throw all 3 bags,  away that makes me mad and I'm not going to return husks I already opend and tried to wash. So it was a big waste of my money and thoses of you who gave them a good review were either working for them, lieing or are lucky they got good husks.

Cosmo is sliding along the floor and contorting in ways that aren't possible.They're both longhaired, fluffy cats and Darwin's fur is sticking up at weird angles and is studded with the leftovers.Now they're beating the tar out of each other with looks on their faces that say, "I will kill you -I HATE YOU!." "Wait! Lets get the drawer open-she's holding out." Darwin gallops into the room and jumps-he's airborn-sailing thru the air with fur rippling. Why? Joy? "Whew. I'm starved. Let's eat first." These are normally sedate kitties. I better keep buying it for my safety.

I have the epipen, avoid at all costs wheat germ in my shampoo, and any would be assassin need only have a handful of flour to do me in.  Note to my enemies, retaliation can come at any time. j/k<br /><br />Anyway, losing bread and pasta is one of those lamentations for all Celiac, related intolerances and allergies face.  This corn pasta is the best though.  You need a meat sauce in my opinion to cover up the corn, and a good rinse is vital, but treat it like pasta.  Boil in water, but don't overcook.  Rinse with cool water and bring the temperature to cold quickly.  Serve immediately with sauce, in baked casserole or as a macaroni and cheese.  Buy in volume and the price is more than reasonable (we buy bread from Jason's deli for 12 dollars a load, this is a godsend and far cheaper).  It will crumble over time in the fridge, but so would good homemade or store bought pastas.<br /><br />If you are not allergic to Wheat, I'd still bet on another pasta, but my Wife isn't wheat free and enjoys it(or grins through it).  I call it a good meal and worth the time.

review/summary: Cheap, nutritional, but not vegan.
review/text: I was shopping around for nutritional yeast, and based on the price and the reviews I found online, I decided to go with this brand.  It is definitely packed with nutrients and is a great source of many vitamins and minerals.  It's flavor is good, although this is the first nutritional yeast I've bought, so I can't compare it to other brands.  The smell upon first opening the jar seemed a bit strong, but it wasn't as bad after using it and opening/closing the jar a few times.<br /><br />I am mostly writing this review to let other potential customers know that this product is NOT VEGAN.  I guess everyone defines veganism a little differently, but this nutritional yeast contains whey from milk, so if you don't want to eat dairy, or can't for some health reason, you should be aware of that before you purchase it.  I will quote the ingredients list from another website:<br /><br />"Other Ingredients: Nutritional yeast, calcium carbonate, whey (from milk), magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, choline bitartrate, niacinamide, potassium chloride, d-calcium pantothenate, para aminobenzoic acid, bromelain, GTF chromium yeast, inositol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, selenium yeast, papain, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, biotin, folic aicd, potassium iodide."<br /><br />This is the same as what is on my jars' labels.  You can get the entire nutritional facts and ingredients from the Twinlab website [...]  It's a nice product at a reasonable price in a large quantity.  In fact, it's going to take me a while to go through two pounds of it (how much yeast can a guy eat?).  When I finally do finish it, I won't be ordering again due to the dairy, but if that doesn't bother you, I would actually recommend this product as it seems to be a good deal.  I gave it four stars because the dairy thing was really my fault.  I should have done some more research of my own.<br /><br />Happy shopping.

review/summary: Power-Packed Nurtition
review/text: Brewers yeast is loaded with many essential nutrients.  It is packed with nutrition.  I especially love this Yeast Plus product as it is even more loaded with vitamins and minerals.  Brewers yeast is not something to write home about as far as taste goes.  So, I mix a heaping tablespoon into my smoothie every time I make one which is several times a week.  That covers up the taste.  I especially take this product because it is loaded with B vitamins and potassium.  Though brewers yeast is not great tasting, another advantage of this product over others is that it seems to have a much milder flavor.  Sure, it's not ice cream, but it will do a whole lot more to benefit your health and well-being.

review/text: I'd give it three and a half stars, couldn't decide between 3 and 4.<br /><br />I use a lot of nutritional yeast, mostly for popcorn flavoring. The taste of this one isn't my favorite. It is a rather strong taste, but I'm glad to have it for variety. Good value for the money.<br /><br />It is a dense powder. Most of them are light and flaky. This means I can keep a lot more in a small container at work.

review/text: This is the first time I tried this yeast, and since I liked it, ordered another one. It is quite powdery and not flaky. It has a strong smell I'm not used to with yeast, but I like it nonetheless. We use it on popcorn and in soups and (as hippie as this sounds) put it on our fried tofu with soy sauce. I trust Twinlab and that is why I was willing to try it.

review/summary: Who expected to find milk products in "nutritional yeast"?
review/text: TwinLab super rich yeast had RAVING fan reviews; and looked to me like it would be the right choice.<br />I am on a totally vegan diet for personal health reasons, and "nutritional yeast" is a frequent ingredient in vegan recipe books.<br />...Imagine my disappointment when i received the product (Amazon really is Amazin' at fast shipping), pulled out the product, and tried a taste.<br />Something didn't seem right.  A closer look at the ingredients told me why.<br />The third ingredient is "whey (from milk)".<br />Egad, boys and girls! THAT's NOT VEGAN!<br /><br />Well, I'm not blaming anyone but myself.<br />I lapsed my habit of reading the label before buying, and did so at the wrong time.<br />And I will find the "nutritional yeast" of my dreams; oh, yes I will.<br />I know you are out there somewhere; and I shall not rest until I have found you.

I've found after drinking a cup, I have less of a need to take ibuprofen or other OTC pain killers, as well as feeling much more calm and relaxed. I'm starting to suspect that it's made out of unicorn tears and rainbows, because it is that magical.

review/text: This tea is great. I like the taste. It helps with constipation too. But what I really found helpful about this tea is calming my PMDD. My PMS was getting really out of hand. I was getting to the point where I could hardly function during my pre menstural. When I drink this tea regularly it's incredible the difference I see. Really helps me with my irritability and bloating. This tea has become a necessity for me.

review/summary: Best natural pain relief out there for severe menstrual cramps
review/text: This is a MIRACLE tea!<br /><br />I'm a 24 year old, otherwise healthy & fit woman who has always suffered from severe menstrual cramps. Every month, I used to take LOADS of ibuprofen and pamprin for 3-4 days at a time so that I could function and go to work. I saw this in a health foods store and tried it, because I was desperate and it's cheap! I thought the benefits would be as a placebo, or the psychological comfort of drinking something warm when you're in pain. I was mistaken. I feel it actually does a great job of preparing my uturus for "that time" and keeping it relaxed and efficient when the time comes---meaning a lot of effective, natural pain relief.<br /><br />How I use it: I start drinking 2-3 cups of tea per day beginning 3-5 days before my period starts, and then even more if I start cramping. The first day or two of my period, I might have 5-6 cups of tea. This tea TASTES GREAT (not medicine-like at all) and you really can't overdo it. I've been able to wean myself off the ibuprofen to where I'm not taking more than the labeled ibuprofen dosage (about 1/4 of what I was using before). I don't suffer from prementrual symptoms (just agony during menstruation) but I have girlfriends who do and they swear this stuff works for that as well. Amazon has the best price anywhere. Do yourself a favor and try this at least once. If you're a MAN reading this (I know, what are the odds): buy it for your significant other! She'll thank you for life (or until menopause)!

review/summary: Seriously impressive
review/text: I'm an active woman in my late twenties with no other physical problems apart from severe PMS/PMDD (symptoms including 3-4 day long migraines, fatigue and body pain, skin rashes and emotional upsets). I started drinking 2-3 cups of this tea (single-strength) about a month ago and noticed a HUGE improvement in symptoms- going from that laundry list above to a few hours of fatigue and a headache is enough to make me stick to this in the long term. Just to add, this list doesn't include cramping so I can't say whether it would help with that.. though I imagine it might.<br /><br />Previously, I've tried other herbal teas and never noticed significant differences (improvements/ worsening). This tea was the first to make such a significant difference, and not have any side effects either. The taste and smell were both quite soothing too!

review/summary: magic tea
review/text: I love this tea, I have used it for years.  I used to use plain raspberry leaf tea (that's what relaxes the muscles and eases cramping), but this tea adds other ingredients, plus ginger, which is just so warming to the body, and when it starts warming me up, I feel more relaxed, and that makes the cramps lessen too.  Sometimes I still pop an ibuprofen if it's a bad month, but always having this tea on hand really makes a difference for me!<br /><br />I drink it throughout the month too, often in the winter because of the warming qualities, or when I feel stressed, because the muscle relaxant ingredients do help with that as well.  I'm a skeptic about most things, but I'm a believer in this tea!

review/text: This tea has worked miricles!  For at least 6 years I have had migraines associated with my period. I reacted to the perscription migraine meds.  As the years past, the severity of the headaches increased as well as the duration.  I have taken this tea the last two months and only had a very minor migraine the first month- none the second- which has never happened in years. I drink cup every other day when I'm not on my period, then increase it to 1 to 2 cups a day the week before.  Then the week of my period I drink 2 to 3 cups a day.

However, the cramps I had been suffering all of a sudden whooshed out and left me feeling better than I do during the other three weeks of the month.  It was amazing!

review/summary: This tea is like a Christmas miracle.
review/text: That's the text message I sent my sister yesterday.  And, yes, it's only August.<br /><br />I hate to sound overly dramatic and prone to hyperbole, but this tea is worth its weight in gold.  My periods have been more and more painful, especially in the years after ditching the pill and turning 30.  Days 1 and 2 are pretty horrendous, with me laid out on the couch with a heating pad and 3-4 Aleve every 8 hours.  I get the kind of cramps that cause hot flashes and bouts of nausea, and about the only thing that helps is lying completely still with my eyes closed.  I'm fairly "lucky" that days 1 and 2 never occur on a work day; I don't know how I'd get through the day.<br /><br />This time around - at the advice of other reviews here - I drank two double-strength cups of this tea right as my cramps were hinting their arrival (so, a total of 4 tea bags that evening).  I drank another bag of tea first thing the next morning, and was able to walk my dog for 2 miles in the heat and humidity.  Major, major feat for the first 12 hours of my period.  Throughout days 1 and 2, whenever I felt cramps coming back, I immediately brewed a bag of this tea and drank it.  Within 15 minutes, the cramping was gone.  That's faster and more effective than any pain reliever I've tried.  Normally, I end up taking at least 12 Aleve during a cycle.  This cycle I took only 3, and those were only a precautionary before I went to bed.  I fully anticipate not having to take any pain killers next month.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this tea.  It's the only thing that's ever worked for my wretched cramps, and it's natural.  It feels as if my life were handed back to me.

review/summary: Didn't relieve my PMS but it did get rid of my migraines!
review/text: I've been suffering from mentrual migraines for years. Drinking water, taking the right vitamins, and exercising regularly reduced the frequency and the intensity of the migraine but I would still get them. And it was getting to a point that Excedrin wouldn't even touch the pain. Well, my worries are over (almost). I took this tea during my last cycle and I only got two migraine epsisodes compared to 7-10 I usually get. I was so thankful!<br /><br />I originally bought this tea to relieve my PMS, namely fatigue and crankiness. The tea didn't help with those symptoms and it actually made me more grouchy and I felt like I was getting hot flashes throughout the day (hence the 4 stars). But compared to lying in bed with a migraine and being utterly useless, they were nothing.

review/summary: it works!
review/text: I've had this product for just over 2 weeks and first of all, I hate the taste of the tea. It's pretty vile to me and tastes spicy and like licorice. I am a serious unsweet tea drinker, I love testing them out, and usually love them all. Despite that, I find myself having at least 2 cups a day because it makes me feel so calm and relaxed. I've tried many teas and herbs to help calm my mild anxieties, and this one surprised me at being the best of all!<br /><br />If I drink it during the day, it relaxes me and makes me feel at peace but still able to function at top level. If I drink it at night, it helps me fall asleep and sleep well. When I wake in the morning, I am not groggy, I just feel ready to start my day and refreshed from the great sleep!<br /><br />I find it also helps reduce pain with headaches, so I'm taking less Advil than normal. I received this tea when my cycle just started. I found I was still in a lot of pain, however, I did feel more relaxed while drinking this. I'm hoping if I keep drinking during my whole cycle, it will have an even better effect, but we will see. Even if it just makes me feel more relaxed during that time of the month, and keeps helping with the headaches, it is so worth it! I highly recommend this product to anyone

review/text: The first month I tried this tea I still had pms pains of headaches and bloating and intense cramps during my period.  I was a bit turned off by the taste and smell as well in the beginning.  But I continued to drink it around the next month and noticed my usual pms bloating went down with my food cravings and headaches were non-existent.  I felt like something was "wrong"...and questioned myself if I was going to skip my entire period?  Well a couple days before my period I had a lot of twitching feelings in the lower abdomen than I have had in the past but no spotting.  My period was pushed a little further past my regular cycle. On the night I got my period the pain was extremely MILD on/off and only lasted until the next morning instead of the whole day.  I'm on the 3rd day and have absolutely no pain and taken way less ibuprofen than I have in the past.  The second day of my period is usually the most painful and this is a huge change for my menstrual cycle and pms.  Another thing I notice is the blood seems to be flushing out of me faster/more heavily.  Highly recommend.  Worth a try and even if it doesn't work for you it's still good tea.

It tastes wonderful and actually helped me relax and ease a lot of the pain. I had my doubts about a cup of water with dried herbs sitting in it being able to do anything for me but it really does help to ease the pain and help your body relax. I now find my self having a cup every night. I would definitely recommend for any women.

review/summary: Amazing tea!
review/text: I was definitely skeptical about this tea before I tried it, so I have to say how pleasantly surprised I am. I tend to get very bad cramps. I'm talking advil every 4 hours, hot water bottle on my lower abs, all while I writhe around in pain. I know that taking so much advil isn't good for your body so I really wanted to find a natural remedy to alleviate my cramps. I wasn't sure Moon Cycle would work but it really does wonders. It eases the cramps and I definitely feel more relaxed after drinking it. The smell is bit unpleasant to me, but the taste is good. It tastes like fruit and cinnamon and maybe cloves. Whenever my period is starting, I know to get my Moon Cycle tea ready.

review/summary: TASTES GREAT, WORKS EVEN BETTER!!!
review/text: I love the taste of this tea!! It's so sweet similar to honey or brown sugar. I actually take this tea to encourage my monthly cycle (my body doesn't want to cycle regularly on its own for some reason) and I found that this works better than provera. It encourages my own hormones without adding extra hormones to my body. I recommend this for any woman who has difficult or painful periods, or women who just don't get a period at all. It has parsley and dong quai which from what I read helps to bring on a delayed period. Which must be why it works well for me. GREAT STUFF, GREAT TEA!!!

review/summary: It's definitely PMS tea
review/text: This stuff is great for PMS. I drink 2 bags of it at a time and I'll have 3-4 cups of it in a day sometimes. It's very calming and it relieves a lot of PMS symptoms. Like all Yogi teas it has a nice, but interesting flavor to it.

review/summary: No more problems with PMS
review/text: I suffer from severe menstrual cramps that, at their worst leave me vomiting and doubled over in pain. The mood swings from the pms are another story. After reading so many glowing reviews about this tea, I decided to try it for myself. Let me tell you, I feel like a normal person during my period for the first time in my life. Drinking this tea along with taking Hyland's menstrual cramp pills <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SJPQDO">Hyland's Menstrual Cramps Tablets 100 ea</a> have made my cramps so light that I only had to take one 200mg ibuprofen to take the pain completely away. I feel like I don't even have my period, which is something that never happens. This tea is a Godsend!

review/summary: Not the most amazing, but definitely take the edge off.
review/text: I get very bad cramps that make me dizzy, nauseous and have pain radiating all throughout my abdomen and lower back. Midol and ibuprofen don't do that much for me and so I'm always open-minded when it comes to things for cramps. I didn't have high hopes for this tea, but I was pleasantly surprised. The tea greatly reducing my bloating, which is usually quite severe (I sometimes look like a pregnant whale) and did make my cramps a little better. Was I still in pain? Yes, but it wasn't quite as bad.

review/summary: Relief From Symptoms
review/text: I have suffered from debilitating cramps and PMS symptoms every since I was a pre-teen, both of which are aggravated by ovarian cysts. I started drinking this tea a few years ago and it has offered me considerable relief of my symptoms without drugging myself into oblivion with OTC painkillers. I find this tea works best if it is drunk throughout the month, and upping to 2 cups a day right as symptoms start. However, it doesn't do too well in stopping symptoms once they start.

review/summary: Didn't help with severe menstrual cramps
review/text: I took it for a few months and I didn't notice any difference. I drank 2-3 cups a day for at least a week before my periods but it still didn't help. I had severe menstrual cramps though. By severe I mean the kind that make you throw up before pain killers start working, feel like you're going to pass out, and writhe in such pain that you are unable to do even the simplest things. This tea probably won't help if you have it that bad.

review/summary: I love this tea, it's so good!
review/text: This is really great tea.  Very, very good.  I am usually the type of person who HATES warm tea, but this stuff is definitly the exception.  I love it.  I make several cups of it a day with 1 - 2 small teasoons of honey.  It's also great without honey.  The Yogi "Woman's Energy" tea is also great too, with a lot of the same ingredients in it.  I am so glad that I gave this tea a chance, I really, really like it.  You should drink 2 - 3 cups a day through out the month and 4 - 5 cups a day during your cycle.  Which is pretty easy to do because it is so good.  I keep a tea kettle on the stove with hot water on my warming unit so I cane make tea through out the day.  You should steep the tea 5 - 10 min but if you forget about it and steep it longer it doesn't taste bitter or gross.  I haven't had this tea long enough to see any benifits from it yet, but I will update my review later.  I look forward to trying their other teas.
