review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I was so excited about training my 4 months German Sheperd/Boxer mix.<br />First time she did me a favor swallowing it. The next day she wouldn't even open her mouth, complete lack of interest.<br />I feed her Blue buffalo dry food mixed with canned food daily.<br /><br />Despite all the positive reviews don't just assume your dog will like it, until dogs can submit a review on Amazon  :)

review/summary: Dogs love 'em, I love 'em
review/text: My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good. They have three calories per treat. About pea-sized.<br /><br />I used them for training and when they go to their areas when I head out to work in the morning.<br /><br />There's really not much more to be said. I did set up the amazon subscription on a two-month basis and may bump that up to monthly eventually. I will see.<br /><br />I can only recommend these because the price and value are excellent and they are great if you have does. Light, small, portable.

review/summary: great little treat
review/text: These treats are made from high quality ingredients, and are made in the U.S.A.(two things I look for). They are the perfect training treat, low in calories, small enough to carry in a pocket. I use them daily as a "reward" for proper behavior. My cavaliers absoultely adore these treats, they are by far their favorite.

review/summary: LOVE IT - and so do both my dogs, even the picky one!
review/text: Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a "variety."<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.  But it gets better later  :)  But whatever the dogs like and is safe to eat works for me!

review/summary: Sad to see it go, even the cat was sold!
review/text: When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.  My dog started having bowel issues - she'd get bloated and gassy, and have diarrhea at least once a day.  I seriously fought for this treat - I researched every dang ingredient in it to disprove of it being the cause and I'm here to tell you,  Zuke's is definitely giving us our money's worth.  But after 48 Zuke's free hours - her digestive disorders vanished completely.  It's not Zuke's fault and I am not at all bad mouthing their product, I still think it's the bomb.com!  I'm only sharing because I couldn't find one other person out there with the same unusual experience.  If it happens(ed) to anyone else, know that I'm jammin' some "Against All Odds" for both of us!

review/summary: Chicken Dog Treats
review/text: Our 10 month old mixed breed is a very picky eater. After trying a few different brands of dog treats someone suggested we try Zuke's because of the high protein and natural ingredients. Our puppy loves them!  The treats are small enough that I don't have to worry about breaking them up for training. There is a very strong smell with these treats, but it actually helps because our puppy comes running when I open the bag. I will be buying more flavors in the future.

review/text: My dog is a picky eater and will ignore some kinds of treats. However, she consistently and readily works for these peanut butter minis. The treats are quite smelly and break pretty easily into two. However, they tend to crumble if they become even slightly dry. On the whole, I would highly recommend Zuke's minis because they're the right size and have the right flavors to get my dog's attention!

review/summary: Another Chapter in the Saga of Mary-Kate the Feral Geyser
review/text: NOTE:  My vet is monitoring my cat's situation really closely, and the minute the vet says bring her in, that's exactly what will happen.  If your cat is having similar issues and doesn't get really unduly stressed by human contact to the point that it's counterproductive to rush her to the vet unless her situation is life threatening, PLEASE take your cat to the vet at once.<br /><br />My cat food reviews here at Amazon have all come about as a result of the slow painful process of finding food that my feral queen can keep down with any reliability.  She's hard to help -> she has to be anesthetized for any veterinary contact, and forget giving her shots or fluids or pills at home (and I have done wound care and post-op care for other feral cats; this one is just the most strongly opposed to unconsensual physical contact out of all of them) -> so an effective dietary intervention is her only hope.  I'm lucky to have a vet who works closely with my local TNR group and has been really available and helpful in working through this.  Neither one of us wants to euthanize this cat.<br /><br />Mary-Kate ate the same food for years without incident, but late last summer, she started first regurgitating (spitting up recognizable food) and then vomiting (violent ejection of bile and stomach contents).  My vet's first thought was that she had developed a food allergy, and I transitioned her to Felidae, which is great food and really seemed to help her.  Until she started getting sick again.  To cut to the chase, my vet thinks it could be an ulcer or renal failure or both, and it's looking more and more like we're going to have to put her through a car ride and sedation to get blood work.  But first we're going to try to see whether ulcer meds solve the problem<br /><br />Which means I need a wet food that she will eat, that is tasty enough to cover the taste of the medicine, and that she can keep down.  I read about Fancy Feast on a cats with CRF page on the internet.  It's not the best commercial food for a cat with kidney problems (I wanted to err on the safe side in case she does have them), but it's better than most and cats love it.<br /><br />Yeah, no kidding cats love it.  The only issues I am having now is that neither of my cats will eat anything else, and Fancy Feast is expensive.  I won't know for another couple of weeks whether the ulcer meds are going to work.  Even if they don't solve all of her problems and it turns out that she does have kidney issues, I will probably be able to keep feeding her this if I add phosphorus binders.  Win - win.

review/summary: Great tea at a wonderful value!
review/text: I could not beat the price of the product and not seeing any reviews at the time I figured for the price it was worth the shot. I am so glad I decided to order this tea! I love to drink green tea hot and cold. What I like to do is boil a pot of water at night and add six tea bags to it, let it sit, add two bags to each cup, then mix the tea with Stevia. I added this with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFM7TW">Numi Tea Rainforest Green, Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and then add Stevia Plus Packets 1 gr 100 pkt to the pot. I then pour the tea into my cups and leave them in the fridge overnight. The next day I just add ice to the cups and it has a wonderful blended flavor! I really am impressed with this tea flavor wise. It is subtle and not too overwhelming with Mango. It has just the right amount. I have been making this tea every night for the past two weeks and plan to buy more. I am very happy with it.

All of the other K-cup teas I've purchased through Amazon -- and which have been fulfilled by Amazon LLC -- have been packaged as two 24-count boxes of K-cups for about $25, give or take a couple of bucks depending on sales. However, this product was fulfilled by Deals On Call, and is just a *single* 24-count box for that same price -- literally twice the price, and actually much more expensive than what I can get by simply walking in to my local Bed, Bath & Beyond store. Again, my mistake, but I will never buy from Deals On Call again, and I will certainly not make the mistake again of rushing through my "regular" re-orders.

review/summary: Excellent tea
review/text: English breakfast is my favorite tea and I enjoy it mid-afternoon to dispel the afternoon doldrums.  Tea isn't available at my local grocery store in K-Cups and it is too much trouble to fight traffic to go to the specialty store to buy so getting it through Amazon is the perfect solution.  Let the UPS delivery driver fight the traffic.

review/text: Good tasting citrus soda but I prefer Orangina <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000121BY6">Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Pulp - 4 Glass Bottles</a> because it tastes more like sparkling orange juice.<br /><br />I have to admit that I purchased this product for the bottle. Given all the concerns about plastic leaching into water, the bottle is great to reuse as a water jug. I use it to store water in the refrigerator. The water tastes great because the glass and flip top keeps the water from tasting like plastic or refrigerator odors unlike some plastic bottles or glass pitchers with an open mouth. To remove the labels, I just soaked the empty bottle in water for several hours.<br /><br />Taste wise, I would have given it a 3 stars rating. I gave it a 4 stars rating because I love the bottle.

review/summary: Too much effort.
review/text: Cafe Du Monde makes the most delicious beignets ever and this is the package that they brand and sell all through New Orleans at every tourist trap in the city. If you're lucky you can find them around even if you don't live in Louisiana. The mix produces rather tasty beignets, but the effort it takes to make these makes me wonder if it's worth it. It's a lot of rolling and shaping and of course they're fried, so one has to be prepared to heat up a big pot of oil to make these.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to eating these when I make it out to New Orleans and just go to my local donut shop otherwise rather than go through all this effort.

review/summary: Better at the cafe.. insufficient instructions.
review/text: Having recently had New Orleans beignets at both Cafe Du Monde and Morning Call, I had been excited to try them at home.  I made both a Du Monde batch and a batch from scratch (using a food network recipe) and was very disappointed in the Cafe Du Monde mix.<br /><br />The box has a simple 3 step (well four if you include the "enjoy!" step) instruction for making the beignets: Stir together 2 cups of the mix and 7oz water, roll it out on a liberally floured surface, fry.  Unfortunately the mixing step results in a way too wet dough for rolling, unless one works in at least another 3/4 cup or more of flour. Once one has achieved a sufficiently roll-able dough the resulting beignets are okay, but not nearly as tasty as ones you could make from scratch for only slightly more effort.

review/summary: Best soup mix on the market.......Delicious!
review/text: I call this product Wyler's Soup Starter - because it's so flexible.  I add extra potatoes, carrots, onions and whatever other vegtables I have left over from the week.  I also use chicken, beef or vegtable broth instead of water.  Every week during the winter I make one or two of these soups.  Family and guests always ask for the receipe and I told/tell them to buy these packages and add whatever they like to make it their own.  It's the best, and I whole hearly recommend it to every cook to try.  I've been using it for many many years and my family always requests my soups during the cold months.  Please give it a try; and Wyler's - please get this product back in the stores.. and Amazon -- Thanks so much for carrying these items.  I don't mind buying each flavor by the case -- just as long as I can still get this product!  Thanks

I live in the Charleston area of South Carolina that does not carry the products so I called the main company and was given a few grocery stores about 2 hours from where I live.  I wrote them back and they gave me the Amazon website that I could order the product from, I was so thrill when I received it in the mail.  I use the products quite frequently with my church group, home menus and Senior Citizen groups and they love it. I am the talk of the meetings!<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Andrea Lawrence

review/summary: Fast and easy and as good as homemade soup!
review/text: Our family loves soup and this package is great for a fast batch of homemade chicken soup.  We throw 5 of 6 chicken thighs in a pot of water and boil it until it is cooked and tender.  We use boneless and skinless chicken thighs as they are faster.  Don't put in too much chicken skin as you will get too much grease on top of the broth.  If you have chicken with skin we remove the skin from all of the chicken except one thigh.<br /><br />Shred the chicken and use 8 or 9 cups of the broth and whisk in the soup mix.  We also add a cup of frozen peas and carrots to the mixture and bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat and cover the pot and simmer for 20 minutes.<br /><br />You now have a simple and hearty chicken soup that your entire family will enjoy.  A fast and healthy meal that tastes as good as homemade.  You will love this soup. I posted a photo of the nutrition label for your information.

review/summary: By far the best honey for baking
review/text: Palmetto honey has a very unique flavor. It's bold, but not bitter. Heavy, but not super rich. A strong flavor with fruity undertones. A very slight bite with a mild finish on the palate.<br /><br />Whoever says this isn't great honey, must not use it often. I replace sugar with honey in nearly all my baked goods, and this is the best to use by far. I've used several, so when I say it's the best..I can say it with confidence based on experience.<br /><br />I will say that I prefer lighter citrus honey for toast. But, this honey is not for toast. It's for cooking, and for that purpose there's no comparison.

I had a massive hedge of Ligustrum in a Dallas suburb that made better honey than this (that was amazing honey!!).<br />  Take a pass on this one i'd say.  I bought this because another reviewer on some other honey mentioned it.  Maybe their quality control isn't very good or we can blame the bees i guess.<br />  If anyone can recommend a very clean, bright tasting honey let me know.

review/text: I love rhubarb but hate paying Southern grocery story prices for it (when fresh rhubarb costs more per pound than asparagus, there's something seriously wrong with my world), so I was eager to purchase rhubarb jams and pie fillings.<br /><br />This jam was good and it didn't take me a week to use it up, but it wasn't as tart as I prefer (tasted pretty much like apple butter, to me, and I feel that you really should be able to tell the difference between apple and rhubarb preserves by taste, not just by texture).<br /><br />However, if you want some rhubarb in your diet and don't necessarily crave tartness, this might be a good choice.

review/text: WOW, some good bread, toasted, with butter, then covered with Rhubarb jam?  That was out of this world...needless to say, we wished I had purchased a larger jar.  The color wasn't so red it was 'fake looking' and yet enough color so it was appetizing.  Perfectly sweetened also.

Tart enough for me.  I take it to the office with a loaf of nice rye... far less expensive or caloric than the rolls and buns offered at work.

review/summary: The Best Syrups Ever!
review/text: I just recently discovered Amoretti syrups. I attracted by the fact that they are made in the USA, thought it would be good to give it a try. And Oh Boy! These syrups are a cut above any other syrup I have tried. So far, my favorite use is in plain, unsweetened yogurt. The caramel is a particular favorite. Swirl some into yogurt, top with sliced bananas, sit back and imagine you are in The Olde Soda Shoppe, with a freshly made ice cream treat. You won't miss the calories, or the chemicals. Delicious.

review/summary: Best caramel syrup I have had!
review/text: I have tried Torani, Starbucks, and Amoretti. By far, Amoretti is the best. Its a little pricier than Torani, but well worth the extra cost. The quality is soooo much better. The syrup is thick in consistency. It is not like the 90% water stuff that you get from Torani. It also doesn't have the chemical after taste that Torani always leaves in my mouth. Plus, it has a rich deep caramel flavor. I do not write many Amazon reviews, but after tasting this syrup I felt compelled to do so! I love this with 4 shots espresso and some steamed half and half. It is the highlight of my morning. Can't wait to try the other flavors! Thinking a Holiday 3-Pack may be in my near future! Great job Amoretti!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I have purchased various flavors of syrups from Amoretti (within day intervals) and they have been fabulous.  When first opening this bottle, the scent actually blew me away.  I did not get an overwhelming smell of sugar, but that of what the flavor should taste like!  It had the caramel scent, but with a hint of butterscotch.  And to me, that is a VERY good thing.  The bottles are truly visually pleasing.  Most bottles that I come across just have the company name and flavor title; not very good.  But Amoretti has graced us with not only the flavor name, but a picture to go with.  These are definitely high quality coffee/etc syrups!  So, if you think that the cost is too much, just keep in mind that in most cases "you get what you pay for."  And in this case, that was a good thing.

review/summary: It's good
review/text: This is obviously one of those products where it's all about personal tastes. I was getting caramel lattes/fraps at Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts and was tired of paying for the high price. So I wanted to start making it for myself and on Amazon it was either this product or the other one where they used high fructose corn syrup. I obviously went for Amoretti because they don't use corn syrup. Once I got it and started to make my iced lattes, it tasted just fine. I haven't experienced anything wrong with this.

In fact I plan on ordering other products from this company in the near future, now that I better understand which items would be more to my liking. What a great company to deal with.....worthy of 5 stars for customer service alone.

review/summary: Delicious healthy beverage, makes for great coffee substitute
review/text: There are other, bigger bags of this product available here on Amazon, and many reviews have been written under the 2lb size.<br />The price fluctuates, so it makes sense to do a bit of comparison shopping.  I bought this packaging when it was about $10, which made it worth it.  If you want to save some $$, you can buy bigger package and share with a friend, or just store it in the freezer - it will last quite a long time.<br /><br />I have been drinking this for years, and as just about everyone else, really love it and recommend it.  It has a very pleasant taste, dandelion is 'good for you' and you can use it as a delicious beverage or as an coffee substitute, if you wish.  I usually add some stevia to mine, sometimes a little bit of half and half, could use rice or almond milk, some raw cacao powder, cinnamon, whatever sweeteners, "whiteners" or other enhancements you would put in the coffee and your imagination comes up with.<br />The amount to use will depend on your preferences.  Some people like theirs little less concentrated, I prefer mine strong, so I use quite a bit.  You can just play with it until you find your optimal powder-to-water ratio.<br /><br />Also, from my experience, it is a good idea to keep your supply in the fridge or the freezer, as it does absorb moisture and if kept at room temperature, it very quickly hardens into a block and you have to chisel it if you want it to dissolve.  Plus it loses the flavor, so it pretty much gets ruined.<br />I had to throw away sizable amount before I learned this, so what I started doing was putting whatever amount fits in a small glass mason jar with a plastic lid and keeping that in the fridge.  Whatever is left, stays in the original bag, gets put into a Ziploc bag and goes into freezer.<br /><br />Hope that helps and if you are sitting on the fence and want to just give it a try, definitely go with this size, I am sure you won't regret it!!

review/text: I really, really wanted to like this. Really. I followed the directions on the package to make a "bold" cup of "coffee" drink and was put off by the taste. I tried it hot, cold and room temp. I LOVE a robust and bold cup of joe and this struck me as bland. It was pretty expensive so I'm pretty bummed about it. It's not a good sub for me. I don't have any experience with Postum like others so no comparison there.

review/summary: Delicious (and good for you) coffee alternative
review/text: I tried dandy blend when I needed to stop drinking caffeine. I don't like decaf coffee because it gives me a headache. I was surprised by how good this drink tastes. It's instant so I add it to a mixture of hot milk and hot water. It's not sweetened but it has a sweet flavor so you don't need any sugar either. A very pleasant drink and worth trying whether or not you're off the coffee. I also learned that dandelion is high on the list of Chinese remedies for stomach and liver complaints. So it makes me feel good to know this is not some chemically concocted caffeine alternative, it's a wholesome beverage made from good-for-you ingredients.

review/text: I've tried two other coffee substitutes and this one is the most like real coffee of those I've tried.  It has the consistency of fine powder.  The package has several recipe suggestions.  One is a cafe-au-lait drink.  Another is a flavored ice cream made by simply stirring the Dandy Blend powder into some ice cream.  (It was a nice treat.)  A very good coffee substitute with hearty flavor.
