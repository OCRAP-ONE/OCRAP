review/summary: Get in my belly!
review/text: Very good texture and taste. I have tried quite a few different bars over the last few months, and these are easily the best.  They are light and don't weigh you down, but are still enough to ease hunger.  Especially good after a workout or for a high protein dessert when you want something sweet.  They do however have sugar in the ingredient list, but only have 5 grams of sugar for the whole bar.

review/summary: OMG--Yuck!
review/text: Oh my goodness...<br />Although I have to give Crystal Lights a thumbs-up for trying to come up with diet water flavorings in more adult flavors (Margarita, Mojito, Appletini or whatever), unfortunately this stuff is just awful!<br /><br />First of all, why would they package this in a pitcher-sized packet?  Do you really think you are going to have a bunch of girlfriends over and serve them a pitcher of Crystal Light non-alcoholic Mojitos?  Why not package it the same way they package all their other Crystal Light products, in individual-sized packets that you can stir into one bottle or glass of water?  The only market I can see for this product is if you should happen to belong to a Weight Watchers/AA group where you need to serve a pitcher of diet "mocktails" to a group of people who are trying to lose weight.<br /><br />Okay, so they missed on the product packaging (and had a misguided focus group)...but what about the taste?  I have to admit that there are some Crystal Light flavors that I do like and enjoy putting into my water.  I'm especially fond of the Pink Lemonade mix.  But this Mojito mix is just awful--the taste is at the same time bland, metallic, sour (and not in a good way), stale-tasting, and leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth, and (worst of all) tastes nothing like any Mojito I've ever had.  I cannot imagine what they were thinking!  The recipe must have been formulated by people without tastebuds.<br /><br />Believe me, this is not a product you will buy more than once, and take my advice and skip it altogether!

review/summary: Mo' Mojito Please
review/text: Okay, at first I was turned off by the color of the Crystal Light Mojito because I always thought Mojitos are clear.  This one looked like the windshield washer fluid my husband buys at Walmart.  Anyway, the taste wasn't bad at all although I was expecting a more minty and sweet flavor.  My daughter thought it tasted like it had some basil.  I would say that it tastes close to 7-Up but less sweet.  I don't think true Mojito drinkers would even consider calling this a mocktail but as a low-calorie juice drink, it's okay.  It's still a better alternative to soda.  Each packet can make 2 quarts and the whole canister makes 10 quarts.  After drinking it for a while, I acquired a taste for it. Nice to drink on a hot day with lots of crushed ice.

review/text: While the Moctails Mojito has a nice lime flavor, it still has the sweetener aftertaste.  I read one reviewer recommended that you use less water or more product but while the flavor is stronger, it does not disguise the artificial sweetener.  Perhaps if it was carbonated or you threw in some alcohol but I'll probably stick with just plain ice tea.

review/summary: Koolaid for grownups
review/text: From the new line of Crystal Light Moctails, we have the Mojito version.  Little packet of greenish powder, added to water gives you a pitcher full of sweet mojito-ish alcohol free drink.  Each packet should make 2 quarts, but it actually better with a little less than that and a lot of ice.  I didn't try substituting rum for water.  If I want a rum-filled mojito, thats what I"ll have and not just toss rum into some crystal light.<br />Overall, not bad.  The sweetener is too heavy and it would be more refreshing with less.  I rarely have a need to make a full pitcher of anything, so a 16 ounce version might be better.  But the important thing is the flavor.  If it tasted really great, I wouldn't care what size it made and I'd happily add rum and use it as a mojito base.  It doesn't quite make the grade for that though.  Compared to other koolaid type drinks, its tasty and different.  I can't recommend it to mojito lovers because it is a poor imposter.  But its not bad as a midsummer refresher.

Using it to cut down on any sugar or fruit juice I would add to a mixed drink<br />cuts calories and does not have much effect on the taste.<br />As others have said this version of CL's Mocktails is very sweet. It holds up to ice very well.<br />I would try to get a 1 pack before I would invest in the 4 pack if you are interested in trying it.

review/summary: A refreshing novelty and not much more
review/text: I don't know. Maybe I'm not meant to be a mojito person, or maybe I've just never had a good one, but when you combine two or more flavors, you really expect them to compliment each other in some way. Mint and lime don't seem to do this, so essentially what you've got here is two clashing flavors creating something less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />If you do like this combination and you don't mind fake sugar, this isn't bad. I didn't get a chance to try this with a shot of rum added (I imagine someone did though), so I don't know how it is used as a drink mixer, but as a soft drink/water flavor, it was meh at best. Either that, or it just doesn't appeal to my taste buds and the three star rating is being unfair. But it is what it is.

review/summary: Tart and overly sweet, but still good.
review/text: Just like all other sweetened powder drinks, too much of the powder can cause this drink to be extra sweet.  It's tasty for sure, and tastes as close to a powdered, non-alcoholic mojito as possible, but a little more water, or a little less powder, can be substituted to give it a good, long-lasting taste.<br />I filled an entire pitcher of it and drank it all myself, so that's probably why my throat was hurting after the drink--BUT, following the above guidelines should still prove useful!

review/text: You're not going to fool anyone into thinking this is a real true mojito, but to be honest, it's a pretty good low-cal substitution. To be honest, I feel a little strange sipping on Mojito-flavored Crystal Light when it's mixed with water (and I'm not a huge fan of the slight artificial taste).<br /><br />But when you add rum instead, it's the perfect drink for sitting out on the deck during the hot summer months (fine, or cuddled up on a couch in the winter, with the heat on high!). Especially when you add some fresh mint and a slice of lime in.<br /><br />I am kind of tempted to sip this at work to see if it helps transport me to a different place :)

review/summary: The Appletini flavor is better.
review/text: Having also tried & reviewed this product in 'Appletini' flavor, I have to say I prefer that to these Mojito packets.<br /><br />As with the Appletini flavor and other Crystal Light mixes, this is a refreshing, easily dissolved, flavorful and low-calorie alternative to other drinks and drink mixes. It'll work with or without alcohol (the instructions don't mention alcohol at all). An added bonus is that artificial sweeteners, like those in Crystal Light (Aspartame), are more effective at cutting the alcohol flavor down in mixed drinks.<br /><br />A funny thing about this mix -- it actually seems like you can taste the different layers of flavors you'd expect from a mojito... the tangy lime, the cool mint, and the simple sweetness of sugar syrup (or, in this case, aspartame).<br /><br />While this made a refreshing drink, and it's convenient to be able to whip up mojitos quickly using this quick-dissolving powder (it dissolves readily, even in ice water), it's just not the same as a real mojito. I'd tend to think of this as more of a Crystal Light Mint-Limeade than as a quick way to prepare mojitos for a party... (the Appletini flavor, on the other hand, tastes just like a real Appletini).<br /><br />I give this product 4 stars for convenience and refreshing flavor but don't think I'll be buying more, since I'd rather just have Crystal Light Lemonade or a real mojito.

review/summary: Now THIS I can drink happily! Delicious and refreshing!
review/text: When I first read about Crystal Light's new Mocktails line, I wasn't quite sure what to think. That confusion wasn't helped any by the first flavor that I tried in the line: Appletini. It just wasn't anywhere near what I expected. Mojito, though? I am SO pleasantly surprised by this flavor! Crystal Light definitely got this one right!<br /><br />I've got a friend that makes, I would bet money, the best Mojitos this side of Cuba. I mean, he could seriously open up a bar solely on his Mojitos. I'm not a big hard liquor drinker because I often find that the alcohol simply kills the subtle flavors of the ingredients it's combined with. Jimmy has mastered the perfect combination in his Mojitos, so that all of the flavors are allowed to play their part and please your palate as a cohesive unit. And, somehow, Crystal Light has done the same with their Mojito flavor in their Mocktails line. You get the crisp, refreshing flavor of a good limeade (a drink that I grew up enjoying during my childhood in the Caribbean, and far prefer over lemonade), and just the slightest hint of spearmint. It's perfect, and it's a perfect, guilt-free drink.<br /><br />I still must admit that I'm not sure if Crystal Light intends for you to go ahead and add the alcohol to this mix, and is just trying to cut back on the calories for you so you can still enjoy your favorite hard drink without as many calories, or if you're simply supposed to mix the powder into water and use this as a sober substitute. Either way, THIS flavor gets it right! I think I've found a new favorite guilt-free beverage for those nights that I want to feel a little naughty, but still be fully functional when I get up for work the next morning! ; )<br /><br />Good job, Crystal Light! Two thumbs enthusiastically up!

review/summary: Wonderfully Light & Refreshing
review/text: I recently reviewed Crystal Light's Margarita from their Mocktails line of low calorie flavored drink mixes.<br /><br />Well, this time I decided to try their Mojito flavor.<br /><br />It comes in a lively, lime accented container. Each 1.41-oz. container contains 10 pouches. And each pouch makes a 2-quart [half-gallon] of mojito flavored drink.<br /><br />I absolutely detested the margarita flavor! I took one sip, and had to throw the rest out! Plain nasty!<br /><br />So it was, with trepidation, that I took my first sip of Mojito.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise! I served the drink over ice, and it was wonderfully refreshing and had a delicious lime accented flavor that was sweet and a pure enjoyment to drink! I first made the drink mix yesterday, and am now into my second pouch!<br /><br />I give this delicious drink mix Five Stars and my Thumbs Up award!<br /><br />Each 8-ounce drink is only 5-calories and has zero fats, sodium and carbs. So you can enjoy this drink to your hearts content!<br />[It does contain aspartame for those who are intolerant to that sweetener.]<br /><br />I think I'll go have a glass now!<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided at no charge by Amazon Vine  for an independent, non-biased review.

Want the refreshing zest of a Mojito without the work (and the dehydrating effects of booze)?  This is your ticket to instant beverage satisfaction.

review/text: I've tried at least 3 other Crystal Light drinks, and like them all. Moctails Mojitos is the first one that I just can't come around to.<br /><br />The initial taste is a combination of the typical Crystal Light flavoring and some generic I-don't-know-what-it-is-but-I-don't-like-it taste. The immediate aftertaste is a blast of mint. It does remind me of a mojito, but just a bit.<br /><br />My daughter and I have tried it multiple times hoping that we'll come around to the strange flavor, but we always end up dumping the glass.<br /><br />We'll stick with Crystal Light ice tea and lemonade.

review/text: This version is very smooth, almost too smooth for my taste. The most prominent flavor is that citric acid "kool-aid" taste, that fake tang after taste. There is barely, and I mean barely a hint of mint in there if you use your imagination. It's almost like drinking "thick" water to me. That sounds odd I know, but it is very bland but with something indescribable in the background. I would definitely need a lot if rum to make this palatable. Too bad. I really wanted to like it.

review/summary: Good summer drink and the makings of a fine Mojito
review/text: If you like Mojitos, crystal light has managed to provide a very good artificial (alcohol/calorie free) drink that does it justice.  I think this will be especially nice in the summer.  While I prefer other crystal light flavors more than this one, it is a matter of taste.  The quality is fine, and the flavor is rich and realistic.  It has no metallic or artificial taste.<br /><br />Although this is not what they had in mind, this mix makes a really good Mojito drink with Rum:<br /><br />1/2 cup club soda with a teaspoon or two of the crystal light Mojito powder stirred in<br />1 1/2 fluid ounces white rum<br />a slice of lime if you have it<br />ice<br /><br />The trick is to add enough of the crystal light to provide the strong mint taste but not too much to make the drink too sweet.  Its a matter of taste and trial and error.

review/text: I don't think the flavor is anything like a real mojito, but then again, this is Crystal Light, so I didn't really expect it to taste like one. I do taste how it tries to be a mojito. It is very sweet, and has an after taste that is sort of a minty taste. Would I drink this instead of a mojito and be satisfied, the answer is no. And I don't think I would drink this on a regular basis. However, it is a refreshing drink, and I just poured a glass of it after mowing the lawn. So it's not terrible, but I think next time I'll try a different flavor.

review/summary: Flavor not for us
review/text: I hesitate to give a bad review, especially when it's some type of food and there's the whole thing about the matter of taste and preferences and so on. BUT, my wife and I both tried this--she really enjoys a good mojito--and we really didn't like it at all.<br /><br />First of all, it has a strong taste of artificial sweetener. If you really don't like that odd, bitter aftertaste, you may not like this. On the other hand, if you're used to artificial sweeteners and can live with the negatives while enjoying the positive of some sweetness without the drawbacks of sugar, then go ahead and enjoy.<br /><br />Secondly, the lime taste was kind of weak. We tried real hard not to water down the powdered solution and were careful to first try slightly less water and then add more till we used the full allotment of premeasured water we had prepared. It just left us with a weak, artificially sweet lime flavor that really wasn't enjoyable at all.<br /><br />That being said, I repeat that it's a matter of taste and I think you can go ahead and try this for yourself. The price is reasonable and it's worth a try. Also, I saw some suggestions that perhaps no one would mind if (adults) spiked this with a little rum! Maybe that'll do the trick!

review/text: Similar to other Crystal light flavoring packets, flavor and sweetness is plentiful.  Calories come at a minuscule 5 calories and one packet provides a large party bowl.  Mojito flavor is similar enough to a real mojito.  I suggest adding some rum and/or vodka with some crushed mint and it'll no longer be just a "moctail" and be perfect for afternoon picnics.  Overall, good supplement if you're a big time Mojito drinker and is as refreshing as it comes for instant flavor.

I find that the Mio water enhancers are far easier to use and have more flavor, but Crystal Light has them beat with sheer variety. If you like Crystal Light, give this one a try.

When I think of mojito I think thick and heavy sugary substance. This version is the slim version of a real mojito. It has that little hint of mint. I have been tempted to add some bacardi and some real mint. Each packet makes two liters. Good thing I read the directions. I almost poured the whole think in a single server water bottle. If you like mojitos you will love this flavor of Crystal Light.

Making simple syrup, cutting up limes, and muddling mint with sugar are a long process for me and most of the time not really worth it since I just end up drinking one or two and then have to clean up the mess.  Prior to trying Crystal Light's Moctails I had been making a low sugar alternative to the margarita using Crystal Light lemonade and really enjoyed it so these pre-mixed packets seemed like a good solution.  All you need to do to make these is stir the packet with water which is even possible for someone that is lazy like me.  I added ice and clear rum and voila! instant mojito party time.  Unfortunately these didn't quite live up to the original, they have an odd after-taste that is mildly off putting which I usually attribute to artificial sweeteners.  Most of my guests agreed that these were an okay alternative but just plain they don't seem like a great substitute.  I used this mix and muddled up some mint with them and added a squirt of lime and that seemed to make it much better, but at that point I might as well just make real mojitos rather than using the mix.  Overall I would say if you're a real mojito aficionado you can skip these; if you're a novice and just want to get an idea of the flavors without a lot of work then these would be a good way to get your feet wet.

review/summary: Great taste, but it isn't very 'minty'.
review/text: To me, when I hear 'mojito' I think mint and lime. This Crystal Light flavor is kind of like a very light, refreshing Limeade, but I can't really pick out the mint flavor.  So I think it is a stretch to think this would satisfy a craving for a Mojito, BUT it is still a really good refreshing drink.  It was a big hit with everyone in my family, including my 4 and 8 yr olds.  My kids called it lemonade, which it is closer to than a mojito.  I added a little fresh mint leaves from my garden, and it was very good.<br /><br />Summary, is it a 'mock' mojito? Not really. But it is still very good, and makes a nice summer drink.

review/text: This drink tastes like limeade with a hint of mint.  The rest of my family wasn't very fond of it, but I love it.  I also like the new packaging, or new to me anyway: a slim canister containing long skinny packets instead of cups of powder.  The powder mixes well and is a very light, subtle green rather than a neon Kool-Aid color.  I'd buy this again!

review/summary: a mature Crystal Light option, but the packaging is hard to recycle
review/text: My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages.  I don't consider many of the Crystal Light selections to have an adult quality to them.  However, there is something about the Mojito flavor that is mature.<br /><br />First, it lacks the shockingly vibrant colors of many of the company's other selections.  If you picture the coloring of bright red lipstick or an orange pumpkin, you can get an idea of how many flavors of Crystal Light look in a glass.  The Mojito mix looks like cloudy water, if it is unadorned with mint leaves or other additions.<br /><br />I also find that compared to other Crystal Light beverages, the Mojito has a more complex flavor. It tastes like a diet limeaide and while I can see how the scientists that crafted this beverage would consider it to be a mojito-inspired creation, I don't know if I would have thought "mojito" without a packaging hint.  Still, it is a good beverage with layers of citrus and a bit of mint; a glass can be made even better by adding fresh mint leaves.<br /><br />If you are a pregnant gal, the designated driver, or a dieter, I think you could dress this beverage up to make it quite satisfactory for party purposes.  Crystal Light has successfully created a mature Crystal Light beverage option, which Crystal Light has relatively few of (the company's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9U6">Crystal Light Peach Tea Drink Mix (12-Quart), 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9RY">Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix (10-Quart), 3.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> are two other "adult" flavors).<br /><br />One negative with all of the Crystal Light products relates to packaging.  First, the container is a #5 plastic.  Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle.  I know Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.  Additionally, if you like Crystal Light, it can be very easy to go through these containers quickly.  Some Crystal Light flavors have six packets and others, like the Mojito flavor, have five.  The container could hold more flavor packets, which would reduce the overall number of containers that the user has to dispose of.<br /><br />Overall, a good beverage that is encased in packaging that is not very green.

I drink regular Crystal Light on a regular basis so I am use to it and love the taste. I shared the drink with some of my friends and the health folks like it but sugar addicts did not like the aftertaste.  Hopefully if you know your personal taste that alone should be able to help you.  They need a bit of work to get that authentic mojito taste without all that sugar, but in the meantime,  for me its a winner!

review/summary: A drinkable, low calorie Mojito alternative
review/text: Several of my friends have recently begun buying the low calorie flavored drinks you see in most grocery and convenience stores now. Cascade Ice is one brand that produces several based off of common drinks like, Lemon Drop, Pina Colada and Cosmopolitan.  They then mix them with their favorite spirit and have a low calorie drink. They're good because they're pre-made and portable, but you are paying a premium for that.  Either way although I've never been fond of these types of drinks, I was willing to give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito</a> a shot.  One thing I can say I immediately liked was the ease of making the drink, it would be great for when my girlfriends come over. Additionally because the individual packets are so small, it would be just as easy to take some to a friends house for the evening. As for the taste, it wasn't amazing, but not bad either.  It definitely wasn't as good as an actual Mojito, but I wasn't expecting that.  After my initial taste I did add a shot of Jamaican rum into my drink and that improved it greatly in my opinion. Overall I believe that Crystal Light has done a good job of providing a pseudo Mojito and I could see myself buying additional flavors to try out.

review/summary: refreshing Lime Drink
review/text: This is a pretty refreshing drink.  It has a nice lime flavor with a hint of mint.  If this was advertised as a LimeAde, I would give it 5 stars.  However, it is listed as a Mojito Moctail.<br />As a Mojito it fails because<br />1) it has no alcohol (for which I am glad)<br />2) it has no carbonation<br />3) the Mint should overpower the Lime, but in this drink the Lime overpowers the Mint.<br /><br />Now 1 & 2 are expected, because it is a "moctail" but 3 makes it taste like LimeAde instead of a Mojito.<br />Actually, it tastes more like Baskin Robin's Daiquiri ice, which I like a lot.<br /><br />If you like the taste of lime, this is the perfect drink for you.<br />If you were hoping for a minty drink, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Refreshing Drink with an Artificial Flavor
review/text: Crystal Light makes many excellent and very popular products, and so I was most interested to try the "Mojito" mix.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is advertised as a "Mocktail." It is not a cocktail mix for the cocktail of the same name, nor is it intended for use with alcohol.<br /><br />That said, the mix is intended to provide a refreshing drink with a Mojito-like flavor, a sort of reminder of summer without the alcohol, the calories, or for that matter, the cost. The mix succeeds to a reasonable degree though there are a few shortcomings.<br /><br />The outer package is colorful, slim, and easy on storage space. Inside the package are long, tubular envelopes of mix which are larger than necessary (they are only about half full). As expected, you simply mix the packet contents with cold water. Each packet makes two quarts of drink, so one container of five packets makes a lot of beverage.<br /><br />A word of warning: Follow the package directions carefully as to the amount of water to use per packet. There isn't a lot of room for error, and a mistake will result in either a thin, tasteless drink, or a drink so concentrated that is anything but refreshing. But get it right (it isn't that hard) and you will be well rewarded. The powder mixes and dissolves very easily.<br /><br />The end result is indeed a light and refreshing drink that has the typical lime and mint Mojito flavor. The flavor does, however, come across as artificial and is quite far from the test of freshly squeezed lime and fresh mint. Of course, you can only expect so much from a tube of powder; you'll have to judge if the test is good enough to pass muster. The group of us that sampled the beverage thought it fell a bit short while still remaining a good enough drink.<br /><br />The only other real negative is the appearance of the beverage. Instead of the nice light green that is shown on the package, the beverage is an unappetizing dishwater gray. This too may not bother you, but one would think that Crystal Light could have done a little better.<br /><br />The overall impression is of a "good enough" beverage that is refreshing but with a decidedly artificial taste. It's certainly not one of Crystal Light's best efforts, but neither is it a bad drink, and so it rates a middle of the road three star evaluation.

review/summary: Light mint flavor that emulates a standard mojito well
review/text: These new "mocktails" from Crystal Light are pretty awesome for sugar-free folk who are tired of the old standbys of raspberry ice, fruit punch, iced tea with peach, and so on.  Instead of going for another standard fruit flavor they mimic a variety of mostly fluffy drinks, and they all manage to taste remarkably like the hard drink they are modeled after.<br /><br />The mojito version has a nice trace of mint, although its flavor is much more mild and light than the appletini edition, which is probably the best of the bunch. Using more or less water when mixing can easily change the flavor if you want it a little stronger. Much like with the appletini, the mojito Crystal Light works great as a mixer for alcohol if you want to spice it up and make it more like the real thing.<br /><br />This is definitely recommended if you regularly enjoy Crystal Light and want to try something different from the standard array of flavors.

It is very clean tasting, fresh and light on the palate with no after taste. It's light on the mint and more like a limeade without the pucker effect.

review/summary: Light, refreshing, unusual
review/text: I've been intrigued by mojitos ever since I saw them in the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QSDYSS">Shopgirl</a>.  Upon my first taste of Crystal Light's version, I was a little put off by what came across as a chemical taste, but then I realized it was the mint ("natural flavor" is the only flavoring listed in the ingredients; no artificial flavorings are listed).  I'm not sure I like the mint in this, but it wouldn't be a mojito without it.  The lime flavor is nice and tangy without being too sour.  Some reviewers have remarked that it's too sweet; others say it's not sweet enough, but I think there is a nice balance.  Also, I find the strength to be fine when prepared as directed.  I can imagine that it would taste even more refreshing if mixed with soda water instead of tap water.<br /><br />Note that this drink, as virtually all sugar-free drinks, is sweetened with a combination of aspartame and ace-K (why the manufacturers don't drop the aspartame and switch to sucralose is beyond me).  Also, curiously, sugar is one of the ingredients (though in apparently such a small amount that they can still get away with calling it "sugar free").<br /><br />I don't drink, so I've never had a real mojito and can't comment on the authenticity here, but judged on its own, this version is a pretty good drink.  Based on Amazon's price, I probably wouldn't buy more, but I'll have no trouble getting through the supply I already have.  If you love lime drinks, this is definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Mojito flavor is just a little weird without the bite of alcohol...
review/text: I was really wondering how this would work.  I give them credit...they made mojito flavor!  The mint and citrus are well defined...and there's a little something else in there too.  I guess it's what gin might taste like if gin didn't have any bite at all.  It's also a bit sweeter than I would think of the normal version of this drink being, but then that's probably fitting with it being crystal light.<br /><br />But that said, unless you really like the flavor by itself, this struck me as a bit weird and not something I wanted to drink much of.  We made a whole jug of it and did finally get through it, but I think both the boyfriend and I are a little leary of making another one.<br /><br />Tried adding some vodka we had around...gin might work, but the vodka just sort of killed the flavor and made it taste like odd sweet vodka.<br /><br />I did try a little of it dry in a little hand whipped creme...that was actually quite enjoyable.  I may try finding other uses for it...not sure if I want to drink it all.<br /><br />I'm going to rate it as 3 stars mostly because in the end I didn't really care for it and I wouldn't buy it again.  I can't rate it lower however...it does capture the flavor better than expected and is identifiable as what it claims to be.

With that being said I still really enjoyed the drink.  It reminds me of a lime summertime drink but it was very light tasting.  It's not real sweet and strong tasting like a lemonade is, but is refreshing IMO.  I like the fact that Crystal Light is coming out with new twists on sugar free drinks.  It's nice to have alternatives to the regular fruit flavored mixes and teas.

review/text: Need a mojito fix in the middle of the day? Want to waste away to another place while at work? Well, Crystal Light's new Mocktails Mojito might be just what you're looking for. Obviously, these are non-alcoholic, but I figure I might as well put that in here (just in case someone asks). The Mojito flavor was way stronger than I expected and I am not much of a fan of the overwhelming "minty-ness".  However, if you like mojitos, take a break from the ordinary, try out Crystal Light Mocktails.  If you want to add alcohol, Crystal Light has done an excellent job in creating an alternative to the overly sweet mixes on the market.

review/summary: A Lukewarm Moctail
review/text: I'll say right off the bat that I am not a big fan of the alcoholic version of Mojitos.  I enjoy one every now and then if I am with friends who happen to be making them, but it isn't my first choice for a cool down drink with a kick (that would be Firefly Iced Tea).<br /><br />Hoping that I would find a decent alternative to the real deal, I picked up Crystal Light's Moctail Mojito drink mix.  Like similar drinks in this line, the Mojito mix is very easy to prepare.  Simply add one packet to two quarts of water, mix, serve over ice and you're ready to relax.<br /><br />When I made the mix, I was a bit taken aback by the somewhat bitter taste.  With lime flavoring as a primary ingredient, I expected some bitterness, but not this much.  I also noticed that the minty taste that accompanies your standard Mojito was lacking in this virgin mix.<br /><br />While the Appletini mix in this Crystal Light line doesn't have the standard "fake sugar" aftertaste that you find in most Crystal Light products, it is very apparent in the Mojito mix.<br /><br />In the end, I'd say that the Crystal Light Moctails Mojito mix is good for a quick, five calorie refreshment if you want something other than water, but it pales in comparison to the Appletini mix for overall flavor.<br /><br />Give it a try for yourself, but don't expect to be wowed.

review/summary: Very refreshing!
review/text: I haven't bought Crystal Light in a long time but used to love it, so I was interested in trying out their new line of "moctails", lightened up versions of your favorite drinks.  I gave the mojito flavor a go and made a 2 qts.  In the container are 5 packets, each that make 2 qts. of drinks.  This was so refreshing and 8 oz. is only 5 calories, so who can beat that?  We liked them just straight, but adding rum to give them a kick would be great, and would be fewer calories than your normal mix.  I really loved this flavor and would definitely try some of the other flavors that they have in this line.<br /><br />Refreshing and easy!

review/summary: I guess it's OK for a 5 calorie Mojito
review/text: In the interest of fairness, I mixed this according to the directions. Although  when I mix powdered drinks, I usually mix them to suit my taste.<br />The first thing that I noticed was how hard it was to get the powder to dissolve completely, no matter how much I stirred. It did eventually dissolve completely. The next thing I noticed was the fluoresent green color. Mojitos are usually clear, so I don't know why they chose that color. The taste: very mild, with a HINT of mint.<br />I tasted it right after I mixed it, and again when chilled and poured over ice. This definately needs to be chilled.<br />If you're just looking for something low-cal, and palateable, then this is fine. If you want to drink something that tastes like a Mojito, then drink a Mojito.

review/summary: Overstated
review/text: I'm at a slight disadvantage not having drank a real mojito before.  Anyway, I think this is like one of those yogurts that claims to be "cherry cobbler" or "key lime pie" and is really just cherry or lime flavored yogurt.  This claims to be a mojito but regular lime-flavored Crystal Light would probably taste the same.  It might even be cheaper.  That said there is a lot of citrus flavor and tartness, so it's not bad, just misleading.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Mojito maybe
review/text: Barb:  I was first introduced to a Mojito about 12 years ago.  It was delicious!  Haven't had one since, probably because they seem to be so labor-intensive to make, with all that muddling of the mint leaves, etc.  So, I was curious about the Mojito drink offered by Crystal Light Mocktail line from Kraft foods.  The pitcher of Mojito drink that I whipped up was interesting, though it seemed a little on the weak side.  It was a strange green color, but there was a nice lime and minty flavor, kind of reminiscent of the one I had so long ago!  But the one big downfall for me was that pesky aftertaste of Aspartame!  Unfortunately, I have to watch my calorie/sugar intake now, so I'll be trying to get my tastebuds to accept that terrible aftertaste.  Unless Kraft foods Co. is willing to change the formula to use one of the other accepted sweeteners on the market...hint, hint.

review/summary: I could taste the lime and mint flavoring, and it's not ultra sweet
review/text: Crystal Light Mojito Mocktail<br /><br />Although I have never tried any alcoholic Mojito drinks, the Crystal Light Mojito mocktail mix was very good. The overall taste is not overly sweet, and I can definitely taste the lime and mint flavoring. It is not an overpowering sensation, although it isn't as sweet of a drink as the Crystal Light margarita mocktail mix or some of Crystal Light's other flavored teas and drinks.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, not overly sweet, and I could definitely taste the lime and mint. I drank an entire quart in one meal and thought it was fairly good although not something a child may enjoy since it isn't as sweet as the other Crystal Light flavored teas and juices.

review/summary: Yummy- I will keep this stocked in my pantry
review/text: I am a mojito snob- I grow two kinds of mint in my garden, and wasn't sure how I was going to like this.  I had some friends coming over last night and I mixed up a pitcher- slightly stonger than the directions- 6 cups of water instead of 8 since I was going to add crushed ice and rum. There are no directions for adding alcohol, I imagine this has something to do with liability and all that- but surely they had to know people were going to do this right?  Anyway it was good- really good, and my friend liked them too.  Since I am on a low carb diet, it was even better.  It was not as good as my home-made mojitos with real sugar, but not by much, and it IS way better than my attempts to make a sugar-free mojito.  And it was so convenient too!<br /><br />It would never have occurred to me to serve mojitos without the alcohol, but since that is what the manufacturer intended I tried it that too.  I mixed up another pitcher this morning and we had them with lunch and I made them as directed.  They were delicious- the kids liked it- they were light and not too sweet, and had an excellent mint flavor.  Very refreshing!

review/text: I enjoy Crystal Light's non-moctail flavors, and was very curious.  The mojito is as good as you would expect from Crystal Light.  It is flavorful and tastes similar to a mojito, though of course it's pretty clearly not a mojito.  The color is a cloudy light gray-green, which isn't bad.  I found the mint flavor a little light.  To make up for that, and to make it a little more special, adding a sprig of mint would be a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, the Mojito Moctail is another nice Crystal Light flavor.  I would enjoy it as any other flavor, more than for its similarity to a mojito.

review/summary: Good idea, but I wish they'd use Stevia
review/text: It's hard to believe this Crystal Light Moctails Mojito mix doesn't have any sodium, because it tastes a bit like a margarita. (I've never had a real mojito, so I don't know how this compares to the mixed drink.) In a glass over ice at a party, I doubt anyone could tell that it's not an alcoholic drink. Of course, I suppose you could tipple in some suitable spirits if you wanted to.<br /><br />What this product does have is the sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium, and I suspect the aftertaste of these in combination is what makes this Crystal Light drink taste a little salty. I know these sweeteners are chosen in part because of the long shelf life, not to mention being lower in calories than sugar, but I wish the manufacturer would consider a line using Stevia as a sweetener instead. I'd be more inclined to purchase this product if they did. I am particularly sensitive to aspartame (acesulfame potassium is a new one on me), so I tend to avoid it. The mix also contains a "trivial amount of sugar," whatever that means.<br /><br />Otherwise, this Crystal Light is easy to mix. The package comes with five packets, each of which mixes up into 2 quarts. The taste is quite strong when made according to the directions, so if you want it a little weaker, you can easily add more water or plenty of ice cubes.

review/summary: Crystal Clear that this isnt a Mojito.
review/text: I love me a Mojito. Usually made with white rum, sugar, lime juice, sparkling water and fresh mint, they are a refreshing cocktail that is both beautiful to look at and dangerous in excess...kinda like a woman.<br /><br /> When I saw that Crystal Light was making "mocktails" I admit to being curious. Crystal Light has been on my radar since 1982 when Linda Evans touted its low calorie wonderment on a commercial "I believe in Crystal Light, because I believe in me." My mom bought the stuff, thinking that it was better than drinking soda, which we never drank anyway, but more flavorful than water. I didnt like any of them , they always left a bad aftertaste and always looked like someone forgot to stir some Kool-aid properly...watery and barely there.<br /><br />This Mocktail tasted like a minty, fruity mixer for something stronger, as if it was on the counter waiting for someone to make a REAL alcoholic drink and you just needed a splash of this. It didnt have the wierd fakey aftereffect on the palate that crystal light usually has, but I wasnt all that impressed with it. It didnt taste like a Mojito thats for sure.<br /><br />If you are wanting to drink this because the real Mojitos have too many calories, then I cant help you..because one doesnt even compare to the other and In my opinion the real thing is worth every single caloric drop.

review/text: This is a fun drink.  It fits well into the Crystal Light family of drinks and as "Moctails" go is a good approximation of a Mojito.  It's just tart and lime enough with a hint of mint and looks good in a tall glass with a little umbrella.  It's obviously not a real Mojito with fresh mint and cane sugar but it's passable.  My main issue is the size, the packets make a half gallon each!  This make this really only good for parties because my wife and I just can't finish 8cups of mojito in a day.

review/text: At first I was not fond of this product since I was comparing it solely to a real Mojito.  While a real Mojito sports a much more distinct, unique, minty taste, the Crystal Light Moctail tastes more like a typical pleasant tasting Crystal Light mix.  Nevertheless, if you judge the Moctail as a tasty lo-cal diet beverage that's easier to make than the real thing, the Moctail earns a clear A.  These Moctails have a good lime and mint taste that's very sweet (impossibly sweet in my opinion) without using sugar and containing only 5 calories per serving!  They also seem to taste better several hours after making them.  The Moctails are an outstanding diet beverage, just don't try to compare them to the real thing.

I've never had an actual Mojito Cocktail.  I have seen the recipe for one, though.  It lists mint leaves as an ingredient.  I noticed no mint flavor at all in this mix.  I love Crystal Lite but will stick with the Margarita mix.  You can even put salt around your glass and it would be an amazing alcohol free drink.  I gave this five stars because I like drinking Crystal Lite mixes in just about all their flavors.

review/summary: A Hit At The Office
review/text: I wasn't expecting anything different with this Moctail drink from any other Crystal Light product - just a limeade with a hint of mint - since my experience with Moctail-similar products is there is no real effort to simulate the alcohol part. But there is an actual difference between the Moctail and a regular Crystal Light mix. There is a clear alcohol "dryness" (but not taste) to the Moctail drink not experienced in the regular juices. The juice part of the Moctail is similar in quality to what you'd get with other Crystal Light mixes - slightly artificial, but on the whole very refreshing and usually much better than what is offered by other labels. I didn't pick up on as much mint as I would have liked, or perhaps I am mistaking part of the mint as the "dryness" mentioned. The drink mixed very well with real alcohol. Makes for a super easy & satisfying drink either way.<br /><br />This was a great hit at the office. Everyone seemed to love it since it gave a little something different to drink than the regular sodas and water (and obviously can't take real alcohol in).

review/text: The Crystal Light Moctails (Mojito) is a great drink mix.  I was genuinely surprised by the quality.  Tastes like a mojito without the alcohol, making it perfect to serve at get-togethers where some folks don't or can't consume alcohol.  Or freeze and use instead of regular ice cubes for alcoholic drinks on the rocks.  It even has a pleasing smell that smells like a mojito.  When I handed a glass to my boyfriend to sample, his first response was "I don't want alcohol this late" because he thought it was an actual alcoholic beverage.<br /><br />Problem is, the Amazon price is much higher than you can buy this product in your local supermarket.  $22 for four containers works out to around $5.50 each.  This product sells in my local supermarket for $2.99-$3.99 depending on whether or not a catch it on sale.

review/summary: A Hint of Mint
review/text: How to describe this drink....<br /><br />First off, I liked it. The color is that of the white/clear energy drinks with a touch of blue/green in it. I thought of the blue milk Aunt Beru gave Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. (I don't know if that helped at all).<br /><br />The aroma is a very mild mint.<br /><br />However, as to the taste (as I reviewed Crystal Light's Appletini) in 2 quarts of water the taste is very mild, very muted. Disappointing. BUT mixing it 1 packet to 1 quart of water it was really enjoyable, the right amount of flavor. The taste is a hint of mint with the flavor of the white/clear energy drinks. (that's the best way I know how to describe it). It was very refreshing and I love the taste. The flavor also comes through more when cold or with ice.<br /><br />I would recommend this over Appletini solely because it's more mellow and not overwhelming, if you had friends over who were watching calories, I would serve this, very nice, very pleasant. It loses a star because if you followed the directions it's not all that in taste. Other than that, absolutely fabulous.<br /><br />4 stars.

review/summary: Odd
review/text: I liked it at first for the refreshing taste.  However, it this product leaves a strange after-taste that reminds me of soap or shampoo.  The color is also very strange.  The color is very pale, a little turquoise-like and almost looked fluorescent.  I would not buy this product.  It is just too odd.

review/summary: Refreshing low-calorie drink.
review/text: Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito is delightful! It's a low-calorie, non-alcoholic, refreshing beverage. Loaded with the flavors of lime and mint, this easy to make drink mix is a terrific way to enjoy the flavor without the alcohol and the calories that always come along with an alcoholic drink.<br /><br />Crystal Light is super easy to make - although I prefer to use a bit less water than what the package directions call for. This is a yummy, quick and easy way to enjoy a refreshing low-calorie "mocktail".

review/text: This Crystal Light  "mojito"  flavored drink mix is okay as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />The flavor is very different and unusual...not to be found everywhere...and for that I give extra points.<br /><br />The flavor is like a Mojito--I'd prefer a little more mint ...but the lime taste is there.<br /><br />Needs ice in the glass for best flavoring......but on a warm day...sit in a comfortable chair...with a tall ice filled glass.............<br /><br />On that day this drink is a little slice  of heaven.<br /><br />While I would not list this as my top flavor----  but to break up the monotony of my grape or strawberrys.. I like that change that it brings to the table.

review/summary: Another delish low cal cocktail from Crystal Light
review/text: This is another delicious alternative for a mojito.  Very tasty, in fact.  Each non-alcoholic 8 ounce glass is only 5 calories. But for me, a mocktail is no fun.  So, I did some math and mixing.  Adding 3/4 cup of Bacardi Silver (6 ounces) to the 2 quart mix, makes each 8 ounce glass only 53 calories (each 1 ounce of rum is 64 calories).  A standard mojito ranges between 200 and 235 calories, so this is 75% less calories! Very nice! Thanks Crystal Light!  Definitely recommended.

review/summary: A Refreshing Mocktail
review/text: Crystal Light has entered the market of non-alcoholic mix drinks with a few flavors. This review is for the Mojito mix and too me was the best tasting of their new product line. For a crystal light product this flavor is very well done. As with their other mixes it is not as good as a freshly made real Mojito but it is a refreshing drink with the Mojito favor with a little extra sweetness. An up side is that an eight ounce glass of crystal light has only five calories, The container contains five separate packets that will each make two quarts of the mix but I would suggest you not add the full amount of recommended water. As with most mixes I would give this a four if compared too the real thing but compared too the product that Crystal Light makes this one is done right. Note, if you do not like the regular Crystal Light products because of the artificial sweeteners you will rate this lower than I did.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito. I normally don't enjoy Crystal Light products (with the exception of their Peach Tea), but this stuff is fantastic! I use only 6 cups (instead of 8 cups) of water when I make it, and it comes out the perfect strength. The citrus and mint flavors come through wonderfully, and it's so easy to make. And at only 5 calories per serving (or a little more, since I make it stronger than called for), I can afford to drink the whole pitcher myself! I can see myself buying this product again and again.

review/text: This is such a nice light drink. It has a lovely lime taste but it doesn't quite taste like a limeaide. There is a touch of mint in it as well, exactly what an alcoholic mojito might taste like. It is a nice refreshing flavor.<br /><br />I don't drink so I can not compare this to the 'real alcoholic version'. But I love this drink and will be buying more of this in the near future.<br /><br />I like Crystal Light so I expected that my family and I would  like this drink. However, I was surprised at how much we all enjoyed it. My husband generally does not enjoy juices and drinks such as this. However, he drank more than one glass and agreed it was very refreshing.<br /><br />Worth the money.<br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Yummiest Crystal Light on the Shelf
review/text: I'm not going to lie--I was more than a little bit skeptical about Crystal light's new lo cal moctail flavors. I worried this would taste like the watery half-inch remnant of a poorly mixed drink left at 2 a.m. in a sad little casino off interstate I-40. But WHOA. These are too yummy. They are tasty and appromixate the cocktail taste well enough, sans alcohol, of course. It's not the same as ordering a top shelf Mojito, but it definitely passes the test for me. I'm stocking up.<br /><br />I've tried both the Margarita and the Mojito flavor and the Mojito is favorite. Forget raspberry lemonade, these moctails are yummy.<br /><br />I like drinking the moctails on ice, but you can also jazz it up and mix it up in the blender with a splash of something extra. Seriously. No kidding. Try it.

review/text: This is definitely my favorite new drink mix in the Mocktail line by Crystal Light.  It's a great tasting lime flavored drink.  The artificial sweetener gives this a very slight aftertaste, but just slight.  And I like the fact that it is only 5 calories per serving.  Each pouch makes enough to fill a large pitcher.  There isn't any type of alcohol flavor, which is fine with me.  It's a very refreshing drink.  I can drink this stuff all day!

review/summary: Better if you don't think of it as a mojito.
review/text: Mojitos are my favorite drink, so I thought I'd try this version. I didn't expect much, so I wasn't disappointed to find that it just doesn't taste like a real mojito. How could it?? Mojitos are made with fresh lime and mint, not with chemicals. I even like mine with a real sugarcane stirring stick.<br /><br />Since I wasn't expecting the real thing, I found that I enjoyed this drink if I didn't think of it as a mojito. It's cloyingly sweet at first, and has that sweetener aftertaste at first, but after I got used to it I found that I enjoyed it as a nice lime-y minty koolaid kind of thing.<br /><br />I'd suggest doctoring it up a bit with some real mint, if you have it. I grow it in the backyard -- very easy to grow and hard to kill!

review/text: I'm a big fan of real Mojitos so I asked if I could review this product for Amazon Vine.  As expected though, this tastes nothing like the real thing.  Does that mean it's bad? No, not at all.  Just think of it as a lime flavored crystal light product instead of a Mojito substitute.  Like the other reviewers, I did notice a slight aftertaste but that's true of most crystal light products because of the artificial sweetener.  This is a really refreshing, super low calorie drink for these hot days of summer.

This mojito mix is disgusting and after drinking a single half-glass, I'm dumping the entire pitcher and throwing out the rest of the package.  Yes, it's that bad.  The synthetic "mint" flavor hits hard and continues to punish long after you've swallowed.

I thought it was just the right amount of lime and mint flavor, but my wife thought it could use a little more mint.  Overall, it was a great drink that I'll continue to look for in the grocery store.  Best served chilled.  Add alcohol if you like or its fine on its own.  Each container includes 5 packets, each of which makes 2 quarts.

review/summary: Finished Product: Cloudy, All you taste is Mint.
review/text: This product is good to mix in with alcohol (such as Bacardi) when you ran out of mint, and would like to host a party for friends, and need a cool and interesting drink to make super fast.<br /><br />As a stand alone, it taste like a lemonade that has been dunked in mint (you can taste more of the mint than the lemon when you drink it, and the aftertaste is very minty). I find that if you dilute the drink, it taste more lemonade-like and less minty-like, but if you make it very strong, all you taste is the mint.<br /><br />The finished product is very cloudy as well. Usually when you make mojitos, its hard to distinguish it from water unless you use sprite or any carbonated water. The finished product has a very cloudy look.<br /><br />I am on the fence over whether I like it or not. But if you love mojitos like I do, I do think you should try it first before making any reservations about it, especially if you really like the taste of mint.

review/summary: Great mojito flavor and if you are clever, you can make cocktails out of this too
review/text: I haven't had Crystal Light for a long time.  Not since my childhood, when my mom used to drink it.  But it really hasn't changed except it has gotten more sophisticated with flavor.  What would have been a good lime drink has gotten an extra jolt, do to the mint added.  It tastes good without much aftertaste.  I discovered you can even make cocktails from this, by muddling a small part of the drink powder with a little bit of lemon or lime juice and mint, then adding light rum.  I made a green tea mojito this way and it was very tasty.  I suppose it could be made with a little of the mix and some water, as long as you make the cocktail prep a bit thick.  I tried mixing light rum with a pitcher of 2 quarts and it tasted like a mojito that was watered down, like the ice had melted in it.  But with some experimentation, i got the mix to taste good as a cocktail mixer.  But it is a good drink on it's own as well. There could be less packaging, but that is a minor gripe, since I can recycle the plastic near me, but I am not sure if others can.  I wonder if these could even be sold with less plastic packaging.  Or a more slender tube.

review/text: It's something of a pain to put a genuine mojito mix together, what with making the simple syrup and processing the mint leaves, and, while not claiming that the Crystal Light mix tastes like the real thing, it isn't bad and it's certainly convenient. It is not too sweet, and it has a pleasant, mild minty flavor. I haven't yet tried it with a generous slug of rum but I'm confident that the rum will improve it, and that after a couple of those, one might feel positively enthusiastic about the Moctail Mojito mix.

review/summary: Minty light drink without the sins of a true Mojito
review/text: This Mojito "Mocktail" flavor by Crystal Light is a light minty treat that is very sipable.  The flavor is mild and not at all over powering.  My pre-teen son even likes it, although he prefers a the Appletini flavor better.  A true Mojito has white rum, sugar, lime, and mint.  This version leaves behind all the alcohol and the sugar.  I cannot tell you if this tastes just like a real version because I have never had a Mojito.  I can tell you that it is a choice when you are tired of the lemonades and teas that predominate the Crystal Light line-up.  If you wish you could always add some white rum in and put it in a fancy glass for some adult fun!  I would buy this one again.

review/text: Yesterday, I received a free container of this refreshing, non-alcoholic mix to sample and absolutely loved this sweetly tangy blend of lime and mint flavors. Obviously, this is not as tasty as the real thing (nor as expensive or caloric as a bar-made mojito, with fresh lime and mint) but it's a really refreshing and surprisingly delicious for a convenient mix. It would be even tastier with a squeeze of fresh lime, a few crushed mint leaves, or if you choose, a splash of rum.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Crystal Light for years, and this flavor is a new favorite. I hope Crystal Light considers making it widely available.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

I know there are people with adverse reactions to aspartame and this product does use it as the artificial sweetener.  If you are looking for a non-alcoholic alternative for a mojito this is one to try.
