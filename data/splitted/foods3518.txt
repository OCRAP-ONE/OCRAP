review/summary: the perfect olive oil!
review/text: I'm in love with Partanna olive oil.  I am always willing try out others but I suspect I've found my go to every day olive oil right here.  First of all, the flavor is rich, with complexity and delicacy too, but it's very full bodied.  There's no question about it, you're using real olive oil when it's Partanna.  (My complaint about olive oil lately, is the flavor is too mild.)<br /><br />The color is a lovely green and the oil itself is clear.  For all the years I've used olive oil, I haven't tasted or even seen a cloudy/fresh oil but I'm going to try to get a can after October when it's just been pressed, just for that experience.  I'm sure it's delicious.<br /><br />THis is the olive oil I've been looking for.  It's not overpowering if you like the olive flavor - and this oil tastes like olives.  Partanna is REAL olive oil, not generic vegetable oil, or the recent crop os vaguely flavored EVOOs.  So if you like the rich flavor of olives, this may be for you.<br /><br />enjoy!

review/summary: European Flair from South San Francisco
review/text: Torani, the flavored syrup often presumed to originate from Italy, but actually manufactured in South San Francisco ("The industrial City"--their motto, not mine) makes many delicious flavors, and hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The hazelnut refers to any nuts from the species of the genus Corylus. While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other candies (including "NUtella") to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene,  and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping.  Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem.  Torani'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth of flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink.  It's not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It's relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone.

review/summary: Makes a fantastic Caramel Matcha Latte!
review/text: I have always been a lover of all things caramel. I've probably tried every caramel cookie, cake, ice cream, tea, coffee, pastry, and countless other items that contain caramel. But I am very picky about caramel flavorings. Many of them taste too artificial, butterscotch-y, or are just too faint for me to enjoy. Happily, this Caramel Matcha did not disappoint me. When I received the package in the mail, I immediately knew my Matcha had arrived. There was a wonderful, strong smell of candy-like caramel coming from the package. After actually opening the package and smelling more caramel goodness, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />I decided to try this as a latte. So I prepared it using my usual method of 2 grams Matcha, 2 ounces of skim milk, 3-4 scoops of stevia, and 6 ounces of water. I whisked this up using my electric milk frother and tried it. It was very good, but a little strong. After adding another 2 ounces of water, it was close to perfection. This Matcha is very smooth and rich. Even though I used very little milk, it tasted so creamy. The caramel flavor is just right - enough flavor that you can definitely taste it, but not enough to outshine the flavor of the Matcha. This may be one of the best drinks I've ever made at home, and I'm actually kind of proud.

review/summary: Awesome flavor!
review/text: The flavoring is absolutely caramel.  No doubt about it.  It smells so rich and sweet you'd expect to get a sugar shock from drinking it, but it's only as sweet as the natural sweetness of a good matcha.  And the matcha base used is good!  The flavor isn't just some mask for an inferior tea!<br /><br />The color of this tea is a bit brownish.  Those who are used to the vibrant green of matcha may be a bit shocked at first, but the brownish tint is undoubtedly from the flavoring.  The awesome awesome flavoring.  Drink it straight for a decadent treat without the cavaties, or make it into a mind blowing latte.  yummy!  You can use it to add caramel flavor to anything!  caramel vanilla matcha milkshake?  Yes please!  Caramel matcha hot chocolate?  Mmmmm...no words.

review/summary: Matcha meets candy.
review/text: This matcha is awesome. I am a caramel addict, so sometimes I'll get something caramel flavored without really thinking about it, which was the case with this tea. But really, the flavors work really well together.<br /><br />The flavor almost reminds me of what I'd imagine green tea creme brulee would taste like. It's got the obvious green tea taste from the matcha itself, but then there's the sweet, creamy notes from the caramel. It's okay when it's hot and by itself, but I think it's vastly improved when it's made as an iced matcha latte. No sugar necessary there.<br /><br />Beyond drinking it, this seems like it would make an excellent flavor for cakes and ice cream. I am definitely going to give it a try in ice cream in the summer.

review/summary: Oh My Matcha
review/text: So in my search for the perfect vanilla (which I've now found in Red Leaf Tea's French Vanilla matcha), I've found that many caramel teas are close enough to temporarily satisfy me. But after a while I miss that vanilla creaminess and begin the hunt anew. Plus, caramel is my favorite sweet candy, though I prefer sour candies. But as a child who went through two sets of braces, caramel was not a treat I was allowed to indulge in often. But every Halloween I would buy a bag of those Caramel Apple suckers, braces be damned, and make them last for ages. My love affair with caramel has been a long and torrid one.<br /><br />Anyway, caramel brings out those feel-good feeling in me. So of course when I was ordering my Green Apple matcha from Red Leaf Teas, the caramel had to tumble into my cart too! I have to try them mixed, or I'll be doing my teenage self a grave disservice. But first, I'm going to try it by itself, with sugar added, of course. If it's anything like their French Vanilla, I'm in for a treat. I'm trying to try all of the new ones, but all I want to do is return to that little gem.<br /><br />On to the caramel! I'm only making a small cup of this as it is 9:30 at night and I want to sleep at some point. But hey, sleep is for the weak and matcha-less, right? Right. The smell is amazing. Like I just want to crawl into the package and spend the rest of forever there. The taste...mmm. Mmmmm....mmmm. Okay, it tastes like....mmmm. Maybe I needed a bigger cup. A soup bowl, perhaps. Guh...mmmm. It tastes like the French Vanilla, but with a lovely burnt sugar aftertaste that is rocking my world right now. It tastes like real caramel made on the stovetop with nothing but sugar, cream, and a big mess that is completely worth it. Mmmmm. When I was in high school, at a church carnival I won a caramel cake. It was a caramel-flavored cake that was laced with real caramel bits, caramel icing and drizzled with, you guessed it, caramel. This reminds me of that. Or the caramel pie from O'Charley's, which was essentially a pie crust filled with caramel. This is amazing, and I want to order some with the "There's matcha in this?" flavoring option so I can just drown in the caramelly goodness. This is a must-always-have-in-stock for me.

review/summary: Great Flavour!
review/text: I bought the caramel matcha more or less on a whim - it was on sale, so I could get a bigger size! Thinking back, I'm really glad I did. I am much more of a chocolate or vanilla person - caramel is not something that I normally lean towards. Red Leaf Tea hasn't steered me wrong yet! I am amazed at how much I like this!<br /><br />Dry, the caramel smell is strong and very distinctive. If I didn't know what flavour it was, I would have guessed correctly! In no way does it overwhelm or taste artificial though. I decided to take some to work with me, so I made it iced. It reminded me of a caramel version of chocolate milk - great flavour, creamy and all-round delicious. It was so good I even let two of my coworkers try it, and they agreed that it was heavenly.<br /><br />I find that my favourite way to have sweet flavoured matchas is as a latte or an iced latte, and I usually add a little bit of honey, depending on the specific flavour. My thermometer is currently m.i.a (I think it's at the bungalow) so I've just been letting the water get a little warm in the kettle and everything has been turning out great! I am thinking that caramel might become a staple flavour in my tea cupboard and I love having the chance to try so many wonderful flavours. I would highly recommend picking up some of this.<br /><br />I'd say that overall, this was my second favourite flavour (behind tiramisu) If you like caramel at all you should try this!

I have tried this hot, cold, somewhere in the middle, smoothie, latte..etc. Basically I've tried it all with my small 30g sample (basic grade a.k.a classic with robust flavour). I like this best hot half matcha, half milk and marshmallows! The customer service is great if you have any problems or questions just ask them :D I also ordered with the tin since the bags aren't resealable. The small tin fits very nicely into my cupboard and helps my tea take up a lot less space! I recommend this to everyone!

review/summary: Great Tasting Matcha
review/text: I am the very definition of a beginning matcha drinker: I have never once even tried matcha before, much less made it myself. But I couldn't help but order one of Red Leaf Tea's myriad of flavored matchas. This one sounded delicious!<br /><br />The minute I cut open the foil envelope of matcha I was swamped with delicious caramel scent. Smelling it a bit closer brought out a kind of fruity aroma, which I assume must just be the matcha. It kind of reminded me of a caramel apple or something like that. Following the instructions on the brochure I ended up sifting 1.5tsp in my bowl (I was unsure on the instructions whether each scoop was supposed to be 0.5-1tsp, or two scoops was that total?). My very fine sieve (yay HomeGoods) worked well, and there were definitely more clumps than it first seemed, so I'm glad I sifted. I added a few ounces of water (though I didn't measure exactly how much) at about 180�F and whisked with my metal cooking whisk vigorously. It frothed pretty well but I think my technique is lacking! Right when the water hit the matcha I smelled a much stronger green tea flavor and a distinct earthiness, but not so much caramel.<br /><br />I took a sip, but it was pretty strong and bitter so I whisked some more, added more water and whisked some more. Better. Still a little bitter, but I am chalking that up to user error. Maybe I just need to add some sugar, too, since I tend to be a bit sensative to bitterness, but I didn't have any with me. Anyway, that kind of fruity caramel came through, the flavor blooming in the sip. The green tea wasn't too vegetal or in your face like I was fearing. The caramel was not as strong as I thought it would be, but it was present (and again that might be user error), and I did finish the entire bowl pretty fast! I am excited to try this in latte form, and I'm sure I will look up all kinds of tips and tricks for matcha now. I also wanted matcha to add to smoothies and to try some baking with it, and this seems like it would be amazing for both. I just bought some brownie mix at the store, and now I am thinking maybe some caramel matcha brownies? I don't know if the flavor would be drowned out, though. Research must be done!

review/summary: A wonderful introduction to flavoured matcha!
review/text: It took me a long time to finally place an order for some Red Leaf Tea matcha, and now that I have it in my hands (and my tummy!) I wish I had have purchased it sooner.<br /><br />I was unsure whether I would find it too much of a fuss to prepare matcha myself, or whether I would enjoy the delicious sweet grassy taste of matcha paired with rich flavourings. Matcha seemed to me more like a tea you should enjoy on its own. But honestly, let me tell you, the caramel flavour and the bright, fresh matcha make a perfect coupling. And I have found the preparation to be much easier than expected!<br /><br />I have had other plain matchas before, but they simply do not compare in flavour or quality to this caramel matcha. So far I have tried it hot with no additions, and hot with milk and sugar. I much prefer it sweetened with milk, as that cuts down on the strength of the vegetal qualities of the matcha. It also really brings out the caramel sweetness. On its own I found it a bit too strong, but I tend to like milk and sugar in most of my teas.<br /><br />Overall I'm very glad I have some of this on hand now, and I can't wait to try out some of their other flavours. I have my eye on cheesecake, cotton candy, boysenberry, french vanilla, pear, and so many others! I think I may have found a new addiction. At least it's a healthy one!

review/summary: Caramel Matcha - very tasty and easy to make!
review/text: I'd say I'm a beginner with Matchas. I've never made a straight up cup of matcha, but I've had matcha pre-mixed with genmaicha teas. One of my favourite sushi joints has "iced green tea" which is matcha iced - excellent and refreshing with sushi! However in stores, I found matcha to be quite expensive. My local tea shops sold basic matchas with no fun flavors a little out of my price range to try a new kind of tea that I'm unsure is good, fresh and packaged right. Best prices I could find was in asian super markets. I've often purchased pre-measured matcha mixes or little tubs that stated it was for ice cream and baking. These mixes were still on the expensive side, so I used them sparingly to make smoothies or add to vanilla ice cream. The matcha mixes I disliked because they contained creamers and sweeteners thus calories I could do without. The unsweetened ones I found were often bitter and occasionally tasted like dirty grass.<br /><br />I saw Red Leaf's matchas reviewed at Steepster and became interested - so many different flavors! As a crazy tea drinker with a stash of over 100, I love interesting and fun tea blends, especially ones that have chocolate, exotic fruits, or caramel. Red Leaf has a big selection of various flavors. Personally, I never saw flavored matchas until I discovered Red Leaf's site. I had to order this Caramel Matcha!<br /><br />I then realized I have no traditional matcha gear, no bamboo whisk, funky spoons or bowl to prepare my matcha. I could of purchased it along with my order, but I had a tea budget to follow. I figured for now I'll make do with a tiny wire whisk, measuring spoon and a wide tea cup.<br /><br />My package arrived in a flat envelope, the matcha in a non resealable gold bag. My package also had a pamphlet on their various matchas and how to prepare it.<br /><br />TIME TO ENJOY MATCHA!<br /><br />Smell of the matcha powder - Strong grassy green tea smell with a spark of sweetness. From sniffing the matcha bag, I got green dust on the tip of my nose!<br /><br />First Cup - The Matcha Protein Smoothie<br />Red Leaf has a collection of matcha recipes to get you started. I followed the recipe on Red Leaf's website for the Matcha Smoothie with Protein Powder.<br />I used a frozen banana, fat free plain Silk soy milk, ON 100% soy protein vanilla powder and 2tsp of the Caramel Matcha.<br /><br />The colour of my smoothie is a milky yet dark matcha green. The caramel in the matcha is smooth and perfect strength that I can imagine it being gooey yummy. The banana adds extra depth and sweetness. I did not find the smoothie bitter or in need of additional sweeteners. The matcha and banana hid the protein powder taste. With that said, I figure this large smoothie was around 270 calories and is a great post workout smoothie that has 32g of protein. I'm going to make this smoothie again next time I lift weights.<br /><br />Second Cup - The Real Deal cup of Matcha<br />Using the instructions from the website, I carefully sift 1 tsp of the caramel matcha through a fine mesh tea pot strainer - it went surprisingly well and not messy at all.<br />Annoyingly, my hot water kettle does 185F (not 180F) so I went with 175F. I poured in about 1/3 of a cup of water and whisked away with my tiny wire whisk. It took a couple minutes to get a 1cm of delicious looking matcha froth. I then added a bit more hot water to taste.<br /><br />My cup was a beautiful deep green. The Caramel matcha is delicately flavored but with a full bodied green tea taste. Not watery or bitter or nasty grassy. The caramel is a fun present at the end of my sip and lingers as an aftertaste.<br /><br />Third Cup - The Matcha latte<br />I followed the same procedure I did for the hot cup of matcha, but added 2 tsp of sugar and topped the frothy matcha with soymilk and ice cubes. The result was very magical as the sugar and cold temperature makes the caramel pop more. I discovered it is possible to drink something and drool over it at the same time! This was better than lattes I've got from local coffee joints, much cheaper and less calories (with an additional plus that I can use the soy milk I like).<br /><br />From my first experience of steeping up my own real matcha, I found I have a new favorite tea. Red Leaf Tea's Caramel Matcha is tasty, better than anything I had from a mix or made from a coffee shop. I had more control over the amount of sweetener and milk.<br /><br />Red Leaf was very clear in their instructions on how to prepare matcha so a newbie like me could make a perfect cup.<br />With that said, I'm totally going to try more matchas from Red Leaf Teas. First, I think having a frother/hand mixer or bamboo whisk would of made the matcha frothing process go faster - especially for impatient "I need tea now!" types like me. of matcha would be fabulous.

review/summary: Fantastic flavored matcha & it's sugar-free!
review/text: Let me first tell you that before I was turned on to Read Leaf Tea, I would sometimes put in some good quality caramel sauce into my matcha lattes as a treat - I really do love good caramel flavoring! Thanks to this company, I don't have to do that anymore - AND I can control the sugar amount!<br /><br />Upon pouring out the contents of the robustly-flavored Caramel Green Matcha from the non-resealable, gold foil packaging into the tin, I could smell the sweetness of caramel. I HAD to make a bowl right then and there!<br /><br />For this first preparation I sifted a teaspoon of matcha powder into my bowl - I highly recommend doing this! Without it, you risk the chance of having clumpy matcha, and no one wants that! I wisked in two ounces of warmed water with my electric frother until the matcha was fully dissolved. Filled the bowl with the rest of the warmed water, about 6 ounces worth.<br /><br />I found the caramel missing an element - maybe it's sweetness, which is something I usually associate with caramel. While Red Leaf Tea doesn't add any sugar to their matchas, I found this benefited from some added sweetener.<br /><br />I also think I might prefer the Caramel Matcha prepared as a sweeter latte - either hot or cold.<br /><br />I do look forward to playing around with the Caramel Matcha more - mixing it with other flavored matchas from this company. Caramel Cheesecake, Caramel Green Apple, Caramel Espresso, Caramel Vanilla, just to name a few! Oooo and I bet baking with this is going to be AMAZING!

review/text: In a word, this matcha is YUMMY!<br /><br />But, you probably want more than one word, so, I will add a few more!<br /><br />I love the sweet, delicious, creaminess of this flavored matcha.  Sure, I prefer unflavored Matcha most of the time, but sometimes I want to change things up a bit, and I love the selection of flavors that Red Leaf Tea offers, and the flavors are amazingly good.  This would make a great dessert substitute that is so delicious that you'll forget that it's quite good for you too!<br /><br />Really and truly yummy.  If you like caramel and you like Matcha, you're in for a treat with this.  If you're new to Matcha - this would be a really good starting point too ... then again, this is so delicious, it might be difficult to try something else if you start here!<br /><br />YUM!

And it definitely makes magic with matcha. The flavor of the tea is like the best caramel candy I've ever had, only in liquid form so I can get more of it into me faster. It makes a killer latte and I'm sure it would be just amazing in baked goods. I can't wait to try a caramel matcha cake!

review/summary: Fantastic flavoured matcha!
review/text: I've been meaning to try Matcha again for quite a long time and this is my first foray back into it... it was well worth it. I traveled to Japan in 2009 and unknowingly had Matcha several times at random sushi restaurants, etc. It was interesting there but I just figured it was a normal green tea, nothing special right? Oh man, was I wrong! This stuff really is something to pay attention to, and the different flavor and health benefits possible with matcha are well beyond any standard green tea. This is really a fascinating beverage and I am excited to get back into it.<br /><br />Before this, I had never tried a flavoured matcha, in fact I had no idea such a thing could exist! Red Leaf pulls off the flavoured matcha with grace and skill, and offers a wild and impressive set of expected (vanilla bean, caramel, etc.) flavours and some wildly crazy and epic sounding ones (Coca Cola Matcha?!!!!) I am gonna have to try that one.<br /><br />I bought the Red Leaf Starter (Basic Grade), Delicate flavouring of Caramel Matcha. This is available on their site here: [...]<br /><br />Since I am a bit of a matcha newbie, I had to read their site about how to prepare it. It was very helpful. I got a whisk from Japantown and used a Chashaku (Bamboo Scoop) to measure out the matcha. I used 2 scoops and my first cup used the suggested amount, 3 oz of 80C water. I whisked it, poured it from the bowl to a mug and drank it from a mug, no extra water added. This was my previous experience with matcha in general, quite thick and vegetal. It was good.<br />In fact it was so good, I found myself going back to the kitchen to make a 2nd cup of it not 1 hr later!! This time I decided to change it up a bit, using only 1 scoop of matcha this time and a little less water, and then after whisking, adding a fair bit more water to reduce the thickness and make a larger drink. I think I actually enjoyed this better, it was a little sweeter this way and also allowed for a more tea-like experience (rather than a sort of "tea shot" like I had earlier). This was very tasty!<br /><br />These are the only ways I have prepared it so far but I think it might be wiser (for my unrefined palate!) to buy the "Distinctive" flavouring next time so that I can get a stronger flavor. This one is subtle, but I tend to enjoy stronger more bold flavourings in my tea, so I think the next one I get from Red Leaf I will pay just a little extra to get more flavouring. Excited to follow this new tasty and healthy habit!

review/summary: Sweet, with a tang of bitterness from the rind
review/text: I love lemon marmalade. Lemon marmalade is pretty hard to find on the store shelves in USA, so I was excited when I saw two different lemon marmalade in gourmet store in Rockport, Mass. Thursday Cottage Marmalade was one of them.  It comes in a fairly large bottle (16 oz) and has a nice deep golden color.  Lemon marmalade is pretty common in UK, and this one is made and imported from England.<br /><br />Thursday Cottage Lemon Marmalade is a true marmalade not a jello, it has a medium cut lemon rind and has a pleasant texture.  I am attaching a photo under customers photo in which you can see the content rather then the label.  About a year ago when I purchased a "lemon marmalade" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BSWIQA">Fruitfield Little Chip Lemon Marmalade</a> on Amazon, I received a bottle of jello which had no strips of fruit. I was disappointed as I don't like jellos. The texture was not obvious from the description or the stock photo as the photo showed just the label. Hopefully my photo will make the texture of the content more clear:  Thursday Cottage is not a thick jam all through out but has a good amount of fruit especially at the top.<br /><br />The marmalade is rather sweet (I prefer my lemon marmalade a little tarter) and has a bit of tang of bitterness from the rind (in a nice way).  Overall I liked it fine, although it was not the best I ever tried.  I use lemon jam when cooking as well straight out of the jar with my tea.<br /><br />List of ingredients:<br /><br />Raw cane sugar<br />Lemons<br />Gelling agent<br />Citrus Pectin<br />Prepared with 35g of fruit per 100g sugar content<br />Total sugar content 60g per 100g<br /><br />Nutrition Facts for serving size of 1 tablespoon (20g):<br /><br />Calories 50<br />Total fat 0<br />Sodium 0<br />Total Carb 12g (4%)<br />Protein 0g<br /><br />Ali Julia review

Basically, if you really like malt, this doesn't taste like it. The only upside is that it's a little larger than most energy bars and it's filling but the taste is pretty bland. The search continues! I think I'm going to try a oat and fruit bar next.

review/summary: Parent, Kid, or Grandparent:  Go with Golean by Kashi !
review/text: I love Kashi products.  We eat several of the Kashi dry cereals. I need a good and healthy snack bar for travel or for when I can't stop to breakfast.  This, for me , is a great choice.  I would also recommend this as a healthy snack for kids after school or while doing homework...goes great with a tall glass of lowfat or skim milk. I also buy other Kashi bar products for my husband to take out on the golf links.  So, I say:  Go anywhere, anytime with Kashi Golean.

review/summary: Not the real deal
review/text: Kikkoman mirin is probably what's called mirin-fu chomiryo (literally mirin-like seasoning). It's certainly not hon mirin (true mirin). If you look at the ingredients list, you'll see a big give away: Rice, Water, **Corn Syrup**, Alcohol, Salt. I'm not even sure this is made with rice wine. It's got rice and (a very little) alcohol in it, but it's sweetened with corn syrup. That's not mirin.<br /><br />Real mirin is sweetened by rice that has been subjected to the Aspergillus oryzae fungus, which breaks down the rice starches into sugar. It's what's used in the production of sake. Mirin uses the same fungus to produce the unfermented sugars that sweeten this essential Japanese cooking wine.<br /><br />If you're looking for the real thing, go to an Asian market and check the labels. Anything with sugar or corn syrup in it isn't authentic. Eden Foods also makes a widely available and very good mirin made from organic brown rice, rice koji (Aspergillus oryzae), pure water and sea salt.<br /><br />(The salt in mirin sold in the US is not authentic either, it's added to calssify the wine as cooking wine, thereby avoiding alcohol taxes).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read the labels and opt for authenticity. You won't regret it.

review/summary: Necessary
review/text: Mirin and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00194JM4Q">Soy Sauce</a>.  That is all you really need for authentic Japanese cooking.  And you need it everywhere.  Those two liquids are the foundation for almost all recipes, and are used in some quantity in every dish.  I do a considerable amount of Japanese cooking, and running out of mirin sends me into panic mode and heading out to the store.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking that "teriyaki sauce" has anything with Japanese cuisine.  Purely an American invention, true teriyaki cooking is a combination of mirin and soy sauce, based on the meat or vegetables which are then slowly cooked, rotating sides until they become a delicious brown sticky mess.  It is sooo much better than the fast food restaurants try to pass off as "Japanese teriyaki".<br /><br />When it comes to brands, it is hard to go wrong with Kikkoman.  For both mirin and soy sauce, they put out a consistently good product that you can count on to enhance your cooking.  There are probably more refined and expensive brands out there, but Kikkoman does me just fine, as it does for the millions of Japanese households where it sees daily use.<br /><br />As a sweetened wine, mirin adds flavor as well as nutrients to a dish, and can even be used as a sugar substitute in some recipes for those trying to escape from refined white sugar.  Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804835942">Japanese Foods That Heal</a> for an in-depth discussion on mirin's health benefits and uses.

review/summary: The secret ingredient
review/text: I'm not sure why, but it seems like a lot of the recipes my friends have for teriyaki sauce are almost exactly like mine. Except for this one ingredient. Then they want to know why mine tastes a lot better. It's the mirin, plus using a bit less sugar because my husband prefers not-as-sweet teriyaki sauces.<br />For quick meals at home, I just mix the ingredients in a measuring cup, and stir them directly in my wok without making a glossy sauce out of it. For grilling, I cook the sauce and thicken it with corn starch mixed into a couple tablespoons of mirin. We also use mirin for our rice balls to add a little flavor to the rice. This is a nice inexpensive choice for mirin and adds a good flavor. Like vinegar, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, it's a staple in my kitchen for homecooked meals.

It's got a sweet taste that isn't as sweet as sugar but it's more calories ( I'm kinda OBESSED with turbinado sugar right now) but for pecan pie it's a must. Although people tend to use the dark one for pecan pie. Good quality. The only reason I give it four stars is target brand is cheaper.

They were also ready to eat as is, which was appealing because my other choice was a raw cacao treat in a jar or a bar--which was a lot more expensive. I also would have wanted to add some sweetener to the jar product.<br /><br />I tasted them right there in the store and added one more bag immediately to my purchase because they were so perfect. It's the coconut sugar which is part of the incredible flavor.<br /><br />They really do give the satisfaction of the old familiar "Tollhouse" I used to eat. They have thick coating of crystallized chocolate which is sweetened to perfection by the new coconut sugar products out there. The pink salt and vanilla are perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Addendum: MUST TRY ... I put these chocolate melt-in-your-mouth crunchies on TOP of my cacao bliss as a topping. I fantasized about putting them on Bishops I-Scream ...

review/text: Since I've mostly ever tried or made savory kale chips, at first glance the idea of chocolate flavored chips disgusted me. I was picking up a bag of the zesty ranch kind(on an empty stomach) and was craving chocolate, so I grabbed it on the off-chance that it would be edible. What a surprise! These are truly delicious, and really crunchy. Moreso than the savory flavors, in fact.<br />The combo was chocolate-y and a bit nutty (the kale, I'm sure) in flavor, and totally satisfied my craving for sweets without resorting to something with high-fructose corn syrup or some other chemical ingredient I'd be unable to pronounce. Came to amazon to buy a cart load for evenings when I want a bite of something sweet after dinner. Dessert packed with nutrients? Genius.

review/summary: Chockalet Chip - cute play on words and yumm
review/text: I had purchased 2 bags of the pressed kale chips made by Kai foods. There was an issue with the chips and the vendor was just so sweet and sent me 2 bags of the new stuff. One of the bags was Chockalet Chip.<br /><br />I wasn't really sure if chocolate would go with kale... but I LOVE kale so I was like, ahhh why not?<br /><br />First I have to say that the new Kale Krunch is made using the full kale leaves. This alone is a huge improvement over the pressed chips in both the visual appeal and the mouth feel and taste. These chips do actually crunch...<br /><br />Each bag is 2.2 ounces and a serving is 1 ounce. Honestly, this is a snack to be enjoyed. Take the time to fully enjoy the flavor of the chip and all the notes as you eat it.<br /><br />As I savor a piece I can fully taste the rich kale flavor covered in chocolate via organic cocoa butter and organic cocoa powder. These two flavors are prominent and complement each other. The chocolate is a dark chocolate that is smooth and rich without being bitter or at the point where only avid dark chocolate lovers would enjoy the flavor. It is more mild than sharp, and as stated above it does not overpower the kale... the kale also does not overpower it, rather they are equals in this taste partnership. At the finish of the chip is a nice sweetness with a hint of vanilla.<br /><br />This is a crisp savory chip with a light sweet finish. There is salt, but it isn't salty. There is sugar but it isn't sweet, except the nice light sweet finish.<br /><br />Chockalet Chip Kale Krunch is made to be both healthy and a delicious experience. Yes, it is pricey, which makes me want to play around and try and make my own... but omg my mouth is telling me that I am quickly developing an addiction that is going to lead me towards kale seeking tendencies by the time I reach the bottom of this bag.<br /><br />The changes at Kaia foods are positive thus far, at least as far as this chip is concerned. They got it soooo right that I am excited to see what they might do next... that and I can't wait to try the other bag they sent me, Quite Cheezy Kale Krunch.

review/summary: Southern Pecan - Office Favorite
review/text: After trying all the flavored coffee Variety packs sold on the Keurig site, this probably rates #1.<br /><br />I'll be the first to say that Southern Pecan did not sound like it was soon to become a daily staple, but the richness and flavor of this coffee is one of the best in the k-cup selection.  The flavor of the coffee is reminiscent of a pecan pie, the coffee is quite flavorful and is even sweet on it's own.<br /><br />I generally probably over-sweeten and cream my coffees, but with the Southern Pecan I find just a little sweetener is great and often take it without any cream.  This coffee smells great as well, easily filling the entire office with it's rich scent.<br /><br />I've been purchasing an assortment of k-cups for the office and find this is one I have to constantly re-order.<br /><br />I do recommend shopping around a bit as k-cup prices tend to be constantly fluctuating on Amazon.

review/text: 24 ct boxes of Southern Pecan are available on plenty of other sites for about $12.  Why does Amazon think they can charge more than twice that?

review/summary: Okay, but not the best.
review/text: I am really picky about my coffee.  For some reason, I decided that a flavored coffee would be nice for the fall and winter.  I like other Green Mountain Coffees, especially their darker blends.  The southern pecan was fairly weak, and I wasn't crazy about the Pecan flavor; I got more of a praline taste rather than a nutty flavor.  This is probably not a bad coffee fo everyone, but it's not my cup of tea (so to speak)!

review/summary: Smooth pecan taste
review/text: This flavor is a staple in our household. It has a smooth pecan taste that is not syrupy or too overwhelming, and is a great morning coffee to start the day (though of course you can drink it at any time).<br /><br />Shop for price. A box of 24 k-cups should cost less than fourteen dollars.

review/summary: Nutty Coffee
review/text: If you enjoy coffee with a nutty flavor, you will enjoy this coffee. It packs lots of flavor even into a large cup though it is not overpowering. It offers a natural not chemical taste with no after taste. I find that it mixes well with many flavored coffee creamers. I have ordered this coffee in the past and will continue to reorder it in the future.

review/summary: Not For Me
review/text: I figured when I bought this that I would either love it or hate it. I hate it. Making one cup leaves the office smelling sickly all day. The smell just lingers. It was just way too sweet for me.

review/summary: southern pecan
review/text: As a rule, I do not like flavored coffees. This is certainly the exception! I love this coffee. The flavor is not overbearing but leaves a wonderful aftertaste. The aroma is to die for. The coffee is not quite strong enough for my taste, so I make a smaller cup, and it is perfect! I highly recommend you give this one a try.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I found the Southern Pecan to be just OK. I am not a huge pecan person, but if you are I am sure you will like it more than I did. It is hard to rate any Green Mountain flavor lower than 3/5 stars, but this is just not my favorite.

review/summary: Good, but not as good as French Toast
review/text: Admittedly my Keurig is not my primary coffee brewer.  I tend to use it at work, and only after the coffee I bring is gone.  That being said, I enjoy this flavor of coffee, and it is easy to drink black (I don't have access to fresh creamer at work).  That being said, I love the French Toast K-cups a lot more, though they are seasonal.<br />This cup of coffee is smooth, and the flavoring is not overpowering.

review/text: Almost a year into the Keurig coffees, we decided to stick to Green Mountain for a while.  We like flavored coffee.  This Southern Pecan could have more pecan flavor for our taste.  Not bad but a little too weak.

review/summary: Tasty for a canned chili
review/text: Not bad.  The usual bent can or two when buying canned goods from Amazon, but the price is right.  Try a can from your local grocery store to see if you like it, first, of course.<br /><br />The "steak" isn't bad at all with a decent texture and taste. Similar to the Roadhouse Chili line.  It will fill you up and is not bad on a cold day.  There is a generous amount of meat and a fairly tasty sauce -- it also has large beans in it which are good, and some corn, red peppers, tomatoes, and so on.  Overall, this is a pretty good quick meal and fairly tasty.  It's probably not easy making a canned meal with consistent quality and taste in mass quantities, so have to give the food engineers at Campbell a thumbs up on this one.<br /><br />After eating a few more cans of this, I actually came back and bumped my rating up from 3 to 4 stars.  In context, I am comparing this to other canned chilis, not home cooked chili!  It's a filling and satisfying meal.<br /><br />As someone else here mentioned, you can buy via "Subscribe and Save" for best price.  It's a good service and very convenient if you want a case of this stuff.<br /><br />2011-2-17 Update: I am now on my second case and this has become my favorite canned chili.  It's a good meal. very filling, and the quality has been consistent.  I find myself eating this fairly often during these cold wintry days for lunch or dinner when I'm looking for something quick and convenient, or just want a good bowl of chili.  A little grated cheddar on top and you're all set!<br /><br />2011-10 -- Raised rating to 5 stars as I have now been through several cases and no more dented cans, quality has remained good, and I really enjoy these.  Very hearty and filling and flavor is good.  Lots of meat chunks.  Best canned chili I've found so far.
