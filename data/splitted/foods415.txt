review/summary: I buy this as a gift item....I hate smoked salmon
review/text: Most of my friends are from South Texas and know as much about smoked salmon as people up here in Wisconsin know about raising cattle for purposes other than draining milk out of them.<br />Everyone I have purchased this product for has said it was great...on crackers. Supposedly it has an acceptable but very present smokey flavor and is made from apparently quality salmon......anyway, I have bought this as a gift item several times and everyone has said they liked it (and my friends are the type that would tell me if something tasted like excrement if it did)......so if you like smoked salmon or are looking for a good gift for someone that likes smoked items....apparently you cant go wrong with purchasing this product.

review/text: I don't order often from ANYWHERE but if I do 8 or 10 times it's Amazon. Because I love to eat fish esp. smoked salmon - I though it was a great deal. I was disappointed, packages were small and the fish fillets were thin,and really not that great of taste. Smoked? where?  I would have given it one star - but I didn't hate it - just wouldn't order it again.

review/text: While I agree this is shipped in a nice wooden box that can be used for other things and the fish has an excellent flavor, I was surprised to find it was not what I expected.  I expected smoked lox salmon like you find at a good deli or grocery store, not fully cooked salmon as this actually is.  For those expecting the latter, this is a great product, however this is not for me as it was smoked (or cooked) too long.

review/text: I purchased this item as Christmas gifts for two people on my list who are difficult to buy for.  The price was within my alloted budget, and when I purchased two, they were eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping, which is always a big PLUS!  The packaging is very attractive and larger than I was expecting (18.5"x7"x2").  Although I have no idea of the quality of the salmon (hence the 4-star rating), if I were to receive this as a gift, I would be pleased.  I'd consider buying this item again when I need a gift for under $20.00.

I would much rather pay a few cents more for an American made product.  Reminds me of how Walmart closed down a rolling pin manufacturing facility near my town in Maine and moved production to china to save 4 cents per rolling pin.  Unbelievable.  Disgusting.

I've been buying them several packages at a time when they go on sale at the market, usually for $2.50 a box, which makes paying 6.66 plus shipping really dumb. Even full price, they're only about $3.49 here in Colorado. On a recent trip to California I found them for $2.50 at Vons and they had the full price noted as $3.89. Buy the crackers, but do it locally. Even the check out clerk commented on how wonderful they were and how many she was selling.

My cat has a health problem that requires this specific food.  I compared the ingredients, the label, and all the details for a match before I placed the order.  I was very careful.  When I received the cat food, it was the new recipe (not what I wanted).  Apparently, the old recipe is not available at all anymore, so the item should be removed from the website.

review/text: My cat has "put up" with canned cat food and other pouches for years.  Her rejection of all would be evident on my carpets if I didn't have every carpet cleaning device known to man.<br /><br />She only likes the gravy and when she actually eats something solid, it's a great day.  When I brought this food home from Petco she ate two pouches down to the bottom of the bowl within a few hours.<br /><br />Since then, I've bought most other Soulistic flavors and she eats them all.<br /><br />I'm sold enough on this product to order it from Amazon because when I go to my Petco they're sold out.  A wasted trip is worth the shipping for me.<br /><br />My cat gives it 5 stars.

If you do buy this, plan on grinding it to "expresso" grind to get a hint of Costa Rican coffee.<br />The coffee by itself is okay... just not what I was hoping for.

review/summary: REALLY GREAT TASTING COFFEE! BLEND this for a Great Smooth cup of Coffee! Easy to do
review/text: These coffee beans arrived quickly in a vacuum packed pouch. Store in freezer (stay cool) to minimize the oils in the beans from becoming rancid & ruining the taste.<br /><br />These beans were nicely and uniformly roasted to a nice brown. No dark, burnt, over-roasted beans here! (If you want a darker roast go for French Roast or Espresso roast(-for morning java consumption, many prefer this lighter roast.)<br /><br />Beans of this Tarrazu are a nice smaller bean, plump (no old dried out beans). These Tarrazu beans will stand alone for a nice, non-acidic, gentle cup of coffee. Note: To minimize/neutralize acidity a very small amount of sugar (tsp or less) is nice.<br /><br />Blended it with 60% Columbian Supremo (more robust, stalwart bean) and 40% Tarrazu, then just load up the coffee hopper on the maker. Those beans in there do fine at room temp for every day use.  This blend is just great for that AM cup-not too harsh, but with a good strength and full bodied taste.

review/summary: Over-roasted beans with no flavor make awesome compost
review/text: I've worked as a barista at an EXCELLENT coffee shop that trained us really well about beans (origins, qualities, roasting, etc.). This Tarrazu was a disappointment, even for a mass distributor. These beans have been over-roasted to the point that there is almost no flavor and the grounds are chalky (no oils left = no flavor at all). Tarrazu is usually medium-bodied with bright citrusy notes. Even after preparing it with 2 heaping TBS beans per cup of water, the brew still came out weak, bland and just gross. The seller won't accept returns, so these are going in my compost bin.

review/summary: Subpar Coffee Beans
review/text: I don't know what happened, but these beans are not very good.  They are dry, fairly bland and just not what I come to expect from Coffee Bean Direct. My boss turned me onto Coffee Bean Direct (from now on referred to as CBD) about a year ago and I fell in love with the variety and freshness. Six months ago or so I found that CBD is now available on Amazon and was a very happy camper since I am a Prime member. The first five pounds I received were the same that I came to expect from the CBD roasters, but now on my second order, Costa Rican Tarrazu seems like they shipped some really old product that is very much past it's prime.  Maybe the CBD Costa Rican Tarrazu are not that popular and have sat in a warehouse waiting for some unlucky person like me.  I would throw them out if I hadn't spent so much on them, I don't even want to mix them with something else since I don't want to ruin another batch of good coffee.<br /><br />I hope it is just a fluke, but I'm not sticking around to find out, too much money to gamble.  I have now found another vendor for my fresh coffee addiction which is unfortunately a bit more expensive, however it IS fresh, oily and so tasty.

review/text: I've been very happy with the other coffees I have ordered from Coffee Bean Direct, but not so with this one.  It's just bad.  Odds are very good that a fresh bag would taste completely different, but that's not what I got.  For $42, I don't want to have to listen to my wife complain that the coffee is so bad it makes her stomach hurt.

review/summary: Inconsistant freshness
review/text: We have been ordering this coffee for over a year and we like it better than any other coffees we have tried. Sometimes the beans are fresh and look oily. Other times they are dry and lack aroma. We were ordering direct from Coffee Bean Direct and got fresher coffee than the coffer we get from Amazon on the automatic ordering system to save money. I don't know if they warehouse the coffee longer than the Coffee Bean Direct or what. There is a difference. If the freshness does not improve soon We will go back to ordering from Coffee Bean Direct and paying more. When it is fresh it is a five-star coffee.

review/summary: Beware the Salt
review/text: Bear Creek Country Kitchens Chipotle Soup Mix is a delicious explosion of flavor.  It's great by itself, or you can add things such as corn, jalapenos, sour cream, grated cheddar, chicken, pork, and avocaodo slices.<br /><br />When I eat this soup, I want to have about two cups of it.  There are only 110 calories per cup, but there is a problem.  One cup of this soup has 850 mg of sodium.  That is 36% of the daily value recommneded.<br /><br />Although I love the Southwestern flavor and my family serves chipotle soup to me as a special treat when I am a guest in their home, I find it necessary to warn you about the sodium.  The directions say "salt and pepper" to taste, but it already tastes a little too salty.  The ingredients include MSG, a serious souce of sodium.<br /><br />As our doctors tell us, elevated sodium in our diets is one of the causes of high blood pressure.

review/text: We love this soup in my home. I tend to add personalized ingredients to prepared meals, and this soup is no exception.  I always make a double batch and add chicken, diced tomatoes, rotel tomatoes with lime and cilantro, and a can of corn. My family and friends love it. Some of them have also begun to use it as a base for experimenting with their own personalized additions, as well. It has the warmth and soothing tone of comfort food. It's even good for breakfast.

review/text: Let me begin by saying that I really really like Bear Creek Soups!! Best on the market as far as a dry soup mix (in my opinion) BUT they really missed the mark on this one. I expected more of a tex/mex taste I guess. This taste more like a minestrone soup. Nothing "Santa Fe" OR "Chipotle" tasting at all. Now I have 5 more packages I am going to try to figure out what to do with. Will REALLY have to doctor it up to make it tasty for my family.

I also won't buy a decaf unless it uses the Swiss Water Process, and this is also organic.  If I am going to spend the money on quality coffee, I want the best.  This is it.

review/text: I just bought this cheesecake after trying a sample taste at Costco and I will most definitely buy it again.  It is extremely rich and creamy and so pretty to look at as well.  I was told this could remain in the freezer for up to a year, but the are no preservatives listed that lead me to believe it is really expected to remain in the freezer for a year.  I also find that at 450 calories a slice, I will be serving slices much smaller than the ones suggested by the nutritional data.  If you like chocolate and you like rich cheesecake and you don't feel like baking it yourself, then this is the one for you.

I had to clean him up at least once a day, yuck, and he sure as heck didnt enjoy it either. Within a few days he was much improved and now is on total raw food diet and has more energy and is running around like a kitten(hes only 5 yrs old). I have my old cat back and he no longer stinks!!!

review/text: First, a confession.  When I cook or eat, I try to use as little salt as possible.<br /><br />Second, though, there are times when salt is an important part of the preparation of food or when it makes sense to add once a meal is cooked.<br /><br />And I far prefer these products, in which you have salt crystals and a built in grinder. I think the end result is preferable to the standard salt out of a box. To me, there is a tastier edge once the ground salt enters the recipe or once the salt hits the cooked food (although it might just be my imagination, too)!<br /><br />Anyhow, this is one nice choice out of the many salt grinders available at the grocery store and I have long been satisfied with it.

review/summary: human quality ingredients, unique manufacturing process-- my cat loves it!
review/text: Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Here's a summary of the nutritional information:<br />-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.<br />-One cup contains 478 calories<br />-Major ingredients:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.  My cat and I have been really happy with it.

review/summary: Our cats LOVE this food! Great ingredients
review/text: Both of our cats love this dry food!<br /><br />We are very happy with it as well. It is well-tolerated on their tummies, and our picky little female<br />cat actually loves it as well.<br /><br />The main ingredient is CHICKEN, not beaks, feet and fat.<br />The other ingredients are all things that are good for your cat (even though maybe some are not<br />necessary, since cats do not need vegetables. They are carnivores, not omnivores, even though they<br />do like to eat grasses).<br /><br />The way we use Blue Buffalo is as their treats. For many years, our cats were getting Temptations as their treats.<br />They couldn't get enough of them, and would beg, rub on the drawer they were kept in to get them, even digging the empty<br />bags out of the trash. Well, once we read up on the ingredients, we were shocked to find the garbage we'd been feeding to our<br />cats! It has the equivalent of kitty MSG in there, which is why they love them so much. (Think bags of flavored potato chips for<br />humans - you can't stop eating them for a reason!)<br /><br />So, we couldn't do that to our cats anymore. We'd also noticed other thing, like itchy skin, hyperness, etc.<br />We no longer give them their old treats, and have instead used Blue Buffalo. They like it just as much.<br />We have one of those treat balls (also purchased from Amazon!), which we fill up with Blue Buffalo. The cats adore it,<br />roll the ball around to get their snack fix, and we know it is still very good for them. Both of our cats are<br />chicken-holics, preferring chicken over all other meat or fish flavors. This food fills their happy spot!<br /><br />We have not yet replaced any formal dry meals with this food, but I would certainly not have a problem doing that.<br />It is a nice size kibble for the cats as well, with the latest formulation being smaller than the other versions.<br />(The other life bits were pretty big - these are smaller and easier for cats to chew.)<br /><br />All in all, as a long-time cat owner and fanatic, this is a really great food to give to them. Whether you feed only dry<br />or just looking for a snack food for your kitties, this should be on your list to try.

review/summary: I had high hopes....
review/text: I have to admit I am having a hard time deciding on a final score for this product. Like many pet owners I want to give my cat the best, I try to make sure she has a healthy diet and I also feel better knowing I am feeding her a healthy product and not something full of chemicals that nobody without a phd can pronounce.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Blue Buffalo dry food as it touts an impressive list of natural ingredients that are both wholesome and nutritious. Sadly when I tried to incorporate small amounts of it into my Lily's diet, she was having none of it. She would pick around it to get to her usual dry food and leave the Blue Buffalo uneaten. Finally I had to give up and went back to just feeding her fancy feast select dry food.<br /><br />Thinking that perhaps it just was not to her taste I tried giving some to my mother in laws three cats, two of the three turned their noses up at it as well while the third a cranky fat cat named Moe did decide to chow down on it.... then again Moe also will eat bugs if he can run them down fast enough, perhaps he's not a good test subject.<br /><br />In the end, even though I am impressed with the food it comes down to the cats. What good is terrific ingredients if they just will not eat it? I wonder if most older cats have come to be used to the standard mix of cat food ingredients most brands seem to use. If you have a cat coming of age and need to start them on dry food this may be a good option, but for me it just didn't work out.<br /><br />Lily gives this product three paws up, it's a nice effort... just not the cats meow.

review/summary: Vimto + SodaStream = Great, reasonably healthy, kids drink
review/text: Like the previous reviewer, my wife and I grew up drinking Vimto. Also as mentioned, this is a concentrate product and must be diluted with water making the price per glass very reasonable.<br /><br />One way that we make this drink even better for our kids is we add carbonated water.  We use the reasonably new SodaStream product [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYT6CS">Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit</a>] to create the fizzy water and add to a glass containing s small amount of vimto. My kids (who weren't brought up drinking vimto) think this is better than any of the SodaStream concentrates.<br /><br />I hesitated to write up this review as the provider is often out of stock and this may cause more demand. My hope, however, is this increased demand will increase availability:-)<br /><br />Hope this helps, Mike

review/summary: Good portion control, manufacturer sealed
review/text: We own a condo in Florida and I constantly have to be aware of the humidity when we aren't there.  What I like about these packages is that for one thing it's portion control and for another it is manufacturer sealed so I can leave them down there. When we get there the next time, I don't have to run out to the store to buy cereal for the next day.  Which means I can leave them at the condo over the summer and the humidity won't affect them.<br /><br />While I would have preferred to have purchased a smaller amount of boxes, I will most likely wind up donating some of them to the local soup kitchen.<br /><br />Originally, I got some at a hotel and used them down there.  That's how I found out how convenient they were.  While more expensive than purchasing a large box of the cereal, once opened I can't leave the box of cereal down there but I can leave these.

review/summary: Delicious multigrain tortilla chips!
review/text: These chips are slightly salty and crispy, with flax, chia, and quinoa in the list of ingredients. They are fairly low fat (4.5 grams for 13 chips)and are delicious. They are similar in taste and texture to Food Should Taste Good multigrain chips - both brands are very good. I ate these with guacamole, and they were great! Love them, and will definitely buy them again. I appreciate that they are certified gluten free, too.

review/summary: Wonderful Snack
review/text: Gluten-free, vegan, and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

review/summary: Good, but not my favorite.
review/text: I like the Orca Spice sugar-free chai mix better- the Flamingo needs a little tweaking (a little extra vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and a teeny bit of Splenda), otherwise it tastes watered down.  (Oh, and I use water with a little bit of sugar-free creamer.  I'm sure it would taste even better mixed with all milk.)<br /><br />My main complaint- and I know, it's my own fault, as I'm capable of reading, but obviously didn't in this case- is that it's a BAG, not the big canister in the picture.<br /><br />That's all- overall, a good sugar-free chai option.

Figuring that it was an isolated mistake, I ordered another from a different supplier (still Prime).  Again, I got the caffeinated version.  Not what I need for my evening drink!  Very disappointed.  The sticker label on both bags is the same.  They mislabeled the bags as decaf - but they are NOT the PINK bags, they are the PURPLE bags.  I wrote the supplier, but no reply.  I'll stick with Chai-Direct.com next time.

review/text: The flavors, texture and freshness of this product were wonderful. It satisfies the sweet craving and there is no sugar. As with most sugar-free products, you have to be careful to limit the amount you eat as the sugar substitute can cause stomach upset and have a laxative effect.

review/text: I've been trying to find the individual-pack option (at the affordable price) for months now. I love having the ability to know exactly how much creamer I'm using by counting the individual packets. (This product isn't available in my grocery store-- just by the coffee dispensers at local convenience stores.) They're perfect for keeping at my desk at work~~I don't have to use the community fridge, and it doesn't lump up in my coffee like the powdered versions do. It's a little less convenient at home, though, where I'm accustomed to using my refrigerated bottled versions~~opening the little packets one at a time at 5 am can get annoying--but then again, I know exactly how much creamer I'm adding to my coffee instead of dolloping in a random splash. (Now all I need is someone to add the sugar-free versions of Coffee-Mate to the Amazon selection. Hint, hint. :) )

review/text: What this product (the original, not the flavored) does for coffee is nothing short of heavenly. It smooths away bitterness while allowing great coffee flavor to come through. It beats half and half hands down for making coffee delicious..... and I drink more coffee than the average person.....BUT....> I have this problem called CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) and suffer from Atherosclerosis (fat build-up in my arteries) THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRANS-FATS. Do not let the labeling fool you. The serving size is listed as ONE tablespoon, and there is less than 1 gram of trans fat per 1 tablespoon serving (there is actually about 1/2 gram per serving).... BUT THEY LIST IT AS 0 GRAMS. BUT NOBODY USES JUST ONE TABLESPOON!! I use FOUR to FIVE tablespoons per serving, as does my wife. TRANS FAT will coat your arteries no matter how healthy you are.. it accumulates in your blood vessels and slowly reduces the oxygen delivery to your body, especially your HEART....slow strangulation. I love this product...but can no longer use it. My cardiologist says NO! NO! NO!.

I use it in my home-made pies because I can't make the pie filling from scratch any lower calorie than Comstock does!  And I love the consistency of the product.  I also use it alone, warmed up in the microwave with warm vanilla sauce that I make.  A great quick dessert.  Unfortunately, both supermarkets in my area have stopped carrying it!!!  I was so pleased to find that Amazon did have it!  It's a little more expensive than it was in the stores, but I can deal with that as long as I won't disappoint my family by not making pies anymore.  :)

review/summary: They Secretly Switched The Coffee At My Favorite Restaurant With This Garbage
review/text: One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure.

review/summary: Knob Creek is a big dense chewy bourbon with tons of character.
review/text: The anchor of the Jim Beam small batch collection (the lowest price, shortest bottle, longest posted age in the barrel and the biggest sales of any small batch bourbon) Knob Creek is a big substantial bourbon that oozes class and quality. It begs to be sipped neat and slow. It stands up to the best bourbons without embarrassing itself.<br /><br />In the glass it's a rich spessarite garnet reddish orange with a tinge of henna. The redness is coming from the #4 char oak barrels. That's the darkest level of char. This char level shows up all over Knob creek - from the color to the nose to the last notes of the finish. Knob Creek's extensive time in the wood is a big part of its character and the fact that the wood was darkly charred is a big part of the wood's character.<br /><br />The nose brings up toffee, leather, and bitter orange. Further nosing brings out vanilla, cream, and some earth mustiness - like forest floor leaves and loam. It's a complex, appetizing, and pretty sophisticated nose for a bourbon that some folks don't respect enough, in my opinion, because it's so universally available.<br /><br />The initial taste on first sip is sweet with brown sugar and moassess. That's followed up by a big midpalate expansion spicy on the edges of the tongue with 100 proof and full of a sophisticated sherry quality. The finish is redolent with oak wood and a bitter orange note in the back of the tongue. There's char in the finish, vanilla, sandalwood perfume and a distant and pervasive backdrop of charcoal and creosote. You don't notice it at first but it builds up as you devour your glass. There's also a sour tang that shows up slowly over time that I have come to associate with Jim Beam. It's very subtle but it's the thread that binds the disparate Jim Beam stable together.<br /><br />This is a big, rough, very masculine bourbon. It's a frontier cabin with leather, musket, and wood fire raging. It's also elegant and refined - to a point. I have no trouble recommending it - but have to point out that Elija Craig 12 has a lot of the same flavor profile (but more sweet and less char) for substantially less money. In any case, you'll have no trouble finding Knob Creek and once you start sipping I sincerely doubt anyone would regret any part of it even for a minute.

review/text: I drink this herb blended with oat straw, nettle and rose hips.  This blend is great for combatting dry skin and hair.  The tea is delicious, drunk with lemon juice, and I love drinking it every time.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear. Luckily I only given about 10 pieces in the week that I purchased the jerky. I immediately stopped giving him the treats since that was the only new item introduced. Lucky for me, my dog was able to recover from the issues brought on by the jerky. Don't ever buy anything that you can ingest which is made in China. Or better yet, just don't buy anything made in china.

review/summary: Still made in China
review/text: I checked the packages of these at Sams and on the back is still MADE IN CHINA. I assume the biscuit part could be made in the USA but the chicken jerky part, as are the waggin train other chicken jerky, made in China. I won't chance my dogs health and am following the suggestion of our vet not to buy any treat made in China.
