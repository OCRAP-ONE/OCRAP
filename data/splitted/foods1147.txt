review/summary: OVERALL DISAPPOINTMENT WITH STASH PREMIUM TEA
review/text: Stash Premium Coconut Mango Wuyi Oolong Tea is right up there with the flavored teas that don't have flavor.  I'm extremely disappointed as I purchased 100-count box. Even doubling and tripling up on tea bags, there's little to no flavor.  I've spent over $53.00 on 4 different flavors of STASH and it's like throwing my money away.

review/summary: Poorly packed
review/text: The tea was smushed into the box so badly that a couple of the individual wrappers were damaged and bust open. The box itself had a hole in it. I had read other peoples reviews that said the same. It was so poorly packed I wondered if it was even legit or if someone had just cleaned out their cupboards and stuffed all of their leftover tea bags in a box. Anyhow, I found the double spice too bitter so I won't probably buy it again. The 100 ct Stash tea probably won't tempt me again either due to the careless packaging.

review/summary: Passable but not fantastic
review/text: My wife will tell you that I am a tea snob.  This is an okay breakfast tea, but I'm not in love with it.  It's also not terribly expensive.  It is convenient.  I usually take it with some milk.  It tastes good with milk.  The tea is slightly bitter, not very flavorful, nor memorable.  I have tasted English Breakfast tea by Strand, Adagio, and a couple others.  Adagio's is my favorite.  This is good if you it's the only thing handy.  It's not bad, but it's not good, either.<br /><br />I noticed a few people thought this review unhelpful.  Sorry about that.  I can't recommend this tea.  Maybe you will like it.  If you do, don't go tasting other tea because you might realize how truly mediocre this one is.

review/summary: Tea Bags are all thrown into a box and get crushed, otherwise a good deal.
review/text: This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.<br /><br />The teas I bought this way are good, they get a 3 for how they were just thrown into the box though.  Couldn't they have used a smaller box and lined the bags up in a way they didn't move around?  They ended up with some tea bags fine, others almost in a little ball in the middle!<br /><br />The tea is refreshing though, not high on the mint, but it's great for a summer's day!

review/summary: Not terrible, but...
review/text: Not terrible, but not anywhere near as good as the Tazo Organic Chai tea bags. Now, you can't beat this price (on the 100-count bulk box), so it still may be worth the compromise in quality. I will say right now that I will likely not buy again and I will try to find the Tazo Organic Chai at the best price I can--which I will still pay even if it is double or triple what this is. Or perhaps by the time I go through 100 bags (50 mugs worth--the Tazo only needs 1 bag, the Stash needs 2) this will grow on me. I recommend honey as the sweetener for any unsweetened chai.<br /><br />The packaging is fine, by the way--except now owing to the complaints they use too much. It's still the same plain box with individually-wrapped teabags stuffed inside, but then that's placed in an oversized box with too much of that air-pack cushion that Amazon uses. This is the bulk size box, so don't expect a box that looks fashionable on your kitchen counter.<br /><br />Lowered rating from 3 to 2 after I found the Tazo at a decent price. See the comments.

review/summary: The Best Chai; and a Great Price
review/text: I've pretty much tried all the bagged Chai tea commonly available and this is without a doubt my favorite.  I'm diabetic so I sweeten it with "Splenda", then add a small amount of Vanilla Soy Milk and the flavor and smells take one to a different world.  I'm buying this in "bulk" so I certainly don't expect high-quality packaging as some seem to think there should be. This is a huge savings over buying it retail at my grocery store and as I use at least three bags a day I am absolutely pleased to buy in bulk.

review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: THE BEST PEPPERMINT TEA EVER...!
review/text: I had to quit coffee cold turkey due to PCOS, and this tea is getting me through it.  It is recommended for females who have PCOS to drink approximately 6 cups a day for full benefits.  I was able to do just that with the Stash-Amazon subscription program.  I love it with a little non dairy creamer and sweet-n-low.  It has a wonderful aroma.  when you open the individual tea package, you can swell the wonderful peppermint aroma.  The other great thing is that Stash actually recommends that you double steep their bags (3-5 minutes).  I did at first, but I no longer do, I want a fresh bag every time. This is some great tea, and everyone who is around me when I drink it; always asks me what is that, it smells so good. I have went to other stores and tried to buy variations of peppermint / mint teas, and none of them even come close in comparrison to this tea.  it is a must buy!

I had been purchasing from the Stash website before finding the same products here at a much better price minus the fussy packaging.  If you like Stash teas, I recommend signing up for the auto delivery option which can be set for up to 6 months apart and reduces the price of the item.<br /><br />I tend to like white tea and the peach flavor is mild so I don't get that fake peach taste you find in some tea.  It's a good balance with the white tea.  I have a small 4 cup drip coffee maker and put 2 bags in the filter basket and about 2 T sugar in the carafe and end up with a few great cups of tea.

(Steven Smith teamakers is my very favorite, but it's much more expensive.) The 100 count box is generally not much cheaper than the 6-box pack, but I appreciate the convenience of less packaging.

I especially love the spearmint.  Yum!<br /><br />The bags came squashed together and wrinkled badly, which is something to consider if you plan on serving these professionally or making gifts, but not a single bag out of the hundred was ripped.<br /><br />I say it "was" my favorite tea because it has lemongrass in it, and I have a food allergy to all grasses.  If you're allergic to wheat or have an environmental grass allergy, you may want to check with your allergist before buying a hundred of these.  The flavor can't be beat, but I'll be going back to brewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> side-by-side with herbal mint tea whenever my allergies are flaring up.

review/summary: Very Tasty for a Decaf!
review/text: You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing.  It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well.  The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming.  Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well.  I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.<br /><br />Be advised this box came with the tea bags smashed in pretty densely.  The quality wasn't compromised, but they would make for poor gifts and their resell appeal would take a hit.<br /><br />As with any 100-count box, I recommend picking up a single box of this at a local grocery store if you can before committing to so many.  It's available at most of my local grocery stores, and might be available at yours as well.

review/summary: Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers and Some Flavorings
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don't mind a few additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

My order came loose in a small cardboard outer box.  I'll have to take them on their word that it's 100 tea bags, because I'm not going to bother sorting and counting them!  Some of them are, as a result of being packed into a very tiny box, flattened and dog-eared.  If presentation for guests is important to you, you may want to rethink purchasing this bulk amount, and buy the individual boxes instead.

I bought this because I was looking for a pleasantly flavored herbal tea (so as not to consume too much caffeine), and I found one.

review/summary: Not for fans of English Breakfast Tea
review/text: This product seemed like an excellent value for decaf English Breakfast tea.  Unfortunately it bears no relationship to any English Breakfast tea I have had in the past 40 years.  I will be returning to paying much more for Twinings.  This Stash product is considerably more like standard black tea than like English Breakfast tea, and if you want decaf black tea that is stronger than Lipton decaf, this is a good choice.  But if you were looking for a smooth, premium-quality English Breakfast tea, this is not it.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: Stash Premium Chocolate Mint Wuyi Oolong Tea is my new favorite!<br /><br />I usually drink my tea strong with whole milk and raw sugar or stevia.  This tea has a nice smell and a smooth taste.  I am mixing it with PG Tips black tea to add a bit of strength and boldness.<br /><br />Very pleased and am thinking my 100 ct box will not last long!<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br /><br />The mint taste really tends to overpower the chocolate.  However, as I said originally, I mix it with black tea and it turns out pretty well.<br /><br />One thing we found we like to use instead of sweetener & milk, is to use Vanilla Eggnog to sweeten & cream.  Yum.

review/summary: Another Great Tea
review/text: Smooth and tasty--Caffeine free herbal tea-- 100% natural ingredients (in the order listed) are: peppermint, chamomile, spearmint, organic tulsi, lemongrass, guava flavor, cinnamon, and grapefruit flavor.<br /><br />As usual, each tea bag is sealed in its own foil package to keep the flavor inside and ready for you.  I use 1 bag per 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />This sounds like an unusual mix of flavors but it is quite tasty--kind of like a minty fruit.  This would also likely make an excellent ice tea.<br /><br />If you want to add a sweetener, I prefer a natural sweetener, such as agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of food store), or unbleached brown sugar (sugar isle) or honey.

review/text: Love this double bergamont Earl Grey Tea!  Very flavorful.  Highly recommend it when the mood is for a black tea.<br />It pays to shop around!  For some reason this box of loose (foil wrapped) bags was cheaper than the retail box of boxes.  Be careful to compare total shipped price and count how many bags you will get.  Some places were selling just a single box of 12 bags for 1/2 the total price of this product!

review/text: This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.

review/summary: Stash brand tea my all-time favorite
review/text: I checked my past orders of the Stash brand Earl Grey Double-Bergamot tea. It seems I order about once every 8 months. This is now my 3rd order but the first time I bought it in bulk like this. The savings were minimal but worth it. I made sure to count all the bags to ensure a complete order was received. It was.<br /><br />I was surprised to find a video by someone who spoke of Earl Grey as a vile and disgusting tea. I love this tea. However, I have met people that I have offered a cup of this tea, and a few have mentioned it smelled like pepper to them. Bergamot, the predominant spice in this tea, is a citrus not unlike an orange whose oils are extracted for this tea. When I smell the tea, I smell a sweet aroma. If, when you smell this tea, it smells like pepper to you, you might first give it at least one sip before dismissing it. I typically put cream & sugar in my this.

review/text: I'm not a tea connoisseur, but I do like what I drink in the morning to have a subtle and recognizable flavor with floral overtones. How's that for specific? Stash Premium Jasmine is just that. It's not a rare Chinese blend picked at high altitude by retired gymnasts, it won't rock your taste buds with complexity and depth, but it won't decrease your net worth by much, and will go very well with your bran-laden muffin. It's pleasant, clean and quite drinkable. Enjoy.

review/summary: Great if you like Wintergreen
review/text: Although I do not care for this tea much, I still give it four stars. That is because it is the only tea I can force down that has wintergreen in it. I often buy teas that are a mixture of green and/or white tea with spearmint and/or peppermint. It was my fault I did not read the description carefully, as I did not realize it had wintergreen in it until I tasted it. You can definitely taste the wintergreen!<br />My favorite Stash teas are the White Christmas, (white tea, peppermint, & ginger), and the Moroccan Mint, (green tea, spearmint, lemongrass, & peppermint). I do the White Christmas if I want something a bit spicier and more warming, and I do the Moroccan mint when I want something a little smoother. Due to the lemongrass it does taste a bit grassy, but it's still good.<br /><br />If you want a good mint tea without green, try the Cascade mint. It just has peppermint and spearmint, and is absolutely delicious! I mix that with decaf green in the evenings and it's wonderful! Unfortunately, I have not found the Cascade mint in boxes of 100, so I usually stick with one of the other varieties mentioned above.<br />Bottom line, I have come to love most of the Stash tea flavors that contain mint, with the exception of the Merry Mint. Like I said though, I can kindof get it down, which is more than I can say about other teas with wintergreen in them. And these boxes of 100 are such a great value, as I drink several cups per day!

review/text: Last Christmas, my wife gave me a selection of Earl Grey teas.  I do not drink coffee, but I love my Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />I found the Stash tea to be the best tasting, the reason for me is the double Bergamot oil that makes Earl Grey Earl Grey.<br /><br />When you open up a tea bag, the scent is amazing.  I love doing that in a crowd to see everybody smell this amazing scent and ask me what that is.<br /><br />Our local supermarket had a box of 25 teabags for $8.99.  Thanks to the automatic ordering process that Amazon has, I only pay $11.99 for a box of 100 bags!!<br /><br />I feel like a pusher at work, when I go down to get the hotwater.  I give out a teabag or 2 and send the link to the product here at Amazon<br /><br />This is great tea, and a great buy!

review/summary: Knew I liked the product, got what I expected
review/text: I wouldn't have ordered 100 of these teabags without trying them first, so I grabbed the smaller size box at my local grocery store. I'd been trying to drink more green tea and realizing my generous cubicle neighbor probably wanted to encourage my new habit, but not necessarily fund it by continuing to "donate" bags to me. I really liked the STASH green tea, so before my small box was up, I ordered this one. It is a delicious green tea to me, but as with many green teas, FINISH IT WHILE IT'S HOT. Seriously - if it cools down, it gets bitter. I thought the value of this box was excellent since I'm up to 1-3 cups per day, so this worked well. I posted a few pics of how the packaging came so you can see - no "retail" boxes, but they are each individually wrapped. Note that it just came in a cardboard box and the little packs inside weren't lined in a plastic bag, so if you have this delivered, just make sure it stays dry. I think a rainy day on my doorstep could have been messy, though I do think the tea bags are foil lined enough to prevent moisture from entering? Still, I wouldn't want to risk it! I've already added this to my Wish List entitled "re-stock items" :)

I used water that had not quite starting boiling so as not to burn the tender tea.  Steeped it for 2 mins and added some Ambrosia raw unfiltered honey.  I bought both products via Amazon's "Subscribe And Save" so I saved an additional few dollars off their already low price.  Any subscribe and save purchase comes with free shipping even if the total order is less than $25.  Amazing savings and fantastic taste.  Sorry if I seem like an advertisement but I'm really excited.  Tea is sooo expensive in the grocery store so I saved a bundle and I'm drinking some of the best decaf green tea I've had in a while. Extremely smooth with no bitter after taste.

review/text: I love most of Stash's green teas.  LOVE them.  Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green.<br /><br />This is the exception.  Blech!  It is incredibly astringent, something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green.  I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea.  That sounds absurd to me, but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P9D3GC">Yamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag</a> (which stash also sells, but I couldn't find it here) is flavorful but retains the mild, non-bitter green flavor I've come to know and love.

review/summary: Subtle, Delicate, Delicious
review/text: I *loved* this tea.  I am mostly alone in my love:  many of my friends and guests prefer stronger teas, and the flavor of this is anything but.  Even if you stack multiple bags in a single brew, you're going to end up with a subtle flavor.  That's most good white teas for you.  "Strong" white teas exist even though the phrase is something of a contradiction in terms, but they exist by layering on a lot of flavor that doesn't come from the tea leaf itself.  Those remind me of herbal teas even though they've thrown in a white tea base.  In this tea, the lemon flavor is as subtle as the white so that you can taste both.  I think it's heaven.<br /><br />This tea is more forgiving of an overly long steep than most white teas, but it's still a white tea and will go bitter if steeped too long.<br /><br />I find I dislike it as an iced tea and even once it reaches room temperature.  The oils separate out and form a film on top with trapped tea dust.  It won't hurt you, but it's very off-putting.<br /><br />To enjoy a cooler beverage, I put a teabag or two directly into room temperature or cold water.  It lends a little flavor to the water without giving up a film of yuck to float on top.  I love doing this with any good green tea, and just a very few whites.  It adds a subtle yum, like a delicate natural flavored water.<br /><br />Alas, this has lemon grass in it.  This is good news for most people:  lemon grass is delicious!  It's also a grass, though.  If you have wheat or grass allergies, discuss lemongrass with your allergist and pay attention to how you feel on days you consume it.  I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IVGU">Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> just as much as I like this, so I've switched over to avoid that little extra bit of stuffiness from consuming a grass product.

review/text: CORRECTION:  I RATE THIS TUNA-FISH F I V E STARS!<br /><br />Before seeing this tunafish, (NATURAL VALUE YELLOWFIN TUNA. [...]), on Amazon, I had no idea that there<br />even was such a thing as yellowfin tuna!  (There's a first<br />time for everything, I guess!)  I wondered if "yellowfin"<br />was another name for "light" tunea.  The strange name for<br />tunafish tugged at my adventurous side -- and since the<br />"adventure", in this case, did NOT involve braving going<br />out to actually catch the tuna -- but only "risking" some<br />money and buying it, I decided to do so....as I had never<br />yet met a type of tunafish I did not enjoy eating.<br /><br />This is still the case!  The "chunk" style tuna here is<br />indeed chunky -- making it easier to mix and form<br />into tuna salad, etc., than solid tuna, (and chunk tuna<br />is usually less expensive, as well!)  The taste of this<br />tuna is 3/4 like the more expensive albacore, and 1/4<br />like the less-expensive, (but still delicious...at least<br />to me),"light" tuna.<br /><br />It's also nice to have tuna packed in "spring water", --<br />not just "water" orm (always more caloric) oil.  Also, I<br />notice that THIS tuna (6 ounce size), gives a 2 ounce<br />serving, and 2.5 servings, per can.  SOME OTHER TUNA FISH<br />BRANDS, ALSO CONTAINING 6 OUNCES PER CAN AND 2 OUNCE<br />SERVINGS, ONLY LIST 2 SERVINGS PER CAN!  The reason for<br />the difference?  MORE WATER OR OIL IN THE OTHER BRANDS OF<br />TUNA!  From buying this tuna, and other brands, and seeing<br />the different number of servings on the label, I HAVE<br />LEARNT TO SHAKE THE TUNA FISH CAN, EVER SO GENTLY, BEFORE<br />BUYING, TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER OR OIL IS IN IT!  And...it's<br />TRUE!  The other brands of tuna have more of a watery<br />sound in them!!!!!<br /><br />As far as SALT is concerned....  Some time ago whilst watch-<br />ing TV, (or perhaps reading tips in a woman's magazine, I<br />don't really remember) -- I learnt this:  TO TAKE THE SALT<br />OUT OF ANY CANNED GOODS, OPEN THE CAN, REPLACE THE LID, AND<br />RUN COLD WATER OVER THE CAN, WHILST PRESSING DOWN GENTLY ON<br />THE LID, AND THUS "RINSING" THE SALT AWAY.  Doing this, one<br />can buy the usually less-expensive "full salt" type of<br />canned goods, and just rinse away the salt yourself!<br /><br />NATURAL VALUE YELLOWFIN TUNA is thoughtfully packaged in a<br />SEAM-FREE container, assuring a longer shelf life, because<br />there are no seam-sealing materials, (glue, etc.), to leech<br />into the tuna, (yeech!)  This review is being written on<br />July 19th, 2009.  The expiration date on the bottom of the<br />can, (clearly labelled -- no 'blind dating'!) is 11/13/12!<br /><br />This tuna is also "No Threat To Dolphins", and bears the<br />"OU" of the Orthodox (Jewish) Union.  These herald a truly<br />product, made by people who CARE about quality and also<br />about Dolphins  -- the most intelligent sea-creatures there<br />are!<br /><br />All in all, a nice little can of tuna!  And it weighs a<br />FULL SIX OUNCES!  Too many of the supermarket brands now<br />come in 5 ounce containers!  This may be a false economy,<br />on the part of these other tuna canners -- because it<br />involves the cost of filling MORE cans!  Could 4-ounce<br />tuna fish cans be far behind?  I shudder to think -- but<br />the possibility is sady real... ) :<br /><br />Anyway, this tuna, which give half-a-serving<br />more than other tunafish in the same size can! Seamless<br />packaging, a long shelf-life, dolphin safe, OU endorsed<br />-- quite a nice little package -- and a tasty one, too!<br /><br />(6 ounces = 170 grams = 176 yum yums.  No -- make that<br />1776 yum yumms...............and counting!  : ),

review/summary: Canned Tuna
review/text: I have ordered this tuna on two different occasions. The quality is good (like big-name brands such as Starkist or Chicken Of The Sea), but the 24 pack is a little more convenient if you use a lot. I bought my tuna as a weight-loss device. This tuna fish is high in protein but amazingly low in fat. The only concern is that a high-fish diet these days introduces the risk of mercury exposure. Still, it's a great way to supplement your diet with cost effective and healthy seafood. Super healthy with brown un-bleached rice.

review/summary: Delicious Natural Dried Cherries
review/text: *****<br />These dried cherries are slightly sweet, slightly tart, chewy and yummy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and they are gluten free. If you are used to added sugar, you might find them not as sweet as you'd like, but if you're like me, you'll be in heaven! The only thing added to the cherries is a slight amount of sunflower oil (probably to keep them from sticking together) that is so small that it doesn't even show up in the "Total Fat" count (there are 0g of fat in each serving). These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />Note that as these are a natural food, they may contain pits. Mine didn't have any, but it's good to just be aware to protect your teeth.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: The best canned salmon ever!
review/text: I received the package today, purchased directly from the Pure Alaska Salmon Company.  The product itself was shipped with additional informational about salmon fishing and sustainability, as well as recipes.  There was also a postcard with a photograph of the fishing boat.  My daughter (6) helped open the package and decided to try some salmon right out of the can.<br /><br />I normally love canned right out of the can but she doesn't usually eat it straight.  I was a little hesitant as the product is a bit pricier than most commercially available products.  But I gave in and we opened two cans.  She ate the entire can and absolutely loved it.  She started asking questions about how they package salmon and we had a great discussion about salmon fishing, comparing it mostly to our experiences trout fishing here in Utah.  She made the comment about how much better this salmon is than the "salmon mush" we bought previously at the store.<br /><br />I have tried several other brands of salmon and this was by far the best.  A few observations made about the two cans we have thus far opened.  Obviously catch will vary so I don't expect every can to be the same.  I don't want genetically modified salmon that every one is identical.  The fish in the cans were smaller, as there were actually two steaks in each can.  The cans were clearly marked Wild Alaska Salmon on the cans themselves, unlike some salmon products that are labeled Alaska salmon, product of China (or Thailand, or Pakistan, or wherever).  This indicates the fish were caught and processed in Alaska.<br /><br />I believe it is a little odd to have fish caught in Alaska frozen, shipped to some remote processing facility, thawed, processed, and then shipped half way around the world again.  As I opened the cans of course there was a fishy smell, but not the same as the bad, icky, fishy smell that makes you want to wear a gas mask.  The flavor was perfect.  My daughter said it was very similar to tuna, and I agree.  I could imagine this would be a great enhancement to traditional tuna recipes.

review/summary: It keeps them busy as a toy, not really a snack or treat
review/text: I used to get these for my dogs.  I consider them more of a toy they eat than a snack.  These will take up quite a bit of my dogs time as individuals as well as give them something play with.  The one things is they never get fully eaten and end up getting tossed about a week later as they lay on the floor or biodegrade in the back yard.  They are worth there money, its worth a try to see if your dogs like it.<br /><br />A good treat is buying frozen marrow bones at your grocers and freezing them.  My dogs love them, and being frozen the don't make much of a mess and last 3x's as long.  Just lock them in the kitchen or send them out back, these are not for rugs.

review/text: When I ordered the Theater-Size Jujubes I made especially sure that the Jujubes were the 6.5 oz Theater-Size boxes (double-checked description etc. in the vendor's ad).  When I received the Jujubes they were 1.5 oz boxes instead if the 6.5 oz.  So I paid the same price for the 1.5 oz boxes as I would have paid for the 6.5 oz sized boxes.  The product was totally misrepresented by the vendor.  I would not have ordered this product had I known the "real" quantity size.<br /><br />I decided not to return the candy because it was just too much trouble to do so.  The main thing I wanted to do is let you know how the vendor misrepresented their product.<br /><br />I have ordered so much from Amazon and this is the very first time anything like this has ever happened and I was really disappointed.

review/text: My dog won a bag of these in his obedience class the first time we tried them; soon the cat discovered them and now she begs me for them daily. I like these because they are completely natural and nothing but salmon. I don't generally think of feeding fish to dogs but honestly I don't think there is a dog or cat out there that can resist them. I have to ration these or they would all be gone the first time I opened the bag. They are great for training treats because they are freeze dried and don't make a mess in your pocket or pouch and your dog will definitely pay attention to you in anticipation of receiving them. The 4oz bag has larger treats (approx. 3/4" square)perfect size for training and just break them in two for your kitty.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: Been using this product for a few months now and have been very happy with it.  It stores easily in my gym bag in single-serving foil pixie sticks.  I add it to my water bottle right before I step on the treadmill.  It keeps me hydrated better than plain water--I sip on it as a motivational reward for every 6 minutes of my 60 min workout.  It was a decent deal at $4.99, but a steal at $1.99/box (Black Friday)--I bought 20 boxes for $40!<br /><br />There is a new water coming out called Activate. 10K is much more cost-effective way to go.<br /><br />This only comes in Lemon-lime, which is fine for me.  Taste is ok, but has a bit of that artificial sweetener flavor--not too much, though.<br /><br />In summary, it's super convenient to take with you and the single-serving is handy.  It tastes good, cheaper than Gatorade and you can use your favorite bottled/water.  More refreshing than water due to its electrolytes.  Highly Recommend it!

review/text: These taste GREAT.  If you like LIME-lemon and it has the added plus of the electrolytes (like Gator-Aid I guess), these are fantastic.<br /><br />I was actually looking for a lemon-lime LIGHT FLAVOR (similar to Baja Bob's Margarita Mix - which I add to my water - without Tequila - because the flavor is just so light and just the right lemon-lime for me - but Baja Bob for water adding - well - it's expensive!)<br /><br />I tried Crystal Light, but so far did not find a refreshingly light lemon-lime flavor - so I tried this.  It's GREAT.<br /><br />FYI:  A bit more lime than lemon, fyi, which is fine by me!<br /><br />So - I cut these  packets in half, and add them to my Ozarka 16 oz. water (which I recycle by the way), ... and I just get a refreshing flavor, plus keep the price down closer to that of Crystal Lite by getting 2 servings out of one package.  You might not need to do that, these are delicious, I just wanted a VERY light flavor, which let's face it - is really hard to get.  This is a fantastic value either way!<br /><br />So far, this flavor is the best I've found - and the added electrolytes - well, that IS a plus, let's face it.  I'm very glad I bought these, will be buying more.

review/text: I'm a vegetarian and don't consume gelatine, so no traditional gummy bears. As with most non-gelatine gummies, these also have sort of a gum-drop texture (not rubbery like a gummi bear), but MUCH more delicate. They tasted as though they had just been made- so good. One thing I like especially about these, is the cola flavor. I've never seen it in a vegetarian gummy candy, and this version is perfectly light and accurate. The 12 pack should last me at least 6 months. I am not a heavy candy consumer.

At first I was disappointed because they're not as chewy as the ones you get from the bins at bulk candy stores, but if you open up a bag and let it sit for a day or two, it loses moisture and gets a similar texture to the stuff that lies around in bins. They're also not quite as sour, from my memory. Nonetheless, an excellent candy.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the other Goody Good Stuff varieties because this stuff is great. But  for some reason, Amazon can't keep Cola Breeze in stock, nor do they offer a "Subscribe and Save" option for Cola Breeze even though they do for other Goody Good candies. Yes, I've written Amazon, but they haven't changed this in the past two months.<br /><br />Although I'm shooting myself in the foot to write this, I'd recommend purchasing a pack of 12 whenever you see these in stock, given Amazon's current difficulty keeping the product in stock. It's also confusing because there are two listings for the same product, one in grams and the other in ounces. But they're both the same weight, so keep an eye out for either of them.

review/summary: Very earthy, and a little bitter
review/text: Pros:<br />Quick cup of tea<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very earthy<br />Expensive<br />A bit acidy/bitter<br /><br />I enjoy green tea, and have tried a handful of varieties and many forms of it.  I've done the bags, pyramid bags, and loose tea.  This, I have to say, was probably the worst green tea I've had.  It was strong, bitter, and very earthy.  Similar to what happens when you steep certain green teas for too long.  Not sure if this is related to the particular brand, though I think I've had bagged versions of twinings green tea before that were just fine, or if its just the way it is brewed with the t-disc.  Or maybe its just a taste preference thing.  Maybe some people really enjoy a very earthy, and slightly acrid taste. Maybe its the more natural way for green tea to be.  For me, I will stick to my loose teas blended with jasmine or citrus notes.<br /><br />To conclude, if you like a smooth tasting green tea, this is not for you.  If you like your green tea strong, and earthy, this might be up your alley.  I think the price is also very expensive for what you get.

review/summary: great tea
review/text: The green tea is fragrant, fast, and delicious. One of the best tassimo teas. Unfortunately it seems that they may stop making it as it has been difficult to find.

review/summary: Depends on the Brewer
review/text: We have a Tassimo machine at work, and I have one at home. The tea is much stronger on the work tassimo (it is a newer model). It brews perfectly at home and has really good flavor. I even drink it cold sometimes, with some splenda and it is wonderful. When I brew it at work, I run the same disc twice in a row and mix them together to dilute it. Or run it once and add the same amount of Hot water. Overall I really like this tea a lot and it is by far my most used Tassimo product.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea
review/text: For a green tea, this is excellent! It has a very mild flavor with very little of the bitter aftertaste typical of most green teas. I highly recommend that you give it a shot if you like green tea.

review/summary: Worst Green Tea I've ever tasted
review/text: I'm a big fan of green tea.  I really cannot think of a green tea I've tried that I haven't liked - except this one.  Yuck.  It is very bitter and strong.  I could only make it drinkable by adding some milk and a packet of matcha tea.  I am super disappointed in this product, as most of the other t-disc coffees from tassimo are pretty good.  Don't waste your money on this - it's just as easy to use a pre-packaged tea bag and it will taste much better.

review/summary: Good solid morning tea
review/text: Glad to see this on Amazon - previously I purchased it directly from the company. The No. 2 blend is a larger leaf and takes a little longer to brew than their No. 1 blend. I know the two versions are supposed to be the same tea, but I like this one better. If you go too long, it can get bitter, so don't try for a 10 minute or longer steep, keep it to 5 minutes and less. If you want stronger, add more tea. I make a 10-cup pot using Mr. Coffee and 11-12 grams of tea nearly every mornings and drink it with stevia and half-&-half. I think the flavor is much better than Tetley's or PG Tips. It's a good solid English Breakfast. Nothing fancy, just very satisfying.

review/summary: Sprouting lentils is easy and nutritious
review/text: This is one of the best ways to get nearly complete protein from a vegetable. Use a wide-mouth mason jar (easier to clean) and a stainless mesh drain cover from your local hardware store. This makes daily rinsing easy. Soak overnight the first night. After that, rinse daily and drain well. Cover with the regular jar lid to keep moist. Takes about 3 to 4 days to get a quart of sprouts from one-third cup of dry. These lentils make very tastey sprouts, with a crunch like chopped almonds when cooked with par-cooked potatoes, sweet potatoes or other starchy vegetable. Eight minutes is enough. Don't let them get too long or green before cooking or they will taste a little grassy. Good raw rolled in rice paper with green onions and dipped, or on sandwiches.

review/summary: Tasty & in a convenient squueze bottle
review/text: After having some problems with Specturm's large glass jars not being sealed correctly, therefore getting some bad ones I was looking for another option. We do not eat alot of mayonnaise so decided to try their "squeeze" bottles. There is a good seal on the top of the bottle & it is easy to tap & squeeze out the mayonnaise. If you do not have time to make your own mayonnaise then this is a great alternative.<br />This mayonnaise tastes like it should - not too sweet, nicely seasoned.

review/text: The tea was okay.  However, the picture and description of these tea bags led me to believe that each bag would be in an individual paper wrap. Instead, the bags were simply all stuffed together in the box----many without strings.

review/summary: Great taste, ales stomache, also good for failing drug test.
review/text: This stuff tastes great but be careful, i had a cup prior to a doctors appointment. He suspected that I took drugs, so i offered up my urine. low and behold. Cocaine. Big surprise however in some way or another. I did not however expect something I can walk through customs to show up in my urine. Bravo Amazon. You are now slangin' yayo. oh. the end result, I showed my doctor this advertisement. he never believed that the levels that showed up in my urine could be attributed to this tea. I asked him "what levels?" response "positive levels." judge, jury, My screening was negative in all other areas.  My record remains tainted, and I switched doctors. Thank You kaiser permanente.
