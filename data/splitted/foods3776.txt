review/summary: Very good, clean snack
review/text: These are simply raisins. But, that is actually a great thing. What most people are used to are sweetened and chemically enhanced raisins. These arent that at all. They are just plain old delicious raisins with nothing added. You can feel good about eating a handful or two every day (or whatever your chosen amount/medium is). The subscribe and save price in particular is spot on as well, and even buying your heavily altered raisins at any store would cost more money than buying these unaltered ones here. I consider this to be both a great product and a great deal and am glad to have found them here.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: Unfortunately, I had assumed that all Bob's Red Mills products were organic and bought these raisins. I was really disappointed to find that the word "organic" was not anywhere to be found on the packaging. Grapes/raisins are one of the most pesticide sprayed foods so its important to me that they are organic.

review/summary: Merrick Before Grain
review/text: Research had led me to Merrick canned cat food.  I discovered how bad dry food was for cats...leaving them dehydrated and nutritionally deficient. I had always fed my previous cats dry cat food and the diseases that the research indicated were caused by a dry food diet were exactly what ended my other cats' lives.  Merrick is a good quality, high protein food with no grains. My kittens love the beef flavor. My Vet feeds her cats this food, too. Do your research and feed your cats only what is best for them....high quality canned, no grain food.

review/text: I have a tubby older cat who is quite the diva. I tried giving her the beef version of this same food, simply because it has a lower fat and higher protein content, and she pretty much demanded more quail pat&eacute; after a few bites. What can I say? The lady has a refined palette. Luckily, the price on Amazon makes it so that this thrifty college student can actually afford to please her. I love watching her lick her mittens and clean her face after she eats this stuff, totally satisfied and content in her little kitty world. Then, of course, nap time.

There's no doubt that this is real food, and not some sort of mix of leftovers from animal/grain processing.  It's pricey, but when you think about it, you spend so little on cat food compared to human food--this is probably a doable expense for most people.

review/summary: Saves a lot of calories and money
review/text: This might not be as great as the coffee down at your local cafe or Starbuck's but it is the next best thing, low in calories and fat. With all the calories you save, you can dress it up with your own cocoa powder on top and still be ahead of the game. Buying in bulk means saving even more money. Just keep in mind that the pack will be half milk discs and half coffee discs so it will be more expensive than buying just straight coffee. You might want to use only half the milk disc by brewing two cups and then splitting it.  Some people find Gevalia bitter, but it is certainly better than Maxwell House. I love the House Blend Starbuck's discs myself, with one of these creamers. Still a fraction of what you have to pay in a shop. Enjoy!

review/text: I still can't believe they are sugar free.  These taste like the real thing and brings back memories.  I received the Almonds within a week and have been enjoying them.  My kids even like these and they don't know they are sugar free. Always great to find sugar free candy that tastes great and I have found it finally.

review/summary: Taste different than regular sugar jordan almonds
review/text: My mom and I both love jordan almonds, but we thought these had a funny taste to them, Over the years, we have ate so many other sugar free candies and have loved them and have never noticed a taste difference. It was an okay taste but we thought it was somewhat strange, and that they didn't taste like regular jordan almonds. I'm still looking for a more normal tasting sugar free jordan almond, but for now we will just stick to the original and have it in moderation.<br />Also, don't have too many, you will end up not feeling so great....

review/summary: I love this thing
review/text: The wine saver is great in so many ways. Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.

review/summary: A good product made better
review/text: I've been using Vacu Vin's previous model for years and have been happy with it.  The one downside of the earlier offering was that wine lovers never knew when a vacuum was achieved.  I used to overpump just to make sure the wine-damaging oxygen was out of the bottle.<p>I got this model in Napa a few months ago and I'm glad I did.  While it doesn't deliver on its Concerto promise, it does give you reassuring clicks when a vacuum has been reached, enabling you to stop pumping sooner.  It's a nice refinement.<p>The only downside over the previous model is that it won't work with the marinating device sold separately because the bottom is configured differently from the earlier model.

review/summary: It really works
review/text: I was very skeptical when I bought this item, so imagine my amazement when I discovered that it actually works!  Prior to buying VacuVin, my red wine bottles would last a maximum of 1-2 days if immediately re-corked, and white wine a few days longer if refrigerated.  Now, my red wine is good for up to a week, and the white wine lasts even longer.  The device is very simple - it pumps air through a plastic cork to re-create the original pressure prior to opening.  Simple to use, and the corks are easy to rinse.  Perfect for single people like me who don't want to drink a full bottle in one sitting, or who may switch from red one night to white the next.

review/summary: Good Product - Great Customer Service
review/text: I use the wine saver almost daily to seal my favorite merlots.  I have never lost a bottle of wine since I began using it about 8 months ago.  Recently the unit suddenly froze up and would not work until I lubricated it with a little vegetable oil.  Unfortunately after that it no longer clicked when a seal was reached.  I decided to contact Vacu Vin directly via e-mail.  What a pleasant surprise when I received a reply asking me to mail them the unit for immediate replacement.  My new unit arrived several days later.  I give the product 4 Stars but the company gets 5 Stars for customer service.

review/summary: Great concept - but low quality - will jam permanently
review/text: I wish another company would make the same product with better quality. Although the concept is spot on, there's a problem with the rubber o-ring inside the pump - it will slide out of place and jam up the pump so that it becomes unusable. My first one lasted about 9 months before that happened, so I was willing to try again. The second one, however, lasted less than a month before the o-ring slipped and the pump jammed. There is no way to open it up to fix it. So until they fix this problem, this product is hit or miss. Caveat emptor!

review/text: I gave this product five stars in my original review, but now it's down to three.  I prefer the look and feel and the clicking confirmation that tells you when to stop pumping of the Concerto over Vacu Vin's original model , but it hasn't proven to be as durable. Less than a year after I got it, the pump seized up and couldn't be used until I sprayed some WD-40 lubricant in it.  It worked fine for over a year until the bottom of the pump mechanism broke off completely.  I've taken the original model out of mothballs.

review/text: I have purchased three of these - one for me and two for friends. While nothing will keep an open bottle of wine forever, the Vacu Vin extends the life of the wine for up to a week. Instead of pouring bad wine down the drain I can now finish it! It has paid for itself many times over - if you live alone and enjoy a glass of wine with your dinner ( not an entire bottle) I encourage you to try the Vacu Vin. By removing the air from the bottle it preserves the taste and quality of your wine far better than replacing the cork.

When you hear the musical click, it's all done! It extends the life of your wine several days. We had a bottle of merlot last an extra four or five days using the Vacu Vin. And it's so small, you can take it along with you to your favorite BYO restaurant, seal up the rest of the bottle, and take it home safely! An extremely useful gadget, and great tool for your aspiring wine snob friends. Get a couple extra stoppers to extend the usefulness.

After using it I bought 2 more to give away to my other wine lover friends.<br /><br />Edited Dec 14 2004: After using this product, I have to say it keeps the air out for about 2-3 weeks. I also like that the company made other items with the same air out idea like the marinater, and air tight containers. Keep in mind when purchasing that there are 2 differnt type of tops and one will not work on the other. The wine saver also can come with another top so you could have all of the same tops. I believe the other wine saver may be an older model.

review/summary: No Click
review/text: I've been using the Vacu Vin for probably about as long as they've been making them, and still had a good one with plenty of stoppers before I bought this "Concerto" model.  I bought it because of the "click" the user is supposed to hear when the right amount of air has been pumped out of the wine bottle, for the obvious reason that I didn't want to keep pumping when there was no need to. The problem is that after using this model multiple times, I have yet to hear it click, so I might as well have just stayed with the older device I had.  Since this thing is apparently clicking away for most reviewers, my case is probably just an isolated one (or maybe in my advanced years I'm just not robust enough to pump to the click--though I'm skeptical that that's the problem).

review/summary: easier than the old version
review/text: i didn't have enough stoppers with my old vacuvin so decided to just buy a new one. the "click" feature that lets you know when you've created the proper vacuum is handy.<br />I love vacu vin as it lets my wife & i drink a bottle of wine over several days without it oxidizing quickly (we have little kids so polishing off a bottle in a night is unfeasible with the attention they need and our sleep deprivation!). The most i've been able to get a red wine to last is about a week in the fridge, but that's 5 days longer than keeping it corked or on the counter! Sometimes a white has stayed in the fridge for 3 weeks and they're still fine. What i find interesting is that a decent to great red will over the 3-5 days i typically have it in the fridge, and it's sort of like aerating it each night.<br />I realize many people think vacuum stoppers or putting a red in the fridge is a no-no, but we have treated many cellar worthy wines and everyday wines through both steps and they come out just fine.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: We've owned several wine bottle resealers, but this is by far the best design.  This is our second Vacu Vin, and both are working like new.  The other brands we tried just didn't seal well.  This is also the only company that designed a clicking sound in the pump to let you know you've gotten all the air out of the bottle.  We keep the wine resealed for weeks and I can not tell the difference in the taste of the red wines kept at room temperature.  I have not tried to reseal a bottle of white wine that should be kept chilled so I don't know if this would seal as well so I couldn't comment on the results.  But, for my red wines this has been great.  I've been very disappointed in other more popular wine sealing products on the market.  The others I've tried have lost their vacum effect over time, and there was no way to know if you got all the air out of the bottle.

review/summary: A vacuum Nature won't abhor
review/text: If you drink wine pretty much daily but are not inclined to finish a bottle at each and every sitting, then Vacu Vin is the tool for you. Better than just corking, more cost-effective than a gas system, Vacu Vin allows one to, say, enjoy a Sangiovese with your pasta on Wednesday and return to it to with pizza on Saturday -- or even next Wednesday's pasta, and enjoy the wine again sans serious degradation due to oxygen exposure.<br /><br />Some sources, like Snooth feel the vacuum pulls aromatics from the wine but my experience has been a very positive one and I recommend the Vacu Vin for the tool collection of any wine enthusiast.

review/text: I was surprised at how much easier the Vacu Vin Concerto is to pump than their lower priced regular pump.  Plus an additional bonus is more wine stoppers!  The Vacu Vin Concerto is worth the extra money for the better pump alone!

review/text: I honestly don't know how we got by without this in the past.  It used to be we would have to drink a bottle of wine in a few days or else it would go stale.  Now we can have several different bottles of wine open at the same time for weeks and still enjoy them when we want.<br /><br />Very simple to use and we've never had an issue with the top not sealing.<br /><br />Have bought 3 more as gifts for family.

review/summary: Great Product that Saves you Money
review/text: I bought this Vacu Vin after having a dinner at one of our friends' places.  My friend recommended it as it helps keep a bottle of wine fresh so you don't waste it if you can't drink it all in one night.  And since she is French, I figured she must have a high standard for "fresh" wine :)<br /><br />She told me she found it at Crate & Barrel, but when I checked their website it seemed awfully expensive.  Much cheaper on Amazon.<br /><br />I've only used it once myself so far, but I like it.  Easy/simple to use, takes up little storage space, and I like the "click" to know when you've pumped it enough.<br /><br />I may be buying this for some family/friends for christmas???

review/summary: WINE THIS!
review/text: The question that has perplexed man for centuries, "Do you let her stay all night or call a cab for her?" It's the same with left over wine. If you try and drink it in the morning you'll find that it doesn't taste as good as it did last night! These is nothing you can do with a half a bottle of oxidized wine except throw it out or settle for vinegar. If you want that wine to taste good in the morning, buy yourself a Vacu Vin Concerto Wine Saver. It will keep your opened bottles of wine fresh for days. If you called the cab, you won't have to share the wine. If you let her stay, the next time she leaves will be with half your stuff! The Vacu Win Concerto Wine Saver will save you a lot of money!

review/summary: Like marriage, it's great if you have realistic expectations
review/text: Looking at the reviews of this an other Vacuvin products, you see reports that are deeply contradictory. It's interesting that there is such a divergence of experience with such a simple product. The ideas behind Vacuvin are pretty simple.<br />First, air is the enemy of an open bottle of wine. Bacteria in the air want to turn alcohol into vinegar. The air itself oxidizes and dulls the taste of all but the most robust wines.<br />Second, you can remove some of the air with a simple pump and thereby slow down the rate at which wine deteriorates.<br /><br />Why then, do we have both no-star and five-star reactions to this product?<br />Maybe the biggest source of disagreement is expectations. Vacuvin slows the deterioration of wine in the bottle, but it doesn't stop it.<br /><br />Another possible reason for all the disagreement might be a question of temperature. The biochemical reactions that kill your wine are temperature sensitive. They proceed faster when the wine is warm and slow down when it's cool. Putting a pumped-out bottle in the refrigerator or wine cooler will slow down the spoilage processes and make Vacuvin more effective.<br />A third issue is the way the wine is handled before the Vacuvin plug goes in. If wine has a lot of air dissolved in it by being poured from decanter to bottle, there's no system that will keep it fresh.<br /><br />For more info on wine storage, check out my book, New Short Course in Wine,The<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The and bang BANG: A Novel from Kunati Books.

review/summary: An extremely successful scam
review/text: I didn't think to question or research this wine preserver until after I received it.  The principle SEEMS valid, but once I received it I questioned how effectively it actually evacuates air from the bottle.  Then my research revealed questions about the stopper's ability to maintain what vacuum there is.  So, I did a simple test.  I pumped all the air out of a bottle that the unit was capable of and let it sit for a few hours.  After only maybe 6 hours, the stopper was so easy to pull out (without releasing pressure first) there is no way there was much of a vacuum at all left in the bottle.  At least it was cheap, but this unit is a complete scam. An incredibly successful and profitable one at that, it seems.

review/summary: An amazing vegetable garden
review/text: I started using Liquafeed around the middle of the growing season last year.  The results were very good, so I used it this year right from the start.  The result is that we have tomato plants that look positively ferocious and squash and zucchini plants that are out to conquer the world.  We have already harvested several large zucchinis and it is only early July.  I usually use about half a bottle on the vegetable garden once a week and the rest on flowers and bushes.  This year the roses were spectacular.<br /><br />I highly recommend this stuff. Normally I would balk at something proprietary when cheaper generic substitutes are available, and I'm not thrilled that the bottle is not refillable, but Liquafeed is so easy to use and works so well that I don't even feel guilty about the extra cost.

Otherwise, I just use the "water" side.  I am amazed that this is so hard to find in our local stores.  It was easily available for the last few years, now I could only find it on line.  Still, it is the easiest way to feed the annuals on my deck and that is what I use it for most.  Occassionly, I do use it on the perennials in the garden.
