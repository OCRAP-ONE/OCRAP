review/summary: Good Cereal
review/text: The product itself is very good. It's lightly sweet and very tasty with the cinnamon. It's a little high in calories (1 cup=230 calories) but it keeps you full for many hours. The only problem I had was with Amazon not the product. If you live in an apartment complex and aren't home all the time, the delivery will not always be left for you if you don't have a mail service in the complex itself. This is delivered by USPS, and not having a car, it makes redelivery take longer to get the product to you on a day that you are home all day to wait for the package. Just a little disclaimer about the shipping!

review/summary: Our favorite tea
review/text: I first tried this tea at Einstein Bros. Bagels, and it is the only tea the we drink now. It has the greatest flavor, and is the finest tea that I have ever tasted. I have offered it to many friends that do not like tea and they have tried it and loved it. We all like it without cream or sugar, the flavors are so rich and vibrant that it easily stands on its own.<br />Harney & Sons even somehow got my boyfriend off of soda, he bought a bunch of different flavors and has them with his meals instead now. They compliment meals very well, and are a wonderful way to start your day and unwind in the evenings.

review/text: The flavor here is a winner, with appealing notes of citrus that provide a refreshing and exhilarating flavor. I'm not a tea connoisseur by any stretch -- I'm fine with Lipton even if it's on sale -- but even I can tell this is really special. As good as it is hot, it also makes a delicious sun tea, with three bags in a repurposed jug from<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00556L9SQ">Arizona Sun Brewed Style Iced Tea with Lemon Flavor 128 oz</a>. Chill and enjoy.<br /><br />I'm sharing little clusters of one to three bags with family and friends because I think it's that good.<br /><br />Hope Amazon.com considers lowering the price especially if it's double what other reviewers have noted at grocery stores.

review/summary: Good formula for finicky CRF cats
review/text: You might want to use phosphorus binders if your cat has CRF.  My cat won't touch any food that has any of that stuff mixed in, and once she's eaten something and it's made her sick, she refuses to touch it again for weeks until she forgets that she's thrown it up, so I'm flailing around alternating among canned foods that she can tolerate, whether they are prescription renal diets or various other foods that she likes and can tolerate.  This food seems to thrill her, and, so far, she's been able to keep it down (but I don't feed her more than one of these cans in a day).  It's expensive to buy online, but you can find decent sales if you check the ads for pet food stores.

review/summary: Chiver's Ginger Preserve
review/text: This is simply the best ginger preserve in the world. Actually, I think it is one of the finest marmalades of anything, anywhere. It's too bad that only very few stores in the US carry it, and it's great that it is available here at a reasonable price. The texture is wonderful - pieces of ginger in a pretty solid preserve. It's sweet, but not overly sweet, and not really bitter, but it somehow manages to keep the distinct ginger taste. I love this on a toasted multigrain bread over a thin layer of sour creme. I agree with the previous reviewer - a good cup of black tea (but with a drop of milk, I dare to disagree in that detail) makes the perfect companion. Alas, it takes so little to have a perfect breakfast....

review/summary: used it to instead of grape jelly for a PB&J sandwich
review/text: I bought this preserve at the local grocery store. I got tired of the usual grape, stawberry & apricot jams when I bought this preserve to try in their place. I always felt that, in general, peanut butter overwhelmed the traditional use of grape jellies... I've known many people to heap on the grape stuff in an attempt to compensate for this. I suspected that ginger, being a stonger flavor, would be better suited for this purpose and in my opinion, I was right. the ginger complimented the peanut butter very nicely and required less product to be used.<br />if you're hesitant to purchase this product because your not sure how or when you would use it... buy it and get creative. I liked this stuff so much, I plan to make it a staple in my home.

review/text: I'm in the coffee business. I order various whole bean coffees through Amazon Grocery to check out the competition. Lately, I've noticed something odd. Perhaps it's a coincidence but the last couple of coffee orders that I have placed have been most satisfying. I go to Amazon to leave feedback and I find that the coffee is suddenly unavailable? Bizarre. Here's another one. I just got the coffee that I ordered. It's a lovely, dark organic. I have been quite delighted with every type of coffee that I have puchased from this roaster. They are putting out some high quality beans. I'm quite particular about French roast. It's my favorite roast and it has to be done just right. This variety was exquisitely roasted. The resulting brew was earthy, fragrant, and not too heavy on the palate. Sadly, as I write this review I see that this coffee is "currently unavailable." I just ordered it! Am I some kind of a jinx? Keep checking back. It's worth it!

I went through this pack of 3 quite quickly so it's not the best value for my money either.  I'm not complaining though.  I am having fun on my search for my favorite French Roast.  Jeremiah's is still very good and probably more worth a 4 and a half star rating.

Bought another brand of chai and it had a strong anise(licorice) taste, which I don't like.  Saw a review that Numi was better than Tazo, so had to try.  Bought the Golden chai and this Rooibos chai.  Both are great, not a strong anise flavor in the Golden Chai.  This Rooibos chai tastes like Christmas.  No anise at all.  If you like cloves, you will like this tea and it is caffeine free.  It is not presweetened so I add stevia and it is a perfect cup of tea!

review/summary: Delectable Herbal Caffeine-Free Chai
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic rooibos, organic cloves, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic cardamom, organic nutmeg, and organic cinnamon. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Earthy, vanilla organic Rooibos and a sultry blend of spices come together from around the world in Numi's caffeine-free chai. Warmed by the South African sun, Rooibos is lauded for its high anti-oxidant properties. It is full-bodied like black tea, yet soothing any time of day. We've sourced the highest quality cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, mingling them with sweet Indian allspice and vivacious Chinese ginger. A kiss of cardamom unites this fabulous caffeine-free alternative to Numi's Golden Chai. Share in the savory warmth of Ruby Chai."<br /><br />If you are used to black tea or coffee and are wanting to get accustomed to herbal caffeine-free teas, this is a great way to start, since the flavors are stronger and thus less subtle than most herbal teas. Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I love this crust.  This is the only precooked crust that I've tried that gets crispy in the oven.  I think one of the reasons for that is it's not frozen.  With most of the frozen crusts, I think there's some extra moisture that causes it to not crisp.<br /><br />If you're like me, you tend to find a brand that you like and buy other products from them.  I've done that with Schar.  I've tried the bread, shortbread cookies, pasta, vanilla wafers, and choc. hazelnut bars.  My least favorite is the hazelnut bars.  My absolute favorite is the vanilla wafers.  The texture and consistency of them is great.

review/summary: Almost perfect... but...
review/text: Ok, well first I should say that I have very little experience with GF products, because I was just recently diagnosed with gluten sensitivity.  And I have zero experience making pizza.  That said, I have both positive and negative feedback about this product.<br /><br />Just today I made my first-ever pizza, with this GF crust.  As it was nearly 100 degrees today, I didn't want to heat my oven to 425, so I decided to make it on the grill outdoors instead.  I sprayed oil on the down-facing side, just to keep it from sticking to the grill grate.  On the stoptove, I sauteed ground sirloin (93% lean), red and yellow bell peppers, some Vidalia onion, and sliced Baby Bella mushrooms in some olive oil and chopped garlic.  When finished cooking that, I drained it on paper towels to remove the excess oil.  Then I piled them onto a pizza crust and topped it all with grated cheddar cheese.  These were all just odds and ends that I had leftover from other meals I cooked this past weekend.<br /><br />Then I put it on the grill on medium heat, and watched it carefully.  I checked it in five or so minutes, and it had started to brown a little.  I lowered the heat to low and cooked it for a few more minutes, then checked it again.  It was brown and had nice grill marks on it, so I took it off and sliced off a piece to taste it.  It seemed like it was cooked just fine... soft and doughy on the inside, nice and brown and crispy on the outside.  I determined that it was ready to eat, so I took it off and polished it off... yummy and soooo filling.  That will definitely be my only meal today.  It was delicious, and the crust tasted fine.  I think that my hubby would even like it.<br /><br />Now the negatives.  But these are more a matter of personal taste than anything specifically wrong with the crusts themselves.  First, I should've checked the label before eating it, because I am also lactose intolerant.  I can handle a small amount of lactose (the cheese I used contained almost none), but I didn't realize until I'd eaten it that the crust contained milk.  Whoops.  So here comes the bloating...  maybe a better warning on the front of the box "not lactose free" would be good.  I don't know why I assumed it was, I shouldn't have assumed that.  I notice that even I write this review, one of the suggested tags for it is "casein free."  It says right in the ingredients that it contains "milk protein," so people allergic or sensitive to casein shouldn't eat it.<br /><br />Second, if you are counting carbs to lose weight, it is not a great idea to eat an entire crust by yourself.  These look like single-serving pizzas... they are small and I treated it as if it were a "personal pizza."  However, the label says that 1/3 of the crust contains 30g of carbs.  Yikes.  So I just consumed 90g of carbs in one sitting.  That's not good for me or probably for anyone.  These crusts are fairly thick too, and I normally like a thin, crispy pizza crust.  I would love these much better if they were 1/2 the thickness and 1/2 the carbs.<br /><br />Finally, these come with holes pricked on one side but not the other.  Being new to making my own pizza, I wasn't quite sure which side went down and which went up.  Some instructions on the box to this effect would benefit pizza-making novices like myself.  In the end, I put the hole-side down, but in retrospect I think maybe that was wrong.  Maybe the holes are meant to allow steam to escape upwards, so the crust gets crispy.  Anyone who can give me some insight on this will be appreciated! (At any rate, my crust did come out perfect so maybe I got it right.) I've cooked pretty much everything in my lifetime, but somehow never got into pizza.  Now that I am gluten intolerant, I hope to be making my own and eventually get real good at it.  My goal is to make a gluten-free pizza that even my hubby will find irresistible...and maybe even preferable to the pizza shop kind.  However, even though this crust was good, I can't see myself eating it regularly because of the carbs.  Most likely, I will learn to make my own GF crust so that I can make it as thin, crispy, lactose-free, casein-free, and gluten-free as I like.

review/summary: Great option for pizza
review/text: I've tried a billion pizza crusts on the market and these things are really good for pizza as long as you follow a few important steps when making them.<br /><br />They are best cooked on a very high heat in your oven and don't really respond well to sitting on a low bake setting for a half hour. You want to flash cook these suckers on one of the lower trays inside the oven. If you cook them too slowly they can dry out.<br /><br />In addition, these things taste about a thousand times better if you cover the surface in olive oil. Doesn't have to be expensive stuff. Just your basic olive oil. This makes them brown really nicely and also adds a good flavor to the finished crust.<br /><br />Most of the pizza crust mixes that you have to add ingredients to are rather cardboard tasting. These things aren't and they're even ready-made.<br /><br />I'd say the only drawback to these yummy things is that they cost a fortune.

review/summary: Best GF pizza almost as good as a normal pizza crust
review/text: My son has gluten allergy and egg allergy, so we couldn't really try many of the other options out there. And some that were there were not good and didn't really taste like pizza. We had given up hope of my son ever eating a good pizza when we came across this. If you follow their directions exactly, the pizza comes out really well and tastes almost as good as any other pizza out there with the right toppings (cheese, green bell peppers, tomato and onions for us). it was so yummy, me and my hubby ate it too!  My son ate a whole pizza and now its a regular thing for him at birthday parties etc. We bought it from Whole Foods though where it is a lot cheaper!

review/summary: Not all that bad
review/text: I'm sad to say that this may be as good a product as you can find in the GF pizza category.  It does crisp up nicely, but it's really not all that different from a communion wafer in taste and texture. That said, I think if I had used better quality ingredients over the top of it, this might have been a pretty good pizza. Mea culpa.

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST
review/text: BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.

review/summary: Just enough crunch!
review/text: Unlike one uphappy reviewer, I was pleased to open my jar of Branston Original and discover that it was just as crunchy and just as flavorful as the last time I'd had a Ploughman's in a pub in the UK.  I'd never had anything like it here in the US and was delighted with it on first acquaintance.  It's a pungent explosion for the tastebuds and a nice crunch for the choppers, too.  I will admit there is a bit more of the sauce-y stuff, in proportion to the crunch, than I like -- hence the four stars instead of five -- but on all other points, this pickle in a jar compares very favorably to what I recall having fresh.  I've also ordered the Heinz Ploughman's pickle through Amazon --  not so much crunchy stuff, way too much "sauce," and not as good a flavor (blander) IMO.  This Crosse and Blackwell comes in a good sized jar for the price and is well worth ordering.

It's so good as a matter of fact that I'm only going to be drinking it from now on. I've been grinding my own Sumatra organic coffee at Fresh Market or French Roast at Whole Foods. However, this coffee is every bit as good. It has a deep, rich flavor that is incomparable! I'm a true connoisseur of great coffee, and this fits the bill entirely. I haven't tried Camano Islands Coffee Roasters' other coffees, but I am certain they are superior, too. Other things that make their coffee special besides being organic (which means no sprays or preservatives of any kind!) are that they're shade grown, fairly traded, and support 39 villages worldwide through [...] If you haven't tried Camano Island Coffee yet, try some today. You'll be delighted you did!

review/text: I just wanted to add my opinion as a non-coffee connoisseur.  I picked this product as my first bag of coffee because I wanted to buy something relatively environmentally friendly and pre-ground.  And I must say, that it produces delicious coffee.  I drink it black, prepared in a standard drip coffee maker. It comes on a bit bitter at first, although not unpleasantly so, but after the first couple of sips, it's all smoothness.  If you're a coffee beginner like me, it's a pretty good way to go!

review/summary: My second blend from Camano Island Coffee Roasters
review/text: This was my second experience with Camano Island Coffee Roasters, and I will say that it was definitely as fulfilling as the first.<br /><br />I have always been a dark roast drinker as I love the full body and the complex flavors typically offered by the darker roasts. This coffee is no exception, really. The flavor of this coffee is incredible, with its initial sweet tones and lasting earthy tones. When I say earthy, I don't mean it has the taste of dirt or sand. Its flavor isn't too intrusive to the palate as a less quality blend usually is, but it never leaves you wanting more body due to the roast itself being weak.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I use this blend in my coffee press and have never used it in a drip machine (due to the lack of access to one). All that I have made coffee for agree that this is the best blend I've had.<br /><br />I highly recommend this blend.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: This is my favorite hot cocoa!!  I am lactose sensitive (not intolerant) so I cannot make hot cocoa "with" milk.  (I can handle it having some milk as an ingredient.)  I was looking for one that tastes very good that can be made with water.<br />I do use three very large heaping Tbsp for about 10 oz of water.  The cost was irrelevant to me, I expect to pay for a good hot cocoa--I was not looking for Swiss Miss or Nesquik.<br />I am very picky but I should disclose that for the record I do NOT like the bitter cocoa.  (if you do, this is not the drink for you)  This was not too sweet to me because I expect "some" sweetness" in a cocoa.  But if you like bitter cocoa, look elsewhere.  I did not like the chocolate raspberry cocoa Pacific Dessert Co. makes (Black Forest I think) because I did think it was a little bit too sweet.  Nevertheless, this white chocolate almond flavor is fabulous!!  It mixes quite well with a shot of Frangelico on a cold evening too. :-)

review/summary: Red Matcha tea made from Rooibos
review/text: I think there is a wrong description of this tea listed at the moment, this tea is made from the rooibos plant.<br /><br />I bought the tea since I do love the Japanese green matcha tea, but that is so energizing I don't want do drink it at night. Plus I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />I found that there are only about 3 companies who do sell red matcha. I tried this one from Red Leaf Tea since I saw that they had many different types of matcha available, even black and white matcha. So they appear to be matcha specialists! I sometimes cannot wait for my shipment of green tea to arrive from Japan, it takes so long. I was happy to find Red Tea and they are an American company, the shipping was fast!<br /><br />I love the red matcha, it has its own sweet flavor, I liked it without sugar or cream. It is very thirst quenching. I haven't tried it iced, but I read that it is wonderful as an iced tea or iced latte. I only bought the small size so I am conserving. I am using the rest to make just plain, I just add hot water and whisk or stir. It is absolutely delicious without anything added. It foams up pretty nicely also! I should have bought the bigger size from Red Tea. I was trying it for the first time.  Now I have another tea I like as much as green tea matcha!<br /><br />This red matcha is very healthy and FULL of anti-oxidants, even more so than green tea! It is a good tea to drink at bedtime since it is relaxing, but it also makes a good daytime tea.  I think this tea will be revitalizing if you need and relaxing if you want, it is unique.<br /><br />Try this: add some red tea matcha to warm milk or soymilk (any kind of milk) with your favorite sweetener. YUMM!<br /><br />I put some of the matcha in lowfat 1% milk with some vanilla agave syrup (I didn't have plain agave) and then used my espresso machine's steamer to foam the milk and create a delicious dessert.  I was a little embarrassed to try to get every little bit of foam out of my mug, so I made a second serving!  I still got every bit out of the mug at the end, that is how good it is!

review/summary: Best Tea In The World! Hot or Cold!
review/text: I was a 5-cup aday extra bold coffee drinker. On a trip to India last year, I got a bad cough and while there, I decided to just drink tea. The hotel I was at served Dilmah Blackcurrant. The flavor was wonderful. I bought some while in India and have been drinking it ever since. I have not had a cup of coffee now for over 7 months. My wife is ecstatic. In 37 years of marriage she never had a cup of coffee and only drank Lipton Tea. I asked her to try this tea and she is hooked too! So is my 13 year old grandson (he makes iced tea with it). This tea is not only great tasting - it's one of the best thirst quenchers you can have. I always carry their tea packets with me (as does my wife). When in a restaurant, instead of paying up to $2.50 for a cup of tea, I ask for a cup of hot water (free)! Servers have even commented how smart that is. I've since tried many different Blackcurrant teas from vatious companies. None of them have the Dilmah flavor. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Cheers!

review/summary: Best Brown Mustard Ever
review/text: When I was little, my grandfather always made me braunschweiger sandwiches with this mustard.  When I tried to make braunschweiger sandwiches myself, they were never as good.  I just revisited Heinz Spicy Brown mustard and it's exactly what all my sandwiches have been missing!  I thought brown mustard was losing its appeal to me over the years, and I'd leave it off kielbasa and other sandwiches, but trying this one again made me realize the other mustards just aren't as good.  Pap-pap spoiled me :D.

review/summary: Best Brown Mustard... Ever!
review/text: I never cared much for any of the brown mustard brands out there. Then I tried Heinz. My taste buds woke up, my eyebrow arched & a smile crept across my lips (while licking them to get every last drop)... YUM!!! This IS the brown mustard that made me LOVE brown mustard! It has a delightful, sweet spiciness that truly enhances the flavor of foods without overwhelming/smothering the flavor of your food. Now I want nothing else on my Kosher hot dogs & sandwiches with everything from salami to turkey: anything else is second rate & I would feel like I'm wasting perfectly good food by settling for anything else! Try it, you'll like it! Try Heinz & enjoy!

review/summary: Mmm Good - a review of Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps
review/text: I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.<br /><br />I don't mind giving them to my family because they are mostly organic (70%) and they don't contain hydrogenated oils nor corn syrup.  In addition, they contain iron - from the molasses - which is  something you don't often find in a snack.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A superior product in my opinion.  The whole family loves them.  Even my extremely picky son.  The flavor is zingy with a definite bite and each cookie is only 26 calories.  One of the few store-bought treats that I have no problem handing out to the children.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: What a great cookie!
review/text: My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew.  If you don't, they're very, very crisp (but still very good).  Snappy, even.  :)<br /><br />I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland.  For my family, they're just the right amount of hot after a few cookies.

review/summary: All Natural Ginger Snaps
review/text: When Whole Foods stopped stocking my favorite ginger snaps, I decided to get a 12-pack from Amazon instead of settling for the "365" brand, which had sugar as an ingredient, giving it a sandy texture in my mouth.  Mi-Del is the real deal and are great with coffee.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic dehydrated cane juice, canola oil, unsulphured molasses, ginger, baking soda, sea salt, soy lecithin (used as an emulsifier).  Product of Canada.<br /><br />Update:  I placed my order about 6-months ago and finally worked my way through the 12-pack.  They are not as fresh tasting now, of course but they still go great with my coffee and I consider them a healthy snack.  My sister thought they were too spicy but I love that ginger spice and just placed another order.

review/summary: Good cookies!
review/text: These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.<br /><br />Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case! However, given the high quality of this product, you should have no problem splitting up the order.<br /><br />Yummy and highly recommended!

review/summary: Crunchy Little Cookie - Delicious
review/text: My order for Mi-Del Ginger Snaps arrived a few hours ago and I tried my first one ... okay, I'm on my 10th cookie now.  My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding.

review/text: This is the cookie that is the bain of my existence. I absolutely love it.<br /><br />They taste best when they are really fresh so if you buy this 12 pack dont wait 6 months to eat them all ... they dont have a long shelf life ... they get hard and loose flavor even if you never open the bag. This is probably because they are made with natural ingredients and dont have the preservatives found in other cookies.<br /><br />But honestly i love these cookies they are sweet, crisp and very gingery ... even my sister and brother in law who don't eat anything "healthy" or "organic" because they think it wont taste good, where impressed with the taste of these cookies.<br /><br />Now they are hooked too and buy them all the time.

review/summary: A Great Dunking Cookie
review/text: This cookie stands up very well to dunking in milk (about three dunked bites per cookie), and with mostly organic ingredients is about as guilt-free as possible in a cookie. We like a crisp ginger snap, and while the bag isn't self-sealing it seals well if you have a clip. We find the ginger level to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there.<br /><br />One correction to the ingredient list posted on this site -- there's no grape juice concentrate in the cookie, according to the bag I'm looking at right now and the Mi-Del website.<br /><br />Per serving size of 5 cookies: Calories 140; Total Fat 4g; Carbs 22g; Fiber 1g; Sugars 11g.

review/summary: So good people are taking them from me!
review/text: These cookies seemed to be a pretty good deal when I saw that there was a special offer on them. I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that "snap" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me "so where did you find these?"  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. "Natural" and "Organic" are buzz words for "gonna cost ya more" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!

The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.<br /><br />Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.<br /><br />I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy.

review/text: I received the Lemon Snaps faster than expected, but one of the bags was missing from the order. The cookies are ok, but not much lemon flavor. I give them a 5 out of a 10 rating.

review/summary: Not My Idea of Vanilla Snaps
review/text: I absolutely love the Mi-Del ginger snaps, so I thought I'd try these in vanilla, thinking they'd be just as tasty.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the vanilla flavor I'd hoped for, and I wasn't crazy about their consistency.  They almost seemed stale, although I'm sure that's not the case.  As I actually prefer the name brand vanilla snaps, I gave these away to my local food pantry.

review/summary: Healthy snaps that taste good, too
review/text: I ordered both the vanilla and the ginger snaps, and like both kinds. The high quality organic ingredients provide a "guilt-free" eating experience. I'm not sure if kids would go for them, but will try them out on my nephews next time I get a chance. I ordered two 12-packs so will have cookies for quite a while. Mine expire 6/20/08 so don't buy TOO many in advance.

review/summary: disappointing taste
review/text: I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients.  I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good.  I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing.  The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter.  It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).<br /><br />Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off.  Not Recommended.

review/summary: OK
review/text: These cookies are hard & somewhat<br />lacking in taste. We threw out half the bag.<br />Mostly because my children did not like<br />ginger snaps & my husband and I did not care for these.

review/summary: Blah
review/text: Good aroma, good mouth feel, but the taste...flavorless.  Like a crunchy lump of flour.  Might help if they put some ginger in it.

review/summary: Great Service and Product
review/text: Received in good time and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the tin was a lot smaller than I had expected for the price.  I guess we live in a time where everything is just getting more and more expensive and you get less and less for your money.  However the seller performed with great service and I love the product.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This product is delicious. It has a very unique taste and is great by itself or in other things like baked goods. It has a beautiful orange-gold color. I also use it in some beer recipes that I brew. The can is also lovely, but once I open it, I store the syrup in a glass jar.
