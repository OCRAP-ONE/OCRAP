review/summary: Wonderful Coffee
review/text: As I am a decaf drinker, I was amazed that this regular coffee did not upset me.  Drinking this wonderful coffee is like eating chocolate covered raspberry candy.  It is not bitter as some coffees are, and it doesn't leave an aftertaste as some coffees do.<br /><br />My guests also enjoy it.<br /><br />All I can say is that I am very pleasantly pleased with this great tasting coffee.  A great pick me up.

review/summary: Best Flavored Coffee...
review/text: I generally do not drink the flavored coffee but our recent acquisition of the Keurig coffee maker I have been sampling many flavors.  Of all the 15 - 20 flavored coffees I have tried over the past 3 months the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee is BY FAR the BEST.  Fantastic blend of flavors and it actually has flavor...most others I tried seemed to have aroma but fell short in the flavor category.  I highly recommend trying this flavored coffee!

review/text: I'm trying to figure out what it is that tastes so very peculiar and unpleasant in these cookies. Could it be the soy flour? In any case, I get no taste of chocolate chips at all. Zero. Zilch. They might as well have left that out of the name. The texture isn't bad. It's crunchy and not overly gritty. But there are better gluten-free snacks out there. I hope.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was so excited to find these in our local Whole Foods.  I loved the fact that they came in individually wrapped packages (great  for travel, lunch boxes, etc).  Unfortunately, the taste was quite disappointing.  The cinnamon flavored ones were even worse.  Neither myself, nor my youngest liked either of them.  Granted, we are both somewhat picky when it comes to store-bought cookies.  I'd have loved to have given them to my oldest son (who has a real sweet tooth and likes most GFCFSF cookies I buy), but they have both soy and corn in them and he is allergic to soy and corn in addition to gluten and dairy.  Fortunately, I hadn't bought them in bulk on Amazon ...  I was surprised to see that they got such good reviews.

review/summary: Where's the Vanilla???
review/text: I love flavored coffees.  This one is supposed to be vanilla nut.  As I'm drinking it this morning, there is neither vanilla nor nut, either by aroma or by taste.  In that sense, this coffee is a complete disappointment for me.  It will get a three star rating, nevertheless, for two other reasons.  This is a good morning breakfast coffee despite the complete lack of flavor.  Secondly, about a month ago Amazon ran this for $13.84 for the three 12-ounce packages, including super saver shipping, which made it a fairly good purchase.  Currently, Amazon has the price back up around $20, which is too much for me given the quality, or, rather, lack thereof.

review/summary: Great "Reasonably" Spicy Jerky!
review/text: I am a long-time fan of beef jerky, since I was a kid reading about its origins.  Too often, commercially available jerky is just so much crap; poor quality, no taste, lousy texture, etc.  Usually, the only good stuff you can find is with small "boutique" (boy, that seems out of place!) vendors, the kind you mind find at good "county fairs".  The only really good jerky I've ever purchased was from Bread & Circus in the early '90s...<br /><br />This jerky is pretty close.  Very good texture (if you like it moist), and little gristle.  Very nice flavor, and some spice - mind you, I really like it hot, so for those who like things milder or moderate, this is probably near or beyond your limits.  The only jerky I know that is hotter is my homemade version using Mad Dog Inferno!<br /><br />Great Product!

review/summary: Really good jerky, but very salty.
review/text: This jerky has great flavor and a perfect consistency but is quite salty. Its chew is ideal for a tender jerky, it's not overly softened by enzymes to the point of crumbling, yet still retains a bit of a chew so feels like actual jerky. All of the pieces are nicely trimmed and cut against the grain from good quality beef.<br /><br />The flavor is very nice as well, there's a distinct garlic flavor and a solid spicy taste. It's definitely not extremely spicy though, if you aren't phased by Tabasco sauce then this jerky will not be very hot to you. For me, the saltiness of this jerky is considerably more intense than the spiciness. My mouth remains parched many minutes after eating this, so be prepared to drink a lot of water since it's salt content is considerably higher than the average jerky.<br /><br />The saltiness didn't overwhelm too much though so I was still able to experience the really nice flavor and consistency of the meat.  A lot of jerky companies use papaya enzymes to tenderize their jerky, but it tends to make it artificially soft and crumbly, sticky even. Buffalo Bill's does not use these enzymes which I assume is why they are pretty heavy on the salt since it's such a good tenderizer. if they were able to lower the salt and retain the same constancy than this would without a doubt be 5-star perfect jerky.<br /><br />This is still very good stuff though and if you are not too bothered by high salt foods and like a little spice then you should definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Fantastic, and well worth the price
review/text: I bought this jerky for my husband because he loves jerky and spicy food (this one seemed like a no-brainer based on the reviews). To be honest, he was thrown off by the very bright red color when he originally got it and let the jerky sit for a few days while he worked up the courage to try it (bright red, chipotle, habanero, it was a little intimidating). Once he tried it, he fell in love. It's soft, tender, flavorful, not too salty, in essence, in his words, it's like "spicy carne asada, and not the junk, tough carne asada you get at the tex-mex places". It's all he can do to only eat one piece, he loves it!  Well worth the price.

review/summary: Not as the label states
review/text: Let me start by saying this is not really bad jerky.  I took issue to two of the descriptions on the bag.  The first is that this in my opinion is not "HOT".  One would thing that Habanero jerky would at least elicit some type of heat in the mouth, tears, etc.  I did not find that to be the case & was quite disapointed.  I also do not believe this jerky to be very "tender".  The first two pieces I ate almost have the consistency of shoe leather & were very tough to chew through.  I have had purchased more tender jerky at Dollar General.  I will not be buying this again.

This is the best jerky I've ever had.<br /><br />I typically don't like things with MSG because they make me feel like crap, and this didn't have that effect on me at all, so they must not use much MSG.

review/text: We've been buying the Country Cut beef jerky for almost 2 years.  It's definitely the most moist(and tender on your teeth) of the variations they offer IMO.  As for this, if you are one of those people who love Asian inspired "hot" foods and have no problems with a searing burn in your mouth, the Chipotle Habanero is right up your alley.  If you are one of those people who can drink hot sauce(like Louisiana Hot Sauce) like nothing but want something more spicier, then Spicy is more at your level.  They are not kidding when they call this one Habanero.  It's delicious but HOT!  Be forewarned :P

review/text: I ordered Buffalo Bills Chipotle Habenero beef jerky for my brother for Christmas.  He's an absolute jerky fiend, but it's hard to find good jerky anymore!  I'm so glad I found Buffalo Bills!  Forget Jack Links or O'berto, which can be dry, tough, and flavorless.  For just a couple ounces of that kind in the store, you'll pay $5 or $6 a bag.  Here, you get half a pound for a great price!  And the quality can't be beat!<br /><br />I haven't tried the Chipotle Habanero that I ordered for my brother (we'll have to wait until Christmas to hear feedback about that), but my boyfriend and I couldn't help but dig into the free sample of cajun jerky they included (a great way to get repeat customers, btw!), and it was wonderful!  So flavorful and chewy.  I had to take the sample away otherwise he would have eaten the whole thing in one sitting.<br /><br />My package arrived within a couple days of ordering and the jerky looks fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to try the habanero one! (If my brother lets me...)<br /><br />Definitely recommend!!!

The sachets allow the tea leaves to move around more freely, so you get a better flavor than with a typical tea bag.<br /><br />Harney makes a huge selection of custom blend teas. I have been ordering their tea for years and am always finding something new to try!

review/text: Harney and Sons Teas are my favorite. Between the exquisite packaging and the exciting combination of flavors incorporated into one sachet, I just love it. And Paris is one of their best. Also, if you like Cinnamon, you will love their Hot Cinnamon spice. You will truly know you are drinking cinnamon! I haven't had a tea of theirs that I didn't just love, yet.

review/summary: Paris in a Cup! The perfect tea!
review/text: Paris is a best-seller for a reason! I love the combination of black tea, sweet caramel, floral, and citrus notes.  They are so well blended that no one taste overpowers the other--a perfect blend in every sip! It tastes like sweetness and joy and lights reflected in rainy cobblestone streets. I have now purchased my 3rd box of this tea, and it won't be my last!

It tastes to good it doesn't taste like a replacement for a real food that I would eat if it wasn't going to kill me.  Used it on a vegetable & Egg-Beater omelette this morning which it complimented perfectly.  Mrs. Dash make doing low-sodium a no brainer.

review/text: The Mrs Dash Onion and Herb Seasoning Blend is one of the many Mrs Dash products I use almost on a daily basis.  I have and use almost every Seasoning Blend even before I went on a low/No salt added diet.  The only drawback is that not all the products a available in packs from Amazon.  I have only found two of the many blends that I use and have ordered both from Amazon.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes good taste and low sodium food.  Buying them in bulk from Amazon is actually cheaper than buying them from the local grocery store and other online sites for the ones I can not find localy.  Hopefully Amazon will get all of the available one of these days.  I would be a regular customer of this product.

review/text: I recently purchased a 6 pack of Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb Seasoning Blend and couldn't be happier!  I tried this product when I saw it new in the store and loved it - but it has become harder to find since so many competitors are offering similar products to the Mrs. Dash line now.  This particular blend is my favorite - I don't need to keep onions in the pantry any more since the onion flavor is just what I like.  The price was a little better than the usual price in the store, and now I don't have to worry about not being able to find it - I'm so glad I found this offer on Amazon!

review/text: I just wanted to follow up to the first reviewer complaining so badly.  These roarin' waters (as well as the grape, cherry, and strawberry kiwi flavors) are great for kids if you start them on these drinks.  There is no junk in these because they are WATER.  MUCH better than the suger loaded bags of "juice"...now whenever my kids have a chance to drink the regular juice pouches, they hate the taste.  They will seek these out over the other ones any day.  They have always been encouraged to drink the flavored water instead of the garbage....and they have much better taste for healthier stuff now because of it.

review/text: I have tried about every low calorie snack. These are so good I almost do not believe they have only 100 calories. They are  dense dark chocolate. If you are used to super sweet light chocolate you may not like these. I would eat these even if I were not counting calories.  I just subscribed for 2 cases every month and get a discount this way. And they are compact so great for traveling. Only bummer: need scissors to open package.<br />Addendum: A couple of months later I stopped my automatic deliveries of these brownies because they were too good.  I could not stop at one which defeats the purpose of a 100 calorie snack.  I find it is easier not to have the first one that to stop after one.

review/text: I have to say that these brownies are very good for being low-calorie with fiber and protein.  I took off one star because I did not like the taste when warm, they are too fluffy, but when cold they taste chewier, like brownies - closer to the way they should taste when they are warm.  I also took off a star because the wrapper requires super-human strength to open it, and I don't generally carry scissors on me.  Being that these are packaged individually, I would assume that would imply "on the go".

review/text: I'm not sure what some reviews are expecting for 100 calories.  I got more than I expected.  The brownies are decently sized (around the size of little debbie brownies) and they taste dry and with a bit of sweetener aftertaste, yet they are decent to munch and take me a little while to eat.  The solve the dilemma of the chocolate craving as well as they last a while in my stomach so I feel full.  They are only about $1 each and my 11-year old and my husband both like them as well.  No, if I could choose between this and full-flavor 300 calorie brownies, I would not.  However, most people eat 100 calorie snacks because they can no longer do the 300 calorie snacks.  For my purposes, they are wonderful.

review/summary: Awesome Brownie - Guilt Free!
review/text: I was skeptical about these brownies before ordering. I ordered one box just to give them a try. I normally eat pure protein bars and they are OK as far as taste goes, main purpose is the protein of course. I wanted an actual treat type food without actually eating junk food. I was blow away by the Glenny's choc chip brownies. I only tried one so far but it exceeded my expectations and then some! Individual wrapped, in it's own tray, it tasted fresh, did not taste "healthy" like one would expect. It tasted like what a regular brownie would taste like, less that overly sugary feeling. Being all natural with an amazing nutritional profile really make this brownie a winner. It really is guilt free, 100cals, 12g carbs, 4g fat, 4g protein - I am not complaining and it fit my daily macros very well. I will be ordering another box or two.

review/summary: Broke my high calorie morning habit
review/text: In order to drop pounds I needed to cut down overall calories. I was addicted to Starbucks Chai (200 calorie) + Biscotti (160 calories) every morning. That was a significant chunk of my 1200 per day. So I switched to these brownies (lucky I found them at a local grocery store) saving 60 calories on my treat. Chai is another story though. I replaced it with skim milk and short chair. So my morning starts with under 200 calories instead of over 300. I have never missed my biscotti :). Highly recommend these. While they obviously don't taste like an authentic brownie (with all that protein and fibre are you kidding!). They are a healthy, chocolatey, moist, filling snack. Who needs real brownies anyways?

review/summary: Habit-forming.
review/text: These first started out as a plan of mine to help me taper myself off of real brownies and chocolate type treats. I love them because they are super moist and really satisfying. However, after discovering how they taste when you add them to plain Greek yogurt with a bit of honey on top--well, I feel like I invented a low-calorie, fudge-like cheesecake. So now it's a problem because I am totally ADDICTED to Glenny's Brownies!!!

review/summary: WOW. Amazing brownies!
review/text: I was looking for something low-calorie to satisfy my craving for chocolate with morning coffee. WOW IS THIS IT! These brownies are rich, moist, and very filling. They are also generously portioned -- sometimes it's hard to even finish an entire one. Basically, amazing. Next time I'm buying a case instead of just 12. These are a great way to give yourself a treat while maintaining your figure :)

review/summary: Delicious 'healthy' treat
review/text: This is certainly one of the most decadent "low fat/good for you" brownies made. I'm still not convinced this product has any nutritional benefit, but it is a great alternative to regular brownies. I much prefer this flavor to the other flavors Glenny's makes. I suggest trying it heated for 30 seconds in the microwave on medium power and finishing with a bit of whipped cream (I'm also thinking of adding a few cut strawberries next time). I will definitely buy again when sold by Amazon.

review/summary: Do not buy from Ozbo!!
review/text: I bought this item from Ozbo.  When I got the box, I saw the side was saturated and it was obvious that some of the jars broke.  I opened the box and there was NO PACKING WHATSOEVER.  They put the package of 12 glass bottles and a box and shipped it off.  Four bottles were broken and I was able to salvage 8.  Didn't bother to try sending back because it wouldn't have been worth the hassle, plus I doubt whatever carrier shipped it would not accept the box in the clearly saturated condition.

review/summary: it's all in the preparation...
review/text: Here's how to get the best results:<br /><br />1. Open the package and dump into a sieve and run under very cold water for at least 60 seconds to rinse away seafood aroma.<br /><br />2.Using scissors, snip the nooodles at least twice to create a shorter nooodle that is easier to manage.<br /><br />3."Dry fry" the noodles in a non-stick skillet until all the excess water has evaporated, the nooodles are now ready to absorb the flavor of your desired sauce, pesto, ragu, garlic olive oil, etc. like a sponge...<br /><br />4. Add your sauce and other ingredients and cook for at least 4-5 minutes to let flavors develop...you can't overcook these noodles because they are very different from traditional wheat pasta...<br /><br />5.  If you follow these instructions, you will get the best results, if you don't, you will have a watery, tasteless experience...refrigerate leftovers, do not freeze leftovers...

review/summary: Zero Weight Watchers Points Plus points!
review/text: These noodles are great! I use them for everything, including with spaghetti sauce. If you are trying to lose/maintain weight and are missing your pasta, this is for you. They are best with other toppings, sauces, stir frys, etc. because they take on the flavor of what you are cooking with. I sauteed spinach with 1/4 tsp of olive oil and garlic and the juices from the spinach mixed with the noodles - it was delicious. I am going to use them instead of egg noodles when I make beef stroganoff later this week. I agree with the review that these are probably best in Asian recipes but they can be used anywhere you would normally use a noodle or rice. These are ZERO weight watchers points. My plate of spaghetti tonight was 4 points instead of 14 points. How can you NOT have this as part of your diet? And I agree with the other reviewer - the fishy smell goes away once you rinse and flash fry. I buy this stuff by the case.

review/text: I LOVE these noodles. They remind me of cellophane noodles without the carbs and calories. They definitely absorb the flavors of whatever you cook with them and they fill you up. The initial smell of the noodles after opening did not bother me. The smell reminds me of fish sauce but as soon as you rinse them the smell goes away. I am doing Atkins and this works well with my food plan....HOORAY. NoOodle will be a staple in my home.

review/summary: Good for Low-Cal Mac & Cheese!
review/text: I made a mac-and-cheese substitute with these. My advice is - follow the package prep instructions and experiment. I rinsed them, snipped them into smaller pieces, dry-fried them in a green pan, put them in a bowl with 4 cloves of pressed garlic, added some garlic powder and onion powder.  I let that sit while I cooked up spinach in the same green pan.  When spinach was almost done, I put the garlicky noodles in the green pan and sprinkled that 4-cheese Mexican blend on top of them, tossed them 'til the cheese melted.......delicious! The texture of the noodles worked in this dish.

review/summary: NICE!
review/text: If you know how to cook, then it is definitely possible to cook these noodles in a way that tastes absolutely delicious and is quite filling. I imagine most of the negative reviews are from people that expect to top these bad boys with store bought sauce and be done with it... not the case. I like to saute a bunch or red peppers, tomatoes, and onions in spices until they are nice and soft with some moisture left over (I sometimes use curry, or fajita seasoning, definitely fresh garlic every time). Then add the noodles and simmer a bit longer... it's delicious! OR you can go the Asian route by sauteing leeks, onions, garlic, and snap peas (and/or any other veggies you like) in some soy and ponzu sauce, then add the noodles at the end and simmer a bit longer again. All these noodles require is imagination really. No you're NOT going to eat them with just salt and pepper and butter, but if you know how to cook they're great.

review/summary: AWESOME FOR CELIACS AND DIABETICS!!!!
review/text: First of all, you must rinse these "noodles" for at least 1 minute, drain, and then dry fry - throw the noodles into a non-stick dry heated pan and fry them for at least 3 minutes to release the water.  Add your favorite sauce, and unlike another review, I have used these noodles like pasta, only I put my sauce into the pan with the noodles and cooked for about 5 minutes. I have Celiac and these are a wonderful replacement for wheat pasta.  I have Diabetes and they fit perfectly into my diabetic diet because they are no carb, no calories!  I eat these noodles at least twice a week!  AND they passed the husband taste test.  My husband thinks they are awesome also!!!  If you are on the fence, try them.  If you follow the how-to cook them, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: NOT too good to be true!
review/text: I was a skeptic, but these noodles are great!  You MUST rinse very thoroughly in a colander to get rid of the fishy odor and drain well.  After that, just heat in a dry frying pay or wok. Keep stirring till the moisture no longer appears at the bottom of the pan. Then, just use as you would any pasta!  Great in soup, better than expected with spaghetti sauce and very good in a lo mein asian dish with vegetables and shrimp in a stir fry sauce.<br /><br />No, it's not the real thing, but a good choice if you are trying to cut calories and carbs.  I plan to try these with some of my other favorites such as clam sauce.<br /><br />One caveat - these are verrrry long, so you should cut them with a kitchen shear.

review/summary: Amazing Addition to Many Entrees
review/text: Anyone who already is used to eating "healthy' knows that there are some unpleasantries to get past on occasion with trying new things.  I happened upon this brand originally with a Groupon.  The taped together twin boxes contained so many packages of them and the expiration date was so short I had to get creative and use them in things I wouldn't normally have made so I didn't waste food.  The first time I was nervous with the smell, but rinsed for a bit and it quickly went away.  The noodles are almost clear so it does give dishes an unusual appearance when you are used to White or colored noodles.  The first dish I used them for was a Chinese Chow Mein, where I cooked the sauce with vegetables, and then after draining added the noodles to the sauce and let them season with the meal (rather than just normally spooning on top of the noodles).  I have a 5 year old and 9 year old that are picky eaters with new things, and I will tell you they ate every bite and loved it.  The next dish was the noodles drained and rinsed, put in a pan and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and pulled pieces of chicken.  Was great.  After that it was plain noodles, rinsed and drained, tossed in a pan with Smart Balance butter, diced garlic (from the jar), sea salt and parsley flakes, stirred them until hot and served alone as a side dish with brussell sprouts and sweet Italian sausage. Again, kids cleaned the plates and the plain noodles were AMAZING. I cannot describe the taste with just the garlic, salt and butter. I was not expecting to be that pleased.  I have used to make spaghetti, and now I will use them in anything with no exceptions. Have not tried other brands of the same yam flour noodles, so I can only speak on behalf of this NoOodles.

review/summary: The key is to remove yucky fish smell
review/text: When you first open this, it smells really yucky.  I almost always hold my breath when I wash this noodle.  But once you wash it away and add it to whatever flavor you want it to have, it will absorb the flavor pretty quickly.  One of my favorite way to get rid of the fishy smell is to boil it in water with bay leaves.<br /><br />The other thing I'm not crazy about this noodle is the texture.  It's got a bit of squeaky texture, but it doesn't bother me much if I cook it with lots of veggies.  When you chew it with lots of veggies, you don't notice the texture of the noodle itself anymore.<br /><br />I love noodles, and it's hard to cut it out of my diet.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with this zero calories noodle substitute.

review/summary: Wonderful, Guilt-Free Noodles
review/text: Yes, there is a slight fishy odor when you first open the package. Don't get a good whiff of it and it's not that bad. The Miracle Noodles (spinach version) was so horrible that it stunk up the house for days so these No Ooodles are nothing in comparison...trust me.<br />Here's what you do:<br />Get a good strainer ready. Open the package, dump in the contents, and give the noodles a good long rinse.<br /><br />I use only lukewarm water at most simply so I don't alter the noodles any before cooking them.<br />However, you want to get your hands in there. I cannot stand the stringy consistency (Miracle Noodles are by far worse) and discovered that by really washing the No Ooodles you can make them very similar to soba noodles in that they don't stretch as much.<br />When the noodles stop clumping together and doing that whole gross, stringy slip and pull thing they do (if you've worked with these noodles I think you'll know what I mean) then you're done. They should feel like limp, wet normal noodles now. Basically you've now washed all the "starch" from them. It's not starch, it's whatever it is that makes them clump and turn icky IMO.<br /><br />My favorite way to prepare these is turning them into ramen. Just be sure to cook them in the same broth or liquid that you cook your veggies and meat in. The more flavor, the better. I add sweet peppers, garlic, green onion, shallots, sometimes tomato, all sorts of spices, sometimes hot sauce, chili sauce, etc. They're really good and filling. You don't have a carb craving with these guys at all. And for me, it satisfys that urge to go bonkers with pasta. You know, you can have the entire bag and not feel bad about it. :)<br /><br />You can also "fry" them. Basically same as before but with much less liquid. The result is not crispy, but it does taste very good.

Order Bun or Pho with rice noodles. Hate 'em? Don't bother ordering any of this kind of noodle. Like them like I do, and this is an awesome substitute!

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: I drank this in Maui and really enjoyed it. Came here to see if I could order it. Rejoice! I could! At nearly $5 per bottle most people would think it's far too expensive for a simple drink! And I must admit it is. But ginger does have health benefits.<br /><br />If I could convey an accurate sense of how this drink tastes I would but it's not easy. I guess the best way I can describe it would be if you took a large piece of raw ginger, minced it up real good and put it in a blender this is what it would taste like. It's got a real strong ginger taste and it's very good. Not unpleasant at all.<br /><br />If you suffer from lack of energy like me (maybe it's all the rains here in Seattle), then this might be better than any Starbucks which will set you back at least $4 if not more. When you look at it this way, $4.50 per bottle really isn't that unreasonable.<br /><br />Packaging arrived in good condition. They really wrapped the case of Gingerade up very well in bubble wrap. It was well protected, heavy though. Took a while to ship, maybe it's coming from Hawaii? Haha, who knows?

review/summary: didn't realize
review/text: Unfortunately, I didn't realize this item is loaded with MSG.  If I did know, I would NEVER have made the purchase.  Since I have a food allergy to MSG, it compounds the health problems associated with MSG...

review/text: Was given this as a gift. Very tasty and light. This is a great snack to hold you over until the next meal. It does taste like a not too sweet cookie, but seems to be pretty healthy also.

review/summary: The 2nd Best in the Hostess Pantheon
review/text: I've said it before, I'll say it again - I'm a white gal who likes to throw her ample weight around!  I find these cupcakes to second only to the mighty Ding Dong when it comes to Hostess treats.  The chocolate cake is great, and the frosting is absolutely delectable.  Avoid the bastardization that is the golden Hostess cupcake.
