They are sweet and better than expected.<br /><br />I have not tried other organic raisin brands, and I lucked out. I will buy this brand every time I need raisins, and I will try this brand's cranberries and prunes too. I wish they offered more types, like cherries and blueberries and figs and apricots.

review/summary: Great raisins
review/text: Since grapes are on the list of things you should buy organic, I figured it was a safe bet that raisins would be included.  Local stores don't seem to carry these, so I was pleased to find them on Amazon.  I was very pleased with the quality of these raisins - fresh, sweet, no hard dried up ones.  No noticeable taste difference from the grocery store ones so my family liked them, and I feel better about giving them organic!

review/text: The first time I got these raisins from Amazon they were great -- plump, sweet and "smooth," the way raisins should be.  The second time, however, the raisins were like old or poorly stored raisins -- more grainy and not nearly as moist.  So I give the first batch five stars and the second batch two or three stars.  Who knows what you will get.  You pays your money and you takes your chances.

review/summary: These are the best raisins on the market and I understand this is a totally subjective statement
review/text: Our local supermarket chain was recently bought by another large grocery chain and so far they are not carrying Newman's Own organic raisins. I didn't think it mattered until I started buying other raisins, organic and non-organic, and discovered a myriad of flavors in the raisin world. I did not know there could be so many different tastes from raisins and none of them anywhere close to the delicious flavor of the Newman's Own. Since taste is very personal, I am sure each reader of this review has their own opinion and raisin favorite. I applaud whatever raisin is your choice to love. This is my choice and it has to do with juiciness, and a subtle sugar flavor and many raisins in each can and definitely that this company shares its profits with charities. I am very happy that I can buy them on Amazon with a subscription and I don't need to care if my local grocery stocks it.

review/summary: Average raisins
review/text: I like raisins.  I eat them by the handful or in cereal or cookies.  Even with ham sometimes.  But, it seems, a raisin is a raisin is a raisin - no matter who packages them.  After all - a raisin is a dried grape.  These are good raisins but they taste no better than grocery store raisins.  Actually, I was a little disappointed.  I'd read many of the reviews here and expected something wonderful like little bursts of sunshine with each bite.  What I got was a good raisin.  Right now I am eating some while I re-read some of the glowing reviews and listen to Peggy Lee singing, "Is That All There Is?"<br /><br />The price is not great but it's not bad either.  It's Paul Newman so that's a good thing.  They're "organic" but I'm still not sure why that's important.<br /><br />Average

Where I live, finding the small round Mexican limes is difficult, and even if you have them on hand, you've still got to cut a wedge out, and the rest is wasted if you're just having one. Enter Twang. It gives the beer the right flavor with a couple of shakes, and it's easy to carry along.

review/text: Sweatleaf Liquid stevia is a must for any one who enjoys flavoring their ice tea.  The apricot flavoring is a great way to make your favorite drink sweet.  I started using it because it was a chemical sweetener and it was also one that does affect blood sugar.  This a great product that goes a long way.  The only thing you must keep in mind, is to use very small amounts and work up, it is much sweeter than sugar.

review/text: This had an "off" taste for me.  I could not even tolerate the smell - even with the bottle unopened I could smell it.  I guess everyone's taste is different.  I'd rather have plain seltzer and water than to add this to it.  I gave it 2 stars, because when I added it to iced tea, it was tolerable. Still would prefer plain stevia and a bit of fresh lemon or orange juice in the tea rather than to add this. This was a waste of money for me, because it went in the garbage.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Ordered two sets of  "SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia, Apricot Nectar, 2-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)"<br />  First order came with broken bottles as the big air bags they used for padding in the shipment was deflated.  Told amazon and they sent out another order, got it in 3 days.<br />  This time the big air bag did not deflate but the bottles were all next to each other with NO padding between them.<br />  In the future they SHOULD wrap EACH bottle in bubble wrap, then put in box with the big air bags.<br /><br />  I have ordered many things from Amazon and this is the first problem I have ever had and they took care of it better than I expected.<br />  Will continue to order here.

review/text: For me, it's great being able to buy natural treats for my dog that also taste great.  My dog loves these (and I like them, too).  I've made dog biscuits before, but it's convenient to be able to pick some up at the store.  I've tried a number of natural biscuits, some good, some horrible.  These are great.  I've never bought them in bulk from Amazon, but the biscuits are inside of a sealed plastic bag within the box, so I'd guess that they would stay fresh for a while.

review/summary: Product has changed for the worse over the past months
review/text: I have been buying Blue Dog Bakery, Peanut Butter and Molasses dog treats for over three years. My dog did love them, but since the recipe changed he won't eat them any more. I noticed that they didn't smell the same and that each individual biscuit was harder than rock. I thought they were old stock or stale and returned them to the super market where I bought them and got my money back. I tried them again from a different super market and found out the old and stale smell and feel of the dog treats was in every box I bought. I returned them all again. I went to the 'wonderful and friendly' Blue Dog Bakery website and contacted them by using their web form email for contact with the company. I wanted to find out why they ruined a wonderful product. The website claims that they will get right back to you regarding your comments and concerns. Haven't heard a word from them to this day. How is that for great customer service? I have gone back to good old dependable Milk Bones and my dog is happy and I'm actually saving money rather than buying those stale over priced dog treats from Blue Dog Bakery.

review/summary: Great Snack
review/text: We found the Blue Dog snacks in a catalogue, but could not find them locally.  I did find Amazon had the flavor Phantom likes the best.  I order a large quantity because my buddy receives 3 every afternoon.  He greets me at the door, and of course I rub him and talk to him for awhile.  THEN I ask Phantom if he would like a cookie (Blue Dog Bakery Dog Treats - Molasses & Peanut Butter).  He tears off into his room and sits and stares at the box until I am in the room.  I pull out one large and two small cookies.  He gets so excited that he is dancing all around.  He knows he has to sit before he gets a snack.  He will take the snack and run into the other room.  There he drops the cookie and comes back for another one.  This continues until he has all three cookies.  When he gets all three snacks he will lay down and eat them all.  His eyes light up when you ask him if he would like a cookie.  Blue Dog makes other flavors of snacks, but Phantom really likes the molasses and Peanut Butter ones the best.  I can't explain how much Phantom loves his Blue Dog snacks!

review/text: My German Shepherd Nyla will sometimes even turn her nose up at a piece of Ham or Steak but goes crazy for the Blue Dog Bakery Peanut Butter & Molasses Biscuits.  It was such a relief to find a snack that was good for her and that she enjoyed so much!  If you have a picky dog then this is a snack you will want to explore.  I have shared these biscuits with everyone of my friends who have dogs and they have all come back with the same report....My dog just loves these biscuits, where did you get them?  They cost a little more than regular dog biscuits but are worth every penny when you know you are giving your pet something that they love and is good for them!  Buying them on line at Amazon.com using the Subscribe and Save offer has saved me quite a bit of money and is very convenient and easy to use.  I highly recommend using this service.  Take a chance your dog will love you and you will be very satisfied with the product and service!

review/summary: Declining Quality
review/text: I've been ordering these treats for my dogs for a few years now - they really liked them. The cookies were not only adorable, but apparently pretty tasty. Recently, though, the last few boxes I've bought have contained nothing but broken remnants of the advertised shapes of cookies that don't even have the cute outlines on them that originally distinguished them from each other. Additionally, the cookies look overcooked and are very hard. Plus - they no longer have that fresh baked smell to them. I really am disappointed in the quality control from Blue Dog Bakery. For the amount of money I spend on these, I expect consistency to the quality. I guess I need to find another low fat treat alternative for my furry family members.

In the last few years I have gotten cases (6 boxes) that had all most all burnt cookies.  The company replaced them.  The latest purchase (with the new logo) are now back to the ones I liked in the past.  I like that they use human grade (I have ate them myself) ingredients.  My dogs just love them.  Wish I could buy boxes of the small cookies (hearts and squares) I have small dogs and have to break the larger ones into smaller pieces.

review/text: These treats are around $6-8 a box where I live, so the price on Amazon is great! I bought a case of six mid-November, and my dog is finally on his last box. He normally goes through a $10 bag of Beggin' Strips in a week, so we're saving a LOT on doggie treats.<br /><br />As for the flavor, my dog will eat just about any treat, but he seems to be more excited about these than most hard treats (he usually prefers soft ones). I like that they smell good, unlike some similarly priced treats, which seems to reduce stinky doggie breath (and I'll admit it, I tasted one... wasn't too impressed with the flavor, but they're not for me!).<br /><br />The only downside is that some of the treats are HUGE, but they can be broken up into smaller pieces.

The vet said Benji had too much fat in his food [he only ate dry dog food and a table scrap once in a while] so now he eats a low fat dry dog food, NO TABLE FOOD and these great low fat treats. YES they are big, so break them, yes they are hard, good for tarter control. But I must mention Benji only gets a portion of one biscut per day if he does his tricks like rollover sit and bang your dead...It took some time to find a low fat treat that Benji would eat..BLUE DOG WINS!

This is their bedtime snack and we have no trouble getting them to go to their bedroom (which they graciously allow my wife and I to share) and ready themselves for the night.  Once, when I ran out of Blue Dog Bakery treats, I tried to give them an alternative.  Goliath disdainfully threw this "alien" snack on the floor as if to say, "If you don't have my regular snack, I'll just pass tonight."  It is a bonus that these snacks are low fat.  Our precious four-legged children just love them.

review/summary: A High Quality Dog Treat at a Reasonable Price
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILEITA">Blue Dog Bakery Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Assorted Flavors, 20-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]<br />It is a healthy and high quality treat for your dog(s) if given reasonably--anything in excess with a treat for dogs is something you should avoid. The price is reasonable...especially if you purchase it from Amazon in automatic shipments. However, if you do, beware that if you make changes in the quantity there is a high probability of error and duplicate shipments.

review/text: These dog treats where just as promised by Amazon. The price saved some money from purchasing this item at stores in my hometown. I was pleased with the delivery time as well. I will order this item again when I need more. Our black lab loves these and will perform many tricks for one of these treats.

review/summary: Dog Treats
review/text: I've purchased these in the past.  My three shelties really love them.  They have a scent of gingerbread to me.<br /><br />I often heat them for about ten seconds in the microwave.  That softens them and I think brings out the flavor.<br /><br />I will continue buying these.

review/summary: Love the bisquits, but sorry only mixed in stores now!
review/text: I have been buying these peanut butter/molasses dog bisquits for several years now, but can only find the two "mixed" varieties in the grocery stores (mixed meat flavors and mixed cheese and meat flavors).  My dogs get diarhhea from these other mixed versions - I know it's the cheese flavors and maybe the liver...) My only complaint in buying them from you, is that I had to buy 6 boxes at a time.  Please tell the groceries that it is ok to have mixed versions in the store, but not to forget loyal buyers like me who want only the one kind!!  Thanks for making such a good product that I would go to great lengths to contine them for my beloved pet.  Susan

review/summary: favorite treat by far
review/text: Since these treats are sized generously, I break each one up into 3 or 4 pieces for my Cavalier King Charles, and keep them in a plastic container in our pantry. Cooper LOVES them! Each time we tell him to "kennel up" (go to his crate) he eagerly waits in the crate for his treat. In fact, at bedtime, he stares at me until I've opened the pantry door. Then he takes off to his crate with no urging and waits for his treat. For us, there is no question that this is a good purchase and have a regular subscription to keep them in stock!

review/summary: BEST DOG TREATS EVER!
review/text: These treats are definitely my dogs' favorite.  They gobble these up and have started turning down other treats.  They come in fun shapes and when you open them up, they smell just like peanut butter.  They smell so good, I've been tempted to try them.  The ingredients are wholesome and natural and I feel good about giving these to my dogs.  I just wish more came in a box.

review/summary: Blue Dog PB&M
review/text: I have been purchasing Blue Dog's PB&M for my cocker spaniel for three years. He is an American Cocker with an allergy to poultry and poultry by-products.<br />Blue Dog has been the perfect solution and Ozzy looks forward to his cookie every evening after his walk.<br />I also enjoy the wonderful molasses smell of the cookies. So they provide enjoyment for both of us.

review/summary: crack treats for dogs
review/text: I started buying those for my dog a few months ago. my dog loves them so much that he will do anything to get one of them. he learned so many new tricks because of them.<br /><br />one funny thing about them is that he gets a treat every time he goes outside to do the deed, I noticed in the first few days we started giving those treats that he asks to go out every 20 minutes or so. I thought the treats were giving him problems only to find out that he asks to go out so he can those treats when he gets back. he even lefts his leg to pee and nothing comes because he peed so many times earlier.

review/text: These are really great treats for the dog. They are healthy and natural. I was fortunate to get these on sale. I have a small stock saved up at home. When I first opened these the dog went crazy. His nose was high up in the air trying to figure out where the whiff was coming from. These treats range from small to big. They come in different animal shapes. They look so good that I even felt like trying one.

review/text: My two dogs love all of Blue Dog Bakery Treats. They prefer them to other treats and seemingly can't get enough. The natural ingredients are very impressive and I don't feel guilty giving them by-products and ingredients I don't understand. I especially like that they are produced in the US. Blue Dog Bakery also has a very nice newsletter, if you wish to subscribe. I highly recommend this product.
