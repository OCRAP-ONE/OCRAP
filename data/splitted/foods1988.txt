review/summary: Perfect Every Cup
review/text: Since I must have my morning cappuccino it is important that the coffee be full bodied and consistant.  This blend is perfect every time.  Illy is known for being the best but I've got to say that for me it is a tie.  Can't be without my Lavazza.

review/summary: Great product if you buy from good retailer
review/text: My wife bought this from the Wolf Mercantile reseller here on Amazon.com and we had a terrible experience. They messed up the shipment and were very difficult to get ahold of to straighten things out.<br />This Lavazza Espresso is some good coffee though. It provides a nice robust flavor while being smooth on the palate. I drink mine straight in shots and the wife mixes with it into Lattes. We both love the flavor and think its a good change from the brands found in our local grocery stores.

review/summary: Excellent Espresso!
review/text: I have tried many different brands of espresso over the years, this is the best of the best. It has a very rich flavor, slightly bitter, but not too much. And the aroma, it makes the entire house smell fantastic! I use a stovetop espresso maker, as well as a DeLonghi espresso maker. The Lavazza comes out perfect in either case. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone.

review/text: I found this ground espresso while living abroad in Germany; I spent countless mornings sipping this divinely smooth nectar on cold European days.  There is no better, for the money, espresso.  It was the most widely consumed espresso in Germany and this price beats the price I was paying for the same grind by >$1.30.  Sit back and enjoy this supremely blended elixir.

review/text: This case of 4 is the perfect blend of flavor, taste, convenience and price. I had been buying ground espresso from the grocery, but always bought the cheapest off-brand they had. Then I discovered this 4-pack and the subscribe & save program, and I am very pleased. The Lavazza blend is delicious. I use a Bialetti 6-cup Moka pot qAM and each can lasts me about 2 weeks (perfect for a subscribe & save shipment every 2 months).

review/summary: If you're using Moka Express... This is the best coffee.
review/text: Before two kids, I had been drinking Starbucks or Coffee Bean iced lattes for over 15 years, spending up to $4 per medium-sized drink (depending on whether or not I'm getting soy milk or half-and-half). Unfortunately (or fortunately, for my household finances), my morning runs to Starbucks or Coffee Bean came to an abrupt halt when the kiddos came along -- I just couldn't run out the door anytime I wanted to get my fill for the day.<br /><br />So I've since had to resort to making some at home on my own using the Moka Express, and this coffee has got to be the best out there for all types of home-brewed espresso coffee drinks. I personally think this makes far better coffee than Starbucks or Coffee Bean or any other huge chain coffees for that matter, and I have been raved many times by family and friends for serving "the best coffee ever" (not to mention the fact that I have been saving a lot of $$$ doing so because an 8-ounce can makes about 20(!!!) "grande"- or medium-sized lattes. Really well worth the money. :-) Amazon's price is really awesome because this same can can cost up to $9 at my local Whole Foods ($6-8 at other supermarkets)...

review/summary: Great Espresso
review/text: Need I say more than the title extends? I have a little Delonghi espresso machine in my Apartment and it makes great espresso with this Lavazza product. The crema is smooth and thick. The espresso is smooth as well and never bitter.<br /><br />The one thing I warn about is the packaging of the canister. The only sealant is a flimsy plastic lid, which won't keep your ground espresso fresh very long. I have been reusing an Illy container from the espresso I was using before this which is much better crafted for maintaining a tight seal on the canister and the freshness of your grind. You can also get a well sealed container at Target or something like that on the cheap.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: Great espresso without breaking the bank
review/text: I've been an Illy advocate most of my life having worked in an espresso bar for several years where Illy was served exclusively.  I brew coffee in both my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2BU3Y">Saeco 30013 Aroma Traditional Espresso Machine, Stainless Steel</a> and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> and Illy ground has always worked well.  Still, this Lavazza four-pack is less than half the price of Illy, so I decided to give it a go.  Using both methods, the Lavazza produces a delicious full-bodied cup of coffee.  I still prefer Illy slightly, but I will relegate Illy to times when I want to spoil myself.  Lavazza is the better choice for an everyday espresso for me.

review/text: First of all, i don't know WHAT people who drink illy are talking about, because ive been using lavazza for a long time now, and i find illy way overpriced, and totally inferior to lavazza. There is a reason that lavazza is italy's favorite, and i believe it. As far as the review goes, i mainly use it in a 1 or 4 cup moka pot, but i have brewed it in a drip pot, pump espresso maker and also in a mukka express which all make one heck of a smooth and delicious cup of coffee. I do agree with other reviewers, that it would not be for people who regularly drink starbucks/etc but if you learn to appreciate it, it is consistent, and will never let you down. I hope you love lavazza as much as i do<br />-Ciao!

review/text: This is excellent coffee at an excellent price.  Very nice flavor and strength.  The only annoying thing is the 8 oz. cans come about half full.  I suppose it wouldn't sell well if they used smaller cans, and the price would seem to high if they put a full pound of coffee in the can and doubled the price.  It's a minor distraction from otherwise great coffee which I've been drinking for years now.

review/summary: Brings the coffee shop experience to your kitchen
review/text: I make my espresso using a FrancisFrancis x5 as my morning wake-up shot and it never fails to do the trick. Both the quality of the crema and slight sweetness in the pull rivals any professional coffee shop, and it works equally well for cappuccinos too. I tend go through about one can a week (yes, you can imagine what I'm saving at Starbucks), and the coffee stays perfectly fresh in the aluminum container.<br /><br />I've bought this particular brand in the retail stores for years and only just discovered the pricing on Amazon is about 40-50% less when you buy the four-pack. The other brand I really like is Illy, but it's over twice the price and I'm not enough of a coffee connoisseur to notice the difference.

review/summary: Best for authentic Italian espresso
review/text: My Italian cousin-in-law recently taught me how to make real authentic Italian espresso and cappuccino and Lavazza is her first choice over all other brands.  It is so rich and smooth and I have to agree after we ran out of Lavazza and went hunting unsuccessfully for more and ended up buying two other brands.  No comparison as there was such a difference in taste.  I threw out the other two cans and went hunting on the internet that night and found it the cheapest on Amazon (my favorite place to shop on the Internet).  Anyway, signed up for the subscription service and LOVE it.  Just about when I was on my last can of Lavazza, here comes an e-mail notifying me that Amazon was about to make another shipment.  Perfect timing.  Love, love, love this service.  By the way, my husband is a die-hard Starbucks fan (very strong coffee) and likes his best as a blend of Lavazza and Starbucks.

The grounds are a little fine so I have to use a little more to get a stronger espresso shot.

I will be ordering more or try others once I'm getting down to my last can.

review/summary: Lavazza Caffe Espresso Black Short Version -(add to cart now!) Long Version -(read my review)
review/text: A little background on me first:<br /><br />I've been drinking coffee for about 10 years (started early).<br />I'm a college student on a budget, but when I'm going out with friends I'll have Starbucks and Caribou Coffee (more on that later).<br /><br />My current coffee setup is:<br />Mr. Coffee Pump Espresso Machine ECMP 50<br />Cuisinart Coffee Maker DCC-1200<br /><br />  About a year ago after reading Laird Hamilton's book "Force of Nature" I was inspired to switch from drip coffee to espresso, along with eating healthier.  He says he sometimes drinks up to 8 shots per day. So I bought an inexpensive espresso machine (listed above), and started drinking espresso in the morning.<br />  I noticed a difference in my body (along with eating healthier my entire system just seemed to be running better).  However with the espresso something still wasn't right.  I've always heard how espresso or even coffee should be smooth and rich, but coffee/espresso I've always made or had at Starbucks did have a kind of "burnt" taste to it.<br />  BTW-VERY IMPORTANT--The coffee/espresso I was using was currently using was:  Folgers Black Silk, Starbucks Brand, and Target brand.<br />  Now on to the review...<br />  Ok I was a little hesitant about buying Lavazza at first.  I read some reviews online(not just on Amazon)and they were pretty favorable. So I bought a can the other day at my local Whole Foods --(Lavazza Black Label $7.99).<br />  I noticed right away that this was better espresso when it was dripping out of the machine, because it looked like black syrup (yum). Then I tasted it...OMG WOW!  I never knew that coffee/espresso could be so flippin' smooth & rich.  I mean wow!  It's crazy to think that for like the last ten years I've been drinking "burnt" crap. & That 5Buck Burnt Crap is expensive! The only problem is I don't know if I can ever go back to any other coffee/espresso.  Buy Now!!<br />If anyone has any other espresso suggestions please post!<br />also check out my youtube channel: cpthemonstergamer (it's game videos and video game stuff)

review/summary: Bitter!
review/text: I had high hopes for this coffee based on the reviews but was let down.  I picked up a can of this to have on hand incase I ran out of fresh beans for my grinder and I'm glad that I didn't get the 4 pack!  Perhaps I got a bad batch since the reviews here are mostly positive but I found this to be incredibly bitter when making espresso in my Rancilio Silvia.  I varied my dose, tamp, extraction time and temperature but nothing got rid of the horrendous, bitter/sour taste.  After several unsuccessful attempts I pulled a shot using my fresh ground beans to see if I was doing something wrong and had a great shot right off the bat.  Go figure.  On the positive side the grind is fine and even enough for an unpressurized portafilter.  This stuff may be fine for other brewing methods, I didn't try them, but I can't recommend it for espresso unless you really like bitter shots.  Perhaps I just like a darker roast, in the end I tossed it as I was unable to brew a drinkable shot.

review/text: This is a perfect match for a moka pot. The grind is fine enough for a good extraction, but not so fine that it chokes the machine or yields a bitter, over-extracted flavor. It is smooth and rich, with a hint of sweetness to it. As with most Lavazza varieties, it is a medium roast, which is the traditional Northern Italian style.<br /><br />I usually drink decaf and buy whole beans. But, I keep a can of this handy for when I want a caffeinated cup or for guests. Highly recommend if you have a moka pot.

And, as she experiments, she is finding out she can use less of Lavazza to give her a strong cup (and she likes it strong!)  So, it is really comparable in price with lots of other brands.  You have my wife's endorsement regarding the product's quality, and mine, regarding the product's pricing.<br />And, Amazon as usual is great to do with business with.

You see - coffee comes from plants, while humans control the processing part of it- we hardly have any control over the quality of beans a coffee plant produces.<br /><br />Lavazza seems to have mastered the art of tasting and selecting the best beans, roasting them to perfection and presenting them to us.  First time I tried Lavazza was in 2002 and 10 years on - this still has to be the best coffee I've tasted - it never failed to impress me.<br /><br />Forget about your Folgers, Melittas ... and even Starbucks - they are good - sometimes on and off.  But Lavazza is one brand which I can confidently buy and savor.

review/summary: When I think coffee, I think of this
review/text: I started drinking LavAzza when I was working with the Italian's as a subcontractor back in the mid 90's in the middle east. After lunch I would have one espresso to pour over my cup of ice cream, and then I'd have a regular american size cup of coffee of espresso after that. I never had problems staying awake during the afternoon. Predominantly we drank the black can version in the middle east. I didn't come across other versions until several years later.  If you want to compare it to well known brands, I'd say its close to Starbuck's Italian, but slightly richer, fuller and definitely smoother. In comparison to the inexpensive Puerto Rican espressos you can pick up in Publix (among others stores) in Florida, it doesn't have the slightly burnt flavor of those brands, but isn't quite as intense either.<br /><br />In general none of the LavAzza brands have that over the top, slightly burnt flavor I associate with French roasts. If you want a rich, smooth espresso or cappuccino, I think LavAzza is the way to start, just remember to make it in a proper espresso maker. I've used the standard stove top Bialetti stainless steel espresso maker for the last 10 years It does a good job, and will last indefinitely.

Even though this had good reviews, I wasn't even positive what I was expecting from it. Me and my girlfriend decided to pop on an espresso machine, so this is my first endeavor is making it at home. I can't comment on what else is out there. And i'm sure if you have a nice grinder, and use whole beans, your experience might be even better. But I have to say this has been excellent. Even the smell of it from the moment you open the can is wonderful. If you want great tasting espresso, and you're not sure what to buy, this is the perfect starting point... You will not be disappointed.

review/text: Visiting my son in Italy, I had Lavazza cappuccino with him every morning, and found it a very superior coffee.  At home, I sought it out, found it at Amazon, and have used it ever since.  It is versatile enough to use for regular coffee or for espresso and cappuccino, just varying the amount of the fine grind.  Vigorous enough to survive my heavy use of milk and sweetener, and not to be bitter when drunk black, this is an all-around coffee for all tastes.

review/summary: makes bad espresso, very good drip
review/text: that's my experience, anyway.  I usually ground fresh for espresso, but it can be nice to have some pre-ground on hand as well.  So I got 4 cans of this on AMZ, started putting it through my Gaggia espresso machine and was very disappointed.  The espresso just had an overpowering bitterness that hasn't been present in the Illy pre-ground stuff I've used, or in any of the whole bean varieties I've bought.  Mind you, I tend to like a little bitterness in my espresso, which is why I usually seek out lighter and medium roasts to use -- but this was too much, very unpleasant.  After several tries, trying to adjust several variables in case my espresso technique was somehow at fault, I gave up, and started wondering what I'd do with these 4 cans of coffee.<br /><br />Then I thought I'd try running it through my Bunn drip machine.  I came out with a great pot of coffee!  Tastes like the same coffee, obviously, and the bitterness is still there but it's very much in harmony and balance with the other notes in the flavor profile.  It's good enough coffee at a good enough price that I will probably buy it again...just won't let it anywhere near the Gaggia.

review/text: We have been using Illy and Lavazza exclusively, also Alessi is okay.  We recently tried another much cheaper brand and after being spoiled with this, the other brand tasted bitter and terrible.  We are considering just throwing away the other brand and getting more Lavazza.  We also like Illy although considering the cost Lavazza is our choice hands down! I believe we learned a lesson **beware** once you try the superior brands such as Lavazza you can never go back to the cheaper brands, the old saying you get what you paid for.

review/text: I bought an espresso machine a few years ago and wanted to find the right coffee for me.  I read up and researched the reviews and found that Lavazza is #1 in Italy.  So I figured they should know their stuff about espresso.  I was right on!  This coffee is not bitter in the least, but has a rich full flavor that's deliciously smooth going down.  I have tried other brands to see if I can save money with a cheaper brand, well that coffee is sitting in the cabinet still and I go back to Lavazza for good reason. I like to ad coffee mate hazlenut cream in it with chocolate cinnamon sprinkles and wowsers do I love the mornings on my deck with my coffee.  Don't be afraid to spice it up the way you like it.  I was paying a lot more for this coffee at a popular international store.  Im saving alot buying it here, which makes it taste that much better to me LOL.  Great for dipping your favorite cookie in or even better a good biscotti.

I am hoping that is was simply a quality control problem, but I am going to wait a while before  buying any more.

Coffee makes me jittery, but I love the aroma and the taste, so I am forever searching out the best cup of rich, smooth, and bold decaf.<br />On a recent trip to Los Angeles, a couple of girlfriends and I took a road trip out to Death Valley to a music festival. A friend of mine plays in the Evangenitals.<br />Not much of the trip was what I would call relaxing or easy. 105 degrees during the day and drunk youngsters up all night in our campgrounds.<br />By the morning we decided that we would try out the little cafe before making our 4 hour trip back to L.A.<br />That is where I discovered Lavazza.Not decaf Lavazza, just regular Lavazza espresso. It was the most beautiful flavor...so rich and so incredibly smooth. I knew better than to have more than one cup as I figured I would be sweating and climbing the walls of the truck on the way home.<br />I think that I ended up having 3 refills, so that would make it a 4 cup morning. To my suprise, I felt great,no jitters and a lovely ride home to the City of Angels.<br />I now get auto ship from Amazon so I am sure to never run out!

review/summary: Strange Taste
review/text: I really hoped I would like this espresso, the main reason being that I just can't take the financial assault that Illy Medium Roast puts on my monthly budget.  With that being said, I found this to have a cardboard-like, slightly bitter taste.  I was hoping to reproduce the rich, nutty taste that I get from a pull of Illy.  Perhaps there is another Lavazza product which will fare better.  I use a Saeco Classico, so if anyone has some advice, I am open to it.<br /><br />EDIT: For anyone in a similar situation, I found Lavazza Qualita Rossa to be much more comparable to Illy Medium Roast.  Still not quite as good, but I'll take 4 bricks/$22 dollars over $13/can any day.

review/summary: Great for coffee, less so for espresso.
review/text: I normally buy my beans from a local roaster, but after seeing this on a gold box deal I decided to try it.  Since its in cans, I figured it could make a good substitute when I run out of fresh beans.<br /><br />The can says it can be used as "coffee" or "espresso" with some guidance on how to use it for each of those.  I've tried both.<br /><br />Made in a regular coffee machine, you use half of what you normally would.  Its already ground (and superfine), so its easy to use.  The coffee is rich and never bitter.  Very pleasant.  I like it.<br /><br />However, as espresso, its not so good.  I've tried it from 2 different cans and the espresso has an off flavor.  Granted, I usually use beans that were roasted "recently" (often, they were roasted the day I bought them, and used about 2 weeks later) and then I grind them immediately before making espresso.  So it could be that I'm used to better beans, but, this is so-called premium so I don't think my high expectations were foolish.  The lavazza espresso had very little crema and a licorice aftertaste that was not advertised and not welcome.<br /><br />I've since read other reviews of other lavazza roasts and this licorice taste is obviously common with them.  I'm not a big fan of licorice.<br /><br />Anyway at around $10/lb "normal price", the price is higher than my local roaster charges per pound.  I would not buy this product unless its on sale.

We contacted Amazon<br />they sent us new ones, but still no expiration date.<br />We contacted them again, they contacted the importer<br />and said that they won't be able to provide expiration<br />date for the teas.<br /><br />We consume a lot of tea and buy from all over the world.<br />This was the first time we came across a packaged tea with<br />no expiration date and these teas are produced in Germany.<br /><br />So, buyers be aware these teas might have been produced<br />who knows when?

review/summary: Good Healthy Treat
review/text: These treats are one of my dog's favorites.  They are very hard and made from two good ingredients, chicken and brown rice.  According to the bag, there are no other ingredients such as gluton or preservatives.  I like to break them into two pieces (although difficult to break).  It takes my dog (small mixed breed) several minutes to devour one.  Good for his teeth and low in fat.

review/text: This is the easiest way to fix a REAL LOUISIANA gumbo I have ever seen. I am from Louisiana and know how to do it all from scratch, but I will never do it again after using Chef Hans mix.  If you just use chicken broth for a base, the flavor is FANTASTIC.  It works great for seafood or chicken and sausage.  If you use can broth, you can be finished within 25 minutes from the time you start.  I prefer to add a few more vegetables (celery and onions) and let it cook a little longer.  THANKS CHEF HANS!!

review/summary: Chef Hans is great!
review/text: I have been using Chef Hans' gumbo mix for about ten years after finding it in New Orleans on a trip there one time.  The trick with this mix is to use Chicken Stock instead of water and to add chicken, andouille sausage and/or shrimp.  I've used homemade chicken stock and the store bought stuff.  Either works good, but the addition of sauted sliced okra and cajun/creole seasoned chicken and sausage on top of an ice cream scoop of white rice makes for a great and hearty winter time meal.  The best part is you can make the whole dish in about 30 to 40 minutes.  I've had lots of gumbo at cajun restaurants and this is as good as any of them.

review/summary: My cats really Like
review/text: I have a difficult time finding Beef foods to offer my 5 kitties, as most of them are just not liked! But they do like this one which has chicken added and eat all of it every time I offer it. I do not give this on consecutive nights as they do tire of it, but if given as often as every other night, they eat it all.<br />They always have kibble available, and are fed wet food in the evening, which is the high point of their day. This food fits in very well with my food rotation of 6 cans per night for the 4 inside kitties. (The outside kitty is feral and gets 5.5 ounce Friskies: 3 tins per day), so he is not in on the rotation. He does get this as a treat sometimes and eats it right up.<br />So, al 5 kitties, give this 5 stars. "thank you" say: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy and Yellow Kitty.

review/text: I think these vegetable bouillon cubes are great.  Each individually-wrapped cube makes two cups of vegetable broth.  Since the cubes are soft they mix easily into water.  My only problem with them is that I can no longer find them in local stores and I have a couple recipes that use these cubes.  I've tried "Better Than Bouillon" vegetable bouillon but found it was nowhere near as good as Knorr.  And Swanson's boxed broth gave my rice recipes a darker color than the Knorr cubes did.

review/text: Knorr Vegetable Bouillon is my favorite!  I'm just upset more stores don't carry it.  This is great with rice, soups, pretty much any savory dish to give it an extra kick of flavor.  Of course it is high in sodium, it is a bouillon cube!  The people who have given negative reviews could have saved themselves a lot of time, by checking the ingredients label.  I wonder if they also complain about the sodium level in salt?

review/summary: Next Best Thing to "From Scratch"
review/text: I usually make my own chicken stock from scratch, but sometimes what I've got on hand isn't enough to fill the pot. When that happens, this is my go-to bouillon. It's also great for when you get to the bottom of a big pot of soup, and it's super thick. Adding a little of this vegetable stock can stretch out that last bit without sacrificing flavor. I've tried a lot of different chicken bouillons, but none of them have the wonderful flavor this vegetable one does. This is also the only bouillon I will drink straight, when I'm feeling sick. It's delicious!<br /><br />The sodium in this is comparable to other bouillons, and MSG (in some form, frequently listed as "autolyzed yeast extract") is in pretty much every canned soup and stock out there. Very few people are actually sensitive to it, or they would have gotten sick every time they ate Campbell's soup as a kid. But they see the scary letters and get alarmed. It's just silly.<br /><br />While I do think you should try to keep processing foods like this to a minimum because of the high sodium levels, a little bit here and there won't hurt you. Fast food and processed meals like TV dinners and Top Ramen are far worse. Practice moderation in all things and you will be fine.  :-)

review/summary: Agreed...bad ingredients
review/text: I recently switched to a vegan diet. I was at a store that had no other options than Knorr's for vegetable bullion, so I bought it. I didn't pay attention to the ingredient list, which I should have. I made a soup, and then next morning I woke up swollen like a balloon and feeling totally lethargic. I couldn't figure out what I'd eaten that would create such a terrible response-tomatoes, fennel, salad and onion should not cause any problems- and then I thought about the bullion. So I checked out the ingredients on the bullion, and I should have known it would contain MSG (if you aren't scared of MSG yet, go google it). So if you don't like MSG and you don't like getting about 50% of your RDA in sodium in one meal, don't use this bullion.

These bouillon cubes contain not only an inordinate amount of sodium but MSG as well. And then as an added bonus they threw in some hydrogenated oil. WHAT are they thinking when they pump this garbage out and box it up? Hey Knorr - if we all end up too sick to work from eating this kind of so-called food, we won't have any money to give you. If your conscience won't cause you to use wholesome ingredients maybe the thought of losing out on sales will.

review/text: I am slowly coming out of the worst ordeal after a very unrestful night as the result of eating Knorr's Mexican Rice. It was extremely high in sodium and I had to drink almost 12 glasses of water-to no avail. Even my sleeping pills did little to help me sleep. The label in the back of the package indicated it had only 670 milligram of sodium. Trust me, in reality it had probably five times more than that. It all happened because I ignored my friends' warnings and succumbed to its lower price than other brands. Because of the above experience, I do not recommend this product to any one even my enemy!

I have to say, I've been very happy with how they work for me.

It may have been training breakthrough, it may have been strictly pyschological, but after I started snacking on the beans at the 1:45 mark, I started sustaining pace, and have actually been able to knock out my last mile on the same pace as my opening mile.<br /><br />Of course, not garunteed to work for everyone, everyone's system processes these things differently, but for right now, I'm believing in the magic beans.

review/text: Ever since I started marathon running I've been searching for a calorie supplement. Ive tried the gels, goos and cubes but was never satisfied. The cubes are too big and its hard to breath while chewing them. The goos and gels are just too dessicating, its like putting peanut butter in my mouth and I need to get something to drink to wash it down.<br /><br />The jelly beans are the best yet. They are smaller making it easier to breath while running. they do not dry your mouth and they also taste good, aways a plus. They provide 100 cals per pouch and contain no caffeine.<br /><br />That said it is not the perfect product. The package can be difficult to open while running and occasionally a few beans drop out as you are trying to negotiate them out of the bag and into your mouth. Also they should make a variety pack. 24 packs is enough to last me a month and I prefer to buy only one at a time. The same flavor, while good, can get a little boring. They have other flavors, a variety pack should not be too hard to make.<br /><br />Enjoy your exercise!

review/summary: Distance Runner in Love!
review/text: As a marathon runner and lover of long distance, I've found my match. Lemon-lime Jelly Belly Sport Beans are really one of the best electrolyte products. I just stick them in my pocket and without a lot of fuss (or pace change), I can grab them on the go. Many sport nutrition "candies" are nasty tasting - when you're exercising you can somehow gulp it down. But the Jelly Belly Sport Beans are actually good whether exercising or not! Conveniently, they come in a resealable pouch that keeps extra beans fresh and secure when bouncing around.

review/summary: Very good!
review/text: I've tried several flavors and the orange is really quite good. Sweet and sour and they really do give you energy but don't make you feel "jumpy" like the caffeine drinks. Highly recommended!

review/summary: doesn't melt in the sun!
review/text: I've been living and riding in Florida for 6 years and came across Sport Beans as a great alternative to PowerBars, Gels, Blocks and Gu's a few years or so ago.  They are great.  Not a ton of energy - only 70 - 100 calories per pack, but they restore some electrolytes and they don't make a mess of your pockets or fuel packs.  Sport Beans hold up in the heat of summer and that is a great thing!!

review/summary: These taste awesome, and do the job!
review/text: After trying GU gel (which made me gag), I decided to try these beans. The watermelon flavor was awesome, no fake taste like the gels that I've tried. They go down as easy as regular jellybeans. Do drink with water though to prevent stomach upset (it tells you that on the box). I haven't had any problems with them at all, as long as I drink water. They give me the most energy of any I've tried, plus caffeine -- which I really need before a run (as I don't usually drink my daily coffee before running). I would definitely buy these again!
