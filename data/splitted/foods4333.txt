review/summary: One bite and you'll become a "chippoisseur"
review/text: I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

review/summary: YUM! If you want a snack, have something REALLY good!
review/text: I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Spicy Thai
review/text: When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.

review/text: Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.

review/summary: My favorite Kettle Chip
review/text: These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.

I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review/text: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

review/summary: Great Tasting Chips
review/text: After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips, Sea Salt
review/text: There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.

review/text: I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...

The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!

If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!

I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

review/text: These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!

review/summary: Crunch. Wow!
review/text: Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.<br /><br />This is an excellent product!

review/summary: Great strong flavor
review/text: I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

review/summary: yummy for your tummy
review/text: The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy. Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips.

review/summary: Best Chips Out There!
review/text: These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

review/text: and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.

review/summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/text: We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.

The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less "natural" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: All the ones I've tried taste pretty good, and are low on calories.  I haven't noticed any attributable effects from the drinks, other than the Neuro Sleep.  It seems like the Neuro Sleep actually works, but I would be careful to not drink it in the early AM, as I have noticed it makes me tired for longer than 6 hours (or I could have just been hungover!).  Overall, these are good-tasting drinks that won't hurt your waistline.  The Neuro Sonic tastes like a flavored San Pellegrino, not overpowering, still light and crisp.  Oh and finally, my mother told me that the Slim actually reduced her appetite.  I wish they were a bit cheaper, but I may still order another variety pack.

review/summary: Good drink, really works
review/text: I tried the neuro sonic by accident in my local drug store and really liked it.  So I decided to try to rest.  The neuro sleep really does just that help you sleep and the bliss leaves you feeling euphoric.  I recommend this product because they all do what they say.

review/summary: But...these things NEVER work! (Testimonial)
review/text: I started seeing these drinks on sale this  summer and I rolled my eyes when I saw the words NEURO GASM printed across one of the bottles.  That killed it for me.  I was not interested in what the other bottles might say.<br /><br />Last week, I went to visit a friend at work. There was a Nuero-drink display in front of the cash register, and the representatives seemed very friendly, so I thought I'd sample the beverages. I was only being polite, though. It would have been incredibly rude of me to just ignore them. That is the ONLY reason I sampled the drinks. As I said before, NEURO GASM killed it for me. How many stupid products have put GASM, or some other facsimile, in the title in order to make a sale? I wasn't going to endorse more stupidity.<br /><br />Since rest is a novelty for the busy student, I decided to purchase the Neuro Bliss and Sleep while the representatives were still there.  If they were in any way rude or pushy, I wouldn't have bothered. I sipped the Neuro Bliss on the way to my following engagement, and as per the reps' warning ("Half a bottle does it") I didn't drink the Sleep until I got home that evening.<br /><br />I sat down at the computer and started chatting with a few out-of-state friends and my husband, who was also out-of-state. I opened the bottle and started absently sipping, as I would the ever-present glass of water on my desk. Nobody was curious about what I was drinking (through virtue of Google's Hangout) until I said, "Whoa...I need to stop drinking this." I was halfway through the bottle, and my head started feeling heavy. Upon inquiry, I showed my friends the bottle and they looked it up. Being the geeks we are, they recited the ingredients and laughed, "Of course this is going to make you sleepy!"  I retaliated, "I didn't read the label because this stuff NEVER works!"<br /><br />Well, I've found a drink that works. I've since also tried the Sonic and Sun with positive results. Maybe I'll give the Neuro Gasm a go. ;)

review/summary: sucralose sweetener
review/text: These are sweetened with crystalline fructose and sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda). If you're sensitive to the taste of low-calorie sweeteners, you won't like these. The drinks are too sweet. I was hoping for the same kind of refreshing taste you get from mixing a splash of fruit juice with seltzer, but it turns out to be just another cloying soft drink, only with supplements added. The ingredient list should be given on the Amazon product page, but it's not.

review/summary: Interesting products, but no results from 2 types
review/text: I've tried Neuro Trim and Neuro Bliss prior to my shipment and felt an effect from them. The other two, Passion and Sonic, I felt nothing from.<br /><br />Wasting money on products that do not work is an unfortunate mistake on my behalf, but receiving the next shipment without ANY Neuro Trim OR Neuro Bliss (contrary to the assortment purchased) means I have to give these 3 stars. I now have two cases of Neuro Passion and Sonic instead of two cases of assorted flavors. Quite unfortunate, really.

review/summary: bought it for the packaging - use it b/c it works
review/text: I'll admit it, I initially bought these because of the packaging. The design indicated to me that the makers believe they have a product that is truly different, and I think they're correct. I've tried all of them and ordered more. They all do what they say they do. Here's how I use them. Have a Sonic with lunch, it puts the kibosh on the afternoon crash, which I experience as not being able to focus on work. It's not buzzy -- it's a lot like 5 Hour Energy only tastes like Knee-Hi Strawberry soda. Bliss is awesome. I don't even know how to describe it. I've kept these at work, and when things get crazy and I want some "me time" I have one on ice. It's wonderful. You just have to try it. Trim is nice to have at dinner if you're a night-time snacker. Sleep is the one I've got the least use for, but have tried it after staying up too late on task. You know how sometimes you get wound up and find it difficult to sleep when you've been working, reading or just puttering around the house? It totally takes the edge off that. I'm far from being an insomniac, so ymmv.<br /><br />I do have to get something cleared up -- on my second purchase they sent no Trim and twice as much Sonic. Not cool, Neuro. Hopefully we'll get this taken care of.

review/text: Absolutely love this stuff! It really does work without any of the crash associated with most energy drinks. Neuro Bliss helps my kids and myself foucs. My wife is losing weight with the help of the trim and the sonic (for energy) and the Neuro Sleep is great. I travel a lot with frequent International trips and it is tough to adjust to all the frequent time zone changes each week and the Neuro Sleep really helps me get a very restful sleep and reset my body clock. Just wish that the delivery option offered "Every 2 weeks" instead of only one shipment per month. "Every 2 weeks" would help spread the cost out over paychecks. Love these drinks!!

review/summary: You don't get what you would assume
review/text: The variety pack is advertized as 12 bottles of three varieties.  With no other information, I believed I would get three bottles of each variety.  Instead I received three bottles of Bliss and Sleep and six bottles of Sonic.  Trim was left out entirely.<br /><br />Now Amazon has their standard disclaimer that what is shipped may differ from the pictures and descriptions.  While this makes it legal, it doesn't make it right.  If you're out of something - send a message and ask what the customer wants substituted.<br /><br />Overall the product has good taste, though Focus is a bit of an acquired taste, is lightly carbonated, and works pretty much as is described.  There are other brands that have stronger effects, but if you prefer a more gentle approach, this is your product.<br /><br />One other note:  while most consumer plastic recyclable, the caps usually are not.  Even my powdered baby formula has a recylable tub (#1) and a non- recyclable cap (#5).  These bottles use quite a bit of plastic by an ecology activists stanard - but they are 100% recyclable from tip to tail.

review/text: Sooo I really should be a spokesperson for this product! I am a HUGE fan!!! I don't know how but all these drinks do exactlly what they say! The sleep is definitely my go-to when I get home late and have an early morning and don't have time to unwind. I get into bed and sip on this and 30 minutes later I had better be ready to slip into a coma because I am out!!!! Unlike sleep aids though you aren't groggy in the morning, just had a great nights sleep! The bliss is another favorite. For me it feels like I'm on the gas at the dentist it's very relaxing and I get smiley. I like the lean also and my husband drinks the sonic. Love this product!!

review/text: I bought these drinks at a corner store in SE DC for 2.25 a bottle and bought it once before at a grocery store in southern MD for 2.50.  I thought the pricing fair. However buying it on Amazon at 36 dollars for a 12 pack seems a bit much I thought it was cheaper when buying directly from the source?! Maybe I am wrong I guess those who do not have access to it in a store near them would pay that much.  But as for the drinks they are awesome. I have had at least 1 of each kind my fav being Neuro Sun taste something close to a Pina Colada lol

review/text: A friend told me to try neurosleep since i have trouble winding down at night. I ordered the variety pack to try the sonic and bliss as well. I loved all four and they all worked amazingly. The sonic gives you a decent amount of energy with now drag or crash afterwards. The sleep helps you fall asleep quickly and if you portion it right for your body size you won't feel woozy in the morning either. I always wake up feeling completely rested as well. Bliss just helps get you out of your funk and trim helped my mom lose a few pounds without crash dieting.

review/text: So far I am quite pleased with Neuro Sleep and Neuro Sonic. I tried out Bliss and it seemed to try and work, but maybe I should drink more of it to get the full effect. I gave only four stars because no neuro gasm, sport, or aqua in the variety pack. But I also don't understand why is it more expensive on Amazon and cheaper to buy at the local stores? it is usually the opposite when it comes to being cheaper on Amazon. I would of continued to buy at the local stores, but it is always sold out. The last time I start saying something works and all of a sudden people start buying it. lol

I didn't fall asleep on the sleep one. But I didn't think it was goign to work,as melatoin just doesn't work for me. And as far as the trim goes,it probably would have it I had more than just 3.

review/summary: made me gag
review/text: A friend praised these to the sky and I read the reviews here at Amazon, which were mostly favorable, so I bought this 12 pack of mixed flavors and I am really and truly sorry. The taste of "Bliss" was super sweet, cloyingly so, it tasted kind of like flat Fresca and I couldn't finish the bottle even poured over ice. The Sonic was even worse. It has a taste and smell like you get when you smell vitamins, and not the cute fruit flavored ones. One sip and it was poured down the drain. Here's the thing, I ordered this stuff based on a friend's recommendation and didn't try it before buying, how stupid is that? These were on sale at my local Safeway so I picked up a couple of bottles, Bliss and Sonic, to try before my shipment arrived, hated them and was going to refuse the shipment from UPS but it got dropped off when I wasn't looking so now I am stuck. The packaging is unopened, yet I cannot return this to Amazon so I am out money and to make matters even sadder, these are cheaper at Safeway than on Amazon right now. So, folks, save your money, do not buy these!

review/summary: Item received is not what is on photo
review/text: Tea received is a cheaper version of Ito En's green tea, not the 1st crop type shown in the photo.  Very misleading, and very unhappy with this.  Don't want to deal with stupid return system with Amazon, have no time for it.<br /><br />Do not recommend buying this at all.

review/summary: I hope no one is buying this crap!
review/text: Ok. First I just have to say that Meaty Bones should be a dog owner's staple, my dog LOVES them... but the problem is with these companies who are selling their products! I mean really? This was originally priced at $80???! For ONE bag???? Then marked down to 10 or 11 something. Jee, they aren't trying to trick people into thinking they are getting some awesome deal and make profits at the same time. Then the buyer gets the product only to find out it is one 6lb bag they could have bought driving pretty much anywhere that sells dog food and buy it for the already 'discounted' price! That is what is costs, not $80!!!! I am so fed up with these companies inflating the cost of their products and then 'deeply discounting' them to boost sales and make the consumer think they are getting the best deal ever. I mean I realize they have done that for years and years but I feel like over the 2 years it has gotten way out of control. And don't even get me started the the free shipping BS (not amazon prime but other companies) where if you return the product they deduct the original shipping from your refund. Shipping was never free, you paid for it in the inflated price of the deeply disocunted product!!! uhg this should be against the law!!!!!

review/summary: Crisp and Crunchy Kernels
review/text: Great to eat even as is -- just pour from can to dish.<br /><br />Try adding this to pancake or corn bread batter, Indian Pudding and even.... for the more adventurous -- bread pudding. Also wonderful in stews and soups.<br /><br />Del Monte canned Corn has always had, for me, a distinctive, recognizable flavor that I enjoy coming back to year after year.<br /><br />If sodium is a problem, there is always the low sodium version, which, to me, has even more crispness and crunchiness.
