review/summary: Our favorite Hamburger Helper variety
review/text: This is a fall-back in our house for dinner when we can;t decide what to eat, or just don't have anything good in the house. In all honesty, we probably eat way too much of this stuff, but this variety is really, really good. Does it actually taste like lasagna? No, not really. But it is good, with rich, bold flavors and pleases our taste buds. Its also filling without being too heavy, and we're not hungry again two hours later like with some meal options.

review/summary: Expiration dates way too soon!
review/text: I decided to stalk up our emergency food closet with a lot of different Hamburger & Chicken Helpers because they are so inexpensive and I have tons of ground beef and chicken that I've canned in there already.  However, unless you plan to use these fairly soon don't buy them as some of the expiration dates were as little as a couple of months away.  Very few had dates as far out as 6 months.  If you plan to use them soon and regularly then go for it but they are not a good idea for a long term emergency food storage.

review/summary: Sauce...will...thicken...sauce...will...thicken...
review/text: I remember the first day they began marketing this particular Hamburger Helper variety. I remember it well. I remember I couldn't sleep the night before, due to my overwhelming anticipation to taste this new variety. I ended up sitting on the sofa in complete silence until my local supermarket opened up at 9:00.<br /><br />Got home in a hurry and went straight for the hamburger I had defrosted the night before, and without a split-second worth of hesitation, I ripped the Hamburger Helper carton asunder. When the pasta is finally cooked, they tell you that the "Sauce will thicken as it stands."<br /><br />Well, this is where my story gets interesting. I had become simply fed up with the man getting me down with all his rules and laws..."psssht," I thought. "I'll eat my Hamburger Helper HOW and WHEN I want, and no one will tell me otherwise. I have since decided to take a journey of introspection, wandering the country, a lone vagabond with only one desire--to eat the very BEST of boxed dinners. You just might see me in your neighborhood park one evening, sitting down to enjoy a tasty meal of Hamburger Helper prepared on my trusty camp stove. You're welcome to join me.

review/summary: Best Turkey Jerky that I've tried
review/text: I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there.

review/text: I'm a really big fan of the Jack Link's peppered beef jerky, but it can be hit or miss with the freshness. This stuff was pretty good though. I think the Jack Link's has a better taste due to more flavourings (the secret is in the soy sauce they use, I suspect) where this has a cleaner beef taste which some might like more.<br /><br />I think the beef strips in this brand are a bit too thick, but maybe that's just me.

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness. Too much sweetness for me.

It tastes so good that once I open the package, I eat the whole thing. It has a sweet taste that I can understand might be overwhelming to some, but for me, it's perfect.

review/text: Having had Jack Links jerky for a while I picked up this brand during one of Amazon's deals to try it out. While it is nice and the smokey flavour works well, there is a much sweeter flavour to it than Jack Links brand. Personally this puts me off this brand a little although others in my house do like the sweeter flavour.<br /><br />So it really depends what you want in your Teriyaki jerky and if you like it sweet or not.<br /><br />The jerky pieces are a good size though, they definitely give you some big jerky.

review/text: I've always liked adzuki beans, but whenever I've bought them in bulk at various stores, they tend to be poor quality, with many rocks that have to be sorted out, as well as a few shriveled up beans here and there.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried these adzuki beans by Arrowhead Mills, because they're much better quality, but still at a reasonable price.  Every package in the case was fresh, and although there were a couple of pebbles in one bag (which is why you should ALWAYS sort dried beans before booking them, no matter what brand they are or where you got them), they were excellent over all.

review/summary: Good for Red Bean Paste
review/text: I used these to make red bean paste to fill "pancakes" for dorayaki.  The beans worked very well!  However I am still working to perfect my recipe.  A few things I plan to try next time...<br />1.  Only use 1/2 the bag at a time.  I originally used the entire bag and after soaking the beans overnight and starting to boil them, the expanded so much that there was not enough room in the pot I used for them to heat/cook properly.<br />2.  After cooking, draining and running the beans through the food processor I will mash the beans through a fine mesh strainer to remove the bean skins and produce a finer paste.  I did not care for the bean skins in my first attempt.<br />3.  Use a cheesecloth or several paper towels to strain any additional water that may remain in the beans after mashing them through the strainer.  The first batch had too much moisture.<br />Overall, these worked well and are much more cost effective than purchasing pre-made red bean paste.

If I had one criticism, it would be that there isn't a variety package available, but that isn't really a fault of this product specifically.<br /><br />I will be buying more candy from Albanese in the future no doubt.<br /><br />As a side note, at first I thought that these were somehow associated with Albania, but this is not the case. They are made in the USA.

review/text: I ordered these when Amazon was out of the peach rings, because like I said in that review, I'm addicted to them.  The peach are still my favorites, but these have a real good sour cherry taste as well, and arrived soft and fresh.

review/text: Not much to say about this this candy. If you like gummy rings, and the flavor cherry, it taste awesome. However I guess I can add one more thing about these. They are very soft gummy rings. Unlike the gummy rings you can find in a candy store, they might've become quite stale or slightly hard, these are very soft and delicious out of the bag. Make a note that when you order these, it comes in 2 fairly large bags, equaling 9 lbs together. Its really a lot of candy, so its a great thing to bring to work or parties to share.

review/summary: Pricey and not very satisfying.
review/text: It's probably been 15 years since I had a peep, so about $6 (with free shipping from Amazon, or .01 with shipping from the 3rd party sellers) for a package of 12 was a small price to pay to try them once again.  But once is enough at that price point, they're not bad tasting but you can eat a whole package in about 2 sittings and they're really not that satisfying.  Buy the big bag of jumbo marshmallows for less, eat two and you're full, those will last weeks.  These will last a day or so.  Okay for reminiscing childhood, but costly for a regular treat.

review/summary: Good decoration, awful snacks
review/text: Yes, these Peeps have been around forever, but I do not know how they have managed to survive when nowadays there are way healthier, and equally as fun snacks. The main ingredients are sugar, corn syrup (they do not use the "high fructose" now), and colorants. Nothing very good for children's health, plus they do NOT taste good. Sure, their colors catch everybody's attention, but most people (children and adults) will put them down after a couple of bites. The one star is for their decoration merits. They indeed cheer up any Easter buffet table.

review/text: I am so glad that Amazon carries this in Prime now. We've been buying from petsmart which is both expensive and inconvenient. I really hope that let me subscribe and save at some point in the future!<br /><br />Regarding the product, this really is the best cat food. My cats' coats are beautifully soft and shiny, they have a good level of energy, and I honestly think it helps with shedding.  We recently adopted a second cat, who was being fed purina pro-plan. his coat was gritty and he shed like crazy, he was slightly overweight and kind of sluggish.  after about a month of avoderm, his coat became as soft as our other cat, lost the gritty texture, he lost the weight and has enough energy to keep up with his new friend. the kitties are healthy and happy - i won't feed them anything else.<br /><br />also, i concur with the other review about the salmon flavor, my cats didn't really care for it either.

review/summary: Oh, poo!
review/text: Our cats ran to their bowls to try their first bits of Avoderm dry food, properly mixed in with their regular fancy kibble. Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little brains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.<br /><br />Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down.

Anyhow, I blend it with frozen rasberry and blackberries and use milk instead of water (learned it from the coffee shop) and the outcome is delecious. My children also love it. If you want a YUMMY smoothie try this brand and add some extra berries and milk.

review/text: I was introduced to Big Train, Smoothie Blast, by a friend who owned a Juice & Sandwich cafe here in Phoenix.  I went to his cafe from time to time and conversated about how gross my protien shakes smelled and tasted.  He told me to bring my protien powder in and that we would do some testing. So I did and we starting mixing and tasting. When it came to Big Train Smoothie Blast, it tasted so good and there were no signs of my protien powder - no smell, no gagging taste, just sweet tasty strawberries.  We liked it so much we tried all flavors that Big Train makes and they were all tasty and delicious.  Ever since that day I have been using Big Train Smoothie Juices.  I strongly recommend Big Train Smoothie Blast. My favorite is strawberry.

review/summary: By far the best canned eel brand
review/text: I've tried several dozen roasted canned eel varieties over the years and keep coming back to this one. It is one of the best. The color, flavor, texture, consistency and sauce balance is just right. The texture is firm and delicious and just the right amount of sauce, with a tiny bit of bite due to the added capsicum. I usually dump the can over some rice and top off the bowl with hot water, making a kind of rice soup. It's quick, easy, and filling. When I have a little more time, I roll this into a sushi roll with some avocado and cucumbers. Tong Yeng also makes a black bean variety and it's also excellent. I like that one even more than this.<br /><br />Made in Taiwan. No artificial colors or preservatives. 262 calories per can (126 from fat), 42% calcium USRDA (US Recommended Daily Intake)!, 716mg sodium (30%). Contains MSG. Steel can, needs can opener. Tong Yeng make a ring-pull version also.

review/text: These are great! I send the kiddos off to preschool with one every day. They love them and consider them a treat, and I love the fact that they're getting some veggies at lunch. They're very picky eaters who normally don't eat veggies unless I'm right on top of them, urging them along. You can get these at the grocery store, but they're about a buck fifty a pop at my local market. Shop wisely on Amazon and compare prices--you should be able to get them for under a dollar. Still a bit steep for some mashed up food, but I think it's worth it to keep a steady stream of veggies in picky kids' tummies.

review/summary: A great healthy snack to keep around for the kids
review/text: These have become staples in our house.  I first picked up the "Blueberry Blitz" from our local super-market, but the only other flavors they carried were "fruit-only".  I really liked the fact that you get at least some veggies in these (albeit a few places down on the ingredient list).  So I came to Amazon and ordered "Carroty-Chop" and "Beetbox Berry".  So far the kids (boys aged 4 and 6) love them.  They are an easy snack to throw in the lunch box or to take on the road.  I also like that they have a long shelf life and they are certified organic by the Oregon Tilth, one of the more stringent organic certification agencies.<br /><br />Here are the ingredient lists since I don't see them on Amazon:<br />Blue-Berry Blitz: organic apple puree, organic blueberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic purple carrot juice, organic lemon juice<br />Carroty Chop: organic apple puree, organic carrot puree, organic mango puree, organic orange juice, organic lemon juice<br />Beetbox Berry: organic apple puree, organic strawberry puree, organic carrot puree, organic beet juice, organic lemon juice<br /><br />They are all 60 calories and have 11 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I've also taken to buying the "Peter Rabbit Organics" which have more vegetables mixed in with the fruit and are a little larger.  My kids prefer the Mashups, but they also like the Peter Rabbit brand, so I just have a big basket of them all mixed in and I grab what makes sense.  If we've dined out and they didn't get a lot of veggies I give them a "Peter Rabbit" for bedtime snack.  If I'm just adding a little something to their lunch box I'll throw in a Mashup.  It does help keep the kids away from the junk food, particularly at snack time.  A great tool in the "trying to feed the kids healthy stuff" arsenal.<br /><br />And to be honest I've been known to grab one when I need a quick snack.  They taste pretty good, and it's better than grabbing cookies or chips.

review/summary: Good portion size, nice crunchy soy nuts!
review/text: I love soy nuts as a snack. Crunchier than other nuts (even though they technically aren't) and with less flavor so you taste the salt more, they can be addictive. I don't care for other soy products (tofu - yuck!), so if you're the same you might still want to try these. A bag of these is officially two servings, but I'd actually consider it one largish serving, which comes out at 220 calories, 10g fiber and 16g protein. Not bad.

review/text: These are very crunchy with a saly taste.  I could use less or no salt, but the family likes them.  My son is allergic to peanuts so these are a great alternative when making cookies.  I made a peanut butter cookies recipe using chocolate soynut butter and added some of these soynuts.  WOW!  Excellent.  Plus, made in a nut free facility.  We will have these on hand from now on.  I also like thier other products as well.

review/summary: Bob, could you PLEASE use a FINER grind?????
review/text: I have been baking gluten-free on a daily basis for approximately 3 years.  Believe me when I say that I have tried just about every brand of Brown Rice Flour there is.  Here is the skinny:<br />If you want a very tender, melt in your mouth baked good that is reminiscent of your wheat flour days, use Authentic Foods Brown Rice Flour.  Their BRF is so fine that it is almost silky.  If you bake as much as I do, and want to use Authentic Foods BRF for everything, you should look into getting a second job.  That stuff is PRICEY.<br />If you don't want to get a second job, Bob's Red Mill BRF is the way to go, but your baked good will suffer a bit due to the sandy, gritty texture of this flour.  Through trial and error, you will find that it works fine for some recipes, but others may seen a bit more gritty and crumbly.  Processing this BRF in the Cuisinart or blender doesn't seem to help.  So, I plan to beg Bob to choose a finer grind for the BRF his company produces.  PLEASE.  Pretty please?  I would love you forever.

review/text: I've been ordering this rice and also the Bob's Red Mill Organic White Rice Flour through Amazon's subscription for several months now. I couldn't be more pleased.  Bob's Rice flours are finely milled so there isn't that gritty taste in your foods.  I order at least 2 cases of each a month and I've never had a problem with any of my flours and all those I've received have been labeled "organic".  Would love to see Amazon offer Bob's Sweet Rice Flour and their White Bean Flour, too.

review/summary: Coarser than Regular Flours but Good Value, Convenient Packaging
review/text: This is priced a few dollars less than at store, and the 24-oz packaging makes it easy to keep your flour from going stale too quickly. The automatic reordering option is great, too, so you can get an additional discount and plan on your next shipment.<br /><br />If you are making recipes using Annalize Roberts', "Gluten Free Baking," she mentions this brand is too coarse for most of the cake recipes (but OK for pizza dough.) I bought some white rice flour from the Asian store and you can definitely feel the difference. The finer ground flour felt like regular flour, and Bob's Red Mill had a slight grittiness to it.

review/summary: Ok, but too gritty for me
review/text: It is a litle too gritty for me.  I think this product can work well if you mix with glutinous rice flour and corn starch.  If you want to use all brown rice flour, then super fine brown rice flour works so much better.  The only problem is it is way too expensive.  I ended up borrowing my mothers grain mill, to make my own brown rice flour.  The only problem is I have to run it through 4 times to get the grittiness out of it.

review/text: I go through flours awfully quickly, since I'm on a gluten-free diet and do all my own baking.  This is good flour.<br /><br />I'd hesitated to buy brown rice flour other than from Authentic Foods, given the praise for Authentic Food's fine grind in one of my favorite cookbooks.  However, now that I've tried this (much cheaper) brown flour, I really don't see much difference.  It's now the only brown flour I use.

review/summary: the answer to being allergic to wheat
review/text: I don't know what they did to wheat. I have been eating bread for over 60 years and love it. All of a sudden I started having trouble breathing and spent nearly $5000 on doctors and drugs. Diagnosis was Asthma, though none of the $300 per month drugs worked. Then I heard a segment on NPR about a guy with similar problems and his solution was to stop eating wheat product which was hard for him as he came from a family of bakers. Within less than a week he felt better, much better. I tried the same thing and within three days two years of misery were over. Now I stay away from breads, but if I don't, it only takes about an hour and my lungs hurt again.<br />Is this some more genetically modified grain of which the public remains uninformed? Also, so much for doctors and their diagnostic abilities.<br />This rice flower is a great substitute for wheat and if you look, there are some excellent recipes.

review/text: I have a pup with wheat sensitivity so I've always used Bob's Organic Brown Rice Flour to make her some "cookies".  Not only does my pup love it, but I made a big bunch of biscuits for all the family doggies for Christmas, and not one of them turned their nose up.  Easy recipe for pups with wheat sensitivity...2 cups rice flour, 1 cup peanut butter, 1 cup milk.  Roll it out, cut it (I used R & M Dog Bone 4 Piece Cookie Cutter Set from Amazon, but I've also just cut it with a knife too).  Bake 10-15 minutes at 350 degrees.  That's it. This is a great product!

It has a slightly "different/strange" taste to me but, since it is Glutten Free, I am willing to give it a chance and hope that my taste(s) will change and adjust. I will probably buy again, because glutten free is difficult to find in my area. Worth giving a chance...plus it is ORGANIC, which I love.

review/text: I bake gluten free with several different flours, brown rice flour being the one I use primarily. It can become very annoying to constantly drive to the store paying more than necessary. You basically get wholesale price when you buy on Amazon (I have Prime so it keeps the costs down and shipping quick). Another added bonus is that the brown rice is organic which is a lot more expensive at my local stores. Now if only Bob's Red Mill had sorghum flour and others on their Amazon.

But my wife likes to assemble ingredients without making a big mess, and this flour is very convenient.  It comes in 4 separate packages, so you don't have to expose all of it to the air at once.  The company makes a number of organic products, including several that were useful for gluten-free baking.  The product is excellent and the shipping was prompt.
