review/summary: A great mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack
review/text: This "cookie bar" reminds me of a thin strudel. It is soft, but somewhat crisp, with a flaky consistency. I find it just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />The blueberry filling is good -- it isn't very moist or gooey, like a jam. It tastes like blueberries and isn't unnaturally sweet or blueberry.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, this is perfect for me. Each bar is 100 calories. Fat is extremely low at only 1.5g. Sodium is a little high at 115mg (5% average daily value). Dietary fiber is a good 2g (8% of average daily value).<br /><br />In general, I like these with either my mid-morning coffee or my mid-afternoon tea. They are a good compliment with either. It's the perfect pastry-like treat without all the calories of a traditional pastry.

review/summary: Crunchy with Blueberry
review/text: These bars are crunchier than I expected. With the soft fruit filling, the cookie bar is definitely crisp.  I thought that the filling has a nice blueberry flavor, but could be a little less sweet.  The cookie part could benefit from some oats, other than just the ones in the topping.  Pleasant and tasty enough, but could be a little more substantial.  I suppose for 100 calories, they have to be a bit lighter, so pretty good.

review/summary: Very tasty, crispy, and the blueberry jam is good, too!
review/text: OK. Now these I like! Individually wrapped, very good insides, crispy outsides, not too sweet, not too crunchy... just good stuff! These lend themselves to lunches, though I've been eating one about a half-hour after I've put in my daily workout. Very good.<br /><br />ADDED after reading other reviews: I do not find these dry at all, and the filling is just the right amount for my taste. The tops do seem to be collapsed a bit, but what the heck? In you mouth they collapse all the way!<br />Ho, and if you want to know what a dry cookie is, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH8M">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>. Those will dry you up like the Sahara!

review/summary: Crumbly dome
review/text: ****<br /><br />You have to take this product, Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6), for what it is.  It is not a Pop-Tart, which is bigger and more thoroughly filled with the fruit-like substance these two food-chunks offer.<br /><br />The product under review is airy, more like a small Nerf ball than a large marble, although it is in no way spherical or useful in any games.  I was surprised that the filling did not fill the shell.<br /><br />Because the filling does not fill much of the shell much of the shell does not abut anything that's more liquid than solid, like blueberry jam compared to blueberry paste.<br /><br />****<br /><br />CRUMBLY<br /><br />Because of that much of the shell is so dry that when you take a bite of the top of it it tends to crumble rather than tear, more like a potato chip than a potao knish.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that the typical consumer of this product cannot eventually figure out the exact measures necessary to figuring out how to eat it without spilling crumbles but I am saying there's a reason you don't see the manufacturer, Quaker, bragging all the time on how many thousands of these bars they have shipped to the International Space Station over the years where I'm pretty sure weigthlessness and the susceptibility to encroachement by crumbits into the various electronic and mechanical devices is considered more dangerous than that same degree of encroachment in the backseat of your car.<br /><br />Or even the front seat.<br /><br />****<br /><br />PACKAGING<br /><br />The package of my Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6) is interesting.  When viewed from above, the shape is not a rectangle as you would expect.  Said another way, the horizontal cross-section of the box of almost every such product, and literally millions of others, is a rectangle whereas the cross-section of this box is a parallelogram, i.e., the opposite sides are parallel but the corners are not square.<br /><br />Below is my best representation of a parallelogram, where you should observe the only the stars and not the dots, but it might not turn out right in the final version of this Amazon review.  If it doesn't ignore it.<br /><br />**********<br />.*...............*<br />..*...............*<br />...*...............*<br />....**********<br /><br />This is interesting because the curious mind wants to know why this package is different from so many others.  There must be a reason the experienced and highly paid people at Quaker made such an unusual decision.  I claim it's for one of two reasons, but it if you learn that it's for some other reason, I hope you'll take the ime to leave a comment.<br /><br />It's either because the package's odd shape was expected somehow to attract more buyers than if it were rectangular or because the shape somehow protects the bars inside from getting crushed as much during packaging and transport and shipping.<br /><br />I think it's the latter, because when the box is on a shelf in a store it looks from the front like all the others.  Not until you see it from the side or the top do you realize it's not rectangular as, as I say, so many other of its shelfmates are.<br /><br />I am not enough of an engineer to undertand exactly why this parallelogram shape would prevent the individual bars from getting crushed from the bottom big surface up more significantly or from the top big surface down more significantly but I'm convinced that's the best explanation.<br /><br />****<br /><br />This product did pass my hungry-dog test in the sense that PheyeG'hdeaux ate every little crumb or chunk I dropped onto the floor where he eagerly watched me eat the bar.  My dog is always really quite extremely eager to eat anything that might possibly be food.  He will happily partake of cat poop and dead squirrel and even broasted plamplams.  It's not much to say that this food product, Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6), passes this test, but the fact remains that it does.<br /><br />It probably also goes without saying, but when you duct-tape one of these bars to a stick of dynamite and detonate it, the bar is entirely disintegrated and no identifiable pieces remain within a radius of 10 yards, including any blueberries.<br /><br />Despite my curiosity about and possible admiration for the box's shape, I award this product only 4 stars, and the reason is its flatulence, by which I mean how flat the filling is relative to the higher top crust of the bar.  If you want this "crispy" this is it, but I don't.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Update of August 10, 2012<br /><br />Bernadettes's comment got me to thinking there's more to say about the box's extremely uncommon shape.<br /><br />One thing is that storing it next to more normally shaped containers in a pantry is slightly more difficult.<br /><br />More interesting is that this box has a shape that is perhaps better suited for stowing in, say, a backpack.  The height cannot be changed, of course, but if you turn a rectangular prism into this parallelogram you do add to the width (the side to side dimension) but you can shrink the depth (the front to back dimension) significantly, which might well make it fit more easily into certain containers such as a backpack or a motorcycle saddlebag or your kangaroo's pouch.<br /><br />And yet another reason is that this shape prevents storing the box on either of its two sides, which is the one orientation of the three that would be most likely to crush the bars inside which, as I've already said, would result in significant damage to them.  If you store the box flat on either large surface or on either end, the damage will be less.  I don't know that this is the manufacturer's reason, but it makes sense either way.<br /><br />If you can invent yet another reason the box is shaped this way, do leave a comment.

review/summary: Another winner from Quaker!
review/text: These bars are absolutely delicious! I did not find them dry, and the fruit filling was plentiful and flavorful. Each bar contains only 100 calories and 18g of carbs, which makes them a better alternative to granola bars. I will definitely buy more of these and keep them handy for an afternoon snack or during a round of golf. I look forward to trying the other favors, but definitely recommend the blueberry.

review/summary: Tastes Great Straight Out Of The Refrigerator
review/text: We seem to eat a  lot of cookie/trail/breakfast bars in our house and these were a welcome surprise. By mistake they were stored in the refrigerator and I decided to try a cold one before  moving them to the regular cupboard, what a delicious surprise, it was delicious; the cold had brought out the taste and did not make it hard to bite into at all. I loved the blueberry taste and found them just sweet enough to suit my taste. They are about the same as as other similar products with similar packaging but with a great taste!<br />So not only do I recommend these, I suggest you put one or two in your refrigerator to see if it lights up your taste buds the way it did mine. My daughter always warms these types of bars in the microwave, she thought these were delicious that way also...

review/text: I loved the Quaker Stila Crispy Blueberry Oat Cookie Bars, as well as their unique packaging. The bars were crisp and the fruit filling had just the right amount of fruit and sauce to keep the bar from being too dry. They were very tasty and the individual packaging makes it easy to carry it with you throughout the day for when you need a little "pick me up". The 100 calories are an added plus.

review/summary: Nice change from a standard bar; could use more filling
review/text: These were an interesting departure from the usual granola-type bars. The outer layers are crunchy, but thin enough that it's not a tooth-breaking exercise to chew. Very nice texture and taste. Not as sweet as other bars, which I found very appealing.<br /><br />My complaint is with the filling -- there's not enough of it. I could hardly taste the blueberry filling at all. What I did taste was pretty good, which makes me think that doubling the amount of filling would make this a more enjoyable snack. Granted, that would increase the calorie count as well, so it would be a mixed blessing.<br /><br />I enjoyed these enough that I'd certainly buy a box provided they were priced at about the same point as a granola bar. It's a nice change of pace.

review/summary: Crunchy fruit bar
review/text: I really enjoyed the Stila bar.  It has a crunchy thin almost cracker like outer pastry which is slightly sweet with a filling that tastes like real fruit not just fruit flavored gel.  At only 100 calories, it is filling and tasty without causing you to feel guilty.<br />I had one of these for breakfast with some yogurt and also packed them as a mid-afternoon snack on a couple of occasions.  They are individually wrapped so perfect for your purse, pocket or lunchbag.  I'm not sure where the name Stila comes from but it's a tasty, crispy treat that I will definitely be buying in all available flavors.  My husband and daughter also liked them which makes shopping that much easier.  It's another winner from the Quaker Co.

review/summary: Poor Ingredients Ruin A Good Tasting Product
review/text: I like the taste and the serving size of the Quaker Stilla Blueberry Cookie Bars.  In essence it is like a crisper, bigger "Newton" style cookie with a thinner filling.  What's not to like?  Well, consider this a list of ingredients that I would rather avoid:<br /><br />* High Fructose Corn Syrup<br />* Modified Corn Starch<br />* Artificial Flavor<br />* Caramel Color<br />* FD&C Red 40<br />* FD&C Blue 1<br /><br />Don't be sucked in by statements like "made with whole grains and fruit filling" and "a snack that's not only tasty but is also a smart choice" and think that these are good for you.  The ingredients listed above are enough to ruin whatever else in these might be wholesome.

review/summary: Taste is Great
review/text: We are always on the go and sometimes that means, besides the kids snacks I need to grab something for myself before I make a bad decision and head through a fast food joint. As a lover of all Quaker products I figured why not give these cookie bars a try. I love blueberry and the fact that this cookie bar was only 100 calories made it an extra plus!<br /><br />I bit into the bar and immediately thought, yummy, then realized that I had assumed it would be soft and it was not. The outside is crisp and crunchy which I like but personally would have liked it better soft.<br /><br />The blueberry taste was great. There is a crisp, crunch with oats on the top and the filing isn't messy which makes this a perfect snack for on the go. No napkin necessary. Eat away. Even with the crunch there was limited crumbs and this is much better than a bag of chips.<br /><br />The family review is: We are all in agreement that this is a great, on the go snack for breakfast, lunch or snack!

review/summary: not impressed
review/text: Not too impressed by these. Flavor is kind of bland, like a cracker with a little fruit. Texture is dry and crumbly. Size is kind of small (less than 1 ounce per bar). I guess if you really want a low calorie snack, you have to be willing to sacrifice taste. Most granola bars are 150 to 200 calories, though they are usually bigger and you don't have to eat the whole thing.

review/summary: Must Be A Lot Of Variability on This Product!
review/text: After reading a number of reviews of this product, I'm baffled.  Some people love them, and some compare them to a Pop Tart.  The item I got is nothing like a Pop Tart in texture.  It's not what I'd call a cookie either, and it's not my definition of crispy.  I'd call it a dry, hard cracker.  The blueberry filling tastes pretty good.  It's a good combo of tart, sweet and fruity.  But there isn't a lot of it, and I just can't get past the unpleasant, cardboard exterior.  I thought maybe I got a package with an expired freshness date, but it's Sept 4, 2012, so not that.  These bars don't seem to pack much nutrition, according to the labeling.  I think you can do better for a 100 calorie snack.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Okay, the package does say "crispy oat cookie bar..." but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so crispy. The Quaker Stila Blueberry Cookie Bar is more like two crackers with blueberry filling sandwiched between them. The flavor was okay, but nothing outstanding, and the cookie was just too crisp and bland for my taste. At only 100 calories per bar, with 2g protein and 2g fiber, it's not a bad deal, but there are other products out there that give me the same or better nutrition while offering better taste.

review/summary: Small Expensive Pop Tarts
review/text: If you have ever had a Kellogg's Pop Tart, that is essentially a similar product.  These Stila bars are just in a package that attempts to make them look healthier.  When they say they are 100 calories, that really just means they are small.<br /><br />First ingredients are the sugars, followed by flours and starches so these are very high Glycemic Index.<br />These weigh only 26 g and 18 g are carbohydrates.<br /><br />Taste wise it is a crispy pastry with sweet fruit filling.  It tastes a lot like a Pop Tart with a slightly crunchier shell.  I even tried toasting one of these in the toaster (careful, not very long) and it tasted really good.<br /><br />So I like the taste of the product (like other mostly chemical products), but I don't see the value.  I would rather buy Pop Tarts as they are a lot cheap.  If you only ate half a Pop Tart they would be 100 calories too and be about the same weight.  These might be slightly more appetizing cold due to their shell.

review/summary: you look like a cereal bar but you don't taste like one...
review/text: I often purchase and eat cereal bars to have as snacks pre-workout or in lieu of breakfast.  While I am not concerned with low-calorie options, those who are should note these are only 100 calories -- alas they are smaller-sized than a typical bar.  Not terribly filling either, so if you are looking for a more dense or higher protein bar (only 2g protein/serving), this may not be the best bar for you.<br /><br />I have to agree with two other reviewers on the dryness of the Stila Cookie Bar, as well as the comment of these resembling a "grown up Pop Tart".  The cookie part of the name seems a little bit of a misnomer.  I was expecting a softer texture and a little more fruit flavor in the middle.  The filling was very thin and didn't pack as much of a punch as I would like.<br /><br />Nutritionally, these get high marks for being 0g trans fat, no cholesterol, 0.5g saturated fat.  There's not much here in the way of protein as mentioned, nor fiber (2g).  As for the ingredients, high fructose corn syrup is at the top of the list.  For those who prefer a more natural bar as a snack, Stila Cookie Bars are probably not the best choice.  As a simple snack it's relatively healthy and doesn't make a mess of crumbs everywhere, a good plus for the on-the-go and commuting snackers.

review/summary: A Little on the Dry Side
review/text: These Quaker Stila Blueberry Cookie Bars have some nice qualities, but when taken all together are not that great. What you get is a sandwich of two rectangular cookies with a very thin layer of fruit "stuff" in between and a coating of grains and oats on top.<br /><br />The cookies are not very sweet, in fact they're almost cracker-like and savory. The filling is quite sweet and has a very syrupy fruit flavor. The grains and other crumb makers on top are just for show and the only thing they add to the mix is a heightened degree of messiness.<br /><br />The overall problem is that there is no balance between the hard, crisp savory cookie and the liquid, overly sweet filling. If there was the amount of jam shown in the product illustration above actually in the bar, it might just work.<br /><br />As it is, you end up with an overall impression of dryness instead or crispness and snowcone syrup sweetness without the natural fruit flavor. These are not bad, but not something i would seek out.

review/summary: VERY sweet "grown-up" pop-tart
review/text: These aren't absolutely horrid, but they're way too sweet and light for my taste (I like a heartier bar and WAY less sugar). If you're an adult pop tart eater, these would be a good, somewhat less embarrassing option.<br /><br />The filling is pure pop tart--the number # ingredient of the filling is high fructose corn syrup, followed by sugar, apple powder, dextrose, glycerin, with blueberry at #6 on the list, and artificial colors and preservatives rounding out the filling ingredients). The crust is a bit more grown up than pop tarts, a bit lighter with a scattering of whole grains.<br /><br />The only selling point I can see is the 2g of fiber and the 100 calories--but you could get twice the fiber and fewer calories from a piece of fruit or whole-grain toast (yeah, I know, fruit isn't shelf-stable and can't survive in your car's glove box for a year). But it your diet is mainly processed convenience foods, this is much less objectionable than some alternatives, hence the 2 stars.<br /><br />I do find it a bit telling that both the ingredients and front label mention that it contains "blueberry" instead of "blueberries." I have a feeling that the singular use is a literal explanation.<br /><br />ETA: I was joking about the last bit. Sort of. :)

review/text: I enjoy most granola bars and energy bars and hoped that the Quaker Stila Blueberry Cookie Bar would be a good addition to the golf bag for the end of nine snack. The golf bag would likely have tasted better. The bar is crisp and dry with a rather dry fruit filling. The filling is actually mostly high fructose corn syrup.( This is the main ingredient)I had to force myself to finish this bar so I could give it a reasonable review, but I would certainly never eat another one. And I was hungry when I tried it. This is a thin tasteless cracker with some fruit flavored paste like filling inside. A few days after I wrote this review my son came and tried the bars liked them and took them with him, so they will obviously appeal to some.

review/summary: Reasonably tasty but not good for you
review/text: Blueberries and oats, ought to be tasty and good for you?  Nope, too good to be true.<br /><br />The cookie was crisp.  Not particularly oatmealy or like granola, but acceptable. Not too sweet which is a plus.  The filling was sweet and tart, a bit scant especially compared to the picture on the box.  But it had the tang of artificial flavor.<br /><br />And no wonder.  High fructose corn syrup city! Plus more sweeteners: sugar, dextrose, glycerin, sorbitol and maltodextrin. And brown sugar with more HFCS in the cookie.  Blueberries were far down the ingredients list- it appears to be apple based and there were four kinds of sugar listed before the blueberries.  The oils are not high quality, healthy oils. Not to mention food coloring.  Here is the list:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Fruit Filling- [High Fructose Corn Syrup, Sugar, Apple Powder, Dextrose, Glycerin, Blueberry, Modified Corn Starch, Sorbitol, Maltodextrin, Pectin, Citric Acid, Salt, Palm Oil, Sodium Citrate (as pH control agent), Artificial Flavor, Potassium Sorbate (as preservative), FD&C Red 40, Malic Acid, Caramel Color, FD&C Blue 1]<br /><br />Cookie- Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacinamide*, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate*, Riboflavin*, Folic Acid*), Toasted Oats, Modified Corn Starch, Vegetable Oil, Shortening (Contains one or more of the following:Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Soybean Oil, Canola Oil), Wheat Gluten, Brown Sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Aluminum Sodium Sulfate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Iodized Salt, Soy Lecithin, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Whey Protein, Caramel Color, Yeast, Rosemary Extract (as antioxidant), Sodium Metabisulfite, Zinc Oxide, Xanthan Gum, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Natural Mixed Tocopherols (PT000218-V2)<br />*One of the B Vitamins,<br /><br />Here is an idea:  how about making a blueberry bar out of blueberries?  Okay, a little sugar or sorbitol since they are pretty tart,but this is a sugar bar with incidental blueberries.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, the bars are made in Mexico. (Hey Quaker Oats, do you know how many times I've gotten e-coli from Mexican berries?)  Maybe that is why you didn't put many in the filling. How about making your food at home and using real ingredients?

review/summary: Kids & Adult LOVE It But a Few Changes Would Make It Even Better
review/text: Amazon sent me six the Stila blueberry package with six bars, so I gave them to six people, of varying ages to sample.  Kids of all ages LOVE the bars.  They thought the bars tasted like cookies rather than something with 0g Trans Fat and only 100 calories per bar.  Adults also liked the bar.  Some preferred the softer granola bars to this type of snack bar, but that is completely personal taste.  I also really enjoyed the taste of the bar.<br /><br />My only complaints, though, are as follows: 1) Thee may only be 100 calories in each bar, but each bar still has 15 grams of fat; 2) the bars contain high fuctose corn syrup; and 3) the bars crumpled a lot when broken into pieces so very small children have a tendency to create many crumbs while eating the bar.<br /><br />Overall, though, I think it is a great snack to keep in a kids' school bag, diaper bag, gym bag, or brief case as it has few calories and tastes great.

review/summary: Quite good and nice to have around in the afternoon!
review/text: This cookie bar is a 100-calorie, 0 trans fat treat. Somewhat reminiscent of Fruit Newtons, they are crispy and quite tasty. They are somewhat dry, and tend to drop crumbs. Nonetheless, they are quite good for a 100-calorie treat, and nice to have around in the afternoon!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Stila Blueberry Cookie Bar)

review/summary: Healthy snack? Think again.
review/text: Though the product description makes this sound like a healthy snack, one look at the ingredient list tells otherwise. Full of artificial flavoring, dyes, corn syrups and a myriad of things I can't pronounce, this is not what I'll reach for when I want a healthy snack. On the upside, there are only 100 calories per bar and while I refused to taste it, my taste-tester at home proclaimed it to be "really good, crisp and chewy at the same time." Good, perhaps for those not concerned about ingredients and only calories, but not for my lifestyle.

review/summary: Good, but could be better
review/text: There are many 100 or so calorie bars and cookies to choose from, and Stila is one of the better ones that I have tried.  From the health perspective, the ingredients list 0% cholesterol, 3% saturated fat, 5% sodium, 6% total carbohydrates, and 8% dietary fiber.  The box gives a very long list of the specific ingredients, including artificial flavoring and preservatives, in the bars, with the primary warning that they contain soy, wheat, and milk.  By no means can these bars be called natural, never mind organic.<br /><br />So, how is the taste?  The cookie part is perfection; the "crisp" part is more like puff pastry (without being crumbly), with no extra sugar or aftertaste.  It is the filling that I have a problem with; while it is tasty and very much blueberry flavored, there is nowhere near enough of it.  The picture on the box of the bar, including the filling, with the blueberry, is misleading.  All that would need to be done is to add between 25 to 50% more filling.  Sure, the calories would go up, but the additional filling would dramatically improve the cookie bar overall.  For me personally, I would rather splurge 150 calories on a fantastic bar versus one at 100 calories that is just so-so.  It is also worth mentioning that Quaker, an American icon company, has chosen to have these made in Mexico.

review/summary: 4-Star Delicious!  BUT, I have SERIOUS problems with this product, unfortunately.
review/text: I will start by telling you that these are one of the most delicious fruit-filled snack or "dessert" item that come in this cookie-type form, not unlike granola bars.<br /><br />The cookie outside of these simply put is crunchy, absolutely delicious, really one of the most satisfying pastry-type prepackaged items I have ever eaten.<br /><br />The fruit (blueberry) filling is actually artificially flavored in addition to some natural flavor...points off, naturally, for this. However, the filling is, truthfully, quite good-tasting and really goes well with the cookie shell outside.<br /><br />100 calories and NO Trans-Fat, certainly is a piece of good news in today's snack market. 115 mg of sodium is also not bad, all things considered, today. 0 cholesterol, 18g of carbs, 2g fiber, 8g sugar, 2% iron, 2% folic acid...I find all this quite acceptable for this type of snack (both the negative and positive aspects), and the 4 STARS for my review is given for what I have just reported here for your knowledge. (Everything about the taste, texture, and the cookie coating is delicious).<br /><br />HOWEVER, now the problems start: (directly copied from the package)<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Fruit Filling-  [High Fructose Corn Syrup, Sugar, Apple Powder, Dextrose, Glycerin, Blueberry, Modified Corn Starch, Sorbitol, Maltodextrin, Pectin, Citric Acid, Salt, Palm Oil, Sodium Citrate (as pH control agent), Artificial Flavor, Potassium Sorbate (as preservative), FD&C Red 40, Malic Acid, Caramel Color, FD&C Blue 1]<br /><br />Cookie-  Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacinamide*, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate*, Riboflavin*, Folic Acid*), Toasted Oats, Modified Corn Starch, Vegetable Oil, Shortening (Contains one or more of the following:Palm Oil, Sunflower Oil, Soybean Oil, Canola Oil), Wheat Gluten, Brown Sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Aluminum Sodium Sulfate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Iodized Salt, Soy Lecithin, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Whey Protein, Caramel Color, Yeast, Rosemary Extract (as antioxidant), Sodium Metabisulfite, Zinc Oxide, Xanthan Gum, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Natural Mixed Tocopherols (PT000218-V2)<br /> *One of the B Vitamins<br /><br />Now, after having read all this, I am wondering if you, LIKE ME, might have decided that these are NOT really what you want to eat.....<br />Great Taste on the Tongue is great, but like so many things, NOT good for you in actuality is common today for our food products being presented for us to consume.<br /><br />This 2nd part of my review, TRUTHFULLY, erases TWO, perhaps THREE more stars, leaving the rating at either 2 STARS or 1 STAR. AS I said, they really are very tasty, but I find the ingredients list just not satisfactory. We are being fed entirely TOO MANY chemical and substitute ingredients in our food!<br /><br />The FINAL NEGATIVE for these is the STARTLING fact that these are made in MEXICO and shipped here for distribution by QUAKER! Imagine! That old, reliable, "ALL-American" nutritionally conscious company! In effect, this fact, to me, erases the Final 1 or 2 STARS left, that I mention above.<br /><br />End result...delicious tasting, (they really do "taste like 4-STARS worth!). Ingredients list and Made in Mexico etc., removes all stars, in effect (at least for me). I find this pretty sad, like I said, as they taste great, BUT they surely are NOT good for one.<br /><br />Finally, one last problem**: The package (box) for this product is printed in multi-colored inks (beyond regular 4-color process) which is very expensive. Many companies do this today, which is excessive and STUPID. Also, the box is set up as a parallelogram which is REALLY REALLY stupid, adding unknown amounts of expense to the production of this packaging. Today, there is SO much expense in the packaging that it is ridiculous. These higher costs are added into the price we are paying for these products, yet we toss the package...what IS this all about, anyway. WASTE, and HIGHER PRICES...two things we certainly CAN do without today.<br />**I worked my entire career in Printing/Graphics, etc., and I KNOW packaging and printing inside and out....the expense of all this extra "glitz" is shameful waste and increases our purchase price unnecessarily.<br /><br />~operabruin

They are more like a pastry, have a crunchy crust and the fruit in the middle is very good.  Only 100 calories and feels like a treat.  I will most definitely buy these again.

review/summary: A different and really good snack bar
review/text: I'm not normally a big fan of the granola bar things. I do kinda like the Quaker S'mores Granola bars. Now these came along so I tried them. And these are a really good snack bar. They are a bit crumbly but not any more than most of the other granola bars. They have a nice crisp texture and the Blueberry filling is just right. Its not too sweet and doesn't have that fake artificial taste to it that so many fruit things have. I love the crunchy part with the crispy and a touch of gooey sweet from the blueberry. The only thing I don't like about them, they ain't big enough! Something this good, you shouldn't tease me with these little bars! Put some SIZE TO THEM when you make them! If they were twice their size they would be perfect. I ate almost the whole box, all but one after I got them. It took all the will power I had to put the last one up in the cupboard for later. After the first one I just couldn't stop! When I see these on the shelf at the store I'm definitely buying them. I think some with Peaches would be great along with Cherry and Black Raspberry of course. I see they have Apple Cinnamon and of course Strawberry ones already. And besides being good tasting they are good for you! If you like crunchy slightly sweet munchies you should love these and just gotta try them.

review/summary: Crunchy but a bit too sweet
review/text: I found the cookie to look tasty (though it appears a bit flat) and smell good. It had a strong blueberry flavor, though I found it too sweet (which I guess shouldn't be surprising since the first two ingredients for the fruit filling are high fructose corn syrup and sugar).  It is crunchy and you'll need a napkin while eating it, otherwise you'll get crumbs everywhere.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it but didn't love it. If someone offered it to me, I'd eat it, but I don't see myself buying these cookies.

review/summary: They Have An Odd Texture
review/text: These cookie bars are perfectly fine for edible snacking, but they're not something I'd probably buy again. The "oat cookie" has an odd texture, at the same time both crunchy and chewy, and out of 6 in the box only 2 weren't already broken or crumbling when I opened them. The flavor of the "oat cookie" is definitely *oaty*, but that's expected, I suppose.

review/summary: "Kind of Dry"
review/text: Yesterday, I shared my "Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bars" with my husband and son.  The first words out of my husband's mouth were, "It's too dry" and my son said the same.  I took my first bite and had to agree.  Yes, the flavor was nice, it's a nice mix of oats and blueberries, but the bar is very dry.  I reminded them (and myself) that the box states "crispy" and maybe that's why it was dry.  Then my son commented that the box shows a really thick bar with lots of blueberries inside and that his bar wasn't as thick or filled with blueberries.  We then discovered that blueberries are part of the fruit filling, but that they aren't the first ingredient - I think that they are fourth in the list of fruit filling ingredients.<br /><br />Since each bar contains only 100 calories, the company probably didn't use as much oil in the making of these bars and that's why they are dry?<br /><br />Either way, the bars are delicious, just make certain that you have a cup of coffee or iced tea or juice to help along the way.  Neither my son or husband tried dunking the bars; I wonder how well they'd hold up to that?  There are three bars left in the box, maybe this morning I will suggest a dunking contest!<br /><br />The bars are delicious, but I won't be buying them off the local grocery shelf.

review/summary: Flaky Crust and Flavorful
review/text: The first Quaker Stila Blueberry Cookie Bar that I ate was a disappointment.  There seemed to be very little filling, which caused a lack of flavor.  However, every bar after that was tasty and filled appropriately.  The crust has a subtle sweetness to it, while the blueberry compliments it very well.  I would certainly buy more of these in the future because they are a nice snack that is not loaded with calories.

review/summary: Sort of like a mini pop tart without being super sweet
review/text: These cookie bars add some crunchy goodness with gooey. It's weird - but in a good sort of way. I really liked the crunchy cookie outside but found there inside to be different. Instead of being a thick jam filly it was more of a runny filling. I did like how that inner filling wasn't super sweet and had a good blueberry flavor. It was more the change in...texture between the cookie outside and the jam inside that keeps me from giving this a five star review. The cookie bar was filling though and I found almost the entire bar to be too much for a single sitting (I can't even eat an entire power bar or the like in a single sitting).

review/summary: Like crackers with jelly
review/text: When you were a kid, did you ever eat saltines with a little jelly? That's exactly what these bars are like. These bars are a pleasant departure from the usual granola bar grabbed on the way out the door to work. These aren't soft like some granola bars and they are break-a-tooth hard like some others. They are super thin, super crunchy, and really, really good. I know these are marketed as cookies, and they are one (minus the sweetness), but really are more like a granola bar. The bars are also low cal (100 calories each) and kept hunger at bay until lunch time. I would definitely buy these and would be delighted to try other flavors - any strawberry out there?

review/summary: This Snack Made Me Blue
review/text: This "cookie" bar might have been tastier if dipped in milk or coffee, but eating it alone as a snack it was disaappointing--dry, crumbly and lacking in juiciness. The serving size was fine, and the calorie-count, appealingly low--just right for popping in a child's lunchbox or a knapsack when camping. But this tastes too "healthy" to be appeal to most appetites.

review/text: Had this in the AM today and I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did. The fruit filling tastes fine but it's the cookie part to it that makes this very tasty. I've had similar bars where the cookie shell was of the very soft but overly dry type. The crispness of this makes it all the more delectable and I think overall, it makes for a good in-between snack or a more sensible replacement to those foods you want to eat but really shouldn't. Fully recommended!

review/text: I love granola bars, oats, and blueberries so this happy combination seemed like a no-brainer to me! I was shocked when I bit into it and found that the bar was actually crunchy. It had a crunch that was similar to a potato chip which was fantastic! Still, it was made to taste like a granola bar with the taste of oats, blueberries, and grains. I had to eat two before I really knew that I liked it, but now I can't stop eating them. They're 100 calories and seem a bit limited for 100 calories. I thought that they would have more blueberries in them. Still, I think that they're a great snack and the grains help keep me full!

review/text: While this bar is nothing to become addicted to, it's a nice, filling snack. The fruit filling isn't overdone. There's just enough of it to give the bar a nice, slightly sweet taste without getting oozy and gooey. The bar isn't overwhelmed by flavors, so it isn't sickly sweet like a lot of 100 calorie snacks are. I wouldn't substitute this for desert (for that, I use Fiber One brownies) but I'll enjoy having a bar with lunch or between lunch and dinner!

review/text: Quaker Stila Blueberry cookie bars come in sealed packets so they are great for lunches or a pocket snack.  The outside covering is slightly hard and crunchy while the inside contains a tasty blueberry filling.  I shared these blueberry cookie bars with three other people and they all liked them.  I like them because the blueberry filling is not too sweet.  Many cookies with blueberry filling are so sweet they make your teeth hurt.  These Quaker blueberry cookie bars are tasty and just sweet enough to enjoy.<br /><br />The nice thing about these cookies is that blueberries actually contain some health benefits.<br /><br />Blueberries benefits:<br /><br />-  Blueberries can improve memory<br /><br />-  Blueberries can improve balance<br /><br />-  Blueberries benefit they eyes.

review/summary: Yumm!! I really like these!!
review/text: They have a real fig newtony kinda taste, but more on the cookie wise with a thing fruity filling that is enough to balance the oat exterior. It is not a crispy or crunchy bar, but has chewiness to it that makes it easy to eat, but gives a nice texture.<br /><br />When you get the box, do not be alarmed that the box came damaged and whoever shipped it did a bad job at packaging. The box is actually on a slant, almost diamond or parallelogram shaped. Within are 6 bars neatly lined standing on end.<br /><br />The name "Stila" has some to be desired. It reeks self-importance and a hoity toity health food. But its a major company putting these out, so you know they are cutting as many corners as possible in terms of what is healthy verse what they can make on a cost verse profit level. But overall there is only 1.5 grams of fat per bar, relatively low sodium (115 mg), 8g of sugar and 2g of protein. The top corner of box says no trans fat, but I guess that would be its only health claim as the blueberry is not real blueberries, so you are not getting the anti-oxident benefit. Each bar is 100 calories.<br /><br />Generally they are enjoyable to eat and light, but probably not full of quality calories other bars might offer. But I like the taste and bite of the bar so despite my nit-picking of the packaging - because thats just me - I would still try other flavors. The blueberry so far I think are really good.

I'm still using it up and it is now November. Even with such a poor start, this is excellent coffee. Yes, it went right into 40 degree storage upon arrival here. But who knows where it spent its first year after being ground? Yet it is not stale (and I feel lucky for that) and has a superior complex, rich flavor. Bottom line: very good coffee.<br /><br />PS: I know that vacuum-packing is SUPPOSED to maintain freshness, but my repeated experience has shown that it is not always effective. This time it apparently was. Yea!<br /><br />UPDATE: When I opened the second package, I noticed immediately that the suction of the vacuum was gone although the package had kept its shape. That indicates a pinhole, which doesn't surprise me because the foil is very thin. The coffee in this second package was not as good as the first, stale, no surprise. (It was still miles ahead of common brands in flavor!) This situation points up the downside of both outdated coffee and inappropriately thin packaging, as such foil is a substance easy to damage. I had handled and stored it carefully. Took away a star.

review/summary: Still Excellent
review/text: I purchased these on a Gold Box Sale, probably like the other reviewers so far. This ground coffee is vacuum packed like a brick; similar to many brands. Date code showed June 09 (a year ago) and exp 12/10, which may be too long, but that may also be why it went on sale. Me and a friend both enjoyed the taste and I would rate it excellent. Not stale at all. Normally, to make coffee taste good, I add sugar and creamer, or coconut cream and rice bran solubles, to avoid dairy and gain nutritional benefits. This coffee was very good black. I will try their other varieties. I'll try their whole beans and grind them myself next time.

review/summary: STOP - Stale Coffee - Packed over a Year ago per package date
review/text: AVOID AT ALL COST - Coffee purchased from AMAZON was received on July 14, 2010 but date on coffee bag indicates it was packed on June 30, 2009 (13 months old).  Anyone who drinks coffee knows that ground coffee becomes stale within less than 6 months and yet Amazon delivers coffee that was packed (per date on package) MORE than a YEAR before purchase date.  Advise NOT to buy from Amazon if you want fresh ground coffee that is NOT stale.  Better option is to buy Melitta from their web site which often has sales at half price (well below Amazon's best price).  Their coffee (Melitta-dot-com) is always fresh direct from their roasting factory and just as good as this brand.  I have had this coffee (Douwe Egberts) before while visiting in England (UK) and when fresh it is great, but can not understand Amazon sending stale coffee to their customers.  I see from the other review that I am not the only customer to receive stale coffee from Amazon.  SHAME on Amazon for sending old food/beverage items to their customers without stating in the item description that the product is very old (no longer fresh).  At least in our local grocery stores they segregate and mark down items clearly stating that the items are near, at, or past their expiration date, letting the fully informed customer make a decision based on ALL known facts.

review/text: Very tricky. I used to buy Dorset all the time, then they went out of stock.  When they came back on Amazon I re-ordered a pack of 5 and I was very surprised:<br />1.  This is half the size the previous ones used to be and for the same price.<br />2.  It's toasted wheat and flakes. It's like Granola not the Muesli such as Steinbracher and Mumu's where you get rolled oat and barley.<br /><br />I though Dorset was good, but not anymore.  Last time!  If only Amazon sold MuMu, the best cereal in the States at least made in the USA, up state NY.  Why import cereals when we have the best one here... We are paying a premium to ship a bad product trans the Atlantic ocean and contributing to air pollution and CO2 emission.

review/summary: Great food for cats or kittens with sensitive stomachs or food allergies
review/text: My 9 month old kitten has had trouble with diarrhea since we got him and it doesn't seem to have a medical cause, he either has a food allergy or just a sensitive stomach. We gradually switched him to this food about 3 weeks ago and have had good success with it. The diarrhea has stopped and he really seems to like this food. I did a slow switch, adding small amounts to the dry food he had been eating and eventually feeding him 100% Natural Balance. We're very happy with how well this food has worked for our cat and plan to keep him on it. The nutrition content is excellent and for a premium food, the price is quite reasonable. I'd rather pay for a quality food like this and have a healthy cat than buy a poor quality cheap food and end up spending more in vet bills. My kitten's coat is very shiny and soft, his weight is perfect and even my other cat, a very picky eater, likes this food. I like the limited ingredients in this formula which is great for cats that might have allergies or be sensitive to the ingredients in other foods. Overall, I'm thrilled I found this food and my kitty is too!

review/text: When I adopted my second cat, it was discovered that she was suffering from some type of food allergy. After doing some research, I discovered Natural Balance carried a limited ingredients diet. My two cats enjoy the wet and dry food and seem to be doing well on it. The prices are very reasonable and I like the fact that Natural Balance has a "buy with confidence" feature so that pet owners can monitor the testing of the food they have purchased. Plus they do not conduct animal testing which a lot of commercial pet foods (Iams, Purina, Nutro) do. I would highly recommend Natural Balance!

review/summary: Chicken-Free!
review/text: My 8 year old cat was scratching her ears/face and after talking to a few people and my vet, it was suggested I do an elimination diet. Within a week, I noticed significantly less scratching and itching on my cat.<br /><br />The Natural Balance food is a good place to start if you're looking for a novel protein source for elimination diets (it's cheaper than a $500 blood test, but it takes time and patience, as you usually have to feed your cat 1 type of food for at least 8 weeks, then introduce other proteins to see if they react.).<br /><br />I do combination feeding of wet/dry of the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diet and at first, my cat didn't care for the dry food (it kind of smells like dried peas) but he started to eat it and got used to it once I mixed up the wet and dry kibbles together - I add wet food so my cat gets enough water intake.<br /><br />I'm so glad Natural Balance has pretty affordable food for allergic cats! I mean, it's DUCK! That's gotta be some good stuff! :)

It's not light so if you're worried about calories you've got to watch your portions, but it is pretty filling anyway. My husband, who is far pickier about cereal than I am, also loves this one.

The serving size is 1/3 cup which sounds like a decent size however since the granola is mostly in clusters it is not a lot at all and harder to measure.  I do like that it is not overly sweet.

One serving of this product is about 30g (1/3 Cup!!!) gives you 6grams of sugar and 15% DV of saturated fat. If you fill your bowl half full (100 grams) you will end up eating 20 grams of sugar and 50% of you daily value of saturated fat.<br /><br />The quantity of cereal in the box is so less that an average male would finish one box in four days (if you eat this once a day) that will cost you 50 dollars per month.<br /><br />I compensate the sweetness by mixing one part of this granola with two parts of quick oats. or-else its to sweet for me, seriously its like eating dessert for breakfast.<br /><br />Verdict: Good product which can compete with Kashi's product line, but unit price and sweetness is twice as much as any of kashi's granola. I will stick with Kashi for now

review/summary: Authentic and easy to prepare
review/text: I bought the Pav Bhaji before from another brand and didn't like the taste as much as this one from Sanskriti.  Overall one thing I did enjoy and like was the photos, the prep seems even easier and I would recommend the prep by stove top and water.  While is may take a few minutes longer I think it keeps the meal more moist vs drying out in the microwave.

review/summary: Very salty!  More so then expected
review/text: Perhaps this will show that I am naive, but I wanted to give a Smithfield ham product a second chance.  So, I ordered one that might be at least closer to their original ham.  I did expect salty, I know their original product is salt cured.  But this is a VERY salty product.  If one likes such high amounts of salt (One 2 ounce serving has a bit over 50 percent of the suggested daily salt intake to give an idea) then consider this closer to a four or five star review, the flavor is very nice.  But, and I'll admit I was maybe somewhat naive again it's just a bit too salty for me.  I'll slowly use it up, but I know I very much won't need to add salt if I use a slice of this ham on a sandwich or in a recipe.

review/text: Good chocolate. Would of gave 5 stars but picture is different then delivered package. I liked the box better. This does have Agave which I did not read before purchasing. So if you are conscious about your health more I would try and find raw chocolate without it.

review/summary: Great herb mix
review/text: I had tried one of the salad herb mixes from this company before, and had really enjoyed them. This has a really nice blend of herbs that are nice to add to any salad. I have mixed them with both yogurt and with a vinaigrette, and enjoyed them equally. Since they're sold in 25 envelope packs (5x5), I have shared with some friends who also really liked the product. Another great use I have found is mixing the herbs with my scrambled eggs.  Very tasty, and again: Very easy, and a nice departure from your standard Italian or Herbs de Provence mixes.<br />Would definitely recommend and buy again.

review/text: Found a great great raspberry chocolate cake recipe at dassant.com using this cake mix.  Great chocolate cake and by far the most moist box cake I've ever had.  Tasted more like a scratch made cake.  The small chocolate chips give it an extra great chocolate flavor.  Very simple to make and great results.  Highly recommend!

review/text: I tried this mix after reading the great reviews on the Dassant Beer Bread Mix. I thought for sure this product had to be as good as their others - and boy was I right! I made the mix into cupcakes. Unlike other cake mixes I have tried, this mix stayed moist. The cake was spongy and filled with little chocolate chips. Each bite was heavenly. I can't wait make more of these. They were a hit with my family!

review/summary: Auntys Spotted Dick Pudding
review/text: Having never tried Spotted Dick, so was curious as to how it would taste.  I've never been to the UK, so haven't had the real deal which is made with rendered beef suet.  The ingredients on the box didn't list this important ingredient so I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.  I bought it primarily for the name of the pudding which is reason enough for me.<br />We had lots of laughs getting our pictures taken with the box, then ate the dessert.  I have to say it tastes delicious but again I have nothing to compare it to.<br />I look forward to an unsuspecting relative to open a present this Christmas and find the "Spotted Dick" and go what the.  We'll have lots of laughs again.

review/text: I have ordered these same Landjager multiple times since I tried them. If you're a meat junkie they're great! Just make sure you let them hang out to dry for as long as you can because they just get better and better! A week or so is when they really start getting good. I end up eating half of them before they really hit their sweet spot, but maybe you've got more self control than me!!!
