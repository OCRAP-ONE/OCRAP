review/summary: Best Animal Cookies!
review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

review/summary: Great snack, good ingredients, healthy alternative
review/text: So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/text: Finally Starbucks comes out with K-cups!! I have been waiting for Starbucks K-cups over the past 5 years. I love strong & bold coffee. The monopoly of coffee from Green Mountain largely can't deliver that bold taste. But I just brewed my first Starbucks French Roast K-cups. First, the aroma from the brew instantly reminded of Starbucks. Then the first sip. WOW!!! I couldn't believe how good this coffee is. I couldn't believe that my machine just made it. I can honestly say this was the BEST cup of coffee from my machine over the past 5 years. It is as good, if not better, than what you get when you visit Starbucks. If you are a Starbuck fan that enjoy dark, rich, bold, & strong coffee; you will NOT be disappointed!

review/summary: The best K-Cup French Roast
review/text: The challenge for those of us who use Keurig machines to fill our travel mugs is that many bold varities don't hold up to the larger cup settings. They get pretty weak at 8 ounces or more.  There aren't a lot of choices for K-Cups for travel mugs. Using 2 K-cups is expensive. I've been working my way through the new Starbucks selections and this is a winner. It is faithful to the Starbucks taste and it can definitely handle the 8 ounce setting.  I've tried French Roasts from Tully's, Diedrich, Van Houtte, Wolfgang Puck, Barista Prima, Green Mountain and others. This rules. Ah, but the price. Well, I guess it's cheaper than going to Starbucks. Keurig seems to have their coffee suppliers package in infinite box counts, making us do the math to figure out who has the best deal. The lowest price I've seen for this selection is a little less than 80 cents a K-Cup at a wholesale club. That seems to be about 20 cents a cup more expensive than other K-Cups.

review/summary: A Better Brew for Flavor!
review/text: In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + French Roast + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot, then the French Roast, that is if you like a BOLD taste.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig "Brew" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!

review/summary: fantastic coffee (I buy at Wal-Mart for $13.88), outrageous Amazon price
review/text: I've been buying k-cups exclusively at Amazon for the past year.  The price is slightly better than local (although available at Bed Bath & Beyond, and Wal-Mart).  Plus I like the idea of having it deliver right to my Keurig!.  However, I am simply taken aback when I saw your price for the Starbucks cups.  Outrageous, to say the least.  I will continue to purchase at Wal-Mart where it is $13.88 for 16 cups.  Go back to the drawing board on this one, guys, or you'll be sitting on a lot of K-cups!  Hurry before other folks catch on and you get into the game too late!  I rate this coffee at about 10 stars!  Most other K-cups are not as full-bodied or mouth satisfying as Starbucks.  Hope they do Espresso soon.

review/summary: Some Like it Hot
review/text: You can keep your spicy, deli-style, French, dijon, honey, pomegranite, yellowy mustards. I want my mustard the way mustard was supposed to be--hot. It's supposed to clear the nostrils when you've got a cold; it's supposed to have a certain sensation as the vapors rise through the nasal membranes and spread to the eyes, the ears, and the rest of the face. And I've been sorely disappointed with many mustards that claimed to be three alarm, hot, spicy, or all three and didn't even ring my bell a tiny-teeny.<br /><br />But then I discovered this little yellow heat in an unassuming bottle. Ahhhhhh! My search had ended. Mustard is as mustard does--or something like that. It seems to activate on ham and bread. A gentle aroma becomes more pungent as the mustard hits the taste buds on your tongue and in your mouth. That's when it's gustatory brilliance takes over making the ham or cheese come alive with flavor. Colman's is the way mustard was intended, to awaken the senses and jolt the central nervous system.  It might not be for everyone though. If you prefer that strange yellow sauce, honey spread, or a bottle in which you can make funny designs on your hot dog, this is probably not for you. And being a Yankee born and bred, I can almost understand how people below the Mason/Dixon line spread it on their hamburgers. I said--almost. Besides, what they put on ain't Colman's.<br /><br />It's the big mustard in the little bottle. It's made for wings, sandwiches, dips, tenders, and clearing your sinuses.<br /><br />Be gentle with it because it won't be gentle with you!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Colonel Mustard<br />(I did it in the Study with the pipe).

review/text: My in-laws are from the Norfolk County, England, which is also the home of Coleman's mustard.  And, the Coleman's jar is on the table EVERY meal.  My father in law practically reignited the American Revolution in Boston one day when he could not get any english mustard with his eggs.  It took the entire family to explain to him that he was not in England, and it is no surprise that he will have a tough time getting english mustard.<br /><br />Anyway, about the mustard:<br />It is smooth, yellow, and just looking at it, one could assume flavorless.  They would be WRONG!  This mustard has KICK.  It has a spicy undertone that on occasion will rise up and clear out the sinuses.  Try it on a turkey sandwich, and you will never go back to mayo.  Try it on hot italian sausage, try it on eggs, try it on chicken, asparagus, fries, just try it.

review/text: If you like mustard, real mustard, and are offended at the plain yellow stuff made by French's...this is the real deal.  I first discovered Colman's at one of my local haunts, The Cat & Fiddle, in Hollywood.  I usually get something or other to eat with my Bass Ale and the waiter was kind enough to drop off a bottle of Colman's one fine Saturday afternoon.  My culinary life (and nostrils) were forever altered that day.  There is no other mustard quite like this stuff.  It has a delicious mustard flavor coupled with a very smokey taste.  It really can't be described properly with mere words.  I was lucky enough to be in London last Spring, and I brought home a couple of large jars of this stuff.  However, it's damned expensive here in the states. Amazon has the best on-line price by far.  If you haven't tried it yet, go to your local British style pub or restaurant and give it a go, and be prepared for the 'kick'.  All other mustards pale in comparison with this legendary British product.

review/summary: Check the expiration date upon receipt. Contains wheat
review/text: I love this mustard but I also am gluten-intolerant. I hadn't had it in a while (long before I found out about my gluten problem) so bought this 6-pack from Amazon in August 4, 2011 not thinking it would 1) contain any wheat and 2) expire so soon. I don't remember whether the ingredients list was on the product page at the time. It probably was.<br /><br />In any case, I just looked at the remaining two bottles of mustard I have (I'm giving them away as gifts now) and the expiration date is March 2012, already expired as of this writing. So I would advise checking the date as soon as you get this 6-pack to see if you can realistically eat that much before they expire.<br /><br />The Colman's Dry Mustard Powder Mustard does not contain wheat - the ingredients list on Amazon just says "mustard flour." Also, an email from a Colman's rep. confirmed it contains no wheat.

review/summary: We're addicted!
review/text: Ran into this mustard at an English Pub in Hollywood when we had the Ploughman's lunch. It is spicy -- we thought it had horseradish, but that's not listed in the ingredients. It does have a kick, and is somewhat salty -- but it's fabulous with cheese, and pretzels, and marvelously fresh bread. The prices here can't be beat -- it's a good 40% less than what we pay at our local grocer....ENJOY!

review/summary: The best purpose mustard for sandwiches and hot dogs
review/text: I'm surprised my fellow Americans are unable to find Colman's mustard. I live in southern Mississippi, and I'm able to buy it off the shelf at my local grocery store.<br /><br />This is indeed the best mustard for sandwiches and hot dogs, and I also use it as a dip for my potato chips (crisps) and fries as well. It has a wonderful, bitter tang to it, with a little bit more heat than the average mustard.<br /><br />Now, I don't mean to oversell the heat factor. This isn't hot like a habanero or a serrano pepper. It's not even as hot as a jalepeno, so those used to authentic Mexican or Thai sauces will be disappointed if you buy this for solely the heat factor. However, it's not supposed to be "hot", it supposed to be good, and it is. Definitely the best general purpose mustard you can get.

review/text: Been over here in NC for approaching two years now and have noted the usual Englishmans complaints - the bread, the beans - although plain pintos have grown on me (must see a doctor about that), the chocolate, the brown sauce etc.. and obviously the mustard.<br /><br />I really must come across as being pompous with all my culinary gripes - but what can I say?<br /><br />Colemans mustard is what mustard is supposed to be like, not a pickle.. not a tangy yellow ooze - but a rip-roaring, eye-watering, cold conquering addition to all kinds of meals.<br /><br />Too much of it in a sandwich will mean a minute or two to recover from each bite though.<br /><br />If anyone can recommend another I'd be happy to know of it :o)

While asking my dad to bring me up a jar on his next trip he told me to try Colman's I am glad I did while it is not exactly the same it as close as one can get with out traveling to L.A. or having someone bring you a jar.  I mix in about an 1.5 -2 oz of  dijion and a little horseradish to bring it closer to Phillippe's.  On it own Colman's is a great spicy mustard and brings a real wow to your senses

review/text: This 'hot' mustard reminds me of home. Used sparingly on most meats, hot or cold, it will add that special zing. Hot-dogs or burgers will also benefit from a little too.<br />It is of course not to everyone's taste because it is so hot. So be careful and see if you can try it at a Chinese restaurant before you commit and buy your own.

He sent it in a tube which is really cool and very handy, but you can't find the tubes anywhere in the U.S. Last visit to England I brought home ten tubes. The customs lady gave me an odd look. Anyway, I can't find the stuff in the supermarket so I order it from Amazon. There are no substitutes for this mustard. I can't eat roast beef without it. Sure, it burns a little, but it's all a part of that pleasure/pain thing most of us don't like to talk about.

It's the Best on bratwurst (with chopped onion)! Used to be a specialty store in my area that carried it, then they stopped.  Glad I could find it on Amazon.  But don't buy just one bottle - the shipping is a bit costly and it goes fast.  Buying a six-pack gets the per bottle cost down and gives me a year's supply (hey, I'm worth it).  And it's too good to give away - get your own bottle is what I always say!

review/text: If you ordered these expecting a smooth gooey American-style caramel experience, forget it. Other than the flavor, which is somewhat of a mellower butterscotchy vanilla cream, you will find these have the texture of crystalized fudge. They are a bit hard & crumbly at first, but soon melt into a sea of creamy delight. I laughed when I read one reviewer's comments about "ordering 5 pounds, and eating 5 pounds". I meant to send some to my sister but ended up gaining about 7 pounds in 2 weeks myself. I'll have to recommend them to Renee Zellweger for her next Bridget Jones adventure.<br /><br />My Russian grandmother used to get the real Polish version of these "krufki" which may mean "cow" since the Russian diminutive version of cow is "korovki" (there was a picture of a cow on the wrapper). If you are looking for those candies, these Caramoo's taste exactly the same. Thank goodness they still come in the traditional wrapper - the only thing that slows down the feeding frenzy. (Please don't tell my dentist!)

review/summary: Tasty Caramel Treats
review/text: Yummy, yummy is all I can say about these caramels, 5 out of 6 in my family love them (hubby isn't a candy fan).  These aren't your traditional chewy caramel squares we are all used to ... If your up for a change in your creamy caramel, you'll be pleasantly pleased.  These are crumbly as their name states and don't stick to your teeth, makes it easy to power them down so be warned.

review/summary: Not bad!!  Sweet though.
review/text: I bought these and got them yesterday.  It is pretty sweet so be warned. I think if you like fudge, you will like these.  It reminds me of the Scortish whiskey fudge candy that I had before.  I love how simple the ingredients are.  It is addictive.

review/text: Nice flavor but sweeter than what I expected from a caramel. Sweet as a piece of fudge. Serving size is 4 pieces [150 calories]. So sweet I can only eat 2 pieces. Which is good for me--I won't finish the bag in 2-3 days! Think I'll share it at work.

review/summary: An addictive krewki alternative!
review/text: If you are looking for krewki, look no further.  No, these aren't "little cow candies", but they are the closest I have had in years.  My Polish mother proclaims them to be perfect.  Price wise, they are about on par with ordering from one of the European importers.  Use Amazon's Subscribe and Save to get a good deal and keep these sweet treats coming on a regular basis!  I ordered a bag to send to my husband in Afghanistan...we'll see if they actually get there.

review/text: I keep a bag of these caramels at my desk for a quick treat after lunch or as an afternoon treat. They have an incredibly creamy flavor yet the texture is unexpectedly crumbly.

review/summary: Not Traditional Caramels
review/text: The reviewer who said these were similar to vanilla fudge got it right. If you are old enough to remember it, I think they also taste a bit like penuche. Two is plenty for a serving, they're very buttery and sweet and crumbley. These are not like traditional caramels- I wouldn't try to make caramel apples with them. They aren't that sort of caramel- they're more like a hard fudge texture.<br /><br />My roommate said he hated them but I had SO MANY of them in the bag that I decided to put some of them in the food processor with some graham crackers and make a pie crust with them. I made a butterscotch pudding pie with the crust and it was roll your eyes over good. My roommate loved the pie and commented on the great pie crust. So I think some of the reason he didn't care for them was his expectation that they'd be like a Kraft caramel or like a butter toffee and they are actually both and neither.<br /><br />So- don't expect toffee or a chewey caramel with these. I think they're awesome.

review/summary: eware of ripped packaging
review/text: I just received my caramels.  When I opened the package, one of the bags was ripped, so I tried one of the caramels.  It was hard, and seemed stale. I looked at package and it was dated  Aug.31,2006..outdated.  I contacted Caramoo and told them they were selling old candy..and I received an email back explaining that they had dated the packages wrong, and it should be 2007.  However,  if the candy bag gets ripped, the candy will get hard and stale quickly.  This is what happened to mine.  I am returning mine because of the ripped packaging.  Caramoo suggested that you keep the candy in an air tight container..so  I am passing this info on to you all.  Hopefully they will improve there packaging.

review/summary: Zhen Bang! ~ Freakin Awesome!
review/text: I felt it necessary to update my original review :)<br /><br />Another birthday means another order for fortune cookies from Greenfire. This has become an annual tradition in our family. Our son picks a theme and the experts at Greenfire come up with awesome looking fortunes to give to his friends. I have also used the cookies as gifts for colleagues as well as clients and they think they not only look cool but they are yummy too. I love the fact that we get to be creative and different at a reasonable price. Perhaps even better than the actual cookies -- the staff at Greenfire. Always accommodating and easy to work with. I am not just a customer - I am a part of the team.<br /><br />Original review - January 27, 2010<br /><br />Wow!  I can't say enough not only about the product but the service received!  I spoke with Jen on the phone about a last minute idea I had for a gift I wanted to put together for some colleagues.  She not only made it happen but when there was a problem with the shipping (a result of a shipper error and NOT the vendor) she went above and beyond to help figure out a way to make it work.  The cookies were fresh and tasted great plus the actual fortunes were beautiflly designed.  I will be back to get more for personal use (my 5 year old sons birthday) and maybe even some for Valentine's Day.  Thank you so much.

I wrapped them in celophane and left them unsigned so they had to open the fortunes to see who they were from.  Joel was the only one who knew instantly that they were from me.  I am definitely doing it again next year with a whole new set of  "zoo" fortunes..for the rest of you... here are the 2009 top 10 favorites:<br /><br />#10  If animals were online...they would definitely "unfriend".<br /><br />#9  The name for an animal that does NOT flee, OR fight its enemy is called lunch.<br /><br />#8  Got crap? let me get you your Union card.<br /><br />#7  You will stop procrastinating tomorrow.<br /><br />#6  A Real fortune: Do not upset the penguin today.<br /><br />#5  Don't poke the bear or you'll get the claw.<br /><br />#4  "Don't approach a goat from the front, a horse from the back, or a fool from any side."<br /><br />#3  Make the best of today, the rest of the week is gonna suck.<br /><br />#2  Your future is simple: carrot, apple, yam.<br /><br />#1  ...there is one thing that separates us from animals.

review/summary: Commenrative Fortune Cookies steal the show
review/text: I found this company on the intranet and wanted to talk with a REAL person about a special request to create fortune cookies with special sayings about fighting cancer for a Relay for Life. We ended up getting 300 fortune cookies, were able to put the pink ribbon for breast cancer, 30 sayings (which Jen helped supply) and our team name Breast Friends.  The cookies arrived timely, it was a very easy process and they were absolutely delicious and a huge hit to the several hundred attending the relay.  I definitely recommend this company for a very special product and experience.

review/text: I'm a repeat customer. After the success I had with the first round of fortune cookies last year, I decided to order more cookies for the night of the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics. A representative of Greenfire and I worked together and came up with 60 different Olympics-related fortunes and I ordered three pounds of them. My staff loved them. I brought them to a meeting at the start of the day, and we spent almost as much time reading the fortunes to each other as we spent working. After the meeting, I left them out for the staff go nibble away at, and by the end of the night, all three pounds were gone. I got a kick out of hearing my staff laughing at the fortunes we came up with. Two successful rounds of fortunes, and I plan on being back for a third round.

review/summary: Best pistachios I ever had & most consistent
review/text: I buy pistachios a LOT. When I say a lot, I mean about once a month or so. And as far as I'm concerned Keenan is the best. I get very few "bad ones" in the entire container, whether it's this one or the plastic bags I also buy. The saltiness is perfect, the size is perfect, and Keenan really knows how to sell in bulk. I just don't bother looking at other brand names, though I am sure they are fine. But another thing to note is that Keenan's tend to be cheapest per pound. I did all the math for all the brands here on Amazon and I just get the most for my money with these or the large 32-ounce bags.

review/summary: Great nuts, almost no duds
review/text: I love pistachio nuts. So I tried these since the price was good and I am always looking for good products at low prices.<br />I wasn't disappointed. Out of the two jars of nuts, there were less than 5 duds (dried out or bad tasting nuts.<br /><br />There were less than 25 nuts that were not split open so no need for a nut cracker.<br /><br />The rest were very good to excellent in taste, ease of opening shells and amount of salt on them.<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop eating them so they only lasted less than a week. 3 1/2 pounds of pistachios in less than a week. I sure will be buying them again, but will wait a couple of months and eat pistachio ice cream in the meanwhile.<br /><br />Jewel Foods now has their own pistachio ice cream that is better than Ben and Jerry's and only costs $2.99 a half gallon instead of $4.50 a pint for B&J's. Just as many WHOLE pistachios in the ice cream (unlike the ground up ones Hagen Das uses) and the ice cream itself is creamier and better tasting than B&J's.

review/text: These pistachios are the real deal!  They are large nuts, and almost 100% of them are wide open, which makes them very easy to shell.  These nuts taste great and come in a sturdy plastic container with a screw-on top which will help keep them fresh during storage.<br /><br />There are no artificial ingredients or preservatives in these nuts and, as a big added bonus, they are grown and packaged in the USA.  The ingredient list only has two ingredients:  California pistachios (dry roasted) and sea salt.  Doesn't get more natural than that, right?<br /><br />They are so delicious that the biggest problem I have with them is keeping myself from eating a whole container of them in one sitting!

I've eaten Wonderful pistachios many times, but I prefer these. They have a great crunch and the right amount of salt. The fact that they are roasted with sea salt and are naturally tree opened makes all the difference. The pistachios come in two large containers. I finished mine off in about 10 days, but they should last you a long while if you don't attack them like I did. There are a few empty shells in the container, but it's not so many that I'd get upset about. If you've been debating on buying these, just buy them! They're worth it.

I use them to store rice as the bottle is air tight and keeps rice very dry, I order the 2 pack. I like that. They use sea salt so they are not overly salted. I only give it a 4 because some of the nuts are harder to open, Some are open shells and empty but I find the shelled nuts still in the bottom. If some are harder to open just take a half shell and use that to pry it open. That works!

review/text: Very good for the price and will probably be my new go-to pistacio until I find something better.<br /><br />I have to disagree with another review I have seen about the nuts. There are plenty that are un-openable without a nut cracker (so if you have one, don't even worry about this). There are also a decent amount that have that funky taste. Most of them taste fine and are easy to open, but they do not differ much from any other brand I have bought in those two ways.<br /><br />The main attraction here is the price for the amount. Most tiny bags in local supermarkets go for over $6 for a tiny package. It would take about 2 and a half (maybe 3) of those other brand's bags to make up just one jar of these.

review/text: This is a great product.  I am happy with the quality of the nut itself along with the seasonings.  The order came quick,  was well packaged, and has an expiration date that is a ways out (that was my biggest concern when ordering online).  This is definitely my go-to for a salty-sweet snack.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Lightly salted, fresh and infinitely better than most grocery kinds. I highly recommend these pistachios, as other brands are way too salty for me. This has just the right amount without being bland. The pistachio taste rings true.

review/summary: GREAT DELIVERY BUT PRODUCT QUALITY BELOW PAR
review/text: I JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER FROM KEENAN FARMS AND I WAS EXCITED AND PLEASED ON HOW QUICKLY IT WAS DELIVERED.  BUT WHEN I TASTED A HANDFUL OF THE PISTACHIOS, THEY WERE HORRIBLE; ARE THEY OUT OF SEASON OR WHAT?  I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT THIS TIME THEY STRUCK OUT.
