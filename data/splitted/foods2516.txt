review/summary: Yummy and healthy!
review/text: These are the only cookies I have found that I can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a "real" chocolate chip cookie. I try to limit refined sugars, wheat flour, and dairy products in my diet for health reasons, but oh, how I miss cookies. The ones I bake myself just don't taste that great, but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating. I don't know what I'd do without them! I like to freeze them, and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream "ice cream" on top. Yummy!

review/summary: The BEST cookie in the world!
review/text: Nana's Oatmeal Sunflower Cookie is not only the tastiest cookie, it is REALLY healthy! I follow a weight watchers diet and it's only 4 points for the entire cookie.  It tastes soooo good I feel like i'm indulging in something that I shouldn't be eating but I can eat it feeling guilt free!  I now live in the UK and I wish they sold them here! I have to get my mom to send them to me from the states!

review/text: Are you kidding me???  The 90 positive reviews must be the owners relatives.  This is the worst gluten free product I have ever eaten. It is dry and it is mealy.  The only way it was marginally tolerable was to smother it in chocolate icing.  My wife told me to complain to the company and I told her I didn't want them sending me any free product.

review/text: My family have a lot of food allergies and Nana's cookies are always a good snack... (except for the ginger... I am not a ginger fan.)  These are by far the best.  It taste like a brownie... very yummy.  Even my friends and family that don't have allegies love it.  I have no idea why someone gave it such a poor review... guess they are able to eat a snickers bar.  And calorie wise, it's not that bad... heck of a lot better then other cookies.  I would totally recomend these.  My 2 month old loves them and so do I and my husband.  5 stars!!!

review/summary: Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it..
review/text: These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say "one" cookie, then "half" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth.

review/text: I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it.

review/text: I was recently diagnosed with asthma, & can no longer eat wheat products. I must also go extremely light on dairy & any sugars, if I want to avoid severe illness.<br /><br />This cookie is a wonderful solution. It is tasty and chewy, just sweet enough, but it causes no negative symptoms for me. The fat content is from canola oil, which is so much healthier than the usual fat or shortening sources, even in 'healthy' cookies. It also gives me a sense of having had something from the 'bread' food group; but without the negative physical consequences.<br /><br />I am delighted to have found this cookie, & I highly recommend it!

review/text: I tend to love orange cranberry cookies, but this cookie recipe is not the best. It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S. Only the first ingredient, the whole wheat flour is organic.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE these cookies!  (and, no, I'm not a relative or friend of the manufacturer).  I've eaten the chocolate chip, oatmeal-raisin and peanut butter ones - never the gluten-free, so can't comment on them.  I love that they've no refined sugar or hydrogenated fats like most other cookies.  I've been buying them locally, and my grocery store is frequently out of them, so I was delighted to find them on amazon for cheaper than at the store.  One reviewer commented on the calories.  HUH?  First of all, who on a diet buys then dings cookies?  Also, keep in mind that just one of Nana's cookies is nearly 1/4 pound (hello?).  If you were to eat 4-1/2 regular size cookies, you'd end up with the same number of calories but they wouldn't taste as good as Nana's or be as good for you.  But you can always save what you don't want for later.  Sometimes I'll just eat half a cookie and roll up the plastic bag and tape it so I can enjoy the second half later.  So far they've kept just fine for even a couple of weeks.  No worries.

review/text: Quitting sugar is HARD. Nana's cookies make it MUCH easier. I get to enjoy the sweet & chocolately taste I crave, without the sugar or chemicals in most other cookies. They are delicious and very satisfying. Because they are sweetened with fruit juice, my blood sugar does not get spiked, so I do not get a "high" followed by a crash after eating these cookies. Nor do I feel addicted to them, like I do when I eat products made with sugar. And, I like that they are gluten free, since we are bombarded by products made from wheat, and I crave a variety of grains, like oats and rice. I highly recommend these cookies - I eat them regularly and they fulfill my craving for sweets, which has been so helpful in making better food choices when I am faced with temptation. And on Amazon, they are priced very reasonably, and worth every penny.

I've been searching for a decent sugar-free cookie for many years and have tried just about every one, but none come even close to this one. It's delicious.

review/summary: Leave the Crunch behind !! .................
review/text: These cookies are pretty good. I need something to pop in my mouth just before I run out the door to walk the dogs. I want something nutritious which won't send me into a sugar frenzy, and I want it quick.<br /><br />If crunch is your thing, these are not for you. I prefer the softer cookie now......I'd rather not crack my teeth on a harder version.... If you're up and out in a hurry, this little delicacy will do the trick !!!

review/summary: Feed your Chocolate Beast!
review/text: My husband and I are slowly becoming addicted to these cookies. While they are, to me, just ok right out of the package, they are delectable warmed up in the microwave for 30 seconds and eaten with ice cream on top! Preferably one that has some kind of chocolate in it to boost the chocolate flavor. A great alternative to sugar free products, which can cause stomach upset, for those of us that want to stay away from refined sugar! Just don't forget that these are not a low calorie food, read your labels carefully!

review/summary: Truly Healthy and Satisfying
review/text: Life with dietary restrictions can be tough. Products like Nana's cookies make it so easy. These cookies are soooooooooo good and truly have healthy ingredients. Some "healthy" cookies are hidden with potentially harmful sugars like evaporated cane juice which is just sugar albeit unrefined. Some can take it and some cant. As a hyploglycemic that needs that is very senseitve to sugar the "good" and the bad these cookies are such a healthy treat. I never feel sick after eating one even if I eat the entire cookie and I couldnt possibly be more satisfied if I ate a homemade cookie with unhealthy ingredients. These cookies all of them I have tried are delicious. The gluten free options are not quite as good but if you must stay away from gluten all together they are a great version. This is the ULTIMATE cookie!

review/summary: My Favorite Nana
review/text: Interesting thing about reviews: you can tell as much about the reviewers as the items they're writing about.<br /><br />I've tried almost all of Nana's products and the No Gluten Ginger Cookie is my FAVORITE.  There's absolutely no guilt for me.  Brown rice and tapioca flour?  Fruit juice?  Canola oil?  What's not to like?  If, like me, you have to avoid dairy and sugar cane, it can be difficult to find a sweet treat that satisfies.  And if your girlfriend is gluten-free?  Well, now you're really in trouble.<br /><br />Fortunately, along comes Nana.<br /><br />This cookie has a great texture (almost like a scone: the real kind, from the UK) and a little kick.  It somehow maintains that perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  (See preamble, above.)  As with most of Nana's products, there's just one problem: I would be happier if the cookie were about as big as my head.  But that's why they come in boxes of twelve: one box lasts almost a week!<br /><br />Nana's other gluten free, dairy free, sugar free flavors - chocolate, lemon, and chocolate crunch - are all wonderful too, but this little wanton want-one is special.  Trust me.  Don't listen to the naysayers.  They just don't appreciate perfection; moist, buttery, spicy-sweetness.<br /><br />(See preamble, above.)<br /><br />Dear Nana: whatever that "natural flavoring" is, which hits the roof of my mouth like a monkey landing on my back, please don't take it out.  I pledge my everlasting devotion to your kitchen.  I'll even wash the dishes...

review/summary: Cookie + soy/rice milk = delicious
review/text: I was diagnosed with severe gluten and egg allergies roughly a year ago and had a hard time parting with my favorite kind of baked good: cookies. I never ate many in the first place but they were a treat or desert and I was thrilled to find a lemon cookie that satisfied my desire for baked goods.<br /><br />The consistency can be off-putting at first but the longer I go without wheat or gluten products the less important the consistency because I have almost forgotten what a real cookie tastes like. These lemon cookies are not tart but have a very nice lemony flavor that is reminiscent of a lemon bar. They are heavy and thick like a dense cake or brownie and incredibly chewy and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I would usually freeze these for a couple hours before taking one to school with me to have between classes. If you're able to drink soy or rice milk then a glass of vanilla or plain flavored milk will go great with these!

review/summary: Nana's Ginger Cookies Rock!! Go Nana!!
review/text: These cookies are soooo delicious!  Due to Celiac Disease and other gluten intolerances, three members out of our family of five must be gluten free.  These cookies sure fit the bill for a treat!  They are delicious, and even though they crumble a bit (if you eat gluten free you would probably be used to this since rice flour is commonly used, and it crumbles), they still have a soft moisture to them.  The ginger flavor is really good and not any spicier than a ginger snap.  My two boys ages 9 and 11 LOVE them.  When I pull the cookies out of the grocery bag, they dance around with joy!  The true test was when my husband tried one.  He does not have to eat gluten free, nor does he care to, lol.  He really liked it, and has since requested them when I shop! A+++ for these!!  Thanks Nana!

review/summary: Very distinct & pungent aroma
review/text: This is my first order of sesame oil, after reading & hearing of Ayurvedic medicine practiced in India for thousands of years.<br /><br />I purchased this to use on my skin and also cook some vegetables in and otherwise ingest as well, as the benefits reported are numerous on both counts.<br /><br />What I've learned thus far in relation to the benefits for the skin are as follows, summarized briefly: Sesame oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties, as well as what you may expect as to moisturizing the skin, as it is a naturally occurring oil in the environment. I really wanted organic, cold-pressed oil, and this product didn't say either, but I bought it anyway, to try out since it is my first try. I've read it's great for athlete's foot and even toenail infections, acne and other skin conditions including dandruff & psoriasis. Do a search on the benefits of sesame oil & you'll get a great deal of hits, including Lance Armstrong's site, Livestrong, as there are also reported benefits of halting cancer growth. I don't believe I can include links here which won't be edited out, so you'll have to check those on your own.<br /><br />Internally, there are also benefits to your GI system and organs in general. This seems a great, all-purpose solution to many issues we currently have in this Western society of the USA. I'm excited to see what benefits I'll experience while using this (to me) new method of healing with food.<br /><br />Now, having explained why I purchased it in the first place, let me say that this particular product is of the darker variety, and has a very strong burned nut odor to it. Nevertheless, I did apply it to my hands, arms, legs and feet yesterday evening and allowed it plenty of time to soak in. It wasn't greasy anymore for me just before bed, so I left it on & slept with it overnight. As I expected with any oil I may have used, I woke up with soft, smooth skin that felt nourished, not dry & itchy in winter months as usual, and I'm in Florida, so I imagine those in colder climates may enjoy those particular benefits even more.<br /><br />I also wanted to use this for my son's acne (14 years of age) but it smells so badly to him that he wouldn't allow that.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase & am beginning this new regimen, though I do wish I had held out for the cold-pressed organic oil instead, which I hear doesn't have such a strong odor. I'm hoping that the benefits will still be realized, however, as I now have quite a bit of oil here to use on a daily basis.<br /><br />It was packaged very well within Amazon's shipping box, and arrived very quickly as most of my items do, but in fairness, I have the Prime membership with 2-day shipping. The outside of the box was labeled "GLASS" which confused me, but worked nevertheless, for handling, as it arrived perfectly preserved as it should be.

review/summary: Excellent soup base, LOW Sodium
review/text: I found this base in a oriental supermarket.  It is the best base you cn buy.  The sodium in this is 190 mg compared to Knorr's 940 mg sodium.  The Totole is excellent.  The knorrs is good but way too salty.  If you want a great chicken flavor use this brand. I never comment, but want to share my experience.  I have bought every kind of soup base tying to get the totole flavor. Buy this stuff or go to an oriental super market.  It must be a huge one or they will not have it.

review/summary: Not the same as canned
review/text: My husband LOVES Dr. Brown's Black Cherry sold in a can but it's very hard to find in a store locally; even a big city.  He often orders it when we eat at a deli and loves it.  I bought it online for his birthday about a year ago and while it was "ok" he said it wasn't the same as what he drinks out of the can at the deli.  I noticed that there was a substantial price difference between the bottles and canned Dr. Brown's Black Cherry Soda online and since this was cheaper I ordered it.  Not sure why they're different but they are.

review/text: I used to buy canned hearts of palm at Trader Joes, until they discontinued them. They still sell jarred HOP, but they taste "treated" and I don't like the texture. The Reese HOP at the grocery store cost almost $5 per can and I can't justify that expense. I'm glad I found them here - they taste great, I rarely get any stalks that are inedible, and at $3 a can the price can't be beat. They always arrive quickly, too.

review/text: I have purchased this product at a much higher price in stores.  I was glad to see it being carried by Amazon at a lower price. I was disappointed in the quality however.  There was at least one "woody" palm heart in every can.  I have never had this happen before when I had purchased them locally.  To have an entire case like this was quite an unpleasant surprise! Palm hearts are one of my favorite foods and I will purchase them again, but will probably try another brand.

review/summary: Exactly like Brazilian Heart of Palms
review/text: Have you been looking for those heart of palms that you ate at a Brazilian restaurant, or even in your last trip to Brazil?<br />Your search is over!<br />Even though these come from Peru, they are from the exact same palm tree of Brazilian heart of palms.<br /><br />This product is not mushy, tasteless, yellowish, and of a conical shape like those from Ecuador, Costa Rica, etc... that you find at grocery stores and discount clubs.<br /><br />Brazilian heart of palms have strong smell and taste and are acidic. Finding woody hearts is usual and this is done by Nature. But, these woody chunks can be sauteed, used in soups (check Emeril Lagasse's recipes), and in pies (add them to chicken pot pie). A little bit of cooking makes them very soft.<br /><br />Finally, Brazilian type heart of palms start changing colors as soon as the palm tree is cut. From white towards grayish/pinkish tones, which is accelerated in contact with air and aluminum cooking utensils. But the taste doesn't change at all.

review/text: I enjoyed each and every piece of palm, in every can.  I love these things.  The consistency and texture varied from one can to another, as did size.  But I like this, and I believe that this would be a natural occurrence.  Organic products would probably grow in a more widely varying array of sizes and environments, and thus might have less consistent products produced from them.  I am definitely going to order more.

Unbeatable.<br />The palms are smaller than usual, but also more tender than usual probably because they were extracted from young plants (usually fits 6 in a 14oz can and here they were 13 small ones). I also liked that they are organic and protect the forests while you enjoy one of the most delicious food on earth.

review/summary: Great low calorie ready-to-eat snack
review/text: Palm hearts are a great low calorie, ready-to-eat snack.  The pop-top makes these even more convenient.  I have found this brand to be consistently good.  These are not pre-cut into small slices.  Most of the pre-cut brands I have tried have had poor pieces.  There is a bit of a risk ordering a whole case since if a woody piece gets into the cans, it might well affect the whole batch that gets put into a case.  So far I have good luck with the cases of these.

review/summary: Hearts of Palm
review/text: I have ordered this brand lots of times before.  My 5 year old grand daughter loves, loves, loves hearts of palm.  In the past, each can contained 4 or 5 huge palms.  None were ever hard.  This last batch is different.  Each can containes 9 or 10 smaller hearts, and several times she has come across palms that are extremely hard and impossible to eat.  I checked them out myself, so I know it's true.  Overall, their product is good, and reasonably priced in comparision to other brands of palms, this shipment was somewhat a disappointment.

review/summary: NOT ANYTHING close to the ones discontinued @Costco
review/text: Contrary to other reviews (which sold me) I did not find these anywhere near the quality of the ones I miss so much at Costco.  They have a grey-ish tint to them which is unappealing.  They were tolerable the first day out of the can but the texture degrades immediately thereafter (hence the organic?).  If they are not used before the third day I think that you will be completely disappointed.  I found that they turned to mush and turned an even darker shade of gray.  I made sure that I had them in an airtight storage container, in the frig, in all of the liquid that was contained in the can.  The color you see on their label is most assuredly not what you will find inside.  If I could return the more than 1/2 case I have left, I would.  And I made sure to cancel the auto ship.<br /><br />P.S.  This is only the second review I have ever taken the time to write on this site in the entire 10+ years I have been shopping on Amazon. (The other was a 4-star positive) I was utterly dissatisfied with these hearts of palm and have no idea what I'll do with the balance.

review/summary: Our whole family likes these hearts of palm
review/text: Everyone in my family likes these -- including the children.  I used to buy them at Whole Foods, but then our local store stopped carrying them.  I was happy to find them here and at a reasonable price.  However I am reducing the rating because in the one case I have ordered so far the interior box was damaged; several of the cans were severely dented, and it was clear that it had happened before shipping.  (The outside box was intact.)  One reviewer said that her case contained many woody stems.  We have been lucky, I guess. We occasionally get a woodier stem, but overall the quality has been very good.  My only other complaint is that I wish Native Forest sold their hearts of palm in jars.  Nevertheless I am about to order our second case.

review/summary: Horrible...
review/text: I love peanut butter; if civilization ends I will raid stores to ensure I have enough peanut butter and honey to last as long as I live; I consider peanut butter to be the food of the gods...that said, when I raid the post-apocalyptic stores for peanut butter I will leave this on the shelf!<br /><br />I have been trying various organic peanut butters to try to find one that tastes good but is healthier; enter "Once Again American Classic".<br /><br />The consistency of this product is more a paste than a butter, and contrary to the label it does need to be stirred as the paste is much thicker in the bottom of the jar.  As to texture, well, it is kind of an oily goo with a lot of grainy stuff, similar to fine sand but not as hard, mixed in it.  It reminded me of light brown sand textured floor paint that has really thickened...<br /><br />As to taste - I don't know how to describe it...it did not taste like traditional peanut butter, but then a lot of the organics don't, but it did not taste like roasted peanuts, either (and I know, because I have also eaten lots and lots of fresh roasted peanuts down here in South Georgia).  I don't know what it tasted like, because it was a flavor that I have never tasted before, and have no intention of tasting again!  After I swallowed it (which I almost didn't) it felt like the sides of my tongue wanted to curl up, and I could not stop spitting; drinking water did not help, but mouthwash seems to be relieving the sensation...<br /><br />The product gets "one star" simply because I cannot post a review with "zero stars"...

review/summary: A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course
review/text: My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner.
