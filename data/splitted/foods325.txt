review/summary: Junk Food
review/text: I was feeding our cat 2 cans a day of Fancy Feast for six months. No snacks or treats or other food. She's very active and gained 1 and 1/2 pounds in that time. After speaking with our vet who was concerned about the weight gain she referred to Fancy Feast as the McDonalds of cat food. Junk food essentially. High in calories and fat. Sure your cat loves it.. but would you feed you kids McDonalds every day just because they like it? Find something better. Wellness, EVO, Avoderm, Purina Pro or Royal Canin are all better for your pet.

review/summary: Wasn't impress with the Fancy Feast or the Hagen Catit Design
review/text: I bought the fancy feast from you because I like the idea I didn't have to pay shipping.  That was a lie though you guys charged me shipping.  Plus the price is the same in the local grocery store.  The toy Hagen Catit Design Senses Play Circuit was ok but centainly not as great as the company stated it was. I'm very disapointed with this purchase of both items and I don't believe I'll be buying anymore for Amazon.

review/summary: My cats got sick from this!
review/text: I started ordering these cases a few months ago and had to cancel after my cats threw up on two different occasions after eating this food... One of my cats NEVER EVER throws up and threw up from this-- and the only two cats who threw up were the ones who ate this! So I'm 99% sure it was from the food. Since it happened again a couple of weeks later, I decided I better stop ordering this food. Sure enough, no throwing up anymore.

PetsMart sells this product for $.53 if you have a PetPerks card; Walmart sells it for $.53 period. If you live in an area that has no Walmart or PetsMart, I suggest shopping around a bit -- there's bound to be a better deal somewhere on the Internet.

review/summary: decent berry tea
review/text: I drink tea on a very regular basis.  Mostly blacks, but I have green, white & rooibos in my collection.  I usually drink premium loose leaf teas and brew them in either a french press or now, my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas 0 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a> tea maker (I prefer the french press).  My usual favorite blacks run thirty to fifty a pound.<br /><br />When I opened the bag I was amazed at the smell...it was just as good as the berry tea at Wegman's (NE premium grocery chain).  I just made my first using the adagio ingenuiTEA brewer.  You can definitely taste the berry, but it's on the weaker side compared to Wegman's.  The tea was smooth and seems to be low in caffeine.<br /><br />I honestly don't think it's worth the MSRP of thirty eight per pound (or even the current price of thirty).  The only reason I took the risk on a pound was that, at the time I purchased, it was on sale and there was a coupon which brought it down to twelve per pound.  For the price I paid it's  a steal.  I have a feeling this will make some really incredible iced tea.<br /><br />FYI - My ratings are based SOLELY on the product itself and not the manufacturer, price, purchase, shipping or some other stupid reason.  All of those are NOT related to the product and can happen to any product you buy!!!  Come on people, when you write a review stick to the PRODUCT not some other random reason.

review/summary: Hot soup in 3 minutes
review/text: This isn't the best soup out there, but the best for the price.<br /><br />Just add water & pop it in the microwave for 3 minutes, for over a pint of noodle & spice rich hot soup... great during the cold winter. Add your own ingredients or spices to make it richer. These usually sell in local & online stores for 11 cents each.<br /><br />Their cup of soup products is 25-29 cents each because you can eat it right out of the provided container. The over a full cup of soup cooks in 2 minutes in the microwave. Buy them by the case to save more. They have a shelf life of years with no refrigeration.<br /><br />These are not intended as a substitute for a full balanced meal, but as a hot snack or hot quick lunch.<br /><br />There's a lot of whining about nutritional content of these. But they're almost about as nutritional as any brand of soup out there except the most chunky & expensive brands. Whattya want for 11-25 cents?<br /><br />I think they're very handy & filling when a hurry or on a diet, for the price.<br /><br />I've add cheese, powdered cheese, a little tomato sauces, or powdered garlic & onion to these to make them taste extra super. Use you imagination, they're incredibly cheap, hot, & ready in minutes.

review/summary: Really tasty, especially how I prepare it *RECIPE INSIDE*
review/text: You can find these in your local grocery stores for a price of about less than a quarter each, so this is a bit of a rip-off.<br /><br />I saw the other review with the person using a microwave(?). I don't use a microwave, however I suspect he may be talking about about a different instant ramen.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE ON A DIET. If you just want a snack, then this is the perfect product for you. Its cheap, filling, and tasty, but it has virtually no nutritional and can be bad(and slightly fattening) in excess. If you like, you can do an experiment on what happens in your stomach until you fully excrete it: place ramen in large container, add two cups of water, and wait a few months to see what happens. Again: IT'S JUST A SNACK OR LIGHT MEAL(LIKE BRUNCH). ON IT'S OWN, IT HAS VIRTUALLY NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND CAN BE UNHEALTHY IN EXCESS.<br /><br />As an Asian, I grew up with this product simply because of cultural values(it says ramen,so in my family it's Asian); so I had a LONG time to develop a recipe.<br /><br />To attain my level of ramen, which my baby sister still adores, I stretch the time to 13 minutes.<br /><br />How I make it:<br /><br />1. Put ramen in regular pot and add two and 1/8 cups of water, or more or less if desired.<br />2. Put to boil on the highest setting possible for ten minutes, or less time if you are unwilling to wait long, stirring constantly. When ramen reaches boiling point, add soup packet. Stir with a wooden spoon and insulated long fork(or spaghetti fork)or chopsticks to avoid burning. Boil for a bit more, if desired. The more you boil, the softer and fuller the noodles. Turn off heat immediately and let cool. Leave as is or add desired ingredients WHILE ramen is cooking. If water gets too low, add water.<br /><br />Have you ever heard of egg drop soup? With ramen, you can make it easily:<br /><br />OPTIONAL: To get more "traditional": add green onions(1 or 2 chopped), soy sauce(1 tbs), ginger(grated, 1/2 tsp), mushrooms(sliced, 1/2 cup), sesame oil(1 tsp), white pepper(1/4 tsp or 1/2 tsp of sugar to substitute), and cornstarch(1 tbs dissolved with 1/2 cup of water set aside previously from the 2 1/8 cups).Ingredients must be added before eggs, so you can keep heat slightly longer but remember to stir entire time to avoid noodles sticking to pot. Add more water, if necessary.<br /><br />3. Immediately after removing heat, add beated or non beated eggs(3) through a fork(or 3 to 4 chopsticks), while stirring the soup. I pick up some parts of the egg with one hand through the utensil and stir with other, though I usually need help stirring at the end. Stir quickly for one minute to get "shreds" or slowly until eggs "form" to get "ribbons"(only on one direction: clockwise).<br />Note: beaten eggs must be beaten VERY lightly so NO BUBBLES FORM<br />The end result is VERY tasty.<br /><br />There are many variations of this soup. My particular version without egg or veggies feeds 1 or 2 people or, if your getting fancy with the veggies or eggs, 2-3 people, and if you got fancy with the egg and veggies, then 3-4 people. If you add even more things, it feeds 5-more people.<br /><br />Be creative, though. Add whatever you like. My dad, who was part Japanese and part Chinese and part Filipino added squid sauce(it did taste good) and white jasmine rice(after boiling) and my Hispanic(slightly Italian, but not culturally) mother added chile(hot sauce) and lemon. My aunt, who looked more and acted more Italian than Mexican made it into Minestra Maritata or Italian Wedding Soup. So, base a recipe into your ramen, or just add things to meet your cravings. All in all, it's a flexible, hot soup good for a sick-day or just a snack.

review/text: I originally found these at Wegman's and tried the Chili and the Olive Oil and Sea Salt varieties.  They were a big hit with everyone that tried them.  When I returned to Wegman's to get more they were out of the Olive Oil and Sea Salt so I headed online.  I recommend that you try these with relatively strong flavored cheeses since they are fairly thick and aggressively seasoned.  Wegman's got them back in stock so I will buy from them because of the great difference in cost.  On line is very expensive.

review/summary: Blueberry Muffin - the Best Larabar Ever!!!
review/text: This is the most awesome-tasting Larabar ever.  I've given all Larabars 5 stars, but this one (Blueberry Muffin) is the best one ever!!!  If you only try one flavor of Larabar, let it be Blueberry Muffin.<br /><br />The Larabar people obviously are really good at what they do.  They make all these Larabars taste exactly like whatever it is they are, but without any added sugar, preservatives, soy, or other bad stuff.  All ingredients are natural.  For example, these Blueberry Muffin Larabars (the feature Larabar) tastes just like a blueberry muffin.  The Pecan Pie Larabar tastes justs like a pecan pie.  The Peanut Butter Cookie Larabar tastes justs like peanut butter cookie.  The Cashew Cookie Larabar, to me, tastes like shortbread cookie.  The coconut Larabar tastes like an awesome coconut treat.  The Lemon Bar Larabar tastes just like a lemon bar.  The Banana Bread Larabar tastes just like banana bread.  And so on and so forth.<br /><br />The Larabar people don't do just taste, but also texture.  For example, this Blueberry Muffin has a different texture than the Peanut Butter Cookie or the Cashew Cookie.  Those two cookies have a harder texture, like a cookie.  But the blueberry muffin has a softer texture, like a muffin.<br /><br />I can't get over how awesome the Blueberry Muffin Larabar is.  It is the perfect blend of ingredients that give it the awesome and perfect taste and texture.  And they do not skimp on blueberries.  I love the taste of blueberries, and it has a rich and wonderful taste of blueberries.<br /><br />This is the best Larabar of all of them, and I've had them all.  I do love all of them, though, and I've given 5 stars to all of them.<br /><br />Larabars are vegan, all natural, no soy, etc.  They are so good, even if you are not vegan, or don't care about healthy bars, I think you would still love them because they are so good.  We don't have to skimp on taste just because they are vegan, healthy, soy-free, etc.

As a curiosity, I e-mailed a request in regards to spoilage/preserving & got a VERY prepared ,non-answer, statement "...all natural, blah, blah...." from General Mills (guess they run the show). When I replied, asking for better info = no response. Never had issues w/ order from Amazon but the later order DIRECT from Lara Bar BECAME COVERED WITH WHITE FUZZ!!!!!!!! I wonder how many bars I ate without looking! Also, if these were factory sealed & fresh, I assume the mold was inside the product from the start! FYI, the mold developed 4 months before expiration date & at stable temps ~ 65-68 deg. I called re the issue & gave them all the info. Sorry .. adv the quality team .. send coupon .. normal reaction. Cust Service rep was going to send a coupon to cover the $ for another. I mentioned the shipping price so she said she would send more. Problem is she sent COUPONS for STORE purchases. Will see how/if I remember to order by mail! No internet credit, etc. No one sells Lara Bars In Central Wisconsin. Also, the coupons she sent wont cover freight & aren't for a 16 count box!!! just a bunch of stuff. This 1-star is for General Mills C/S (kinda stupid) & the mildew/mold. No issues w/ other Lara products - they are excellent

review/text: I'm a big fan of Larabars in general and have been eating them for years. I've liked almost every flavor, though of course some are bigger hits with me than others. I really like the cherry pie, not so much the pecan pie or cashew cookie. Honestly the blueberry muffin is the first one I've tried where it was so gross I couldn't even finish it! It doesn't taste like blueberry at all, just kind of like weirdly sour and mushy cashews. Maybe I got a bad bar, but I will never try this flavor again unless someone could assure me they normally taste better. It was really so bad I couldn't even choke it down.

review/summary: Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats
review/text: For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!

review/summary: I like these!
review/text: These are actually very tasty.  Pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler "stuff."  No bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  They cook well in either the oven or microwave.  I add a touch of either salt & pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  I rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  However, this item is a fairly good value for the money.

review/text: I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.

review/summary: Au Gratin Potatoes
review/text: January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

review/summary: BEWARE - MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like "THREE DOG BAKERY" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label "MADE IN CHINA" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it. Thanks again for the reviews and concerns of the caring people out there.

review/summary: Dogswell chicken and apple, banana, sweet potato treats
review/text: I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!

He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it.

review/summary: Dodger Loves It!
review/text: On occasion, my daughter and son-in-law will go away and leave their Shitsu (Dodger) with us for a few days visit.  When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.  That includes a large jar of assorted treats. Sometimes I'd wonder why they're called treats because he often doesn't get excited by any of the many varieties that jar contains.  I mentioned this to my daughter and she referred me to this product. We ordered it (from Amazon) on his last visit and I was amazed at how quickly he accepted and consumed them when offered. Unlike others which he might shun or sometimes take and may not actually eat, the Happy Hips treats were always eaten right away. Both Dodger and I rate this product as a "buy now".

review/text: My Rottie, with a sensitive stomach, is able to tolerate these treats well.  The best part is she actually has to chew them for a few moments...if you have a Rottwieler you know what I mean.  Any treat is chomped on in 1 second and gone... I feel good about these treats because they seem very healthy for large dogs...although, my daughters Chiauau loves them !

review/summary: Chewy veggie bliss!
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor, nor is there an oily or greasy residue.  They are the same high quality treats we've become accustomed to buying from Dogswell.  Our dog LOVES them and we'll be buying them again in the future as they are a nice change from the "meat" jerky varieties she has been eating for years.  Next time we'll try apple!

review/summary: Another favorite snack of my dogs
review/text: For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

review/text: Dogswell brand treats are the best I have found. After the gluten scare I searched for natural ingredients treats and found these which he loves. Even though they are made in china they are continually tested here in the US for quality control and have always passed. My dog has alergies and with two basic ingrediants I don't have to worry. He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.

review/summary: Our Dog Loves These Treats
review/text: Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.  Amazon has a better price on this than any other place that carries them. The only problem we have is now the dog tends to "guard" the hall chest where we keep the treats and gaze hopefully at anyone walking through.  :-)<br /><br />Our dog has been getting them for about a month.  While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.

review/summary: Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?
review/text: I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super "high" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.

review/text: My dog Mona just loves her Happy Hips chicken & sweet potato treats. They are not only delicious or so it seems, but they seem to ease the stiffness in her hips. Please keep making them.

review/summary: My dogs won't eat this!
review/text: My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.  They're almost impossible to chew (unless I soak them in boiling water for at least 30 minutes, which presumably would leech the nutrients from the chews).  When the lab first tried these, they cut her gums, and when she would leave pieces of the chew on the floor, if I stepped on them before noticing them, they'd cut my foot!  I noticed this about ALL the varieties of Dogswells Sweet Potato Chews.  I threw them all out.

review/summary: Dogswell Veggie Life Happy Hips Chicken & Sweet Potato, 5-Ounce Blue Pouches (Pack of 6)
review/text: These doggie treats are very good (Just ask my dog!) and quite a bit cheaper than purchasing them locally. Same product I had  been purchasing at the local pet store but at quite a savings.

review/summary: A great snack for your dog
review/text: My poodle just loves these healthy and nutritious snacks.  The natural sweetness of the apple combined with the chewiness of the chicken wrap makes a perfect treat.  He jumps for joy at the sight of the bag (which is resealable for freshness).  Great choice!

review/summary: My dogs love them
review/text: The only problem I have with this item is ONLY giving my dogs one a day! They love them! Better than almost everything else! They are hard to get locally, so I ordered them on here. I have a golden and a belgian, and both are larger and one is already showing hip issues. So I give them both supplements (the best I can get) and this is just one more item. I keep organic peanut butter cookies and other snacks for them, but they would prefer these!<br /><br />The order arrived quickly and was wrapped well. I will order again!

review/summary: Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.
review/text: Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.
