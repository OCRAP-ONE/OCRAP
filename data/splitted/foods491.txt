review/summary: Low Nutrition, but Gluten-Free
review/text: It's hard to find gluten-free foods that taste good.  This cereal tastes pretty-good and is gluten-free.  There maybe other 'natural/organic' cereals with better nutrition, but are they gluten-free?  Did I mention that this is gluten-free?

review/summary: Gluten Free, but also vitamin free?
review/text: This cereal tastes great, and it is hard to find many items that the kids will eat.  However, I was surprised when looking at the label, that most of the nutrition content only improved slightly by adding milk.  Otherwise, there is no nutritional content to justify this as "healthy".  Be sure to check the label before ordering, I wish I had.  There are other things that are gluten free, that would provide more nutritional value.

review/summary: Imitation Blueberries
review/text: What exactly is  an imitation blueberry anyway? I bought this thinking it was dried blueberries, but after tasting it, I  thought I'd better take a closer look at the box. If you enjoy real blueberries, you will know immediately that something is wrong. The box does say clearly it has "imitation blueberries" in it. It's nothing short of awful, with a fake blueberry extract throughout the pancake, so you can't even pick out the "blueberries" from the pancake.  No one in my family would eat these.

review/summary: Not so much...
review/text: Tastes like granola.<br /><br />That's pretty much all I could say in a positive review. Now let me get to the negatives:<br /><br />1) The granola has an almost stale characteristic to it. I don't think I'd call it rock-hard, but they've taken crunchy a little over-board. You have to soak it in milk for at least ten minutes before it becomes palatable. (I suspect that it is the lack of fat that makes it this way).<br /><br />2) If you didn't read it on the package, you wouldn't really know there were apples in this.  There is no apple taste to speak of, and I'm not sure where they're hiding.  And if you didn't see the little dried pink strawberries, you wouldn't know there were strawberries in there either. It just tastes like granola -- nothing special.<br /><br />3) The bag isn't any good.  I realize this is taking the review to the extreme, but this stuff is packaged in a clear plastic that is difficult to open (and virtually impossible without scissors).  After you get that first bowl-full, you've gotta be careful to avoid creasing or ripping the plastic at the top of the open bag.  If you fail, the plastic tears down the side of the bag, and you have a big granola mess.  Now maybe you're not as clumsy as I am before my first cup of coffee, but I tend to be a little cranky in the morning when my granola bag tears and I have to find another container to store the stuff in (assuming the dog isn't eating it off the floor for me).<br /><br />4) Not exactly cheap, is it?  Folks, this 12-ounce bag is really small - probably no more than five modest servings.

review/summary: Strawberries? Blue strawberries that are round?
review/text: This may be my own unique experience but I didn't have any strawberries in my cereal although I did find a few blueberry (freeze dried)pieces. And while I don't care enough to complain to Amazon, I may register a minor complaint with the company since this is a sign of poor quality control. Otherwise, I am enjoying the product. It's a mild blueberry flavor which complements the apples nicely. My guess is that the strawberry favor might be similarly mild but who knows? Though I have yet to open all the bags, a quick scan suggests that blueberries may be all I find even though they are all labeled "strawberry".

review/text: I ordered two pounds of Scott's Cakes' Raspberry Butter Cookies, hoping that they would live up to my high expectations. Well, they most certainly did! I can no longer find what I consider to be tasty raspberry butter cookies in local bakeries or supermarkets. Either they are not available or the quality is alway disappointing. Not so with these scrumptious treats. Soft, buttery cookie dough, with really delicious, slightly tart raspberry centers--not the bland, starchy raspberry fillings that seem to be universally prevalent these days. Well done! I'll be ordering more very soon.

review/text: This is the only peanut butter I buy now. It tastes exactly like normal JIF peanut butter, but adds an Omega 3 boost. The previous reviewer scorned it because of the fish oil, which I'll admit made me squeamish too at first, but I've honestly never tasted anything fishy in this peanut butter. And unlike actual fish, or fish oil capsules, I've never burped up fish either after eating this peanut butter. Considering these alternatives, I'd rather get my daily Omega 3 boosts in this extremely tasty way, especially since I eat a lot of peanut butter anyway.

review/summary: Hey, you got your fish in my peanut butter!
review/text: So...I should have read the ingredients list before buying. The Omega-3's in this are derived from sardine and anchovy oil. Also includes tilapia gelatin. Sounds yummy, right? Actually, the peanut butter doesn't taste bad, but every time I take a bite my mind starts thinking about tilapia gelatin. On a level, I know it isn't really any different than a fish oil pill, but that gelatin thing FREAKS me out.<br /><br />Seriously, the fish oil and gelatin are basically tasteless and odorless, but I couldn't make it through my PB&J and gave it to my dogs. They swallowed it without a second thought, but I am certain the dogs have probably eaten worse things.<br /><br />I recommend it if you want to try and incorporate more Omega-3 into your diet. Just don't think about what you are ingesting.  Fish oil and gelatin and strawberry jelly just seem wrong, so I am thinking of reserving this for something like Thai peanut noodles.

review/text: I discovered this oatmeal quite by accident last year while looking for something whole grain to have for breakfast - on a path to eating healthier. Since I'm diabetic as well, it's important the carbs not be outrageous as well. It needed to be quick, nourishing and taste good enough I'd stick to it. Since then, I've had this oatmeal for breakfast at least 5 times per week since my first discovery. I even take it on vacation (when I can and know I have access to a microwave). It's filling, I love the taste and it's good for me. I've lost quite a bit of weight in the past year, all in part of eating healthier and exercising more.

I guess that next time I'm in that area, I'll simply be cleaning out their available stock.<br /><br />It would be nice if there were an even number of pouches per box - a 100-calorie packet is mighty tiny if you're not anorexic.  Two pouches make for a nice, rib-sticking meal, though.

review/summary: Amazing Cuban Coffee
review/text: Hands down the best Cuban coffee out there.  Pilon and Bustello are both good, but neither matches the intense aroma and rich flavor of La Llave. It's strong but not overpowering or bitter.  Highly recommend trying this brand out if you like a strong espresso.

review/summary: A richer roast than either Bustelo or Pil&oacute;n.
review/text: A Cuban friend (who happens to be the owner and operator of a small, family style Cuban restaurant) suggested that I try La Llave.  He said that it was the best and the most authentic Cuban coffee.  And he was right.  He made me a believer.  Bustelo and Pil&oacute;n are both good, but La Llave has them both beat for the richness of the roast, aroma and flavor.  Try them side by side and I did, and you will be convinced too.  Don't trust me.  Compare for yourself and trust your own senses.

review/text: This coffee has such an amazing aroma just as you're scooping from the package that even before it hits your lips you know it'll be a delight.<br /><br />Yes, Starbucks serves espresso, and it's not bad, but it's not La Llave. I'm not sure what it is, or if the blend of beans in La Llave is somewhat "tailored" to the latin taste bud , but it's a perfect little cup every single time I make it in my tiny stove top espresso pot.<br /><br />Please don't make the mistake of trying it in your regular coffee maker in hopes of getting a rich tasting coffee, it's really ground too finely for that (so you'll be tasting coffee grounds instead of coffee) .<br /><br />I've never purchased it on Amazon because they carry it at a store under a mile from my home,  but I do wish Amazon offered more buying choices .<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: A bitter taste
review/text: OK to be fair we always have Lavazza or Illy on hand,  I wanted to try something different at a lower cost. These for us seems to have a bitter taste, I am not impressed yet.  I don't know if we got a bad batch or what? It to the point where I am even considering throwing it out and getting more Lavazza.  I bought the brick, use in a pressure machine.  We also find Starbucks has a  weird aftertaste like the beans are over roasted, possibly the same problem here??  So far made 3 cups and 2 stars is all we can give.  I even used a different milk for steaming thinking that could possibly be the culprit,  still bitter sour, it certainly the coffee.

review/summary: Not as good as Lavazza
review/text: After having read the positive reviews by those who liked Cafe La Llava, I gave it a try. For under $4.00, it was not bad. Normally not a dark roast fan (can't stand Starbucks) I found Cafe La Llave to be very smooth. However, it was not as good as Lavazza Crema e Gusto Espresso or Lavazza Super Crema Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso. I will use Cafe La Llava in my espresso maker when I want espresso. As for my morning coffee on the weekends when I don't have to go to work, I will continue to drink Lavazza for its rich, creamy, flavorful and satisfying taste. Since I've had Lavazza, I am spoiled and choose it over all American brands of coffee. I wish we had one like it in the US. It would certainly save money, because unlike Cafe La Llava, it is pricey. However, Lavazza is not wasted as it is that good.

review/summary: Aztec Chocolate Bitters--The Bitter Truth
review/text: I'm sorry to say the Aztec bitters are a terrible product. I do enjoy some of the Fee Brother's other bitters, the orange and the whiskey barrel. But this one reeks of artificial chocolate flavoring and I didn't detect the slightest bit of heat or spice--just cloying sweetness all the way. If you're at all serious about cocktails, don't throw your money away. I think this was a flimsy attempt to compete with the new Bitterman's line that's coming out soon. If you happen to try the Fee Brother's chocolate bitters anyway, don't even think about experimenting with a Manhattan. Don't do it--your whiskey will never forgive you.

review/summary: Pleasantly different, subtle and interesting
review/text: I must admit I'm not typically a fan of mole flavoring when it comes to mexican dishes. But I love Mexican hot chocolate and this is precisely the flavor that this bitters brings to the table. I've found that adding a few dashes of Fee Brothers Aztec Chocolate to a black/white russian really brings out layers of subtlety. I have also found from a non-cocktail perspective a few dashes are perfect to add to morning coffee or hot chocolate. There's not a lot of spice but the cinnamon and chocolate definitely come through. Not a direct replacement for angostura in every cocktail but really shines if you put some thought into application.

review/summary: Yes, now WITHOUT real butter...and taste suffers big time
review/text: I'm not sure exactly when the change was made, but the last several batches we've bought no longer contain real butter.  At first we didn't realize this and thought maybe we just had a bad couple of batches, but after sleuthing a bit I found that the butter has been replaced with butter flavoring -- big mistake.  Now the popcorn that was much better than anything else out there, no longer tempts our taste buds.  Pop Secret brand was bought out by another company and I suppose in their infinite wisdom decided to make - or at least keep - the change (probably to save a few bucks).  But this will backfire on them and I'm sure the complaints have already been piling up.

review/summary: This is NOT the same product it used to be!
review/text: I was disappointed to learn that General Mills sold this product to Diamond Foods (the nut company) in early 2009.  Since then, Pop Secret Homestyle has become unrecognizable.  The kernels are larger than they used to be and they have so many husks that it chokes you to swallow it.  Not to mention the fact that you need to keep toothpicks and dental floss nearby! Oh, and make sure you have something to drink handy while eating it because of the choking issue. It it really unpleasant!  They also did something to the flavor.  I suspect that they no longer use real butter because now it has no flavor at all.  It is just salty and greasy.<br /><br />I used to have trouble keeping Pop Secret in my house because it would be devoured as soon as I bought it.  Now I have had 4 boxes sitting in my pantry for months that nobody will touch.  I don't believe I have ever before experienced such a drastic and disappointing change in a product that I used to love so much.  Guess I'll have to switch to Orville now.

They are particularly popular with their Ginger beverage selections and I think it is because their ginger tastes very authentic, like the real thing from Asia. Lots of teas out there are just Ginger flavored but this is actually made from real pieces of actual ginger. It might be strong for some you can always adjust it by adding more/less water. I highly reccomend to anyone for preventing colds (immune system), neausea during travels, keeping body circulation/warmth in winter etc.<br />4 stars from me!

It doesn't even tell you how much liquid to add, just a glass of water and one tbsp. of the mix. I used a large glass. It was horrible so I added another tbsp. It was still REALLY bad. It was so watery. Then the next time I used skim milk (only because that's what's in my house). This tasted better, but nothing I'd want to drink again. Also it says on the package in the picture 'sweetened,' and it says it has sugar in it and my package was, so I agree with the other lady as to why people assume it's not sweetened when it clearly is. I would NEVER buy this again.

For the most part, it's a hard drink to mess up if you make it yourself; it may not end up being amazingly delicious, but definitely something worth drinking. When I saw this drink mix in the store, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Suffice to say that I was supremely disappointed. I tried it with water, and no amount of drink mix could salvage it from tasting and looking like dirty water. Blech... With milk, it got mildly better, but I would much prefer a glass of milk to the nasty, plastic-y taste this added.<br /><br />Stay away! Look up recipes yourself or maybe try one of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GPNT32">Imagine Rice Dream Horchata, 32 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/text: I tried the mix with various milks of different fat content, including Almond Silk unsweetened almond milk.  Each version tasted slightly different.  At its best, with the whole fat milk and a generous tablespoon per 8 oz glass, it was a rich, creamy (egg and alcohol free) version of holiday eggnog!  I agree that using "just" a tablespoon with the lower fat liquids made for a watery drink, but a generous tablespoon with a higher fat (2-4% milkfat) milk was delicious (and good even with the lower fat liquids, although as noted a level tablespoon is not quite enough to get full flavor and a rich texture).  So what if it's a bit different from "traditional" horchata--you will get a different horchata from house to house and from restaurant to restaurant; recipes and tastes vary.

Many people with wheat allergies can tolerate spelt and we now use spelt exclusively in our kitchen.

review/summary: Can't tell it's gluten free
review/text: The problem we've found with gluten free products is, primarily, the textures are different than the wheat flour products, with the wheat products being familiar and preferred.  However, the VitaSpelt pasta is very much like the wheat pasta, in the opinion of my kids.  They eat it up and ask for more.  Personally, I also prefer the VitaSpelt products when eating gluten free pasta.  Both the texture and flavor are what one would anticipate and prefer if they are yet unaccustomed to the gluten free diet.

review/text: Finding spice cake mix at the grocery can be a hit or miss proposition. This is the perfect solution. It's a good price and eligible for "Prime" shipping. Packaging was perfect--grocer's display box inside a shipping box. I split the order with a neighbor, and now we both have just enough boxes to get us through the holiday season. Makes a great base for yummy pumpkin cookies!<br /><br />Easy pumpkin cookies:<br />1 package spice cake mix, 1 egg, 2/3 cup pumpkin puree, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. (Optional: grated zest of 1 lemon, chopped nuts, or raisins.) Mix it all up, drop by tablespoons on oil-sprayed cookie sheet (or non-oiled parchment or silpat), 350 degree oven, 10-13 minutes. Add an extra minute if you are using silpat. These are good!

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/summary: Good Flavor
review/text: A friend from Sri Lanka often uses this rice in her cooking and I enjoyed the flavor.  I am not a fan of brown rice but wanted something different than the usual white.  I urge everyone to read the brief instructions on the container for cooking this type<br />of rice because it is a little different than the white or brown rice.  First of all, you need to soak and rinse this rice but it doesn't have to be for a long time.  I only allowed mine to soak for about 20 min and then rinsed it.  Then it takes 3 cups of water per one cup of rice and it requires extra time to cook.  It was worth it to me because I really enjoy the flavor.  I don't like brown rice because it never really tastes tender to me and sort of rough and chafe like.  This rice has a very mild flavor, very slightly sweet but it has a wonderful texture, none of the roughness that I dislike about brown rice.  It won't interfere with curries or anything you top it with.

I steep the tea for 5 minutes for best flavor.<br /><br />The cherry flavor is very light, just enough to let you know it is flavored but not so much that it is overwhelming.<br /><br />I have been drinking both flavors of Gevalia green tea for over 10 years now and I like them so much that I usually ask for them as Christmas gifts from family and friends.

review/text: Spices from Butcher and Packer are always a pleasant event.<br />Whom does not want to get ripped off from buying spices from a middleman grocery chain whom jacks up the prices through the roof.<br />Instead, by from the source as i have always done.<br />One pound of spice is too much? Go find your family to split the spice order and buy in bulk. Next time you are walking down the grocery aisle LOOK at the price of one of those 4 ounce spice containers and instead envision yourself buying four times that much for about the price of that jacked up spice sold at that store.<br />Review their complete Amazon posted website store and add to your order anything and everything you would normally buy at the grocery store.<br />Then, when those one pound purchases arrive, they are in sealed plastic bags so you will need in advance spice holding containers to transfer that spice via funnel.<br />Buy extra of peppers cause you know you are already using pepper and determine whether ground versus whole is best for you.<br />Place a massive order versus small orders since the shipping fees by ratio become cheaper with the larger the order. Arrives packaged well.<br />Now, that Christmas holiday is soon arriving check out all their spices like nutmeg,etc and start your baking in bulk.<br />enough said, check out their amazon website and review your order per pounds.<br />Remember, one pound of spice is alot of spice too.<br />Enjoy and save some of your hard earned cash.

review/text: There is not much one can say about Lifesavers-5 Flavors Hard Candy, 20ct excepting they have been around for a long time. Perhaps a little on the pricey side but as far as quality is concerned it has not changed. They are good hard candy and 4 Stars is what they get.
