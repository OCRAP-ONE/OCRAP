review/summary: Best, Healthy and Low-Fat Alternative for Cheetos Puffs!!
review/text: I purchased the variety pack and have been able to try out all the flavors. This Vintage Cheddar variety is one of my faves. If you're a Cheetos Puffs fan and want to cut back on calories and fat, this is the product for you.<br /><br />The texture in both are similar -- light and airy. So is the taste. Of course, it's not an exact match, but nothing else on the market this low in fat content comes close. (And I've tried several alternatives.)<br /><br />To compare nutritional info on a 1-oz. bag, Cheetos Puffs contains 160 calories compared to Gourmet Basics' 110. As for fat grams, Cheetos Puffs has 9 grams and 1 gram saturated versus GB's 2 grams of fat and 0 saturated. On the flip side, the sodium content on the GB is higher at 340mg compared to Cheetos' 250mg. Carb count is also higher in the GB at 22 grams as compared to Cheetos' 16.<br /><br />I'm sold on this product and my next order will be for a carton of this flavor alone.

review/summary: Yum!  I like these better than popchips!
review/text: The smart fries are really tasty!  I ordered the 6 flavor variety pack.  While I did enjoy all of the flavors, my two favorites had to be the Jalapeno Trio and the Honey Mustard and Onion.<br /><br />I will be ordering these again, but I will pick and choose the flavors I like best.<br /><br />These make a great potato chip alternative.  I've also tried the popchips and I do prefer these.  the serving size is actually very large!  When I saw the size of the bag I figured it had to be all air, or that there were multiple servings in the bag.  Nope!  Granted it is 110 calories vs the popchip's 100 calories.  But honestly, I get way more satisfaction out of these.

review/summary: Better than expected!
review/text: After being on a very strict diet for over two years, the same foods, day in and day out, become repetitious, and it becomes very difficult to maintain the will-power to continue.  However, Smart Fries are an excellent product that offers a bit of a variety to a healthful diet.  As another customer wrote, I, too, was skeptical of purchasing this product, but, at 110 calories per bag, I was very impressed and have become a loyal customer after the first try.  Additionally, I find that I can not eat an entire bag.  My fiancee and I shared a bag of the Smart Fries, and I had some left over for another meal.  A great product for those looking for healthy alternatives, while maintaining a great taste.

review/summary: Folks these delicious snacks are 3 POINTS on the New Weight Watchers Points plan!!!
review/text: I purchased a bag at a local gourmet deli in NYC because they had about 1/3 the calories of all the kettle fried chips.  First, I was shocked that there was only 1 serving in the bag (even though the measurement says 1 once the bag is bigger than you think).  After calculating the points I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I almost felt guilty for having soo much to crunch on (there are a lot of these fries in that there bag).  I must reiterate 1 bag (1 oz) is 3 points!!! This is major.  The flavor is great and you will not feel hungry.  I am ordering a bunch of these right away.

The honey barbeque, honey mustard and onion and cheddar are my favorites!  These are similar in texture to the Andy Capp's Hot Fries.  I've lost over 80 lbs and am always on a lookout for low cal, yummy snacks and these fit the bill.  My kids really like these too and I don't feel bad letting them have them because they don't have a lot of fat or calories.  I would like to try the cinnamon ones soon!

review/text: These SmartFries are so awsome!  With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving, but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories.  I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20.  If any of you love the Trader Joe's Skinny Fries, then you're in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs.  I am a frequent buyer of this product.

review/summary: Good for Low Cal Snack
review/text: I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they are so light and airy but they are filling and only 110 calories, 2grams fat, 1g fiber. A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet.

review/summary: love love but take out some salt please!
review/text: I was so excited about receiving these and wow the crunch and flavor is great! 1 ounce for only 110 calories is awesome. At the bottom of the bags though I found a lot of salt so I re-checked the nutritional info and found one bag has 11% of daily intake of salt! That is just too much for me with my BP issues etc. The pop chips are yummy too and only have 6% daily salt.. for a little less than one ounce and the pop tortilla chips are also 6% per 1 oz. bag. With the great taste of the fries you just don't need all that salt anyhow! So to people not worried about their salt intake ( everything else is very healthy) go for it.. but for people like me just be a bit cautious. This was to be my newest best healthy snack but guess I will have to enjoy sparingly and keep on looking. My score would def. been a 5 if not for the extra, in my view, unnecessary salt. Hope this helps!

review/text: I purchased the 1.1 oz.-24 bag variety pack.  I actually didn't care for 2 of the 6 flavors though I realize this is just personal preference.  I thought the other flavors were tasty.  You get a lot of snack for the calorie content.  I think they are very comparable to PopChips but you get a much bigger portion(1.1 oz. of Smart Fries for 110 cal vs. popchips - 100cal for 0.8 oz.). I like PopChips but I'd rather be able to have more snack for the same calories. The Honey Mustard & BBQ flavors are delicious & were my favorite.  If you're a chip addict like I am, this is a good deal.  It was a big enough serving to satisfy my craving without completely blowing my daily calorie intake.  I will definately purchase again.

review/summary: Healthy, delicious but not cheetos!
review/text: Looking at the shape of this snack you will think you are eating Cheetos. But rest easy there's no grease here. This is the perfect snack if you're trying to diet. There should be something fun if you're fighting the calories, and this was perfect! For 110 calories, you get 65 smart fries, and I actually felt full after eating a bag. They're light and crispy and very flavorful. Here's what I thought about the flavors:<br /><br />Honey Mustard and Onion: My fav by far! I can taste the honey dijon and the sweet onions. Delicious!<br />Vinegar Splash: Lots of vinegar flavor!<br />Honey BBQ: More subtle in flavor, but very tasty.<br />Vintage Cheddar: Classic Cheese Curl flavor, light and salty.<br />Sea Salt: allows the potato flavor to shine through. Yum!<br />Jalapeno Trio: I liked this one the least, if I'm going to eat a flavor like this I would want something greasy with it, which would defeat the purpose of a healthy snack!

review/text: First off, I am not a big fan of vinegar potato chips or fries, but these came in the variety pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AZ2ECY">Gourmet Basics Smart Fries 6-Flavor Variety Pak, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>.  Nonetheless, I must say that they are enjoyable.  However, I still prefer BBQ and plain potato chips or fries.  They are not my favorite, but would make a good from time to time.  They have a strong tart vinegar flavor with a touch of salt.  The acid of vinegar may pair well with the bland or complement something less intense.

They taste great, love all the flavors, and there are a lot of them, great variety.  The bags are chocked full, unlike potatoe chip bags.  I highly recommend.  Kids even like them!  Crunchy and fun to eat.

review/summary: Smart Fries taste great!
review/text: I purchased these for my kids. I am always purchasing alternatives for chips (that they love so much) and I stumbled upon these. I ordered the variety pack so the kids could experience different flavors and they were so happy when they ate them. I usually purchase Pop chips and Pop corners, but I thought these would be a fun change for my kids and I was right. After they each tried their own bag, they immediately told me how much they liked them and almost everyday during the Christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack. They have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and I have not heard any objections yet. I tried the sea salt, cheddar and salt and vinegar varieties and enjoyed the flavors of each. If you like Pop chips, then chances are you will like these too. Although the seasoning on the fries are not as intense as the flavoring on Pop chips, I still think these are an enjoyable snack for kids and adults.

If you're the type that's aware that you have to make small sacrafices for a healthy lifestyle, then you will love these. They satisfy my cravings when I need a cruchy, saltly snack. And when i'm craving something sweet...the honey mustard flavor does the trick. I say give em a try! Just got my second order in the mail yesterday.

review/summary: These saved me.
review/text: If you're ever in the mood to just munch on something and not have it kill you in calories, this is it.<br />It has crunch and a little salt. Looking at other reviews, it IS a lot like eating air, but again,<br />for those of us who can't afford to eat a bag of chips, this is the best substitute. You're not going to<br />eat one and be like - WOW. This is the best snack I've ever had. BUT, it's the  best when you're looking to find something crunchy that you can eat while watching a movie. It works for me so well, that when my local BJ's stopped carrying them (which is a sign I know), I had to go directly to the vendor to find where I can get them. Now I have to buy at Trader Joe's and they're much more money now. Still - they work for me like nothing else.<br />I must add I only like the Sea Salt. I've only tried one other flavor and didn't like it. If anyone finds out where I can buy the huge economy sized bag that BJ's used to sell, PLEASE tell me! It's a great deal! I wish they didn't stop selling it...

I expected the consistency to be like that of Hot Fries but they are actually really smooth. You get a ton of them in the bag, too. I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly. I'm happy with the price too so I think I"ll stick with these.

review/text: I discovered these on a whim at a discount store and they were surprisingly delicious. They have an awesome crunch and great potato flavor. The best part was the nutrition stats: only 110 calories, 1.5 fat, and 2 fiber per ounce (which is a much larger portion than expected and very satisfying). The original flavor is very good, but could use a touch more salt. The jalapeno is also really tasty: a little sweet, a little smoky, and just a little spicy.

review/summary: These are great but the mix of flavors is not the best
review/text: I love Smart fries so they get 5 stars. However this pack is not the best mix of the flavors. It good if you don't know what you like and want to try 1-2 bags of each different flavor. However, if you know you like certain flavors and are looking for a bunch of them you should just buy the seperate flavor packs.<br /><br />The flavor of the smart fries themselves are amazing. I have been using these as a subsitute for eating other salty or sweet snacks. The whoel bag is only a little over 100 calories and if you swap them out for the right cravings they are going to save you a junk load of calories.<br /><br />The price here is alot better then local stores that I have seen. At my work cafe they have these for about 2 dollars a bag. So anything under 1.50 would have been great but under a dollar a bag that's just awesome. I am planning on stocking up on some of the 1 flavor packs for a long road trip since these are an excellent "snacking food" when your not starving but want to munch :).

review/text: Had my first package of these today - the Cheddar.  I was surprised at how many are in the bag.  I was expecting maybe a dozen and it was easily 3-4x that. If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.

review/summary: Potato Styrofoam Tubes...
review/text: These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless "potato sticks" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the "sea salt" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual "fry"<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better.

I would say they will pair with almost any kind of hearty sandwich or make a filling snack.  Yummy!

review/text: I ordered the Variety pack of 24. The only flavor I didn't care for is the Salt and Vinegar but that's only because I don't like that flavor in anything. I gave them to my grandkids and they LOVED them!!<br />I was VERY surprised when I opened a bag and saw how many were in a 1 oz serving! WOW!!! Not like your typical lo-cal/lo-fat snack chip where you get about 10 chips and you're done. I love the texture and everything about these fries. I'm already trying to decide what flavor/flavors to reorder. This is definitely on the top of my snack list.<br />My only suggestion is if a little bit more salt could be added to the Classic Sea Salt flavor. They didn't have quite the flavor punch I was expecting but they were still very good. I think a bit more salt would make them PERFECT!!<br />I'm so glad I came across these fries and I'll definitely spread the word to friends and family.

review/summary: Bad for You and Bad Taste
review/text: I bought the newer 2% after enjoying the original velveeta shells since a child. The taste was horrible and after adding chili to it, only edible. Add the fact that one serving is 50% of your daily salt and I will never buy this again. Definitely not worth the price. Disliked it enought that I even tried to find a customer service number on their website with no luck.

review/summary: Half fat = half edible
review/text: I really don't know how this can be considered food. I love the original Velveeta Shells & Cheese and bought the 2% at the store by accident, so when I saw them in my pantry, I figured the accidental purchase would allow me to try this "healthier" option. My exact reaction when putting this stuff in my mouth: 1) Umm, okay not THAT bad, 2) WHAT IS THIS?! 3) Worst, most artificial/bitter after-taste ever. In this case, half the fat is simply not worth the pain when trying to swallow this stuff.

review/text: I grew up eating Velveeta shells and cheese.  It was always something my mom had in the panty and now I frequently buy because it tastes great and is a quick side dish.  I accidentally purchased this 2% milk 1/2 fat variety and was immediately repulsed.  I wholeheartedly disagree with the other reviewers who claim you "can't taste the difference."  Well, I certainly could.  If fact, I threw it in the garbage because I couldn't stomach it.  It has such a strange chalky flavor.  I don't think there is anything "cheesy" about it!  I will make sure NEVER to buy this variety again.  Blech!

review/text: Tahsildaroglu Traditional White Cheese is inarguably the best pre-packaged white cheese not only among imported Turkish cheese, but also in Turkey. The fat-salt consistency is perfect, the taste is wonderful, and it has the right texture. Go for the sheep's milk, since it is a better representation of the 'Traditional White Turkish Cheese' (not feta, big difference), better tasting than cow's or goat's. It does not smell like sheep, so don't be turned off by the title.

review/summary: Wonderful Dog Food
review/text: A recently deceased friend told me about this food, Canadae Platinum.  He fed his "boys" both the dry and the canned.  His boys are a German Spitz and a Bichon Frise, 4/14 years old respectively.  Doug said that after less than two weeks, the 14 year old was like a "new dog".<br /><br />I now have his dogs, fullfilling a promise, added to our Doxy and Shiba Inu ( 5/7 years respectively), three cats and 7 birds.  All the dogs are now on this Canadae Platinum dry food and love it.  While they used to pick at their old food, they dive into this.  They also seem to get satiated faster, so they actually leave a little in the bowls.<br /><br />The Glucosamine/Chondroitin is the key for the older dog.  A vet once recommended it for an older dog we used to have years ago.  When I started taking it for my arthritic ankles, I was soon able to stop taking anti-inflamatories like Daypro.  I've since found out that the medical establishment considers GC to be useless.  All I can say is that it works for me, and within a few weeks of re-starting Little Boy ( the 14 year old) on this food with GC, he runs, plays and jumps with the rest of the dogs like a puppy.<br /><br />There are a few places in Las Vegas selling this food, all "high-end" pet food stores and all slightly more expensive.  The convenience of one-click and having the food on my doorstep in a day or two is even better than the savings.<br /><br />We've also moved our cats over to Felidae (the feline version of Canadae) with similar results.

She even likes a couple pieces of kibble as a treat.  Check out the ingredients and you'll see there are no Corn products which, while being rich in protein and carbs, is also pretty fatty and is much cheaper to use.  I think you'll be pleased with your results with this food.

review/summary: Long live longevity!
review/text: I've been feeding my dogs Canidae foods for over 10 years.  I partially attribute their longevity to a great diet and regular exercise.  I had some problems in the past when it appeared that Canidae reformulated this particular food and I ended up switching to another brand.  I was never happy with the other brand, and after about a year off from Canidae, I gave them another try.  The food was back to the former formula and my dogs loved it (and still do).  I'm happy that this senior formula has Glucosamine as a supplement.  Overall, aside from the reformulation issue, I'm a happy Canidae customer and my dogs are happy Canidae dogs!

review/summary: My dog looks amazing!
review/text: Because of the price, I decided to only feed this to my oldest (and only overweight) dog (out of 3 dogs).  She looks so good and still has a lot of youth and energy.  I adopted all of them, but I believe she is about 11.  I haven't weighed her, but she has visibly lost weight after 2/3 of the bag!  I'm guessing she has gone from 90 to 85 pounds in about 3 weeks, which is incredible.  I read a lot of good things online about the ingredients of this and a few other premium foods.  We will certainly continue with this if we can afford it; it's actually a great value if you have Prime; which is worth it if you're going to be ordering heavy items such as this.

review/summary: LadyBug Likes it
review/text: Ok, to be fair LadyBug likes anything edible.  :)  Which was part of the problem....  Lady is a older (11-14 yr.) std. American Eskimo who loves to  eat that I inherited from my Grandmother.  She got up to 42 lbs on her previous diet dog food and the vet wants her to be 35.  That means she was overweight by 20%  &lt;cringe>.  So I discovered this food and after &lt;6 months, she is 36 lbs.  She likes the food and once she adjusted to the smaller quantity of food, found it to be quite filling.  Our Bear (6 yr. Great Pyrenees / Border Collie mix) sometimes steals Lady's food instead of eating her own.  I'll probably move Bear over to this dog food next year.  I should probably note that as old as Lady is, she acts like a young dog...  even though she is losing her sight slowly.

review/summary: Sun-Dried Olives and Almonds (Olive Essicate con Mandorle)
review/text: For some you will have to aquire a taste for the way these olives are cured. If you are willing to try it and hang in there it is well worth it though. These have already been prepared for you but you can still add your own olive oil and any other spices you may like to them. The flesh of these olives after being cured is meaty with a slight bitter to them. They play off the almonds very well. The almonds in this mixture are soft, smooth (almost creamy) and offset the slight bitter in the olive. I prefer to eat one or two olives and then follow up with an almond. You can even eat both simultaneously. The olives do have pits so be careful. Don't just bite down into one or you may damage a tooth. Eat the flesh of the olive off of the pit. I prefer to add some of my own extra virgin olive oil but it is up to your individual taste. This would go great on an antipasta tray or served with some cheeses and maybe some wine. Buon Appetito!

review/text: I bought this with another guy at work and we both came to the same conclusion, there is more wasabi flavor in flour than in this worthless trash. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would, but that is the lowest that the ratings go. I actually tasted a spoonful and had to search for even a hint of wasabi flavor. Now, I have a lifetime supply of this and it is awful and I can think of absolutely no use for it, may try to make a roux with it since it is basically flour. Maybe my daughter can finger paint with it. This is the biggest waste of 20 bucks since my ex wife's wedding ring.
