review/summary: Creamy and Delicious!
review/text: I've been getting this through subscribe and save for the last few months.  Every box has come in perfect shape with no dented cans, and the contents of every can has been smooth and delicious.  I like this brand much more than the local store brands, and it has been cheaper to get this case through subscribe and save rather than in individual cans from the store.<br /><br />Today I received an email that this item is being discontinued on S&S.  I'm so disappointed!  We use a lot of coconut milk in our house -- smoothies, baking, curries, ice cream. I'm not happy about losing this value.

review/summary: My favorite coconut milk....GREAT deal!!
review/text: As stated, this is my favorite brand of coconut milk. It is neither too thin or thick, is ORGANIC, which is a major selling point for me when it comes to food for my family. I had been buying it locally per can for $3.79 each. Now I have it on subscribe and save and pay just over two dollars per can....and free shipping to my door!! A few past reviews mentioned dented cans, I am happy to report that all of mine arrived in great condition.

review/summary: A smooth, mild blend
review/text: I thought that since it said "Danish" that this would be a strong breakfast blend as I remember the coffee in Copenhagen being rather strong.  This is not a strong roast.  The beans are a dark brown color (not as dark as my MoccaJava blend).  I don't get a morning jolt from this blend.  However, it's a smooth blend, a kind of coffee that I could drink several cups while perusing the morning news websites.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price.  This package at close to twenty bucks is already eight bucks more than the first patch I bought in September.  Coffee prices are rising this fall of 2010, but to rise that much seems ridiculous.  There are other coffees that are better than this blend for considerably less dough.

review/summary: OMG fantastic! Expires dec. 2011.
review/text: I ordered these from Amazon, but they are not listing it as a verified purchase which is odd. I only mention this as I tend to believe the verified purchases eliminate the "shill factor." The nuts were delivered in perfect condition on a hot day. These candies are delicious and if you can resist not eating at least half of one package as a single serving, you have more self control than I! Organic dark chocolate covered Brazil nuts are difficult to find at a reasonable price. Now I wish I had purchased more while they were on sale. The nuts are fresh tasting medium sized covered in a glossy dark chocolate. This chocolate does not readily melt on your fingers, such as non-glossy chocolate typically does. I am enjoying these heavenly treats (5 pieces for 219 calories).

review/summary: Finally found a way to eat Brazil nuts!
review/text: I thought that I didn't care for Brazil Nuts, but a clerk at my health food store talked me into it since I had my heart set on the coconut one. (they've been on back order for a LONG time). She said that she didn't care for Brazil nuts either but that she loved this. Well, after sitting on my counter for 2 weeks thinking that I wouldn't like them, I finally tried them. She was right. These really ARE tasty. However, at over $6 per bag, I won't be purchasing from this particular seller. In fact, it was my understanding that Amazon required competitive pricing? Maybe I'm wrong. But even my hoity toity health food store is selling them for $5.49. I've found them repeatedly at health food stores and even some convenience stores along the freeway; so keep your eye out for them. I'm looking forward to trying other types now that I know I'm in love with the coconut and the Brazil nut ones.

review/summary: Not all nuts are fresh...
review/text: I bought these organic chocolate covered Brazil nuts based on the good reviews.  The nuts that are fresh are very good.  However, about 1 in five nuts is rancid.  Sometimes Brazil nuts will have an earthy taste.  This is not an earthy taste, it is the taste of old nuts where the oil in the nut is turning rancid.  The expiration date on the package is 10/12 which is 8 months away.  This is a very expensive treat to have 20% of the product bad.  I cannot recommend.

review/summary: bennyclams on clams!
review/text: I use canned clams because I no longer live in the northeast. I use them for linguine with clam sauce. I found Crown Prince chopped clams more like minced than chopped. Also they were packed in water rather than clam juice. I had to add bottled clam juice to make it better. Overall they were adequate but I have returned to Snows chopped clams packed in clam juice.

review/summary: Best canned clams I've ever used
review/text: My local grocery store has stopped stocking Crown Prince canned clams and I'm forced to buy them online instead. I've opened cans side by side with Snow's and have been shocked that the Crown Prince cans contain more than twice as much clam meat, drained, than Snow's.  In addition, the Crown Prince clams are pink and look cleaner than Snow's. I actually opened, drained and weighed a number of cans of each variety so I'm sure it wasn't a fluke.

review/text: These chopped clams are good- not great, but good. I add them to canned clam chowder to boost the protein content, and they are quite adequate for that. They aren't quite as sweet as my previous brand- but pricing was good, and because I'm disabled, the delivery to my door is also a perk.  I'll use them, but will probably go back to the "clammier" brand I was buying.

review/summary: Did better than the orange can.
review/text: My daughter was put on the orange goodstart at birth.  But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what. I know with the blue soy she seemed to have been doing much much better.<br />Only thing I dont like about the soy formula is the greasy residue it leaves in the bottles. You have to let them soak in hot water in order to clean them properly.

review/text: Great flavor! I love that these apple chips come flavored, so many out there are bland and boring.  A chip should be salted or sugared or something and these are great!

review/summary: Taste great
review/text: I was having trouble locating apple chips locally and was happy to find these at a good price Amazon.  I love the chicken salad a chain restaurant sells that have apple chips on top and wanted to try to replicate the recipe at home. These work well and taste great.  The only issue I have is that they really aren't the healthy option I thought.  They contain oil and sugar, bringing the calorie content to 375 per bag.  It is better to eat an apple, but these are a mighty tasty snack.

review/text: Just like I remember them 8 years ago.  I used to buy these for about the same price at my local supermarket until they disappeared 4-5 years ago.  I was so happy when I saw these on Amazon!  They are delicious and taste better than other apple chips in my opinion.  However, be aware that they are not as healthy as other brands.  Love them and will order more soon!

review/text: These are so delicious. They have a light carmel flavor that really makes them stand out from the original flavor. These are a great healthy snack. The normal price is really not a good deal, but I purchased them when they were on special for around $20. That price, you can't beat.<br /><br />I give this three stars, just based on the price. It is 5 stars for flavor, but like 2 stars for how expensive they are (at least right now). Wait for them to go on sale!

review/text: I recently tried a dehydrated apple chip snack that I absolutely LOVED. After the market stopped selling those chips, I was looking for an alternative. I saw these and thought, why not? They are the same thing. NOT! These chips taste like vegetable oil. I was hoping for a chip like the last that I had, crunchy tangy and sweet. But these are deep fried which are not healthy. I threw the bag away. If you are looking for a potato chip that tastes like an apple, these are it. If you are looking for a healthy snack, look elsewhere.

review/summary: I don't like them
review/text: I've tried all the flavors, and I don't care for them. They are crispy which is weird for an apple, and they taste like they were soaked in oil. The flavored ones are way too sweet and even the plain ones have corn syrup, which is really bad for you. They also have a lot of fat and sugar, which is completely stupid since this snack claims to be healthy. I feel bad eating these because they are not healthy at all. I'd rather eat a real apple or some dried fruit.

review/summary: Frantoia EVOO: Great Taste, Reasonable Price
review/text: You can pay a lot for high-grade "finishing" olive oils, but it would be hard to get such clean fruity flavors with a slight peppery background at the reasonable price charged for the Frantoia oil.  I had been using Frantoia for the past 10 years after seeing it on the counter in one of Mario Batali's old "Molto Mario" cooking shows and giving it a try. We use it for salad dressings, adding extra richness to pasta, vegetable, and meat dishes just before serving, and even for sauteing.  When I moved to Portland, though, I could not find it at the local supermarket.  Happily, Amazon came to the rescue. I can't say enough about the vendor, SuperOlive. The order was fulfilled within days of placement; the packaging was solidly cushioned and secure; and the oil was fresh. I have subsequently found a local source, but at a higher price. As it turns out, it is almost a wash between the Amazon/SuperOlive cost plus shipping and the higher local price, so I continue to order it online. (Sales tax isn't an issue here in Oregon.)

Not only does it supply the heat, the popcorn itself is of excellent quality!!  I had three bags of this popcorn so far and after popping it in the microwave, there were only just a few unpopped kernels.  The popcorn did steam after I took it out of the microwave but no burnt kernels.<br /><br />Definitely amongst my favorites of the microwave popcorn brands!  I also knew it would be good because I enjoyed the hot sauces in Dave's Insanity series.

Definitely a fun snack to share as you watch people's eyes water!

review/summary: Just Alright
review/text: Dave's Gourmet is probably the hot foods brand I hold in the highest regard so I was hoping that the Popcorn would be every bit as good as their sauces and Dave's Burning Nuts. Insanity Popcorn is spicy but without a lot of flavor. It lacks really much definition, its really buttery, or smokey. Instead its somewhat salty with a lingering heat. Its reasonably spicy but without insanely hot or great flavor (or both), its mostly novelty.  On paper it sounds like a great idea but I don't think popcorn is probably the best delivery mechanism for hot foods sadly.  Its not bad but its not great either. Other customers seem to love it to so buy and try.

The teas are full of flavor and truly a British style tea.  And yes, if you over steep them they will get bitter!  But ever time I have share Williamson teas with friends, they all immediately want to know who is the grower/manufacture of the tea is.  And many of my friends now purchase the tea regularly.  The elephant tins are nice storage containers that fit tight.  Please Google Williamson tea's website... you will find that their plantations support the Kenyan communities as well as any fair trade tea on the market.

review/summary: Love this flour
review/text: I have used this in multiple bread recipes, my most recent batch was 10% Rye, 15% white/wheat and 75% Barley. I basically just mashed a cantaloupe up in a bowl into mushy liquid, started mixing in flour, added water/yeast, eggs and a bit of guar gum and baking soda, a touch of agave nectar, let rise twice and when finally cooked i ate a loaf there on the spot. lol this is GOOD STUFF

review/summary: Everyone is right somehow
review/text: I was reluctant to buy this product because of all the bad reviews and I thought maybe all the good reviews were put there by the families of the team who concocted this product. Just the other day, my co-worker gave me a chocolate brownie made with erythritol and I enjoyed it and I waited for a weird aftertaste and I waited for any laxative effect. Neither. I was the grocery store today and I picked up some sugar-free Oreos and then I saw this bottle of sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup and then I instantly thought back to all these reviews.<br /><br />  As a lowcarber, I use stevia in my soy milk, my hemp milk, my tea and my coffee. I think stevia is TERRIBLE with chocolate. All the chocolate products out there are usually made with maltitol and sucralose mix, which I do enjoy. So, if there was such a product out there like this, I would buy it. I don't have the explosive diarrhea or upset stomach or other related episodes that other people have with maltitol. Maybe they consume A LOT more than I, or maybe I'm special. Having tried recently the chocolate brownie, I thought what the heck.<br /><br />  I mixed in three teaspoons of syrup into my soy milk and I absolutely thought it was GREAT AND DELICIOUS! Those naysayers were exaggerating! The flavor was not as sweet as I expected, but that's okay since most commercial products are way too sweet, just like the sugar-free chocolates on the market. So, I thought it was genius that it was just sweet enough. And when you go low carb, everything starts to taste too sweet and obnoxious after awhile.<br /><br />  I did notice a slight bitter aftertaste that was not attributable to natural chocolate. The bitterness was fleeting and not unpleasant, so I didn't mind it. The lingering taste in my mouth is a slightly sweet chocolate, not a chemical taste. The aftertaste didn't taste natural though, so if you're the organics-only type, then you should not buy it.<br /><br />  I was ready to side with all the five-star-raters but I wanted to be sure, so I took a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and ate it straight. All of a sudden, all the one-star-raters were right: it was sour!!! So, these people were right too! It tastes terrible out of the bottle.<br /><br />  So, I say this to all of you, if you are a lowcarber or a diabetic and you're looking for a chocolate treat in the form of a drink like chocolate milk, for example (though milk has carbs so why would you want to drink milk? Add it to unsweetened soy milk or hemp milk), then by all means get this. It's great. Whatever you do, don't be tempted to eat it or pour it down your throat. Otherwise, you will think it's gone bad and you will throw out a treasure and close your world off to sugar-free chocolate syrups forever.<br /><br />  Sure, Hershey is trying to make money out of an increasingly hard niche market to cater to, but at least they know about you and your needs and are trying to make you happy. I thank Hershey's for that. So, give this product a chance. And until they come out with an organic, carb-free, non-diarrhea-inducing syrup with a pleasant aftertaste and mouth feel, this is a compromise I can deal with. I hope you will try it and see the value in a product like this.

review/summary: Choco flavor but no sweetness
review/text: I purchased this item to save on calories and carbs.  I primarily use this syrup to make mochas, smoothies and hot chocolate.  I agree that if tasted straight from the bottle this has a bitter, sour taste.  However for what I am using it for it works out great.  I must admit I do add Splenda to sweeten it up but it does add the chocolate flavor I am looking for and once mixed with the other ingredients the bitterness and sour flavor disappears.  This is an item that will stay in my kitchen.

review/summary: Buy this syrup if you want Erythritol as a sweetener
review/text: Erythritol is the only intestine-friendly sugar alcohol and has the most sweetness per caloric content of any sugar alcohol. Sucralose, on the other hand, is also in this product and is made by manipulating sugar molecules with chlorine.. yuck.<br /><br />Regardless, I prefer this ingredient list to other chocolate syrups.<br /><br />Ingredients: water, erythritol, glycerin, cocoa, natural flavors, citric acid, xanthan gum, salt, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, caramel color, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, vanillin, artificial flavor, zinc sulfate vitamin e acetate, niacinamide and biotin.<br /><br />There is a bitter aftertaste, but it's sugar free for a reason and I'm sure anyone interested in this product will get used to it.

review/summary: Nasty aftertaste- & NOT just a bad case: same in all 3 cases!
review/text: I *really* don't like saying negative things about ANYthing, let alone products made by a mfr that's been around for a long time- like Hershey's.  But, I honestly must say I have found this product virtually unusable.<br /><br />I work for a company where some of the folks add chocolate squirts to their coffee.  So, we go thru a fair amt of chocolate syrup- and thus I have purchased, over 6-9 months, about 3 of the 6-bottle cases of this.  Regrettably, each has been the same- i.e. I'm not just judging the product based on one possibly bad case, or batch.<br /><br />I *do* get a sense of chocolate from this-  !!BUT!! the accompanying odd taste- and the persistent aftertaste, is quite bad.  I've literally mixed this with milk- which has been GOOD milk, and several times not been able to force myself to drink the whole glass- I've had to pour it out- the non-chocolate odd chemical taste of the syrup- EVEN when mixed with milk- was THAT bad.<br /><br />Apparently if you only use a little bit- like maybe a small shot in a cup of coffee- you MIGHT not notice anything different.  But, if you try to taste this directly, or mix it with a reasonably lightly flavored substance- like milk, or water, or, perhaps, cake or cookie mix, I can virtually *guarantee* it will not taste the same to you- it has a VERY odd chemical, sour, bitter, or SOMEthing taste, IMO.<br /><br />Perhaps, if this is the ONLY type of syrup you can use, due to diabetes requirements, or something, you might try it.  However, I would strongly recommend that you look through & try OTHER products first- and use this particular "sugar-free" one as a last resort.  Or, if you're determined to try it, go out & find a single bottle in your local store- and try that.  Then, if you *still* like it, perhaps go ahead and buy a case.<br /><br />However, apart from a very special need, I can't imagine why someone would use this.<br /><br />I do *not* think, for example, that even an average person who's concerned about calories, would use THIS.  In fact, *I* am concerned about calories- which is why I tried using this, and stuck with it for so long.  I almost *always* use the low-calorie varieties of foods.  And, in ten-plus years, I have rarely found any problems in doing that- I'm a pretty tolerant person, taste-wise.<br /><br />However, this is one product that I simply can NOT force myself to use anymore- I'm shifting to Hershey's "low-fat" version of the syrup.<br /><br />This is DEFINITELY not the product for me- AND, looking at other reviews, it looks like I'm not the ONLY one who thinks this has a VERY unusual side-taste & aftertaste.

review/text: I was so happy to see Sugar-free Hershey's Syrup on the grocery store shelf.  Anticipated all day having a scoop of sugar-free ice cream with a drizzle of sugar-free chocolate syrup.  Am I ever glad I tasted the syrup before ruining the ice cream with it.<br /><br />This syrup has the most vile, bitter taste - totally not palatable at all.  Hersey's Company - WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?  I am a chocolate lover from way back and there is nothing to this taste that even resembles chocolate.  Very disappointed and wasted $3.50 to boot.

review/text: I'll get used to it and it's not nauseating; but please don't tell me it tastes just like the sugared version.  I'm not diabetic; but cut down where I can.  By the time I've gotten through six bottles, I'm sure it'll taste just fine to me.  Did it with diet colas and low-fat milk.<br /><br />If your kids like it just as well, more power to 'em.  It's good to cultivate broadened tastes in kids so they'll enjoy a variety of foods and enjoy future travels more.  If you like it or, like me, figure you'll get used to it, great.<br /><br />Just don't tell me there's no difference?  No reason we can't adjust or even like this better, though.  We all have different tastes.

And though the taste is not the same as the one you get with sugar, I don't find such a strong aftertaste in this as in most light products. I'll certainly keep buying it!

review/summary: Great on sugar-free/low carb ice cream
review/text: I think how much you will like this depends on a) how many other sugar-free chocolate syrups you've tried, and b) how you plan on using the syrup.  If you have tried a lot of sugar-free syrups, you will like this one.  If you're used to sugared syrups, you will find that this product, like other sugar-free products, takes some getting used to.  For me, some of this on top of my low carb vanilla ice cream with some nuts works just fine, and I feel like I'm getting a real treat.  I haven't tried guzzling it by itself or with milk, or in coffee (really?  yuck).  I can't imagine the Hershey's version is made for coffee, and even Toriani, which IS made for coffee, doesn't taste very good (although my niece likes it).

review/text: I discovered sugar free Hershey's syrup a few months ago and have since become addicted to it.  It's great on low-carb ice cream and can be added to silk or regular milk to make low sugar chocolate milk or hot chocolate.  I have also tried adding it to Cool Whip for a "chocolate mousse".  I think it tastes very similar to the regular Hershey's syrup and wouldn't know the difference if no one said anything.

review/summary: Chocoholic , and I like it
review/text: This must be my 4th order, but I like this syrup. I've been drinking chocolate milk since I was a toddler ( my mum used to bring us all our glass of milk at bedtime.) so I've been drinking Hershey's syrup and nestles powder (and then syrup) for many years.<br />The only negative I could think of is that it seems to take more syrup to get more of a chocolate flavor.<br /> You'll also need to mix or stir it longer.<br />I don't know if there are some bad batches out there, but  what I've gotten so far tastes great, although I seem to use more of it.<br />Nestles has a sugarless quick powder, that's good too, but I was getting tired of that.<br />Missed the dark chocolate taste of Hershey.<br />I suppose I'd advise someone to give it a try. If you can return the unopened bottles , then give it a try.<br />I go through probably TOO much of it.  I have 2 teen sons who like it too.

review/summary: The BEST in Sugar-Free!!!
review/text: I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking when they write such horrible things about this amazing product.  It is not sour or bitter or anything of the sort; it is chocolate syrup that tastes like chocolate syrup.  A sugar high does not come with it (perhaps what the others don't like or are missing?) as Hershey's use erythritol--the exception to the rule--which is the only natural (or otherwise) sugar alcohol that does not cause diarrhea under any circumstances.  Now that in and of itself is reason to buy it for those out there with concerns about sugar consumption.  Most other products use maltitol (or any of the other sugar alcohols), which works better than any other laxative that I've tried.  In short, if you are a sugar-free fanatic, this is the product for you!<br /><br />A postscript--if you are not used to consuming sugar-free products, then it is going to taste odd in comparison to sugar-garbage.  Also, the fact that Hershey's can get a product like this to incorporate erythritol and not have it recrystallize is remarkable.
