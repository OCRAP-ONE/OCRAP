review/summary: Maze's Coffee
review/text: I love Eight O'clock coffee, it was my mother choice, now it mine.  I have tried several brands at home and work but I always come back to 8 O'clock.  I enjoy the mild blend in their original whole bean package.  I was at home with a cast of my right foot and realize I was running low on coffee...Amazon, coffee, Prime member and two days later I had my favorite drink.  A winner is a winner, no matter how you call it.

review/summary: Expensive, but worth it.
review/text: My husband has been drinking Eight-O-Clock coffee for decades. He refuses to switch to a less expensive brand because he loves this brand that much. In fact, I have been sending it to his military base in Afghanistan for the past 2 1/2 years. I signed up for autoship and now he enjoys one of his comforts of home on a regular basis.

review/summary: Delicious and a Bargain
review/text: Eight O'Clock Coffee is a great bargain. 100% Arabica Beans, never overroasted and always fresh. This is what good coffee should be...at a decent price (for nowadays).<br /><br />I find it to be full-bodied without being bitter, and has none of the stale off-flavors that some of the canned varieties have. There are some good quality beans in the original blend (cannot vouch for the others).<br /><br />I especially enjoy it out of my stovetop percolator...aroma is heavenly, and flavor is similar to what a good coffee shop (not coffee house) produces. Overall, if you like a good cup of plain coffee, this stuff is golden. If you like the darker roasts of some of the more famous coffee vendors, you probably won't like it. Personally, I adore it for my first cup of coffee in the morning.

review/text: I had to pick a new coffee to order for someone in our house as the regular kind we were using as the general house coffee was no longer available. I was hesitate to buy such a big bag but had eight o clock brand before so gave it a shot.<br />The beans grind well with strong coffee smell that makes you want to inhale after grinding. Brews up tasty coffee with medium flavor, not bitter and consistent cup after cup. I will continue to buy this coffee as the house coffee if it remains at a good price.

review/summary: It's just ok.
review/text: You know that moment right when you open a new coffee bag where you've just gotta stick your nose in and inhale? Well when you do that with a bag of Eight Oclock Coffee, it's a little bit unpleasant. That fresh sharp but sweet aroma is missing. But I mix this 50/50 with another kind of bean I prefer to save a few bucks and I'll give these Eight Oclock beans credit for not ruining the taste of my final product as most other cheaper coffees do. It's not awful, especially if fortified with some more flavorful beans. On its own this is a fairly bland roast with no personality and perhaps if you make it as strong as I do you may also find it a bit unpleasant.

review/summary: Disappointing and stale
review/text: I'm not sure if I just got a dud. I purchased this based on users' positive reviews and my bag of beans are NOT fresh at all. The last bag of whole beans I purchased was from Costco and when I first opened that bag, the smell of sweet coffee aroma was overwhelming (in a good way). With the Eight O'clock beans, you have you put your nose really close and practically into the bag to smell coffee fragrance. The beans look to be dried out and stale (and some beans roasted to a black burntness). It's possible that maybe my bag is a dud or maybe there was a small hole that caused the beans to dry out before it's arrival. This is my 3rd coffee bean purchase from Amazon and it is a real disappointment. I'm tempted to call the company's toll free number to complain but figure they probably can't do much than give me more of this crappy coffee.<br /><br />I'll admit...I'm sitting here in the morning with a freshly brewed cup of this coffee, but with each unsatisfied sip, I'm get frownier by the minute. It doesn't even smell coffee-like at all! :( :( I will probably throw this out when I can find a good affordable deal on some new beans.

review/summary: New to 'whole bean' coffee
review/text: Jesus created the coffee bean and I am so thankful (Colossians 1:16 ..."all things were created by him and for him").<br /><br />I have been enjoying coffee since a young teenager - starting the day around 5 AM with coffee in hand and chatting with my grandfather - great memories.  Those were the days of percolators and Maxwell House 'ground'.<br /><br />Recently I purchased a grinder and ordered the Eight O'Clock 'whole bean'.  I guess I'll never look back. The thrill of grinding it fresh each morning and enjoying the smell adds a whole new level of enjoyment.<br /><br />Jesus didn't have to make the coffee bean, but I am very glad that he did.  I am also thankful to the Eight O'Clock company and Amazon for bringing me this great product at a very fair price.<br /><br />Jim Smoak

review/summary: Not terrible, but I won't buy it again
review/text: OK, first thing first. This coffee is cheap- around $6 per pound, shipped. Until I tried this, nearly all coffee I'd bought was between two and four times as expensive. Keep that in mind while reading this review.<br /><br />If you are a poor coffee snob, don't get this. If you are just looking for a good value in coffee and don't have very high standards for coffee, this might be acceptable.<br /><br />I drink coffee every day, and I take a fair bit of effort to prepare it well (Hario V-60, french press, or clever), I don't ever brew large pots of drip coffee. By general standards, it is probably fair to call me a coffee snob; by local Seattle standards, not so much. That said, I'm not going to go on about tasting notes, undertones, overtones, etc. etc. etc. I like some light roasts, some medium roasts, some dark roasts, but I'm not much of a taste-tester- when I taste coffee I can tell right away whether I like it or don't like it, but I can't pick out subtle flavor profiles and can't necessarily tell why I like or dislike it. My immediate impression of this coffee was that it tastes a little bit bland, a little bit burnt, and not very good, but I'm not going to expand on that.<br /><br />Important caveat: This review is intended for people who have the time, patience, and interest to brew coffee with a reasonable level of care. The best coffee in the world is rendered mediocre without careful brewing. If you are using an electric drip brewer, you probably shouldn't be spending more than $6/lb on coffee, ever. *<br /><br />If you use an electric brewer to make your pot of coffee in the morning, my recommendation is to buy this coffee because it is good value and will be nearly indiscernible from much more expensive coffee (and stock up on cream and sugar to mask the flavor of old coffee that your brewer imparts on every cup). If you take a reasonable amount of care in preparing coffee, read on (but you probably shouldn't buy this).<br /><br />Depending on how frugal and lazy I'm feeling when my coffee runs out I typically get whole bean bulk coffee from a local upscale grocery store at around $12/lb, try one of the local coffee roasters at around $15-20/lb (I live in Seattle, there are a lot to choose from), or try to roast my own beans (which comes out to about $8/lb but results range from bad to acceptible). Before moving to Seattle I'd usually buy whole bean coffee from starbucks at around $15/lb. I tried this coffee because I am currently pretty short on cash and figured cheaper coffee was a good way to save money.<br /><br />So, the eight oclock original bean is... alright. The coffee I was getting at the local supermarket and pretty much all of the local roasters is much, much better. Pretty much every Starbucks roast I've tried is considerably better. For about the same price I was (usually) getting better coffee by roasting at home (although this does add time and effort).<br /><br />Overall quality is about 2 stars, value is about 4 stars, I'd say that averages out to three stars. If your expectations are sufficiently low, you won't be disappointed and might be impressed, it isn't nearly as bad as a can of pre-ground Folgers that someone once gave me (that was really, truly, horrible).<br /><br />Prepared in a v-60, this coffee is drinkable, and I'll probably drink all three pounds instead of throwing it away, but I won't be buying again. I always drink black coffee, but I might sometimes add cream to this. In the future, for about the same amount of money, I'll stick with home-roasting (a bit of a hassle, and results vary a lot for me, but usually better than this). Starbucks is better; most small-scale roasters I've tried are much better, but these are more expensive, whether it is worth it or not is really up to you.<br /><br />* note on electric drip coffee machines:<br />Maybe there are good electrical drip machines, I don't know, I just know that I've never had a good cup of coffee from one. If you love coffee and always use an electrical drip machine and yours makes the best coffee in the world, that's cool, I'm not trying to insult or question your judgement. I've had $50/lb Kona coffee out of an electrical drip machine, it was lousy (the same coffee made "cowboy-style" in a pyrex measuring bowl and filtered through a paper towel was great.)

review/summary: Start Your Day Right, With Quaker Chewy Chocolate Chip
review/text: I like to grab a pair of granola bars in the morning as I head to work and Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip make a good choice for this type of breakfast. They offer a decent amount of nutrition for such a small amount of food and the ingredients are mostly wholesome. Combined with a small amount of milk or other beverage to wash them down, they make a great way to start the day. I also like the sweet, grainy taste and the chewy texture, which is better than some of the crunchy granola bars that can often be a chore to consumer.<br /><br />Even though I like Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip very much, there are a few possible drawbacks with these granola bars. The first one is the fact that they are not very filling. If you don't plan on eating lunch for a long time afterward, then you might want to reconsider Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip because they are likely to result in a growling stomach in a relatively short time. The reason is because they lack sufficient fat and calories to keep you going for very long. The other potential drawback is the addition of high fructose corn syrup in the manufacturing of this product.<br /><br />If you are worried about budgetary restrictions, you will be pleased with Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip. These bars are not very expensive and the surprising fact is that, compared to other granola bars, they often rank in the bottom half in terms of overall cost. This is surprising when you consider that they carry the Quaker label. A premium, quality name like Quaker should, one would assume, carry a premium price. But Quaker has managed to keep costs under control and it offers these granola bars for a price that is lower than most other name brands.<br /><br />Granola bars will likely remain part of my daily eating routine and Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip rank among my favorite breakfast bars. The ingredients are a little worrisome, and the carbohydrate level is too great for those on low- carb diets. But these are still very tasty bars and they are priced right.

review/summary: Movie Theater Popcorn In Your Home!
review/text: Are you looking for GENUINE popcorn flavor and texture popped from the convenience of your own home?  Then look no further than this popcorn party kit!<br /><br />I purchased this popcorn as a side item when I found and purchased an at-home "authentic" popcorn machine on Amzaon.  Unfortunately, the popcorn machine that I ordered during the same transaction (from a different Amazon seller than Wabash) had been discontinued; however, I received this popcorn kit from Wabash within a mater of days.<br /><br />Here I was, stuck with this popcorn kit and no popcorn machine in which to pop it.  The only way I knew how to pop popcorn was in a microwave.  So I got out a covered, 6-qt sauce aluminum sauce pan (part of a 13-pc Calphalon cookware set I bought a couple years ago at B, B, & Beyond), followed the cooking instruction for "stovetop" popping on the back of the popcorn package, and poured the package's contents into the pan.<br /><br />The results were INCREDIBLE!  The scent of movie theater popcorn filled the air of my condo, and the entire sauce pan was filled to the top with buttery popcorn.  It was actually pretty cool, too, watching the popcorn pop through the glass lid lol  We poured it out into a popcorn bowl, sprinkled a little bit of Wabash's Popcorn Salt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017LF24">Popcorn Salt</a>, and my wife and I couldn't believe how authentic this popcorn tasted (on a separate note, this salt tastes GREAT on things like french fries and tater tots).  Nearly every kernel popped fully and perfectly, and nearly every piece was nicely coated in just the right amount of yellow, melted butter and oil.  We then sat down and watched "Batman Begins" - we weren't even past the first five minutes when we had finished off the entire, huge batch of popcorn and were making more!!<br /><br />We didn't use the paper popcorn cups because we didn't want to waste them on just us, but they're definitely a nice novelty and add to that authentic, movie-theater feeling.<br /><br />We've had a few guests over for movie night at our home, and our guests agree that this is great tasting popcorn.<br /><br />This Popcorn Party Kit is a MUST HAVE!  If you want authentic popcorn at your home, whether for yourself, your family, or for your friends and guests, look no further than this.  I'm a Wabash valley Farms customer for life!!

review/text: A very nice, premium popcorn that I had years ago. It doesn't have the "movie theater" taste (I believe that to be powdered butter), that someone was looking for (it was a gift). This is a good purchase, but something you can get for less. That is, the taste. Nearly everyone has movie theater popcorn for sale, & we have tried nearly all of them. No difference to what you can get in the grocery store to micro-wave.<br />Granted, there is more fun in using this product, & you get a few popcorn cups to put the popcorn in. Plus everything is measured out unless you want more butter or salt.

Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known.  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better.  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.<br /><br />As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.  Almost like a couple of hours on the beach.<br /><br />I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.  This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood, but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties.

review/text: We have some food sensitivities in our household, so we cannot use flavorcol due to the Yellow 5 (Tartrazine, a known migraine trigger).  Although it's not as good as flavorcol for popcorn, it is as close as we can get in our house.

review/summary: Covers well, you will probably eat less salt in the end
review/text: This stuff is great.  Since it is a fine powder, it covers very uniformly and sticks a little better.  I am confident that I use less salt since I don't have as many large "rock salt" chunks, so I use it on everything.<br /><br />Yes, it isn't iodized, but I don't count on salt for my iodine anyway.  I seem to have avoided goiters since iodine it is included in multivitamins and many fortified foods like cereal.<br /><br />Keep your chunky sea-salt, it is a gimmick and tests show no one can tell the difference between sea-salt and regular.  The same goes for gimmicky brown "unrefined" sugar.  Which reminds me - I use less sugar when I sprinkle cereal, etc, with powdered sugar.

review/summary: Diamond Crystal Popcorn and Nut Salt
review/text: I love this salt! It is absolutely excellent on popcorn or nuts. It is a very finely ground salt that adheres to the moisture in the popcorn when it is freshly popped or adheres to cold popcorn due to the crevices in the popped corn. With nuts it also adheres wonderfully when the nuts are fresh out of the oven after toasting them. Since the salt is so finely ground the salt just becomes part of the popcorn/nut and doesn't stand out as salt would do if using a regular ground salt. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017LF24">Popcorn & Nut Salt - 24 oz</a> I use this salt for a variety of foods as it disperses well and dissolves in food so that it gives an even taste without being obtrusive. I highly recommend this product. So much so that I bought three 24 oz containers of the salt.

review/text: I haven't ordered this but I was reading some bad reviews saying it was just salt, not flavored, which is true. I also read that it is finer than regular store bought salt and so it sticks to the popcorn better.  That is very true.  But I wanted to tell people that if you go into the regular supermarket and find Diamond Crystals salt it says "The finer salt" on it and I think it may be the same as this.  It is very fine and I have been using it on popcorn for years.  It sticks much better than granulated.  You may not need to spend more on this product since it's most likely the same salt.

review/summary: Great Stuff - but formula has since changed
review/text: I first bought this lime extract to flavor "home-made" seltzer water without the use of sugar or real lime juice in July of 2009. This extract has been very easy to use - about 6cc per liter of seltzer. I've gotten lots of compliments on the taste of the lime-infused seltzer and I'm no longer throwing out perfectly good bottles after just one use.<br /><br />The shipment from JR Mushrooms was prompt... two bottles arrived in a well-padded box with lots of bubble-wrap and foam peanuts to keep them safe and sound. The bottles themselves are dark brown glass (presumably to shield the juice from the sun) and have well-fitting plastics caps. All in all, I was very happy with this purchase and the quality of the product, as of July 2009.<br /><br />Recently (August 2010 - that is how long the initial 32 oz order of the old extract lasted), I ordered another set of extract. Sadly, the supplier of extract to JRMushroom has changed and so has the formulation - the extract now arrives in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark brown glass bottle of 2009. I am not convinced that the present version if terpeneless, as there is a fairly bitter aftertaste. Amit at OliveNation/JRMushrooms was very nice to refund the unopened bottle (I had bought 2) and also informed me that he is negotiating a new supplier for the stuff.<br /><br />So here is what I suggest for any extract order over the internet: Order a small sample bottle ($6.5) and make sure it fits your flavor expectations before ordering a larger bottle. Plus, before you re-order, contact the seller and make sure that the flavor/supplier hasn't changed. I am a bit disappointed that Amit has not updated the Amazon web pages to reflect the new packaging, which would have been a good clue not to go ahead with a large-bottle purchase but to sample the present product first. Live and learn, I guess.

Put the egg white halfs on a plate (they will be filled later on). The egg yolks go in a bowl, add some mayonaise, Hela Curry, salt and pepper and mix this untill it becomes smooth. This mixture will go in the spot where the egg yolks used to be! You can use a piping bag with star nozzle for a nice effect!

review/summary: The stuff I missed so much.
review/text: This is exactly the stuff I missed from back when I still lived in The Netherlands. Not the hot version but this one's the one they use in snackbars and the like.<br />I had to pay a bit over $10 from the seller I bought it from which is pretty pricey but it's an imported product and I haven't been able to find it anywhere near me so I think it's worth the splurge every once in a while. Having family ship some would've cost more so I'm very happy with the purchase. Already used it in deviled eggs like I used to and they were awesome!<br /><br />Now to find a good recipe for Frikandellen. ;)

review/summary: Not quite American Catsup
review/text: I ordered this and other catsups just to taste what they use in other countries.  This catsup reminds me of the catsup from the Phillipines made out of bananas; pretty sweet, but does not have the curry flavor though.  Although I am sure this is a fine product for those who are from the countries that normally use it and grew up with it, but it is a little funky for American tastes.  Besides the extra sweetness, it has a less viscous more syrupy consistency.  And I thought I would like the curry flavor, but it somehow confuses my taste buds that are expecting Hunts, Heinz, or Del Monte.<br /><br />Get it to try it and make your own decision.  But for my tastes I will be putting some good ole Heinz on my fries.

review/summary: Not too bad as a gift
review/text: First, the quality of the individual products in the box is great.  Packaging is also nicely done (not the mailing packaging, but the gift box and its quality.  We are very pleased with all items in the box.<br /><br />With that said, My only real complaint is price.  The 4.4 pounds includes everything - even the packaging.  The quantities are not being shown in the product description as I write this review.  This is not a lot more than a product sampling package, yet the Amazon price at this moment is an even $40.  That works out to very expensive "per ounce pricing" if you purchased each of the items individually.<br /><br />But there is one additional positive.  It's become common to expect "gift baskets" and other types of gift selections to be priced very high.  If you're willing to pay the money for a very nice gift, that's exactly what you'll be giving - a very nice gift.<br /><br />Had it not been for the pricing, this would have been a very solid 4-star rating (we give VERY few 5-star ratings - they truly have to be the best of the best to get 5 stars from us.

review/summary: Give your friends a healthy nudge.
review/text: The box looks like one of those old-fashioned wooden fruit crates.  Can't really tell by the photo here, but it does.  It has all kinds of witty sayings written on it... "Kale yes!" and "Hugs and quiches" and so on.  The food products are nested in shredded brown paper.  Overall it's a very natural and quaint presentation.  The shredded paper left some dust on the spice bottle and at first I thought it was dirt since it was brown, but then I realized....<br /><br />I have often cooked with quinoa and lentils and mung beans and Bragg's Liquid Aminos, but the sprouted lentils and beans were a new experience for me, as was the spice shaker.  Oh my goodness those spices were so tasty.  My nine-year-old daughter selected one of the four recipes that were included.  I was like, "Meh, I've cooked all of this before... whatever..."  But the recipe we made-- Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes--was entirely new to me.  It was so good.  Like Thanksgiving all in one patty.  So there's these four recipes included, and they all use most of the ingredients in the box--just add fresh veggies.  The sprouted beans cook up in just five minutes, which is pretty amazing to me as a veteran bean cooker.  In my opinion, sprouted beans taste stronger than standard beans, and not very good on their own, but with the two Bragg's ingredients in the box, and the excellent recipes (well, I only tried one), the beans are perfectly balanced.  We had a delicious dinner.  My 6-year-old finished her plate of food and was going for more before we had even served up everyone's food and said the prayer.  Little rascal.  But anyway, if kids think it's good, you know it's good.<br /><br />All of the recipes are vegan and gluten-free, as are all the ingredients in the box.  All organic, too.  Also included in the box was a pamphlet about how to start on a healthy diet.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that the quinoa instructions should say that quinoa must be washed first.  I noticed that too, and it's true that quinoa should always be washed before cooking, so I looked for any such instruction, but then I noticed that the package says the quinoa is thoroughly washed.  Why isn't quinoa always sold that way?  I cooked it without washing it.  It was good, clean.<br /><br />I think this is a great combo pack, very simple and straightforward ingredients and recipes.  As soon as I opened it I was thinking of the many people I would like to see on a healthier diet, and I'm guessing that's what this box is intended for... those of us who do eat a whole foods diet and hope to win our friends over with a nifty gift.  Yeah.  Support the positive propaganda!

review/summary: Nice but needs a little something
review/text: This Whole Foods gift set contains 5 items and each are high quality healthy foods. Quinoa, mung beans, lentils, Braggs spray and seasoning blend.  They are just my type of food and I enjoyed trying one food that was new to me.  But the box looked so empty that I was digging around in the filler for more even though I knew there were only the 5 items included.  Considering that you are paying a huge premium for the convenience of a gift box and the desire to impress the recipient of your gift, you would expect a little more oomph in the box.  Maybe include an organic vegan chocolate bar?  Or a beverage?<br /><br />So it's a little lackluster, which is why I took away one star.  I almost took 2 stars off (yes, it's that bland) but then I realized that this set has the added bonus of being vegan friendly and gluten free.  Most gift baskets would not be suitable for someone in that position.  So kudos for that!  But I still think it needs just one indulgent item or non-food item added to the box to make it gift worthy.  Something that doesn't just say "Here, I bought you some groceries".<br /><br />Whole Foods offers other configurations of gift boxes and they are really nice.  The larger box packs a nice variety of snacks and has eye appeal.  The smaller coffee set is also very nice - you can't go wrong with coffee!

review/summary: A GiftBox of Goodness
review/text: Lucky me.  I am so grateful to have gotten this box of wonderful food.  It could be called a Vegan Starter Kit.  Or you can eat the foods by themselves.  It's a starter kit for me because I like to put other foods with it.<br /><br />This kit comes with 10 oz bag of lentils, 10 oz bag of munga beans, 12 oz bag of quinoa, 6 oz liquid aminos, and 1.5 oz of 24 herbs & spices seasoning.  (All organic, of course.)  There are also some recipe cards.<br /><br />I already ate some of the lentils and mungas with the seasoning.  I added fresh tomatoes, fresh onions, and sea salt.  That was my dinner tonight.  It was really good.  In fact, it was excellent.<br /><br />I love this kit, and the remainder of it won't last long!<br /><br />Of course, I will not be consuming the aminos, as that is soy.  But that one bottle does not take away a star.  The rest of the contents are enough to make up for it.<br /><br />I love the 24 herbs & spices seasoning.  I can think of so many things that it can be used on.  I can't wait it try it on mashed potatoes, which I will try it tomorrow.<br /><br />I love this kit.  It is wholesome, awesome, healthy, filling, and tasty.  Too bad I can't reach into the sky to get more stars for this review, because 5 is not enough.

review/summary: There is definitely healthy vegan food in this package
review/text: This gift box is large but only contains 5 items besides some recipe cards.  These 5 items are definitely healthy and vegan-based.<br /><br />In this gift box I received:<br />12 oz truRoots Organic Quinoa<br />10 oz truRoots Organic Sprouted Mung Beans (which I can't wait to try)<br />10 oz truRoots Organic Sprouted Green Lentils<br /> 6 oz Bragg Liquid Aminos which is a natural soy sauce alternative (this I'm not too thrilled to try)<br />1.5 oz Bragg Organic 24 Herbs & Spices Sprinkle Seasoning<br /><br />There's also a pamphlet on getting started (toward healthy eating), one card describing the products, and 4 recipe cards using the ingredients in the package.  I am disappointed that nowhere in any of the instructions (recipe card, package directions, etc.) did it say that quinoa should be washed before cooking.  I have a lot of quinoa at home and you always have to wash it first to remove the saponins (soap like film).<br /><br />I would have rated this package 5 stars because the idea, recipe cards and three grains/beans enclosed are great.  However, there are two main reasons that caused me to rate this 4 stars. First, the products supplied can be purchased separately for about $23 retail--of course without the recipe cards which is a nice touch.  Second, the box it comes in is too big.  I think Whole Foods wants to give the impression that you are getting a lot for the price but it's really a waste of cardboard.  If this package were priced between $30 and $32 and came in a smaller box more suitable to the items enclosed, I would have rated this five stars. As of this review, the price on Amazon is $40.<br /><br />This is certainly an interesting twist on a gift although the recipient might not think you spent so much.

review/summary: A great gift for a vegan, or anyone trying a healthier diet
review/text: A friend's daughter has just gone to college.  Now that she's there she's decided to go vegan and can't find anything but potato chips to eat.  I suggested my friend send her this, along with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CVTT52">rice cooker</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUXU">hot pot</a>.  As long as those appliances are allowed in her dorm, she can have good healthy meals and plenty of protein, right there in her dorm room.<br /><br />I have quinoa or lentils several times a week, partly because I like them and partly because they fit my budget.  I'm new to sprouted mung beans and the liquid aminos and seasoning.  I've had a week of fast and easy lunches with this kit, and this is what I've noticed so far:<br /><br />Quinoa: Oh, man, I am getting spoiled.  I love quinoa but hate to have to rinse it.  This quinoa is pre-rinsed, so it goes straight into the pot.  I've always cooked it for 10 minutes, though the package says 15.  10 seems to be just fine for this quinoa, too.  It also seems to be fluffier than my usual quinoa.  The flavor is the same, which is to say, not much, so it works well to replace rice.  I add it to soups or chill it to add to salads.  I've also had it for breakfast instead of oatmeal.  1/4 cup dry (about 1/2 cup cooked) has 5g of protein, so I'm not looking for a mid-morning snack after having this for breakfast.<br /><br />Lentils: I sauteed some onion, added broth and a half cup of lentils, then added a good pinch of seasoning.  20 minutes after I started chopping the onion I had a really great lentil soup.  Since I don't cook with salt I sprayed a little of the liquid aminos over the top.  Best lentils I've had in a long time.<br /><br />Mung beans: The first time I made lentil soup with this kit I figured I'd throw in some mung beans. That was a mistake--the mung beans have a stronger flavor and they completely overwhelmed the lentils.  I ended up with a soup with a nutty flavor, and it wasn't as thick as I expected.  It wasn't lentil soup, but it was very good.  Since then I mostly cook and chill these to add to salads.  The instructions say 3 cups water to 1 cup mung beans, but 3 cups left me with a lot of water to pour off.  A 2 to 1 ratio seems to be about right.<br /><br />Liquid Aminos: I just tasted a bit of soy sauce then a bit of Liquid Aminos.  (I don't recommend that, by the way.)  They taste about the same.  My soy sauce has a preservative, and there's no preservative in the Liquid Aminos.  Otherwise I'm not sure what the difference is.  The spray bottle is handy.  I'd use them interchangeably.<br /><br />Bragg Organic Sprinkle: A nice seasoning mix.  I've been using it in soups and on chicken.  I'll have to try it on popcorn.<br /><br />The kit comes with four recipes, but to be honest I haven't tried any of them.  I keep a fairly well-stocked kitchen, but I was missing ingredients from every recipe.  I'm looking forward to trying them (especially the Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes,) but it would be nice to see a few recipes with ingredients most people will have on hand.<br /><br />I really like this kit, and while I do find it expensive, I'd happily give it as a gift to someone who wants to take their cooking in this direction.

review/summary: Healthy and Thoughtful Gift
review/text: I decided to get the Whole Foods Market Mighty Bowls of Goodness Gift Box for my 20 yr old daughter who is a vegan. She always has difficulty finding foods that fit her lifestyle, and holiday gatherings are especially trying times for her. I think she'll appreciate having a variety of delicious all organic, gluten-free, and vegan friendly grains and seasonings at her fingertips. Hopefully she will whip up a couple of the included recipes as part of Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow! I'm looking forward to sampling some of whatever she makes.<br /><br />My gift box arrived double boxed in perfect condition. The box and contents are exactly as shown in the product photos on the Amazon webpage. The gift box is sealed with kraft tape. I imagine this is both to keep it closed safely during transit, and to act as a tamper evident seal. I opened it up to make sure everything had arrived safely - which it had. The interior of the box has a nice double flap, and generous amounts of crinkle-shredded kraft paper, to protect the contents. Most everything is easily recyclable except the 3 plastic bags containing the grains. The expiration dates on the products are clearly marked and all are well into late 2012 or 2013 - so everything is nice and fresh.<br /><br />Overall a very nice gift for the healthy eater on your gift list!

review/text: I have nothing but good things to say about this product because I have the great fortune to be able to order it online. The local store is only a few blocks from my house but I would not shop there for all the tea in China! The service is deplorable, filled with lazy, arrogant and disdainful pimple-faced teens that would clearly rather be ANYWHERE ELSE than helping paying customers!! This store has the worst service I have had the displeasure of experiencing in a long time. (I'm sorry it had to be said LOL.) As for this product, I loved the gift basket, it was a perfect gift for my Vegan buddies. The quinoa sweet potato cakes were fabulous. My packages arrived ahead of time and were in perfect condition thankfully for a gift. The 3 stars is only because box is fairly small but all in all a great deal in my opinion.

review/summary: Perhaps a good gift for vegans
review/text: I am a healthy eater and frequently shop at Whole Foods.  I like beans and spices and thought I'd like this ensemble.<br /><br />I did like the packaging. It comes in a box that opens easily and it feels like a nice assortment to receive as a gift. Though I agree with others that it could use something else - a sweet or something to make it more special than just beans/grains and flavorings.<br /><br />It comes with several recipe cards.  I also liked this idea, that the recipient can use the ingredients to make something right away (though some fresh veggies are needed in addition to what is in the box).<br /><br />I tried one recipe - the quinoa sweet potato cakes, and wasn't impressed. The amount of chili powder called for made them so spicy I could barely eat them. I definitely couldn't serve them to my kids.  Even with less chili powder, I think they would have been just mediocre.  None of the other recipes looked appealing to me.<br /><br />So now I just have a few bags of beans and flavorings waiting for another use.<br /><br />I'd give this product a good rating for the packaging and the concept.  I'm docking stars for the usefulness of the products enclosed and the appeal to anyone but the most natural foods eater.

review/summary: Perfect gift for the natural & health minded cook
review/text: This gift is a wonderful accompaniment to any kitchen, especially for those who are health conscious and want to serve natural and organic foods at home.  The Braggs Liquid aminos is an excellent alternative to soy sauce (without all the extra salt) and have used it twice for the base of delicious marinades on seafood, along with garlic and ginger.  The Braggs organic seasoning is very tasty on mixed vegetables to kick them up a notch, or sprinkled on potatoes.  Just watch out with how much you are using if you have high blood pressure or are watching your sodium intake.  The quinoa was very fresh and nutty tasting, and I liked the fact that it is pre-washed, saving an arduous step in cooking quinoa.  Makes it a very easy and healthy side dish to include with any main dish.

review/summary: Pricey departure from more typical gifts
review/text: I'm grateful to have received this for free for review, as I think I'd be a little disappointed had I had to pay the full price -- but price aside, this would be a nice gift for someone special for whom you might want something "Different."<br /><br />The box is a sturdy flip open cardboard box, filled with shredded paper and the five items you see in the photo, along with some recipe cards.  I've tried two of them, and they're tasty -- but I did add a little olive oil instead of going with their oil-less cooking instructions.<br /><br />You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy these meals as-is, and you can certainly add some meats of your choice if desired.<br /><br />The reason I'd be disappointed at full price is there's just not that much to this box -- the lentils, quinoa, and mung beans will be gone after 2 to 3 recipes' worth of each at best.  The liquid aminos (quite similar to soy sauce!) and the seasoning blend will at least last for awhile, and they're not something I'd typically buy myself, so I welcomed the opportunity to try them.  They certainly added a more complex flavor to the dishes.<br /><br />I did not wash the quinoa first, as that wasn't specified in the directions, and it came out just fine -- even my husband, who has not often been exposed to such things, enjoyed it!

review/summary: Quality Products, Packaging for Shipping can be improved
review/text: Thankfully, I was able to pick this up at a great discount.  I don't think it is worth its normal site price.  It is still a nice gift, and nicely put together if you don't mind spend the higher price.<br /><br />The products are quality. I am giving this as a gift, so I cannot review the food.<br /><br />Shipping is my only complaint.  I received the box today, very nice/fun packaging, it ships to you in the box that you see in the images.  The items are presented well and there are even some recipe cards inside.  BUT.  This is the ONLY packaging, the Braggs spray came with a snapped off sprayer. While it looks nice, there is minimal crinkle packaging for the two products that could break.<br /><br />I'm hoping to get a response back and hopefully get a replacement.  Until then, if you can get a good deal on this, it is totally worth it!

review/summary: Wonderful gift set!
review/text: First, the price.  At the original price, this was not a good value no matter how you look at it.  On sale, however, the price is right so long as you want the gift box packaging.  I ordered this set because I wanted to try sprouted mung beans and sprouted lentils and was frankly afraid to try them.  Go figure.  I was already familiar with quinoa and knew I loved it.  At the time I ordered, I didn't pay much attention to the packaging and the other items in the set -- until it arrived.  What a surprise to find these simple, basic items packaged so attractively along with recipes and condiments that made trying the sprouted beans a pleasure instead of a challenge.  The mung beans are terrific.  The Bragg Liquid Aminos add depth to whatever food you spray them on.  The Bragg Organic 24 Herbs & Spices Sprinkle Seasoning is wonderfully balanced and not unlike an herb mix I have been making myself for years.  If you are able to get this set on sale to give as a gift to introduce someone to these new flavors, it is a very good purchase.

review/summary: Maybe a Little Too Earthy, Even for the Crunchy and Gluten-Free
review/text: For the record, I'm in Austin.  I have long hair, and a lot of my clothing does not involve synthetic fibers.  Having prepared some of this for dinner, I am drinking organic, fair-trade coffee with gluten-free almond milk and agave nectar, as I write this.<br /><br />But, mmm...no.<br /><br />See here is the thing.  This is mung beans, sprouted lentils, and quinoa.  It's also "Bragg's Amino Acids" and a spice mixture that doesn't say "gluten-free" on the label.<br /><br />As for taste, this isn't ideal:<br /><br />Bragg's is a very acquired taste.  Even after a decade of being vegetarian and thirteen years of being gluten-free after that, I still don't like the stuff--and unless you're sure that your recipient thinks it's good stuff, you're going to get an "eeewww" on your Hanukah or Christmas present.<br /><br />This is also a gluten-free fail:<br /><br />The quinoa, mung beans and sprouted lentils are all good, and it's merciful that they are marked gluten-free, because sometimes it's difficult to know how things are processed, and if they are gluten-free.  But, then the spice mixture doesn't say it's gluten-free--which means it's probably not, and that's kind of annoying.<br /><br />Even drinking my fair-trade coffee out of an Ikea mug, I'm still a little stumped as to who would think this is just nifty.  I felt sacrilegious adding canned spinach to the first cooking attempt--the enclosed recipes call for things like cilantro, which is not something one tends to have sitting around the house in the dead of winter, even in Austin.<br /><br />So, it's good food, but it fails as to practicality and gluten-freeness. I'm wondering if the Austin Food Bank would find a good use for it.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee and Service
review/text: This item came prior to scheduled delivery and we ordered it online since it is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the stores.  The house brands, which are replacing this, don't measure up to the Millstone blend.  I ordered two packages to get the free shipping.

review/summary: A little disappointing for Kona
review/text: Even though I knew this was a blend and not 100% Kona, I was still a little disappointed by it (even taking into account my lowered expectations). It is a decent enough coffee, but doesn't really have that smooth Kona flavor that I fell in love with in Hawaii. Honestly, I'd rather just have 100% Kona every once in a while and regular coffee the rest of the time than drink this.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: If you are looking for major Kona coffee flavor, this is not the ticket.  The coffee is good but contains only a small component of Kona bean mix in the blend.

review/summary: Good for Long Term Food Storage
review/text: I'm working on creating a one year supply of long term food storage and before purchasing a significant quantity of a food item such as canned meat, I always get a sample and try it out.  This was a good candidate since it has a 10+ year shelf storage life.  I normally eat turkey bacon, so wanted to see how this would substitute.  The bacon slices are very thin and pre-cooked.  When I pulled the bacon from the can, I noticed there was a lot of fat, so you have to wash your hands after handling .  I sandwiched 7 slices of bacon between paper towels and microwaved for 60 seconds.  The end result was crisp, lean, thin, and tasty slices of bacon.  Expensive, but a good product to add to my long term food storage.  I would only use this product in an emergency situation and for that purpose, give this product a 5 star rating.

review/summary: Good bacon for long term storage
review/text: I bought this bacon to see how it tastes, need to know if the wife and I will eat it before buying a cse of something. Anyhow the first thing I thought when it arrived was how small the can was, but its only 9 ounces of bacon, I guess a 15 ounce can should be big enough.<br /><br />I opened the can and out came a an oily roll of wax paper, I know about the product so that doesn't worry me, I just have to wash my hands before and after, same as refrigerated bacon.<br /><br />I unroll the bacon and there are three layers to the roll, they are all folded in half so the full length strips of bacon fit into the height of the can. Each layer of wax paper has 12 or so slices on it, they are thin, not paper thin, but don't expect thick cut slab bacon either. These are supposed to be fully cooked, but I like my bacon crunchier.<br /><br />I found I liked this bacon best in BLT sandwiches after cooking the bacon almost 2 minutes in the microwave on a paper towel just to warm it up and get it crispy. I'd cut the cooking time to 30 seconds or a minute until you have your microwave dialed in.<br /><br />Obviously if there is an emergency and you're cooking over a flame, you'll want to be careful not to overcook these when warming them up.<br /><br />Last thing for you folks out there, my wife liked it, food storage products are hit or miss with her. Four stars because I really like thicker cut bacon, that isn't really the product's fault.

review/text: We took this camping. Huge advantage that it needed no refrigeration prior to opening. It was decent quality, though kind of misleading to think you get a lot of bacon. I'd get it again for the convenience - for camping.

review/summary: LOVE the "PEACH" Flavor...
review/text: I LOVE this Tea...let me say, I have never liked Iced Tea until recently. I was more of a Coffee lover, but with Summer coming up I thought I would try this. At first I fell in love with the lemon flavored version, then I ordered the variety pack. I was not a fan of the Raspberry, but the Peach is wonderful...it has a nice peach flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I am not a big fan of "Sweet Tea" mainly because my last few tries of southern sweet tea tasted like I was drinking a glass of sugar.  This has a nice blend of a tea flavor, peach and a hint of sweetness...TWO THUMBS UP FOR ME...just ordered 2 full boxes!

review/text: I have been completely satisfied with every single Green Mountain coffee and tea K-Cup until this one.  This tea is far from perfect!  The peach flavoring is so artificial it tastes like poison.  And it is not sweet!  I have tried brewing it strong, brewing it weak, adding sugar... nothing can help this tea.

Time to play catch-up :)<br />Its also a great drink to offer company instead of coffee, beer, wine, ect...

review/summary: It's good, but I wish it was stronger
review/text: I enjoy this K-cup tea. The peach flavor is mild and not overwhelming to the point of disguising the actual tea taste. I just wish the overall blend were a bit stronger. When brewed in a travel cup over ice it tends to get diluted and ends up on the weak side. After a while, as the ice melts, the tea becomes even more diluted and I often add some peach Snapple to the cup to regain some flavor.

review/summary: Great tea, great price!
review/text: I knew what I was getting when I ordered this tea, so of course I was pleased!  And, the best thing is the price.  K-cups are around $12 for a 12-16 pack in the store, but for just a small amount more (a couple bucks at most) you can get a 24 pack.  Also, by buying them on line they come straight to your door, so no trip to the store.<br /><br />I find the tea itself has a good taste, the peach is very summer-y and refreshing.  However if you are used to true "sweet tea" as made by a southern lady you may not find these sweet enough straight from the brewer. That's an easy fix though, just add a little of your favorite sweetner (or sugar) and enjoy!

review/text: I ordered this product and I absolutely love it. The taste was great. I initially thought it would be diluted with the ice but it wasnt. My only suggestion would be to use Aguave or a sugar substitute like splenda, etc. instead of regular sugar when brewing so it wont be grainy.
