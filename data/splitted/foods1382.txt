review/summary: Ind. Iced Tea Bags
review/text: This stuff is great!!! No powder to worry about, and the flavor is just like BREWED iced tea, without all the hassle...I carry a few in my purse at all times; just in case.  I've already gotten a few friends hooked on this product, the flavor and convenience are great, I especially like that there is no "powder" taste like with some other products of this nature...

review/summary: Convenient but Extremely weak
review/text: I'm surprised at the high ratings of this tea. Maybe the people rating it don't really like tea? This stuff tastes like water with a little tea added. I tried using 2 bags per serving which helped but it was still too weak. I LOVE tea and to get a really good tea taste I'm afraid I would have to double the strength with these. I'm giving it an extra star for convenience.

review/summary: Not all Gummy
review/text: I purchased these as "cupcake toppers" for some "Dead Velvet" cupcakes I was making for a zombie themed party. Most of the body parts that were gummy were melted and it was hard to distinguish what they actually were. Not all the body parts in here are gummy. The "teeth" are hard sugar candy. The parts that are gummy aren't very evenly distrubuted and my pack had a TON of feet, hardly any brains and some "sticks" that looked like they should be fingers. I only needed 24 so I found the best and trashed the rest ... Next year I will be looking for something better.

review/summary: Good, except they were melted
review/text: These gummies would have been very good except for the fact that over half the box was melted by the time they got to me. I don't know if they sat on a hot tarmac in Dallas, or if they were melted before they left the store. Unfortunately, it was too late to send them back because I had ordered them for a Halloween party. For the price, I really expected more. Since I ordered two boxes, I was able to get enough unmelted gummies for the party, but the rest were just a gross mess. Since the point of the candy is that it looks like a body part, it was very disappointing to have over half the product melted in a gooey, unrecognizable mess.

review/text: I've bought this product at the local markets for years, but they recently made it a Holiday 'seasonal' item only.  So I bought it through Amazon.  I still like the product, the the case I got was OLD.  The powder mix was largely solid (had lost moisture) and several bags had cracks and product loss.  I'm guessing it was just a fluke thing - but when you order, you do get a case of the stuff.  A bit disappointing.

review/text: I love Alpine Spiced Cider,as do several of my co-workers.  I have been drinking it for a number of years.  In the fall of the year one can generally find the product in a local market, however in off seasons the markets just don't stock it.  Since there are a number of us who enjoy the Cider, we have begun taking turns buying it and it is very convenient to purchase it through Amazon.com.  By getting a couple of boxes of the 12 packs, we get a fair price and also enjoy free shipping...so why run around - let it come to you.  Enjoy it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BS29S">Alpine Spiced Cider Apple Flavor Drink Mix, 10-Count, 7.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>year round.

review/summary: Balance of Sweet, Tart and a Hint of Spice
review/text: Alpine Spiced Cider is a great instant cider blend. Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't. It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background. During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds. On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go. Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage. It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either.

I actually drink it black and truly enjoy the flavor! It has a phenomenal aroma that lasts for the duration of the bag. Amazon, however, is charging too much for New England Coffee. It is 30% cheaper at the grocery store when the grocery store doesn't have it on sale (Amazon = $10/bag, Grocery = $7/bag), and 50% cheaper when it is on sale ($5/bag).

review/summary: Lovely and nutritious !
review/text: These mango slices are just the most lovely, tasty and healthy ever! They are less yellow than the photo represents. But, that is only to be expected in non-sulfured and organic dried fruits. They are also without the additional added sugar of all other types of dried mangoes. These slices are naturally sweet and have a lovely chewy and easy to consume texture.<br /><br />The lack of the sulfur and added sugar reveals the fresh, subtle and delightful taste of a "real" mango. I found myself gorging on these and had to restrain myself, in order to prevent their disappearance on the day of their arrival in my home. Eat these as they are, grind them with pineapple and banana to make a delightful and fresh-tasting Smoothie. Alternatively- add chopped bits of the dried mangoes to your baking, as with scones, gingerbread cake, or healthful cookies. You won't be disappointed with these lovely slices of dried mango.<br /><br />They are expensive, but well worth the price, especially considering all of their healthy contributions to your daily diet. The shipper was responsive, the slices were very well-packaged and arrived far in advance ot their estimated date of delivery. This is a no-brainer! I highly recommend these mango slices to one and all.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: I love dried mango when it hasn't been spoiled with added sugar.  However it's somewhat expensive so I thought I'd try buying in bulk online.  The actual product looks somewhat darker than the example picture, and the quality is not quite as consistent as what I can get at my local WholeFoods.  I estimate that 90-95% of the dried mango tasted excellent, however 5-10% was dry and brittle, and lacked sweetness.<br />If you can't obtain good dried organic mango locally this a good deal, but think I'll pay the extra $5 and get it from WholeFoods since there I can also select which pieces I want.

There may be some out there, but not in my grocery store in Houston, Texas.  This syrup along with whole milk, half and half and heavy whipping cream made the closest to "easy" store-bought eggnog I found.  I didn't want to use raw eggs and splenda, so this was a great alternative.  Topped with nutmeg, it was good enough to satisfy the Holiday craving.

My<br />husband is a diabetic and was able to eat these cakes without a negative<br />response in sugar levels.  I also used the Pillsbury Sugar Free Vanilla<br />Frosting with no negative results.  I served the Chocolate Cake frosted<br />at a very elegant dinner party and received rave reviews from the people<br />who attended.  I did add a teaspoon of real vanilla extract to both mixes to<br />enhance the vanilla flavor. My guests were unaware they were eating sugar free.Both cakes rose to a remarkable level; frosted easily and stayed moist for several days.  The crumb was the very same as I would expect from any good<br />cake mix.<br /><br />The vanilla sugar free frosting was a bit hard to spread eventhough it was<br />at room temperature.  I popped it into the microwave covered for 20 seconds<br />and that solved my problem regarding spreading the frosting.  I will use these<br />products regularly.

review/summary: Love them... New Staple
review/text: My wife and I are runners and all around athletes. I bought these after seeing Ryan Hall rave about them on his blog. Here are a few thoughts.<br /><br />They may seem expensive, but what I found is that they are so filling, we don't have to eat much. We make 3 servings per meal (I usually eat 2 and my wife 1). This is 1 cup which is about a 1/7 of the box. That meal ends up being about $0.75 for the two of us! Also, most pancakes usually have tons of calories, I can eat two servings, be comfortably full and only have eaten 260 calories. That's amazing!<br /><br />They are very quick to make. We have only made pancakes so far, but it only takes about 20 seconds of whisking. How easy is that?<br /><br />As for taste, I'm not AMAZED but they are good. They are boarder-line bland, so I put a little butter spray on them. We often mix them with fruit. However, for wholegrain... I'd say they are excellent. We've started mixing in protein powder and that has the potential to improve the taste depending on the protein you use.<br /><br />Healthy, cheap, easy, tasty, hearty... what more do you want?

review/summary: Simply the BEST Pancakes
review/text: This mix makes the most delicious pancakes. I've been using this product for several years and am still incredulous it only needs water! The local supermarket stopped carrying it because of price but now Amazon has it for a very reasonable price for the quality, especially on its Super-Saver plan.<br /><br />It is also delicious if you mix it 50-50 with the whole grain mix from Heidi's Rainy Day Pancakes that has that wonderful flax seed taste.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: THE MIX:<br />I really like the taste of this pancake/waffle mix and it's whole wheat which is much healthier than most of the mixes I see in the markets that are just white flour.  I've had trouble finding a whole wheat mix I like but was not disappointed here.  My little one is a picky eater and she likes it too.<br /><br />THIS SELLER:<br />Really fast shipping, I was very impressed.  I'm in CA, not sure if that matters.  Expiration date was 11 months from date of arrival.  This is same as when I buy it in the store so I was very pleased with that as well.  Overall extremely satisfied.

review/summary: Kodiak Cakes / yummiest pancakes
review/text: This pancake mix is excellent, if you are looking for a wheat pancake, that is light and fluffy, look no further. The combination of wheat and oat flour, makes this pancake mix, one of the best! I gifted Kodiak Cakes Mix, this past Christmas, with a wooden spoon & spatula...there were smiles all around.

review/summary: Another 5 star
review/text: Found this in the grocery store while looking for a healthy (read: no artificials, has whole grain) mix for the kids.  It was so easy and so good that it's the only mix we use.  Heck, we use it to make cookies too at times.<br /><br />I'll never use another product.  They taste great, and they also have an oat & honey version of the flapjack mix that adds some variety.<br /><br />Also, as others have noted while they are a little more expensive, we use less and any extras are used for snacks on trips to the zoo, etc.<br /><br />I also like that it's just a 50/50 ratio of mix & water, so they are a breeze to make either for flapjacks or waffles, though I tend to make it a little thinner for pancakes.

review/text: There always seems to be something weird about every pancake mix I try. But these just have the best taste, they're perfect pancakes. I've tried a few cheaper brands but I always come back to this.<br />I think it says to mix 2 cups of water with the powder for the serving size I make, but I do one cup, and then the other cup I replace with an egg and some milk. (One cup's worth, together.) Very rich and delicious.<br />I haven't tried waffles yet, but I just got a waffle iron and I am very confident they'll be amazing.

review/summary: Best pancake mix ever!
review/text: We started eating healthier about 9 years, and a major part of this was eating only 100% whole grains.  I was just making whole wheat pancakes from scratch until I found these, and I never went back to home made.  If you are used to Bisquick and that's what you like then these might be a change for you, but for me I couldn't tell these were 100% whole grain.  We camp quite a bit and I loved that I finally found a 100% whole grain pancake mix that was good, low in sugar, and most of all that all I had to do was add water, even better is that it is a 1 to 1 ratio on the mix to water so you don't need measuring cups while camping.  There are some good recipes I use this mix in, one was the apple spice cake which I now can no longer find one Kodiak Cake's website, maybe they'll repost it.  I tried their blueberry muffin recipe, not bad for a 100% whole grain muffin lower in sugar and fat, my daughters loved them, so...  We eat these quite often for breakfast and I don't feel bad that the girls eat them, they have a lot of fiber and except for a little bit of honey in them are a whole food.  I highly recommend this pancake mix!

review/summary: Our Sunday morning delight.
review/text: My husband and I were introduced to Kodiak Cakes on two week trip to Alaska.  At<br />a hotel breakfast we were served these fantastic waffles and syrup. The chef smiled conspiratorily and told me that I could get them in certain lower 48 stores.  On return home, I could not find them in stores, so I tried on line.<br />That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship.  We buy them by the case. We leave the waffles in a little extra time to make sure the outside is crispy, and to bring out the nutty oatsy flavor.  I also use the three delicious syrups, but my favorite is Marionberry.  We have had these delights every Sunday for nine years.

review/text: I grew up eating homemake pancakes from scratch every Saturday and haven't been great about contenting this tradition with my children - until now!!! I recently was turned on to Kodiak Cakes from a relative. Not only are they healthy (whole grains and no fillers!) but they taste unbelievable. All my children love them (even the baby) and the fact that they don't' require anything but water makes them easy enough to do on school mornings. I also love the exact directions as now I finally don't burn pancakes. This would be a fantastic item to bring camping or RVing as they are easy and don't require milk or eggs.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Quick, tasty, healthy! Our favorite breakfast!
review/text: My husband and I LOVE these! We picked this up at Fresh Market one day, and wow, we've been hooked for several months now. I make the pancakes (haven't made waffles with this mix) every Saturday, or at least every other Saturday. To feed my husband and myself, we use one cup of the batter and mix it with one cup of water (as per the directions). Too easy. I've made them plain and with blueberries. I love that I can sign up for the subscribe and save with these, so I never run out.<br /><br />***To make blueberry pancakes, I buy frozen organic blueberries (so I have them on hand at all times), thaw them in the microwave, pour my batter onto the griddle, and then drop the thawed blueberries onto the top side of the pancakes before I flip them. What you get are delicious blueberry pancakes without the blue batter and smashed blueberries.

review/text: My sister LOVES pancakes (the way I LOVE pizza).  We were looking for a healthier pancake mix when we came across this product.  We tried it and LOVED it.  And now we love it even more at the AMAZING price we can purchase it on this site.  We got creative w/it and mix about 1-2 tablespoons plain pumpkin (lessen the water a bit), a dash of pumpkin spice, and package sweetner for the BEST pumpkin pancakes ever.  We're thinking about adding a little applesauce and maybe some chopped apples...with your creativity, the possibilities are endless.  I probably wouldn't make chocolate pancakes because then I might be eating them all day long!

review/text: This Kodiak pancake mix is great for waffles.  I prefer to add in either flavoring, chocolate chips, or small pieces of nuts to the mix for a great variety.  I'm pleased with the texture of the Kodiak mix.  It cooks up well too with a nice color and crispness in my Belgian Waffle Iron.  I haven't tried pancakes with it but I am sure it would be just as tasty!  I'm especially happy that all you need to add is water - makes the mix even more cost efficient.

review/text: For the past 5 years, my husband has been experimenting with making whole grain pancakes. He is constantly trying new whole grain pancake mixes out on the family. We were visiting some friends in Brooklyn when he discovered the Kodiak Cakes at a small deli. He bought the box and made them for us and we couldn't believe how amazing these whole grain pancakes are. They are super tasty and made with amazing ingredients. Hands down the best whole grain pancake mix I have ever had. We bought 12 boxes to start giving away as gifts when we go to someone's house (instead of giving a bottle of wine)!

review/text: I picked up a box of this waffle mix at our local Target store recently.  My husband is a waffle afficionado and we usually get waffle mix from Williams & Sonoma and/or Bouchon Bakery, but I can't often bring myself to pay $12+ for waffle mix or wait two hours for the yeast to work its magic.  I tried this mix since it had used natural ingredients.  I was nervous when the first waffle came out of the iron.  They looked flatter than I was expecting, but when I bit into it, I was pleasantly surprised by the fluffiness.  My husband really enjoyed them too and I think this may become our go to brand when we're in a hurry.  Now I'm thinking of trying their brownie or cookie mix.  I don't like to bake from mixes, but this is one I can feel good about using.

review/text: Absolutely delicious flavor from ground wheat and oats- who knew that healthier pancakes would actually taste better? :)  These really seem like a product made by a company that cares about quality and tradition vs. maximizing profits.  Our family LOVES them and has them at least twice a week for breakfast.  We keep a couple of spare boxes on hand so that we never run out!<br /><br />Not heavy but substantial--I have noticed that fewer pancakes are needed to satisfy a hungry family.  A bit more expensive than Aunt Jemima-type pancakes, but they truly taste far better than any other pancake mix I've tried, and they are much healthier.  Highly, highly recommended.

Actually, since I was the only one in the family who liked them, this might be a good thing!  They are hearty without being cardboard or gritty.  They mix up in a split second and are fun to experiment with.  Try adding some canned pumpkin and a good sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice (cut back on water a bit).  I use a vintage, very well seasoned cast iron skillet, sprayed with Pam. Once the pan is hot, keep the flame between medium low and low.  No trouble with sticking as some other reviewers have mentioned.

While I was finally cleaning up the office (it's taken years!), I decided to reinvigorate the gum machines (perhaps my daughters would stop by and say hi more often).<br /><br />I looked around for some gumballs and most I found were the larger size that's typically in the $.25 commercial machines (which clearly wouldn't fit my machine).<br /><br />I found these and gave them a shot.  The gumballs are 1/2 inch and fit nicely in my machine, the amount filled my machine about 2/3rds of the capacity (it's hard to tell exactly since some is below the glass and the glass shrinks towards the top -- but clearly I could not fit another package into the same machine.<br /><br />The gumballs were fresh (I hate stale gum) and the taste is good and varied amongst the balls.  They taste lasts about as long as you get from most gum.  I'm certainly happy with the product and my girls are -- the first thing they do when they get in from school is stop by the office for a gum refill.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star is that I think they are a bit on the pricy side for the amount of gumballs provided.  I think a more reasonable price would be on the order of $10 to $15 -- though I do have to admit that I've been unable to find similarly sized balls for that price (unless they also included a large shipping cost on top of the lower price and netted out to be even more expensive).

review/summary: Should have come in a glass container
review/text: I've always been able to buy this product locally but have been unable to find it in this size.  I bought this product from Amazon as I finally thought to check online.  Well, when I've bought it before it came in the glass jar like your picture shows but it came in a plastic bag which I was disappointed.  I like to put some in the gun machine and save the rest in the jar till I need them but am unable to as the plastic bag deteriorated when I opened it.  Otherwise, the gum balls are just what I wanted.

review/text: I ordered this not realizing that wal-mart has the exact same thing (different brand) at wal-mart for $6.  Seriously.  Same size container, same size gumballs in their grocery candy section.  I was really hoping when this arrived that there would be "something" special about it, ie, bigger than I realized with more volume or larger size gumballs.  Nope.  Exact same thing as the $6 gumball container at wal-mart.  What a waste of money. Shame on me for not checking wal-mart FIRST.

It was so stringy we couldn't even cut it.  It looked pretty, but we couldn't even eat it.  The first pear we had was wonderful and the second didn't have any taste at all.  I know, it sounds like we complained, but you expect that kind of fruit to be good.  We really enjoyed both Kiwi fruit.  The apples and oranges are still adorning our dining room table.  They look very pretty and we will be eating them this week.  You asked me what I thought and I guess we were disappointed and I suspect you are, also."

review/text: Bob's Red Mill sells a few varieties of oatmeal, and the one listed (quick-cooking) is not the one pictured, described, or sold (instant). Indeed, Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Rolled Oats is not the same as Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats. This listing sells the Instant Rolled Oats, yet is titled as Quick Cooking. Some people feel that the Quick Cooking Oats is tastier than Instant, and when they place an order for the former, they don't want to receive the latter. I am deliberately giving this listing a low rating to draw your attention, in case this makes a big difference for you.<br /><br />The product itself is very good, of course, and I would gladly give Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats five stars if only it were the item listed. I urge Nutricity to make corrections to its listing as soon as possible.

review/summary: Gritty, cheap knock-off of high quality juice powders
review/text: The label on the back went as far as making this claim: "100% Whole Leaf Powder...not from juice!"  Ummm... the reason we drink wheatgrass JUICE, is because it's 99.9% digestable, because it doesn't contain any fiber.  Throw the fiber into it, and it takes a lot more effort and energy to digest.<br /><br />This Amazing Grass powder is gritty, and doesn't taste ANYTHING like real wheatgrass juice.  The gritty-ness is so bad, that it's very, very difficult to drink.  Do a google search and look for Wheat Grass JUICE powder.  Not just wheatgrass powder.  This stuff is 25% fiber by weight, so 25% of this product is filler.<br /><br />I used a similar cheap powder that came in a glass jar a number of years ago, and I was wary that this was the same stuff.  Sure enough, it's EXACTLY the same stuff.  You can find this stuff in bulk in canisters at Vitamin Wholesalers for 1/3 the cost.<br /><br />Again, the gritty taste and the fact that it doesn't even come close to dissolving in water should tell you something.  If it doesn't dissolve in water, it doesn't digest well in your body.

It does not dissolve well into whatever form of liquid out there.  They suggest you use in a smoothie, . . granted I never have tried that quite yet.  I drink with 8 oz of water and a packet of emergen c lemon lime flavor.  I really hope drinking this is as good for me as I think it is.  When mixed it looks like sewer water, . . .and although I've never drank sewer water, . . .I wouldn't be surprised if this is what it tastes like.  I guess it sure beats having to juice my own.

review/summary: Best way to keep from getting sick!
review/text: I decided to try wheat grass about a year ago as part of an effort to improve my overall health. I would mix 1 packet in a bottle of water and just chug it every morning. It doesn't taste great, but in my opinion its much more tolerable than fresh juiced wheat grass. The taste can change quite a bit based on my own body alkalinity and what I've been eating recently. Its really not bad at all, and the benefits are truly amazing. As long as I was drinking wheat grass, I was immune to every illness floating around. I never got sick once while on this stuff. My boyfriend also tried it with me and also never got sick while his co-workers were out consistently catching each others colds. He uses the loose power in the large container but I prefer the individual packets because they are so easy to carry around with me. I've eased up on it over the summer but I plan to start using it again daily as the fall/winter cold and flu season approaches. After a few months of using it, I didn't even have to worry about people sneezing on me or missing the hand sanitizer one time because I was simply immune to everyone's germs.

review/summary: Health benefits and convenience
review/text: I've only recently become aware of the health benefits of drinking wheatgrass juice, but like many I can't stand the taste, and it's too much trouble to juice the grass myself.  Unless you live in California or someplace where juice bars are abundant, who's got time for that?<br /><br />I already use the Amazing Grass/Amazing Meal Chocolate flavor, especially for breakfast because I tend to skip that meal and it's an easy way to make sure I don't.  I usually mix a sleeve of this wheatgrass powder with Amazing Meal to get a little extra boost of nutrition without adding a ton of calories.  (Wheatgrass is already in Amazing Meal, but people probably wouldn't drink it if it tasted too "green.") Also I like that I can conveniently store the one serving packs in my desk at work or in my tote, so I have no excuse.  Yes, it is a little gritty even when I blend it in my Vitamix, but that doesn't really bother me; I know it's not a milkshake and I feel good that I'm consuming a nourishing drink.  I have to say I was hoping for but haven't felt any significant energy boost as others have mentioned, but I figured a few extra greens couldn't hurt.

review/summary: Favorite Chili Recipe Very Easy
review/text: Flavorful but not too spicy chili. Also easy to make only requires hamburger meat, beans, and tomatoes takes under 10min prep time and cooks for under an hour. All the additions are purely customizable. Inside the box is pre-measured spices with directions. Couldn't be simpler makes a large meal if you add few cans beans and diced or stewed tomatoes.

review/summary: Old, stale and utterly awful
review/text: I received this in an unmarked box that had a sealed plastic bag inside of it with a pound of mints inside. No food labels, expiration dates, etc. After opening the package and trying one, I spit it back out. It was at best old and stale. I'm actually a little afraid that it may have been tainted somehow. I'll never order anything from this brand again.

review/summary: Richardsons Butter Mints
review/text: I have used these butter mints many times over the years.  When I was planning a wedding reception for myself, I chose to serve these mints to my guests.  As always, they were delicious and very elegant on the serving dish as they are very generous.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168ADMK">Richardson Butter Mints 16oz. - 10 Unit Pack</a>

review/summary: Happy, but larger pieces than expected
review/text: Seller was great and the product is great.  The pieces were just much larger than I expected.  They are twice the size of the usual after dinner mints.
