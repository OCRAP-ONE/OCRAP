review/summary: Best bags ever
review/text: I travel for work and wanted a bag that would be reliable, durable and convenient. In addition to Honeysuckle, I tried Lansinoh, Medela, Ameda and Simplisse. Honeysuckle was the best. Lansinoh was similar to Honeysuckle in that they are larger and easier to zip, but the bags are a little thin and would sometimes stick to the freezer and/or other bags. The "easy pour spout" of Ameda wasn't any easier than pouring out of any of the other bags. Medela was the worst - horrible zipper making it hard to get out the air and you were never sure it was fully zipped. The only advantage Medela has is that you could pump directly into them. So, I just cut little slights in the Honeysuckle bags and pump directly into them using the adaptors that came with the Medela bags. These bags are wonderul!

review/summary: Bags leaked! :(
review/text: I've been pumping and EBF for nine months now and recently switched over to these bags. I had such high hopes for them after reading the reviews and my initial experiences with them were fine. In fact, I love the design and size and the fact that I could lay them flat in the freezer and then move them upright for storage as a space saver. The problem?  I recently had two bags in a row leak. I have never had this happen before with any other bags and it was clear that the leaks were coming from the side seams and not due to punctures or improper sealing of the bags.  The bags were not overfilled or stored improperly.  It is so time-consuming and difficult to pump and try to keep up a decent stash that it was heartbreaking to see my milk go to waste like this. I was so upset that this is the reason I am writing this review -- I'm a frequent Amazon shopper but this is the first time I felt compelled to comment on a product.  I don't know if my remaining bags are okay or not but it's just not worth the risk.

review/text: I have nothing but good things to say about these bags.  No issues thus far.  They freeze well, they defrost fine, no leaks, and pour out easily.  They appear thin but are strong.  I would recommend them as they end up being cheaper in the long run with this bulk 300 bag purchase for $44.99

review/summary: Sturdy storage bags!
review/text: These bags are not only priced wonderfully (cheaper than you can get bags at a local store), they're also very sturdy. When I'm going to freeze my milk I only put about 6 ounces in the bag per recommendations (which is really closer to 7 because the bag's markings are off) but when I'm just storing milk in the fridge I put all the milk from my pumping session, which varies from 9 to almost 12 ounces. And the bag holds it! Not only that, but I had a full bag fall off the top shelf of the refrigerator and it landed on the bottom, intact. Yay for dual closures and sturdy plastic!

review/summary: Strong and economical
review/text: I'd been paying $23.00 for the 100 count bag of Medela breastmilk bags at the local BuyBuy Baby.  I go through a LOT of bags, because I want to have another child.  This baby is an IVF baby, and the next one will have to be as well.  My son has to be weaned from the breast for three months before I can cycle again, so I pump and freeze three times a day, because I want him to have enough breastmilk to see him through until at least 18 months.  I was going through bags like crazy and spending tons of money.  There's nothing wrong with the Medela bags, other than the fact that they are pretty pricey.  I found they Honeysuckle bags while searching on Amazon, and I just had to give them a try.  I'm so glad I did, because I certainly wasn't disappointed.  They are strong.  I haven't had one tear, and I haven't had any leaks either, which says a lot since I freeze my bags flat instead of upright.  I'll be buying these again.

review/summary: Requested samples, but then just went for it.....
review/text: I have been using Medela, Lansinoh, The First Years, and Nuk bags.  Up until I tried these, the NUK were my favorite.  Here are the features I love about Honeysuckle Bags:<br /><br />1.  The bags hold so much milk (I freeze in 5oz. quantities) and still freeze flat<br />2.  Dual-ziplock bag to prevent leaks<br />3.  Sealed top to ensure sterility<br />4.  They are biodegradable and better for the environment<br /><br />I am disappointed to see so many women complaining about not receiving the free samples on Facebook.  They're free!  It is not like the company didn't fill a paid order.  It is a nice gesture that the company was even offering them, but at some point you have to just decide if you want to make the purchase.  I initially requested samples, but then I just placed an order and I have no regrets.

review/summary: AWESOME.
review/text: I was in the NICU when I got my free sample. I shared my sample with another mom with twins and one of my lansinoh bags. I tried out the one bag and was happy. Not to waste I used up the lansinoh bags, made sure I was getting a better price on the Honeysuckle and ordered the 75ct, as I wasn't sure I still needed the 300ct (supermega-producer in the beginning). Well I'm sad that I didn't order MORE (just a super-producer now). So I didn't save as much money. But very happy with the bags. I made boxes out of paperboard with a hole at the bottom to pull out the "oldest" milk similar to the gift bag idea. Halfof my 7 cu. ft freezer is full!  Also these are such a great deal I'm planning on donating some to a woman in Brazil that lost her baby and is producing for the local NICU. Buy the bags, you'll love them!

review/summary: Price is great!
review/text: We haven't yet thawed out any of these bags so I cannot yet remark about strength. It doesn't really matter...I thaw my bags in a container. It's just a safety net no matter what (and a no brainer if you ask me).  My main motivation was cost. At 15 cents a bag, vs 20 cents a bag for the lansinoh, I was sold. We go thru approx 1 case of these every 35 days. It's a savings of $15. Not everybody will need 300 bags but my daughter is on 100% donor milk and we thaw approx 8 bags a day. The free shipping is great, and it's fast. With alot of babies on donor milk, moms really need more options out there because the cost adds up!

review/summary: Soooo many leaks!
review/text: I recently had several hundred ounces of milk shipped to us from the women who donates milk for our son...I purchased a bulk pack of these bags for her and I received the first shipment a few weeks ago.  I am sad to report that 95% of the bags have leaked...I had such high hopes for these bags but have since gone back to Lansinoh, while I had a fair amount of leaks with them it was nothing like this! I usually defrost 6 bags at a time and all 6 usually leak out the side seams and/or top.  Needless to say defrosting milk has become a total nightmare! Our donor only put the recommended 6 oz in each bag, froze them flat and shipped them with care. I was careful putting the bags into the deep freeze so this was not a user issue.  If you're planning to ship or freeze any milk I would definitely not use these bags.

review/summary: Great bags! Great deal!
review/text: I was using Lansinoh bags, because those were recommended to me. I live in a fairly rural area and those are the ONLY bags available in a 35 minute radius. Ordering these is actually less expensive (no tax and free shipping, which means I don't have to go to the store)and the bags are better quality. The side seams are thicker and so is the plastic and I have not had a problem with leaks. These are BIODEGRADABLE and tamper resistant(the others were not). I am on my fourth box of these. They will fit at least 12 ounces, but I usually only freeze 6 to 8 ounces at a time for convenience. Great bags overall...the ONLY problems are that there is no place to mark how much you put in the bag and the markings seem very generous on the outside; example...if you put in 6 ounces it looks like you only have 5. Overall I have been very happy with them and plan on ordering more next month.

review/summary: Better than Lansinoh or Medela bags
review/text: After 7 months of pumping I tried these on a whim and really like them. They are around the same size as the Lansinoh bags, but I had several instances of the Lansinoh leaking when thawing. I never liked the Medela because they are a little smaller and if full (4+ oz) don't freeze flat.<br /><br />Only thing a little strange is that there is no indicator on the label for # of oz (it has a spot for date and baby's name). So a small design flaw. But otherwise, I'm very happy with them.

review/summary: Love, Love, Love these bags!
review/text: Hello, my name is J, and I hoard breast milk - and these bags help me do it!  Thanks honeysuckle for feeding my addiction with storing a giant stash of milk.<br /><br />I've used every bag on the market, and since finding these, I won't use any of the other ones because they are THAT awesome.  Now you're probably thinking "why do you want to save so much? (my husband keeps asking me the same thing every time he opens up our chest freezer to see a bunch of paper gift bags stacked with milk)"  Well, with my daughter started teething at 4 mths then had 6 teeth by 8mths, therefore ruining our breastfeeding relationship.  She was also eating like a pig and due to my hectic schedule in the military, I was unable to keep up with her demand, so I burned through my stash quickly and was supplementing formula sooner than I would have liked.  I smartened up with my newest offspring and started pumping early and built up a nice little oversupply.  With that overage, I'm burning through bags left and right.<br /><br />Honeysuckle bags are thicker than others and they easily stand up on their own.  They don't feel remotely flimsy at all or leak in the slightest.  The best part is the biodegradable aspect.  I already feel guilty enough going back to work, I don't have to feel even worse about chocking out landfills with a ridiculous amount of plastic breast milk bags as well.<br /><br />You can also request free samples on their facebook page.  There is also a dollar off coupon code floating around as well.<br /><br />And a tip for storing the milk is to freeze it laying down, then stacking them up.  As said above, I put them in small gift bags, but I know people that have taken the ice cube buckets and stood them up in there.  Depends on what you have room for.<br /><br />Just buy the bags already, its a purchase you won't regret.

review/summary: Best storage bags I have found!
review/text: BEST BAGS EVER! These bags are a good value and they are durable. I was originally using the Lasinoh or Medela bags. Usually whatever was at Wal-Mart.  However, after searching on Amazon, I decided on buying these bags in bulk. I got soooo sick and tired of going to the store 1x a week to buy milk bags. I was actually searching for the lasinoh ones in bulk. Then I came across the honeysuckle bags.<br /><br /> These are totally worth it!  Before, I would have to defrost my milk bags in another little ziplock "just in case"... some of my other milk bags would have little kinks and end up leaking.  However, I have had NO PROBLEMS with any of the 200+bags that I have used so far. Also, I'm lazy and don't lay them down systematically. I pretty much just throw them in my deep freeze. No leaks!<br /><br /> Like many of the other bags they have a double seal and are easy to write on. You just pull off the little tab at the top and pour in the milk. Once, I opened the bag with a little too much force and it ripped the bag. But that was my only problem and obviously my fault. If you already buying the bags at your local store, then you will be happy with these. Go for it. It is so nice not having to worry about running out of the house at random times to get storage bags.

I previously used Lasinoh bags and they used to leak every time. I had returned my recent purchase of lasinoh bags because of leakages and shifted to the Honeysuckle bags.<br />I suggest a Subscribe & Save account for this item so that moms can benefit buying these.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: This is the third type of bag that I've tried. The first was Medela which I liked but they were pretty expensive, then simplisse which was a big less expensive than the Medela brand. They worked just as well but I'm always out looking for something better. I'm trying these right now and so far they are just as good as the Simplisse brand when it comes to storage. I don't really but my baby's name on the bag because she's in family care and the caregiver only watches her so i don't have a problem with the small space provided. I just write how many ounces are in each bag in that area. The bags seem a little bit thinner than both the Simplisse and the Medela brand, but they are a bit thicker on the bottom. Maybe that's the part about them being tamper resistant. I freeze my milk flat and in a sandwich bag to save space and they are doing as well as the Simplisse bags. If they holdup in the thaw then I will definitely be hooked on these as they are significantly cheaper than both the Medela and Simplisse brand.

review/text: These are great bags. They are sturdy, the closure works well and they freeze and thaw with ease. There is just one really stupid thing they did when making these bags - there is NO PLACE to write the volume. Really? During the testing and development process NO ONE noticed this!? It seems almost impossible to me, yet it's true. Now, don't get me wrong, you can easily write the volume anywhere on the top of the bag, but really? (And, if I'm being picky, the "name" box is a bit too short if you need to write first and last name, which most daycares require.)

review/summary: Deceiving marketing tactics means they have lost my business (updated)
review/text: **UPDATE** Shortly after posting this review they decided to change the price back to the discount pricing - I'm guessing they were getting a lot of bad press around the new pricing changes. I have changed my review to 2 stars and will monitor their so-called "marketing" over the next month or two and update my review again then.<br /><br />My wife has been using these bags for the past 3 months or so and like many of the other reviewers, we found them to be a great quality product for the price, handily beating many of the other well reviewed and well known brands on both price and quality. So why the 1 star review? Well we came back to buy an additional 300 after exhausting our supply, only to find the original price we purchased them at ($44.75 for 300) has now been increased to $72.95, a huge difference. This places them at a similar or higher price than many of the other brands. Browsing to their Facebook page, they state that the original price was a temporary promotional price... and that if you sign up for their marketing lists they might give you a 50% coupon that will essentially reduce the price back to where it was originally. A bunch of people are complaining over there as well, expecting to get 50% off the original price of $44.75 for 300.<br /><br />I would usually be ok with this, except the "temporary" promotion has been going on since close to the start of the year and they never made any mention of this promotion on Amazon or their website. So to me, it seems like they had just lowered the price to garner a ton of great amazon reviews before raising the price back up again.<br /><br />To new buyers of this product: hopefully this helps you understand why so many of the reviews say this product is great quality for such a cheap price. Don't get me wrong, the product is good, but I'm not sure its better than other brands now given its the same price or more.<br /><br />As of 9/9/2012 here is a price comparison of some of the other highly rated storage bags -<br />Honeysuckle: $72.95 for 300 - 24cents per bag<br />Simplisse: $7.95 for 25 - 31cents per bag<br />NUK/Gerber: $9.16 for 50 - 18cents per bag<br />Lansinoh: $12.79 for 75 (subscribe & save) - 17cent per bag<br /><br />We will be trying the Lansinoh and NUK/Gerber brands out to see if they are good alternatives to Honeysuckle.

I've tried Medela (don't freeze flat, too expensive but otherwise great) and Lansinoh (too thin, leak when frozen because corners tear but freeze flat) bags and so far like these best because they freeze flat but are thicker than Lansinoh and have reinforced edges like Medela, plus they're less expensive and hold 6 oz. I haven't needed to defrost milk in these yet, so I can't say how they perform there, hence the 4 star rating. That being said, I already placed an order for another 300!

review/text: I purchased these bags along with the Gerber NUK/Gerber Seal N Go (AWESOME bags) and the Lansinoh bags (not a fan). I like the Gerber bags far better than both.<br /><br />These Honeysuckle bags are ok. The quality of the plastic is not as thick and sturdy feeling as the Gerber bags, but far better than the Lansinoh bags. The ziploc seals easily and quickly and there is a white area for labeling. This isn't a big deal but I have black countertops and the white labeling area makes it easier to see if the ink pen really wrote on the bag or not when I label the bag.<br /><br />The bags have done there job so far and have not leaked but I am just not as happy with the quality of the bag as I am with the Gerber bags. Overall I would give the bags a 3.5 rating.

review/summary: Environmentally friendly and high quality option
review/text: I have been using these bags for 3 months.  They were provided to me by the Mother's Milk Bank in San Jose.  Prior to using these bags, I had used the very popular Lansinoh bags for 3 months.<br /><br />Between the two, I much prefer the HoneySuckle bags.  Why? They are better.  How are they better, you ask?<br /><br />1. This bag is actually tamper resistant, while the Lansinoh bag is not.  The HoneySuckle bags have the entire top sealed to prevent tampering.  You cannot tamper with the bag without opening one of the three sides of the perforated top.  You remove the perforated portion to open the bag.  The Lansinoh bags have a perforated top, but not the sides of that upper area, so you could actually still open the bag without undoing the perforations.  Poor design IMO.<br /><br />2. The sides and bottom of the HoneySuckle bags are reinforced, the Lansinoh bags are not.  I pump exclusively, and even at 6 mos, my son is not eating all the milk I produce, so I freeze easily 2-4 bags of milk a day.  I can produce between 8 to as much as 14oz during a pumping session, and have been able to overfill these bags without them bursting open when they are frozen.  The reinforced sides and bottom have alot to do with that.<br /><br />3. The information to write at the top is much more useful, and is rightside up.  The Lansinoh bags have the info updside down.  That has always bothered me.  Even when you stand the bags up in the freezer, they are upside down.  It's stupid.  HoneySuckle bags have the labeling rightside up.  Plus it asks for baby's name and the date, not the volume.  I don't find the volume info helpful at all, and when my baby was in the NICU, or when donating breastmilk, the name is much more useful information.<br /><br />4. Best quality - THEY ARE BIODEGRADABLE!!  They will dissolve when they are in the landfill.  If you care about the environment at all, these are the bags for you.  The Lansinoh bags aren't biodegradable, at least from what I can tell from their packaging.  As if dirty diapers aren't a big enough contribution to the tremendous amount of trash people generate these days, breastmilk storage bags don't need to add to that.<br /><br />Price wise, these are comparable to the Lansinoh bags, except that with shipping they are a few dollars more.  But I think they are worth it from a quality and environmental standpoint.  You can also go to the New Bag Co. website and order a free sample if you aren't convinced.  IMO, these bags are superior to the Lansinoh bags and I will definitely be using them exclusively.

review/summary: Nice bags but not as environmentally friendly as you might think.
review/text: I did a lot of research before purchasing these bags. I looked at various brands of breastmilk storage bags as well as researching oxo plastics as I was unfamilar with them. From my research I ended up choosing purchasing over the lansinol ones.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />1. These have a reinforced bottom, lansinol do not.<br />2. The side seams are a lot thicker than the lansinol ones, so would presumably be stronger.<br />3. The biodragradable factor, this can only be a good thing right? While researching oxo plastics I discovered that oxo plastics are FDA approved and are safe for food storage and do not contain any BPA (lansinol bags are also BPA free). Oxo plastics can be manufactured to degrade quicker or slower depending on the manufacturers needs, therefore if you wish to compost them I would suggest contacting the manufacturer to find out the degradation time. That oxo plastics need oxygen to degrade so they would not degrade well in landfills as most landfills currently inoperation do not have an atmosphere conducive to biodegrading as they are so deep and compacted that there is not enough oxygen. But surely any amount of degradation is better than the alternative bags?<br /><br />After receiving the bags I conducted a few experiments with these bags and a few of the lansinol ones I had received in a couple of boxes of the lansinol disposable breastpads.<br /><br />Conclusions.<br /><br />1. Apon examining the two different bags I noticed that the lansinol ones are marked with the reccyling symbol and the number 4. If you have access to recycling and are diligent in sorting your recyclables it would actually be better for the environment to use the lansinol ones.<br />2. I took one of each type of bag and stretched each bags seams and bottoms, neither bag gave way and seemed to still be in good condition. I then fill these bags with water, sealed them and then squeezed the bags to see if either would leak, the honeysuckle one did leak at the seem right underneath the zipper, the lansinol had not leaks.<br />3. I took two new bags, one of each type, and over filled them with 7oz of water in each. I then squeezed them to check the seams, neither leaked. I froze them flat and then thawed each in a seperate bowl, neither leaked during the freezing or thawing process.<br /><br />Both bags should hold up well to use following the maufacturers directions. If you have recycling in your area I would suggest the lansinol ones, if you do not have recycling then I would suggest the honeysuckle. Once I have used these up I will be switching to the lansinol ones. If you want more info about oxo plastics this website is quite informative. [...]

review/summary: Best storage bags ever!
review/text: When I bought these I was a little hesitant, as they were brand spanking new on the market and there were no reviews.  I decided to try them out, because they were cheaper than the Lansinoh bags I have been using.<br /><br />I love, love, LOVE these bags!  And the fact that they're biodegradable makes me like them even more.  While I do agree with a previous reviewer saying that there wasn't a spot to put the volume size, I just use the place where it says "name" since I know my baby is getting it anyway.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with these bags!  The company itself is amazing too, they will give you free samples of the bags if you ask for them on their Facebook page, and also they do giveaways every Friday-last Friday I won a free 25 pack of storage bags :)

review/summary: Good product so far
review/text: I'm a big over producer of milk and have been bagging 35-40 oz a day for about six weeks.  This requires a high number of storage bags and I've been trying various brands and have now settled on the Honeysuckle.  They seem to be a new product on the market and it's still relatively new to me, but I did freeze some for about a week and then thawed in the fridge and using warm water and neither method had any leaking.  About 10% of the Lansinoh bags were leaking as I filled them, before they even went into the freezer, very disappoiting.  Plus, after talking to friends I've heard about 2 out of 5 bags would leak during thawing. Medela seem to be much stronger and I've had no problems so far with leaking, but they are more than double the price.  And the Honeysuckle are biodegradable, nice bonus.  I gave a 4 rating because they are not time tested, but so far so good.

review/summary: Why didn't I find these sooner?
review/text: I used Lansinoh bags with my first son who is now three, and up until about a week ago with my five month old.  In one day, my husband lost THREE bags of milk due to leaks, and my sitter was having the same issues.  Ever since Lansinoh repackaged their bags, nothing but problems, and any working/breastfeeding mom understands the defeat of having a bag of milk go to waste.  So, being that I shop on Amazon for pretty much everything, I saw this new product and figured I would give it a try.  The bags arrived super fast! At first glance, the bags seem to have more reinforcement.  I am quite smitten with the zipper as well; it is a much higher quality seal than Lansinoh. It also seemed to me that I had fewer air bubbles after pouring the milk into the bag.<br /><br />The only negatives about this bag are that:<br />1.) Its not readily available in case I run out.<br />2.) Would like a space for volume.  I know some moms like that there is a name, but my child is the only breastfed baby at daycare.  However, it is easy enough to write "4oz" in that space instead.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a great alternative to the other competitors.  I have high hopes for this bag!

review/summary: No Volume Information
review/text: Really like these bags.  My son is breast feeding and I pump the opposite breast every time I feed with him.  The only complaint I have is that the top part has no Volume information.  I don't wait till my bag has 6 ounces to freeze it.  I freeze whatever I pumped off the opposite breast at that time.  I don't find the Name part to be very useful but I could see where it would be useful if your child was going to day care or in the NICU but if you're just the average mom who does what I do I believe these bags would be more useful with a Volume part instead of a name.  But really love that they are more 'green' than other bags.  More pros than cons.

review/text: I exclusively pump for my baby so I go through a lot of storage bags. I bought a pack of 300 of these after hearing raves about them. The plastic seems more flexible than Medela bags and thicker than Lansinoh bags. I plan on buying more Honeysuckle bags when I use the 300 up. I have not needed to thaw any of the frozen bags yet but a friend who has used several different brands told me that Honeysuckle hardly ever leak for her while lots of the Lansinoh leak when thawing.

review/summary: They worked really well until they started leaking
review/text: I have used these bags for the past 6 months. I used to love them and liked that they are biodegradable, but the last box I bought contained a lot of damaged bags. I thought it was one bad batch, but it keeps happening with bags from different batches. I have lost over 30 ounces of breast milk in the past month and one day didn't have the regular amount to send with my son to daycare. Breastfeeding mamas know the devastation of losing even an ounce can cause so losing this much has been beyond upsetting.  I caution you to be very careful when using these bags for milk storage.

review/text: I got a sample bag of these baby food bags when I received my order of breastmilk bags and I love it. Here's the irony: I bought the breastmilk bags to store baby food in (I felt so smart), ha. I love the Honeysuckle products, very well made. Turns out the baby food bags cost less than the breastmilk bags. The only upside I can see to using the breastmilk bags for baby food is if you prefer to freeze more than 4 oz of food. The baby food bags hold 4 oz and the breastmilk bags store 6 oz. Either way their great.

review/summary: AWESOME PRODUCT!!
review/text: I am about to return to work and I have been pumping furiously.. however, I have noticed lately that my medela bags are not sealing completely.. my first bag I laid flat to freeze and it instantly started seeping milk past the seal(wasted!)..anyone that pumps knows how precious every drop is! After I store milk in the medela bags, I have to stand them straight and squeeze it btwn some random freezer objects until it freezes flat. Today I decided to test the honeysuckle bags I just received after reading tons of positive reviews myself here on amazon and they have really surpassed my expectations. I have included a photo of the comparison. I am placing an order for some more!! So thrilled and I feel much more confident in my supply.

review/summary: Bag Design *Updated*
review/text: I have been happily using these bags since June. They were a good price and Biodegradable,...a big plus for me! They were the perfect bag.<br /><br />But now I am not happy with the new bag design. I have had more faulty bags in this last batch than ever before. Also, the zip closure at the top doesn't feel as secure and you really need to work hard to ensure it's closed. I'll be switching brands. thanks New bag company, you've lost a regular customer.<br /><br />Updated as of 12/29/2011<br /><br />**I contacted New bag company and they were very helpful in putting things right. They immediately sent me new bags which were of the actual new design. These bags are much better and the zipper closure is way easier to close. They said they have stopped shipping the bag design that I originally posted about, so hopefully I will not have any more problems.

review/summary: Great Bags but we've had a few leaks
review/text: I had been using the lansinoh bags and after a few leaks tried the green sprouts storage bags which were great but pretty costly - the honeysuckle bags have been great! Affordable price and no leaks :)<br /><br />**Updated**<br /> Now that we are in full swing using these bags to defrost milk for Daycare I can give a better review. I have had 3 leaky bags out of about 100 which have been defrosted so far... there were no holes when I put the milk in but the 3 that have leaked seem to have come apart at the seems when frozen. I have about a months worth of milk frozen in them right now and I sure hope that there aren't more leaks... as a 3% failure rate isn't great. I will update again in another month as that will be another 140 bags we have defrosted.<br /><br />* Update 2* I freeze 8 bags a day - 6 oz of milk in each. I defrost 5 a day. Today 3 of my 5 which were left to thaw overnight were leaking. All were from different batches and all were leaking along the seams. I cannot even put into words the anxiety I have about the fate of my entire freezer full of milk stored in these bags.... To lose 18 oz today was heartbreaking.

review/summary: I love these bags already!!!!! -- had to update
review/text: I love these bags already.  I have been using them for about a week and am in love with the product.  I had been using the lansinoh and medela bags.  I love the medela because you can pump right into them but I find them very expensive. I needed an alternative.  I took a chance and chose these bags.  I like them because they hold 6 oz of milk, are biodegradable, tamper resistant and have an easy pour spout.  The only thing they need is to have an adapter so that you can pump directly into the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/11<br />I happened to get to the last few bags in one of my boxes of 25 (out of 75) and noticed several pin sized holes in the bottom of at least 3 bags.  I discovered the holes because I added milk to the bag and noticed milk at the bottom, I wiped it away and noticed the drop kept coming back.  When i squeezed the bag to determine where the hole was I noticed 4 small holes in the bottom. i poured the milk into another bag and the same thing happened.  Tried it again and it happened.  I poured the milk in a bottle and put it in the fridge.  I've decided to stop using these temporarily as I can't afford to waste milk.  I was so excited about this product now I'm sad.  Maybe I should contact the manufacturer.  I also wonder because I have 72 frozen bags that I'll have to carefully defrost.

review/summary: Poor Product or Quality Control
review/text: Don't let the limited # of 1 stars fool you like they did me.  They talk about breast milk being "liquid Gold," well mine leaked 2x's so far.  It may work well for solids, but I purchased (along with other brands) for milk storage.  The first thawing leaked about 80ml of breast milk all over my mom's fridge shelf, leaving only a drop or 2 in the bag.  Being aware of this, I thawed a second bag of about 70ml of breast milk in a clean bowl to have it leak completely out.  There are better products out there that are biodegradable-I've used them with no problems-so there is no reason to "settle" on this product.<br /><br />It is quite possible that I had a bad lot, but when I work that hard to leave a sitter(my mom) with enough milk for my kid and it is wasted, it's devastating. Fortunately I left her with too much milk, so my child did not go hungry. I will be contacting the manufacturer regarding this issue so they can try to resolve this matter.<br />I would not recommend.

They are not quite as heavy as the Medela but they are freezing just fine, haven't had a leaky one yet.  I also like them because they freeze a lot flatter so they don't take up quite as much room in the freezer.  My only complaint is it can be a little tricky to pour freshly expressed milk into the bags because of the flaps on the top.  I have missed the bag more than once which can be a little heart breaking because the milk goes down the drain ;)

review/summary: Exactly what we wanted
review/text: We have a two month old and have been storing breastmilk basically since she was born.  We tried Lansinoh, Medela and Honeysuckle.  Honestly we didn't have a problem with any of the brands, since we never filled the bags over the top line (which I think is why most people have leaks) and we kept them stored safely in a freezer away from anything that might cause damage.  However, we decided to come back to Honeysuckle for more bags - the main reasons are: a) they're at the best price, b) each bag is sealed with an anti-tamper cover that you can easily tear off, c) the bags are big and hold 6oz which I think is more than the others.  They feel heavy duty and have been getting the job done great so far.  Very happy with the purchase!

review/text: I started out using the Medela ones but those took up a lot of space even when I tried to freeze them flat because of their stand up base and their double zip lock was really hard to zip right to make it leak proof. I tried the Lansinoh ones and those were pretty good - double zip lock was easily used, laid out nicely flat for maximum storage in my freezer but the labels were upside down if you stored them upright instead of lying down. These Honeysuckle ones are very sturdy (reinforced bottoms and sides), there is tons of space for labeling (with labels right side up during upright storage), the same style of double zip lock as the Lansinoh ones and they also lay down pretty flat. I am very happy with these bags and would recommend these to everyone.

review/summary: If you are not sure after reading reviews...request sample :)
review/text: With my previous baby (now 2.5 years old) I researched and tried a couple of storage bags and found Lansinoh to be the best. This time with my new baby I tried a newer bag from Ameda and promptly went back to Lansinoh. I was also given a box of Gerber and I used them but again went back to Lansinoh. However, when I could no longer find specially marked boxes of Lansinoh (20% free) in my local stores; I decided to try to find a better price online.<br /><br />***This is how I found the Honeysuckle Brand :)***<br /><br />Being able to buy in bulk (300 count) was a benefit to me and the price was better than what I was getting at best with the Lansinoh brand. I placed an order and within two days had my order! Then once I opened my package and used my first bag...I was SOLD!<br /><br />I exclusively express my baby's milk and freeze an additional 20-25 ounces a day above what baby drinks so I use alot of bags. I am filling 6 ounce bags right now and these bags are working beautifully!<br /><br />So, you can read the other reviews, do your research and try to decide if you want to try these bags OR you can locate the manufacturer's website and request a sample and get a hands on review of your own before you buy - what other brand lets you do that??? My order also included a sample of the baby food storage bags :)<br /><br />By the way the labels on the bags I just received allow for Volume, Date and Name. This may be due to previous requests and the company listened (Wow! What a concept!)<br /><br />I hope you love these bags as much as I do! Thank you Honeysuckle for your wonderful product! I will not be going back to Lansinoh again.

review/text: I used to use madela bags and loved that they attached to the pump.  I switched to these bags and haven't had any problems.  These hold alot more milk.  My baby receintly turned 1 and I am feeding him purees... I actually started using these bags to store/freeze his baby food.<br /><br />The only negative is that they do not attach to the pump, so I would pump into a bottle and then pour it in the bag.

review/summary: Great bags!
review/text: I'm very glad I found these bags! I struggled with the Medela bags that came with the feeding gift set I purchased (difficult to ziplock, not stackable when frozen, too small). These are excellent. They have a double ziplock, a place to write how many ounces of milk, the date, and your child's name. They freeze flat and don't leak. They are also a good deal for the price. I'm sticking with this brand from now on.

review/summary: Love these bags!
review/text: After reading reviews, I purchased the Honeysuckle and Simplisse bags.  Both work great--however, I ultimately went with Honeysuckle because they are biodegradable.  Have used them for a few months now--not a single leak, whether thawing milk from the fridge or freezer.  Pour spout is perfect for transferring milk--our baby's nanny commented that these are the best bags she's ever worked with!  Love these bags!!

review/summary: Preferred over Lanisoh & Medela bags
review/text: Working great so far! Previously I've used Lanisoh and two types of Medela bags (the ones with the sticky strap and the ones that require an adaptor - I prefer the adaptor ones out of those two). I liked being able to pump directly into the Medela bags, however because the measurements are skewed when you pump directly into those bags, it was hard to know how much was in each. So I had already started pumping into bottles and then pouring into bags... and then I figured since I was already doing that, why spend all the extra money buying the expensive bags JUST because I could pump into them?<br /><br />I tried Lanisoh, but I don't like them: they just feel like the sides could split at any moment and I could lose liquid gold. That's what differentiates the Honeysuckle bags for me: they have a stronger, thicker side seam that makes me feel like they'll hold and last. It's also nice that they're biodegradable. I'm on my second set of 75 now, and next time I plan to order the big 300 count box.<br /><br />3.1.12 Update:<br />I just used my 500th Honeysuckle bag and so far we've had ZERO leaks and have been extremely happy with this product! I also like the changes they've made to the bags recently -- adding a place to write "volume". Keep up the good work, Honeysuckle!

However, we've had several bags that have had leaky bottoms as soon as milk has been poured into them :(  Doesn't make me happy after having to work to get the milk.  Other than that, we have liked these bags - especially the price.

review/summary: Great bags at a great price!
review/text: These bags work great!  They are well made and hold up well in the freezer.  Personally the biodegradable feature is nice, but not my main reason for purchasing.  The only thing I missed was the ability to pump directly into the bag. To address this issue and make these bags even more user friendly, I place the bottom part of the breastshield where the valve releases milk into the bag and put a small strip of medical tape to secure it over the top of the shield.  It works great and eliminates the need to wash yet another bottle.  I would recommend this product!

review/text: These bags seem to work very well.  They feel sturdy and of quality materials. As other reviewers have commented, they don't work to measure your milk, so you need to know how much you're putting in ahead of time. Easy to adjust for. I have so far only used them to freeze milk - haven't defrosted any yet.

review/text: Pros:<br />Enforced side protection<br />Don't have to turn the bag upside down to write the info on<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does leak every once in awhile<br />Pricier<br /><br />I've used both honeysuckle and lansinoh bags and I have to say both have leaked on me, however, there was a higher percentage of leaking with the lansinoh bags.  The extra side protection on the honeysuckle bags made me feel less worried that it could burst open at any moment.  A little pricier than the lansinoh bags, but think of it this way, breast milk is like gold, would you rather pay a cheaper price and end up losing the milk you spent 20-30 minutes pumping because it was leaking out of the bag?

review/summary: Really wanted to like these more than the Lansinoh bags
review/text: I was very excited to try these bags given the great reviews that they had. They're biodegradable, have reinforced seams, and each package has an inspection tag that comes out, making me feel like their quality should be good. But now that I've been through more than 1 package of them, I conclude that I prefer the Lansinoh bags.<br /><br />(1) These bags are perforated on three sides at the top. Initially, I thought this would be a good thing, but it takes two hands and some mental focus to get them open. This annoys me.<br /><br />(2) Once the perforated parts have been removed, they still don't open as easily, and the top part is much larger. Both of these things make it more difficult to pour milk into them and increase the risk of spillage (for me).<br /><br />(3) Every brand of breast milk bag I've had has a few that leaked during thawing, but these were the first bags I have ever used that leaked immediately  - with  no freezing involved. I was pouring milk in to the bag, and the bag was pouring it out onto my desk. I think you failed, Inspection #1310712-A.

review/summary: Good for the Price
review/text: I needed a big lot of storage bags since I have plenty of breastmilk to store everyday. I found this deal (vs Lansinoh which I used before this one and Medela which I never used because it's expensive), which seemed very good. Size-wise, they are a bit smaller than Lansinoh. I fill up a bag before storing in the freezer and Lansinoh's can hold about 15oz while this one holds only 13oz and I often have 15oz to put away so I always have to leave 2oz in the bottle to store in the fridge. However, I like that the volume labels are more accurate than Lansinoh. I have used about 3 packs (out of 12) and 3 have leaked on me (two were already frozen and when I thawed them, I saw the milk disperse in the water so I had to dump 15oz of milk each bag!). The other one leaked right after I poured my pumped milk and sealed it. I still give it 4 stars because overall these take care of my needs.

review/text: I got the 300 pack for the bulk savings.  What a mistake.  The bags have been leaking and this is just unacceptable.  After the first one leaked we were careful in handling the frozen bags, as they always leaked during the defrost process.  After multiple leaky bags we gave up and found an alternative. What a disappointment.

review/summary: Total disappointment !
review/text: I ordered these bags looking at the amazing reviews. I've used Lansinoh exclusively for my older kid, and never once had an issue with leaking bags. After I ran out of the stash I had from last time, I ordered nuk (which also had no issues) while pumping for this baby. I wasn't sure about ordering Lansinoh again since I read some reviews that quality has dropped in the last year or so, so decided I would give honeysuckle a try. I'm now regretting my decision to do so...the very first pack of 25 that I opened had 4 defective bags. 4 out of 5 bags being defective is a defect rate of 80%....needless to say, I haven't even tried using them after that. I totally regret the fact that I put so much stock in the reviews and ordered 100 bags. I will go back to trying what worked before for me.

review/summary: Stored and thawed perfectly- BPA free and Biodegradable. Wonderful!
review/text: So this product is certainly not lacking in the positive reviews department, but I was so happy with it, I wouldn't have felt right not chiming in.<br /><br />Sadly, due to poor latch, I ended up exclusively pumping. Certainly not what I had envisioned, but I was happy to at least be able to give my baby primarily breastmilk for his first 6 months. However, with this, milk storage suddenly became a lot more important. The idea of losing any of the precious pumped milk to bag breakage, leaking or the like made me just ill. I, of course, LOVED that these bags are biodegradable but that also made me a little concerned for their structural integrity. Silly me. Clearly, there have been great strides in the world of biodegradable plastics because these bags are incredibly strong and very trustworthy.<br /><br />I spent so much time trying to find the perfect storage system- just being sure to not store them in a way that could damage the bags and leak the milk. Everyone seemed to say that standing them up was best. I don't know how many of you have an industrial-sized, walk-in freezer, but I certainly didn't- and standing these upright would have greatly impacted the number I'd be able to store. Instead, once I froze them flat, I just stacked them on top of each other- in order so I could use the oldest ones first. They were JUST fine. No breakage, no leakage- these bags held up to having other bags of frozen milk stacked on top of them without a problem!<br /><br />Love these. They are wonderful and they allowed me to be able to continue feeding my son breastmilk even after my production took a hit. Very, very nice.

review/summary: These 4 oz bags are better size for milk than the larger bags
review/text: I accidentally bought this smaller size, but it's actually better for milk because you have to use what you thaw...so filling up the 8 oz milk bag and you have a lot of milk for baby!  I've been freezing and thawing and have used about 20 of these bags so far and no leaks or holes!  Freeze them flat then stack them together - be careful the condensation may case bags to freeze together.  Even so, I've found that pulling them apart has not created any leaks.

review/summary: Don't be fooled these bags leak!!
review/text: I bought this product with high hopes seeing as how great the reviews were, so I purchased 1 order of the 300 count bags. These bags claim to be resistant to leaks however, are no different from my Medela or Lansinoh breast milk storage bags that have leaked. When the first bag leaked (the leak occurred at the seam located at the bottom of the bag) I thought it was just a fluke, however I have now had over 15 bags leak. Thankfully I was able to see the leak immediately when transferring my pumped milk to the bag for a few, but I can not say the same with the bags I have taken from the freezer to thaw. Not only did I lose precious milk, I had a huge mess to clean up in my fridge! I still want to really like these bags, but they keep letting me down. Who ever said there is no use crying over spilled milk obviously wasn't talking about breast milk! Very disappointing!<br /><br />**Update** (09/28/2012): Although it was unfortunate circumstances that brought me to give Honeysuckle a bad rating of 2 out of 5 stars, after dealing with their customer service, and receiving replacement bags, I have to give them a higher rating. Even though some bags were faulty from the first order I purchased, the replacement bags seem to be holding up thus far. I greatly appreciate working with companies who appreciate their customers and Honeysuckle is probably one of the best customer service experiences I have come across.

review/summary: MULTI-USE!!
review/text: As a breastfeeding mom i thought i would never need milk storage bags. But i was wrong. I got a pack of these as a present and saved it just in case. Well i was breasfeeding my son EXCLUSIVELY till he started theething and bitting. Now i pump and store the milk. I bought him a bottles so i could feed him the expressed BM. well i ended up washing too many bottles and using so many milk bags till one day i decided to buy a drop-in bottle from parents choice brand. I warmed the milk in the bag by placing it inside a 12oz cup of warm-hot water for a few seconds till it was at a good temp. Then place the bag inside the drop in bottle and folded the top and screwed the nipple and ring on it. WELL THERE IT WAS.... NO MORE BOTTLES TO WASH AND NOT A SINGLE BAG WASTED BUT USED TO STORE AND ALSO AS A LINER ... IT DOES NOT LEAK OR TEAR. i feel better knowing that i used a bag for a multi use instead of using the bag and later a liner which is double plastic to our environment. Note: the bag will only fold easily on the original drop in bottle. NOT the premiun it has a wider top and the bag is not as wide. But for some reason the original is thiner. I love this combination. I carry my breastmilk in the storage bag and dont need to transfer it to a different bottle or liner to feed the BM to my baby.<br /><br />It is true people complain abou the bags leaking but all other bags leak aswell. The only time the bag leaked was when i filled it up with too much breastmilk and only after it was previously frozen. I only use them to refrigerate the milk. And as a liner.

All the attributes I love about this product.<br /><br />BUT!!!!!<br />For the third or fourth time now, when I thaw the frozen milk, the bags leak milk all over my fridge. This leak comes from the bottom corners of the bags - not the top seal. I have now learned to put the bag into a glass container, so it doesn't leak all over the fridge, but lost milk is lost milk.

review/text: With my first daughter I used the medela bags which were good but took up a lot of space.  Now that I'm on my second child I wanted to try something different.  I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  So far so great.  No problems with transferring milk from bottle into bags.  They store so flat they take up less space than expected.  I put them into freezer safe tubber ware so it doesn't get contaminated by meats or vegetables and helps me protect them from getting squished into other shapes and form.  The bags are thick and seems real strong.  I haven't thawed any out yet because I just starting to store my milk.  But I have confidence that they will be ok.

review/summary: BM storage bags are good, but seller sent wrong product
review/text: I ordered 600 of the BM storage bags. I received several "sample" BM storage bags, and 600 food storage bags instead. It is a hassle to have to return these, so I will use the food storage bags, but very disappointed in receiving the wrong items - especially since there are 600 of them.<br /><br />*UPDATED REVIEW AFTER SECOND BULK PUTCHASE<br />This time the correct tyoe of storage bags were delivered. The bags are great most of the time. I really wanted to like this brand. Maybe I was just unlucky but this time one of the packs I received (each pack contains 25 individual storage bags) had 5 ~ 6 faulty bags - it looked like they had been slashed with a pen knife. Some of them were slashed at the top where the label is, and some were near the middle / bottom of the bag. I had a few accidents where I poured milk into the bag and it spilled all over the place due to the hole in the body of the bags. Disappointing and unacceptable. The company should screen their products better, as it is a pity for their good reputation (and generally good products) to be tarnished by a few faulty items that were probably sent out by accident.

review/summary: Beware of Leaks
review/text: I guess all bags may have some problems but I hate taking a chance with my breast milk. I've used these bags for two months now with no problems. Then after transporting what I had pumped home from work yesterday, I opened the cooler bag to find just a puddle of milk and empty bags that had once been full. Today I checked all of the bags that contained the milk I had pumped and discovered they all had leaks. I'm sure this is just a bad batch, but it sucks to have lost a whole day's worth of pumped milk because of it. Since I bought 300, I'm going to go test some of the other packs as I'm hoping they're not all bad since I had already used 1 or 2 packs with no problems. I really want to recommend this product, but as with anything beware of the bad apple.<br /><br />Edited 9/10/12: I really don't have anything bad to say about the Honeysuckle Break Milk Storage Bags. After another two months of use I can say that was just a bad batch. What I've taken to doing is testing each bag after I fill it by squeezing the milk toward the closure several times. If it's going to leak, it leaks at the corners and I can tell right away. Since the problem with the bad batch (one bag of 25) I've probably only had another couple that leaked. Overall, I really like these bags still and I'm upping my rating from 2 to 3 stars.

review/summary: great so far!
review/text: It's all been said before - the bags are sturdy, easy to write on, and seem durable. I just ordered another box because I've been so please with their performance and love that they are biodegradable. I much prefer them to the Medela bags (which don't lay flat) and the Lansinoh bags (which have an upside-down label and seem thinner). I took off 1 star only because we haven't defrosted too many of the bags yet, so I can't comment on long-term durability / leaks. (Note: This review was written by Michael's wife, who is the one actually using these bags.)  :)

review/summary: good milk storage
review/text: So far so good with these bags! I have used them to store pumped milk and the convenience of the double zip closure is perfect. The only thing I dont understand about their design is the tear off tab at the top of the bag.  It seems a waste of plastic, and I have to have a trash can nearby to toss it. Great write on area keeps the details clear andeasy to read. I will continue to use these bags while searching for a brand I can pump directly into.

review/text: I like these bags because they were the cheapest I could find anywhere on the net. I was used to the medella bags that are much more firm and sturdy, however for the price these are better. Also, the Honey suckle bags hold an enormous amount of milk. I can store 11oz in one bags without difficulty. I have had no problems with leaking or breaking. Keep in mind these are not free standing bags like the medella ones.

review/summary: Best breast milk storage bag out there!
review/text: Honey Suckle bags are very durable and easy to fill with breast milk. It has markings for up to 6 ounces, but you can easily fit 7-8 ounces. I have used over 300 of these bags and have never had a leaky/broken bag yet. I've also dropped some filled bags my accident and they haven't broken open. I have a freezer full of them and they area easy to defrost and pour into any bottle. The labeling tab can be written on with any pen. I love these bags so much I just ordered another 300! The price per bag is also a great deal compared to what I used before for freezing my breast milk.

review/text: Long Story Short: The 4 oz. Baby Food Bags are rated to hold BreastMilk too.<br /><br />Long Story: I thought I was ordering bags labeled "BreastMilk Storage" when I clicked on 50 Bags (4 oz.).  However, it was actually Baby Food Storage.  When I got to my order before checkout, it still said "BreastMilk Storage" and said "50 Bags (2 Packs of 25)," so I ordered them.  Well, what came to my door were the Baby Food Storage Bags, so I sent them an email totally confused as to what those were!  [Ironically, it came with a paper that says "Enclosed is a sample of our wonderful, degradable, leakproof HoneySuckle BreastMilk Storage Bag!"  However, there aren't any in the package.]  Anyhow, I emailed the company saying that I was completely confused as to what happened and that the Amazon listing should be edited.  Their customer service personally called me, and while they didn't offer to send any BreastMilk bags or fix the order, they did offer to fix the Amazon listing to make it clearer and also told me that the Baby Food Bags ARE RATED to hold BreastMilk - so no harm done - I'm using them for BreastMilk!<br /><br />Thank you!

review/summary: Love them but...
review/text: I really like these bags. They're super durable, but thick and pliable. I bought the 50 pack to try when my baby was first born. I got through the first 25 and loved them. But after about the 5th bag in my second set of 25 they began to leak badly at the bottom. I had pumped 4 oz and put it in the bag, as usual, and it began to drip. My hubby quickly got out another bag and we transferred the milk and that one also began leaking. We poured the milk into the bottle because obviously it wasn't a one time deal. I put water in 4 more bags and realized they were ALL leaking. I looked in my freezer to make sure they hadn't leaked without me knowing it and there didn't seem to be an issue. I called the company and made them aware and asked them if they could replace the bags. They were VERY nice, took my address, phone number, and said they'd send me 100 new bags and to return the leaking bags so they could examine them. Sweet! Well, that was 7 or 8 weeks ago and I haven't seen or heard anything and have never received new bags. So, Lansinoh bags are my new friend. They're similar enough, but I'm bummed because I really did want to LOVE Honkeysuckle.

review/text: These breastmilk storage bags work wonderfully!  I have not had a single leak in the 3 months that I've been using them.  The tabs are easy to write on with a regular ball-point pen (but don't seem to work so well with markers - not a big deal), and have a space to write the ounces and date.  There's a space to write a name too, but since I only keep these at home for the babysitter to use, I just use that space to write the expiration date. I lay them flat to freeze, and then keep them upright in a storage bin.  (It would be nice if they also sold bins to use in the freezer!) Overall, I'm very pleased, and will continue to use these bags.

review/summary: Exclusive Pumping Must Have
review/text: I exclusively pump for my daughter (who is now 3 months old). I have an oversupply and am building up quite a large freezer stash. Originally, I was using Lansinoh bags but had some leakage issues. With the use of Amazon.com, I was able to browse similar products and came upon Honeysuckle brand bags. The price was right, so I ordered the 300 pack. Gosh, I'm so happy I did.<br /><br />The bags are completely sealed to prevent contamination from shipping and general handling. The top has a spacious area to write details like ounces, date, and child's name. As an exclusive pumper, I put 6 oz of breast milk into each bag, freeze them flat in my kitchen freezer, and then I transfer them into 1 gallon freezer bags (in packs of 10) to head into my chest freezer. When I want to use up some older milk to help shuffle my stash, I take these back out and thaw them in my fridge. These bags haven't leaked once. The edges are reinforced and sturdy. The zip top is easy to close, has double zips, and feels secure once they are zipped. I couldn't be happier with this product and wish more pumpers knew about it.

review/summary: Leaks, leaks and more leaks
review/text: At first these bags seemed great. Until you actually go to defrost the milk. The bags are leaking at the bottom, with frequently far less that the full amount. I would say every other bag is leaking. The only thing I can do to save the milk in almost 200 bags is to start thawing the bag in a clean bowl, and watch carefully for a leak. If it does, I pour the milk into a bottle to thaw the rest of the way. Far less than ideal. I will absolutely not purchase these again, and warn any pumping moms against them to protect all their precious hours of pumping!

review/summary: Leakproof but doesn't stand up
review/text: I like that this bag is well sealed on all sides. The double ziplock is easy to close. I also like that there is lots of room above the level of liquid because I like to squeeze the air out before I seal the bags.  The only drawback is that they don't stand well once I put the liquid inside, they tend to flop over with 4oz or more of liquid.  Which may not be a concern if you place the filled bags in a box, container or organizer or if you lay them flat in the fridge or freezer.

review/summary: Top Quality Bag for Great Price
review/text: I have tried every bag available in stores, from Medela to Ameda while pumping for my daughter.  With this baby, I am no longer pumping at work because I am a SAHM.  I donate breast milk, though, and was important to find a quality bag as inexpensively as possible.  I sent in for a sample of the Honeysuckle bags, and really liked both the breast milk bag and the infant food bag.  The oxo-biodegradable bags are stronger than other brands, and the reinforced bottom helps the bags to stand on their own if needed. No more losing milk because the bag topples over while you're filling or trying to seal it up!  The double seal is strong, and the label for the bag is right-side up. (Lansinoh bags have odd, upside down labels.)  The infant food bags can be used for breast milk, also, and are great for freezing smaller portions.  I ordered a case of 300, and I'm glad that I did.  They're working out very well, and for a lot less than I'd spend by buying bags in local stores.

review/summary: Great bags, great price!
review/text: These bags are a great value. I was using the breast milk storage bags that were the same brand as my pump, but they were pretty expensive. These bags are less expensive, and still have a good seal to them and don't leak when unfrozen. They even hold a little more milk in each bag- the measuring marks go up to 6 ounces, but you can easily fit more like 8 or 9 ounces and still leave room for it to expand when frozen. They also have a spot on the label where you can mark how many ounces you put in, which is nice because I find that the measuring marks on any storage bag are not as accurate as those on the hard plastic bottle.

review/text: This is my second order of breast milk bags from The New Bag Co. I received my order promptly and was surprised to find I was shipped a supply of their food storage bags instead of the breast milk bags I had ordered (they hold about 2oz less). A note enclosed with the bags indicated their breast milk bags were backordered and they had sent me the food storage bags at no extra charge in the interim so I would not be without a storage option. My breast milk bags arrived roughly a week later. Great service!<br /><br />As for the bags themselves, they are just thick enough to be strong but not too thick that they take up unneccessary room in the freezer and they have a very good zip top. I've used about 100 bags so far and have had zero issues with leaks. I find the zip top is sometimes difficult to open, and that is not a complaint. :) I highly recommend these bags. The only other brand I've tried is Lansinoh (which were fine), but I certainly prefer the Honeysuckle bags for their great overall quality and biodegradability.

review/summary: Great Storage Bags!
review/text: I am a first time Mom and I did a lot of research before deciding on a breast milk storage bag. I decided to go with the Honeysuckle Bags due to all the rave reviews. I am just as impressed as everyone else is. These are great storage bags. I like the fact that the have a double ziplock feature. I have been using them for about two weeks now and have not had any problems with them leaking. When placed in freezer lying down, they freeze nearly flat, which makes them easy to store. They also have a nice weight to them....they are not too thin or too thick. The only downfall that I have found to them so far is that the measurements are off by about an ounce, so I only go off of the ounces listed on the bottle that I pump into and label it at the top of the bag. Once the milk is frozen in the bags, you don't use the measurement markers anyways, so it is not that big of a deal. I would highly recommend them to other breast feeding Mothers!

Also, I cook my popcorn the "old fashioned way" in a pan with a lid on top of the stove.  This popcorn had almost a 100% pop rate.  Out of an entire large pan, 5 kernels were left unpopped.
