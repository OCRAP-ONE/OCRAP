review/summary: Love me some Passion Fruit Tea!
review/text: I love this tea!  They make it at Panda Express, and I asked them where they got their tea from and they said the company makes it especially just for Panda Express.  I was not satisfied with that answer and went online.  I found it on Amazon and was estatic!  The only complaint I have is that you pay $5.99 for four tea (big) bags and you pay $7.99 or so for shipping, which made my four tea bags cost $3.50 a piece, but I love me some Passion Fruit Tea!

review/text: When I was drinking this tea, it felt oddly reminiscent to me.  I remembered where the flavor was from:  Tazo Berryblossom White tea.  One of my favorites- it tastes exactly the same, and I believe it's even caffeine free... so if you're looking for a cheaper substitute, give it a try:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E2TAX6">White Tea-Berry Blossom - 20 - Bag</a>

review/text: This is one of the best teas I've ever had! I am not really much of a tea drinker, but I enjoy iced tea much better than hot tea. My former workplace has China Mist Passion Fruit Iced tea as their staple drink for customers, and I became obsessed with it! It has a wonderful flavor, yet not overwhelming either. It's a perfectly refreshing mix of fruitiness and tea and it's completely wonderful! You'll love it!

review/text: I need to eat sugar free candies and I find these to be the very best.  I've bought another brand locally, but they seem too sour.  I use these just to have a piece of candy, but also when I have a cold.  Especially during the night, I just want something that keeps my throat soothed and allows me to go back to sleep.  I don't want sour taste that makes them hard to eat and also keeps me too aware of the candy.  Thanks for carrying a product that I can eat.

I THEN EMAILED THE PROVIDER, JR MUSHROOMS AND SPECIALTIES, EXPLAINING THE ISSUE AND WHY I DID NOT CONTACT THEM SOONER.  I ALSO COPIED AMAZON.<br />I NEVER HEARD FROM EITHER OF THEM.<br />CAUTION-BE AWARE OF THE RETURN/COMPLAINT POLICIES BEFORE YOU ORDER.  IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CREDIT BUT MORE THAT NEITHER AMAZON NOR JR MUSHROOM NEVER HAD THE COURTESY TO REPLY.<br />THE TIME LAPSE SHOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED THEIR  QUALITY AS PANFORTE WERE ORIGINAALLY MADE AS NOURISHMENT  FOR THE CRUSADERS BECAUSE THEY LAST LONG, MOST PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN MAINLY DRIED FRUITS AND NUTS.

review/summary: Sicilian memories
review/text: I visited Sicily about a decade ago. I ate many almond desserts on the island, and encountered the delicious Sicilian marzipan the first time. Unfortunately, I haven't found the same flavor since... until now. The Stramondo marzipan has a superb intense almond flavor, despite that it does not contain any flavorings, only organic raw sugar and almonds. The texture is very fine,smooth. I cook quite a lot, and like almonds, so I fell in love with the product. The company sends it with UPS as default, i. e. the postage is rather expensive... therefore now I will order three packs of it in one shipment...

review/summary: You don't know marzipan until you know Stramondo.
review/text: A friend whose baking I adore, recommended this marzipan to me years ago.<br />I never thought much of it, because I have no feelings for cloyingly sweet almond paste. She promised that this is different.<br /><br />OH MY GOD, is it different!<br /><br />I made an apple galette with a thin layer of this marzipan on the base, and it gave such a subtly lovely almond..essence? to the whole thing. Delightful. The texture is unbelievably smooth. It's so ALMONDy, and not too sweet. Like they know how the almonds taste delicious enough, and don't need a bunch of sugar to bolster that.<br /><br />I saved the other half of the tube in the freezer, and cut paper thin slabs when I got a hankering. Just eating it like that, letting it melt on my tongue, was amazing. This marzipan deserves to be the highlight of anything you put it in, or just eaten as is.<br />I see why there is always a wait for this product. Pay whatever you have to, and ask your local fancy grocery to put your name on a list for when it comes in. Go out of your way.

review/summary: Great refresher after working outside or exercising!
review/text: Working outside in the summer or exercising can deplete your body of necessary water, electrolytes and energy.  This is a good tasting low calorie drink that refreshes you and helps maintain a healthy balance of what your body needs.  Each 32 ounce bottle has 4 servings and each serving has 20 calories, 5 Grams of sugar, 110 mg of sodium and 30 mg of potassium.  It replaces the salt you have lost from sweating and the potassium helps your muscles not cramp.<br /><br />This is an ideal drink for those lighter workouts or if you are diabetic and need to get refreshed quickly but don't need a lot of sugar.  It contains the same electrolytes and hydration as the original Gatorade with � the calories and 1/3 of the carbohydrates.<br /><br />It is great for those hot summer days.  It is best served cold and shaken before drinking.  The price here seems a bit high and with the additional shipping cost you can pick it up in the store at a much lower price.  It is a very good product.

review/text: I love gum, it helps me stay awake during boring meetings or long hours at the computer and keeps me from snacking, problem is almost every type of gum made now has aspartame which tends to give me a headache.

The peppermint and spearmint are my favorites and last the longest, the fruit is a little sweet for me and does not last as long.  None of them last as long as your standard commercial gum, but for me, it is definately worth it.

The products are well-packaged, and the steps taken to assure frozen delivery are stellar.<br /><br />Warning!  The lobster is addictive!  I must always have a couple of the Hancock products in my freezer.  I particularly like the lobster mac and cheese, and the lobster ciambatta.  Also, need to have a half dozen whoopie pies on hand.<br /><br />This product is worth the money!

review/summary: Hallelujah! Dorset Cereals are the best mueslis in the world.
review/text: I recently moved to an area without much in terms of specialty and high-end grocery stores, so I am so glad to see Dorset Cereals for sale on Amazon. They are, quite simply, the best mueslis I have ever had the pleasure of eating.<br /><br />You would think that a muesli is a muesli, wouldn't you? I certainly would. And that's exactly what I thought, more or less, until I tried my first Dorset Cereal.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure how they make their mueslis better than everyone else's, but I have a theory. I think they toast the grain flakes. Maybe not the oats, but perhaps the wheat and barley, to bring out the flavor. I'm not sure exactly. But whatever they do, it sure works.<br /><br />This particular variety of Dorset Cereals is simple but outstanding. In fact, it is probably my favorite. No exotic fruits -- unless you consider dates, sultanas and Chilean flame raisins exotic. The fruits and nuts percentage reaches 30%, which for Dorset Cereals is on the low side, as most varieties are at 50%. Lots of Brazil nuts and hazelnuts. Good eating all around.<br /><br />There are certainly other good mueslis out there, but often my favorites among other brands, like Germany's Alnatura, use tricks to make them tastier -- like chocolate. Dorset Cereals manage to outshine good chocolate mueslis without resorting to cheap sugary tricks.<br /><br />If anyone honestly knows a better muesli, I'd love to try it. I've tried quite a few, from lots of different muesli-rich countries in Europe, and so far Dorset stands head and shoulders above the rest. I will change the title of this review the minute I taste a better muesli (at least one that isn't loaded with sugar). Until then, I'll stand by my statement that these guys makes the best mueslis in the world.

review/summary: The absolute best muesli; hands down!
review/text: Yes, I've tried them all; the imports, the organic "wannabes"; nothing compares to Dorset Cereals' muesli! Although the company makes several different varieties (all the while blending different ratios and types of fruits, nuts and fiber), I find this "blue box", "simply delicious muesli" flavor to be my favorite. Inside, you will find a combination of raisins, sunflower seeds, dates, roasted hazelnuts and huge chunks of brazil nuts, along with multi-grain flakes...30% of the blend consists of fruit, nuts and seeds, which is significant, compared to other brands. I've just signed up for the auto shipment program, as that brings the price down to around $4.36 per box, which is exceptional, considering it's $5.30 per box at my local gourmet grocery!<br /><br />Try an initial order of two boxes; I am sure you will love it! You'll have nothing to lose, and everything to grain...ummm; I mean gain!

Short of going to a health store and buying expensive ingredients to mix it up himself, this cereal is the closest thing we could find. He really loves this cereal, it has all great natural ingredients that are wholesome and very healthy.<br />While this cereal is still on the pricier side, it is still much cheaper than buying each ingredient yourself and mixing it all together.<br />Perfect healthy cereal without any unwanted added sugars.

Big halves of brazil nuts and whole hazelnuts made this luxury.  I'm hooked. :)

review/text: This muesli is one of the best available. In fact, all the Dorset Cereals are worth a try. From a nutritional point of view this is a well balanced breakfast that you can feel good about eating. My only gripe is that it's still a little expensive compared to other breakfast cereals, although I realize that it's not necessarily fair to make such comparisons. A price of less than five dollars a box would be ideal. Highly recommended, buy with confidence.

Other brands tend to be filled with dust (Alpen) or too chewy (Red Mill), but this one is just right.  I'm not so fond of the other flavors, but the "Simply Delicious" is, well... just that.  I have 1/2 cup every morning with soy milk and a layer of grape nuts sprinkled on top.

review/summary: High quality ingredients
review/text: First let me say that I have tried a LOT of mueslis (and also have made my own with thick cut oats and dried fruit) and that I dislike American super sugary cereals in general.  My favorite way to eat muesli is preparing it as Bircher Muesli (search the internet to find out more on this recipe), with yogurt, orange and lemon juice, chopped apples and other fruit and a touch of honey and milk to thin it out if needed.  Bircher Muesli is usually prepared the night before to give it time to soften up the oats/grains.<br /><br />This cereal looked great when pouring out of the box (nice fruit and nut pieces), but when I ate my first couple of bowls of this Dorset muesli, I was somewhat disappointed.  It does not hold up to long soaking or preparation as a Bircher Muesli and can get mushy.  Then I started eating it as more of a quick version (especially on hectic workday mornings) and I have come to love this cereal.  To me, the grain flakes in Dorset are more like quick oats vs. thick cut oats in some other mueslis (like those in one of my favorite German mueslis - Seitenbacher).  I mix the Dorset muesli with yogurt/ (soy)milk/ honey/ fresh blueberries or just (soy)milk and let it sit for only about 15 min and it is perfect for me - still has a nice bite to it.  It has lots of dried fruit and big pieces of nuts.  Lives up to its name "Simply Delicious" and I will repurchase.

review/summary: Wow, super yummy!
review/text: I really enjoy muesli but the selection at my local grocery and health food store consists of either over-processed, sweetened junk or flavorless cardboard.  This brand showed up at the grocery so I picked it up on a whim and I am certainly not disappointed!<br /><br />Absolutely delicious.  I like my food to be simple yet flavorful and nutritious and this muesli fills those requirements on all three counts.  Just the right balance of texture and taste, with lovely chewy grains, soft sweet raisins and crunchy nuts.  I love brazil nuts and hazelnuts so I thoroughly enjoyed this mixture.  Best of all, not too sugary or salty, the flavor is understated but very nice.  I go with the suggested serving size of 1/2 cup with some cold milk and feel pleasantly sated, with lots of energy later.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and I'm thrilled it is being offered through Amazon as I'm sure it won't last long around here - the box I got had dust on it so I think I might be one of the only people actually buying it locally.  Their loss!

review/summary: Fantastic product, but be careful buying it from Amazon.com!
review/text: I first tried this cereal when visiting a friend last weekend and thought it was absolutely wonderful!  I had a bowl every day of my visit and loved it more each time.  My friend told me I could order it from Amazon.com, which I did as soon as I got home.  I had my first bowl yesterday -- the same day the package arrived -- only to find that it was horrible!  The flakes tasted soft and stale, although the box was in-date, and I couldn't find anything wrong with the packaging.  I tried a little more this morning just to make sure I wasn't imagining things yesterday, but alas, still awful.  Maybe I just got unlucky this time, but for $6 a box, I don't think I'll risk another purchase from Amazon.com anytime soon. Too bad.  :(  If it hadn't been for this experience, I would have totally concurred with everything the most positive reviews said about the product.

review/summary: Foam and gummis make a tasty frog
review/text: The light foam layer on the gummi frogs makes an interesting mild flavor mixed with the fruitiness of the gummi portion. These are a nice textural change from gummi bears and a few of them satisfies the sweet tooth.

review/summary: 5lbs of hard!
review/text: I reviewed these 5lb mini gummy frogs right after I received them about a month ago. It wasn't a favorable review either. I can't believe the last post on this product was over 6 months ago (Sept. 2010). They probably had 6 months of bad reviews...anyway, I'll try again and hope I'm able to warn you about these gummies.<br />Let me first start out by says how much I LOVE Haribo gummies. When soft and fresh, these are definitely worthy of five stars. I love the green frogs and mini frogs the best. Whenever I am at Cost Plus (the only places I find the mini frog gummies) I'll purchase a small 5 oz bag at $1.79. So when I saw the latest deal through Amazon to get 5 lbs of mini frogs for cheap, I jumped on the deal. Yes, I did read all the reviews and saw the one and two star reviews before placing my order. But most were old posts, some years old. They've got to improve their product freshness issue by now, right? Wrong. Unfortunately, what arrived was a big block of hard, stale mini pellets (gummies). I was totally disappointed. Hence, my one star review.<br />For those of you wanting soft gummies. Buy the 5oz - 12 packs. Those are tightly sealed packs and hold in the freshness better than the non-airtight packaging of the big 5 pounder. Not as good of a deal but you'll be getting a fresher product.<br />Would I buy this product again? 5lb package: no. 5oz 12 pack: yes.

review/summary: Great Little Candies
review/text: Probably my Favorite Haribo candy, I've ordered this twice from Amazon. Comes in a huge bag and with an assortment of three flavors. The green tastes like regular Gummi frogs, the reds and yellows taste like their respective gummi bears. My only complaint is that I usually get too many yellows, which I'm not particularly fond of.<br /><br />Pros: Great flavor, great price per pound, great party or snack food due to size.<br /><br />Cons: Some people dislike the yellow flavor, bag is a little hassle to deal with sometimes, candy stays in clumps while pouring out because of tight packing.

review/text: I used to order a bag of these every 2 weeks or so and they were always awesome.  There was a period recently of about 3 months where these minifrogs had a terrible smell and taste that was unbearable.  I think I returned 4 or 5 bags. It must have been a distributor issue.  I started ordering other HARIBO products...all great!  I stopped ordering these Mini Frogs for about 2 months and finally decided to try them again...AMAZING!  Just like I remembered them.  Lets hope they stay this way.  Have another bag on my doorstep waiting for me now.  Cant wait to get off of work!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These are for the person who wants to like gummy bears but just never could.<br /><br />The 'gummy' taste of normal gummy bears is offset by the foamy undercandy.  It makes for a very nice taste that's not too harsh.  Additionally, for me personally, I like them because they don't stick in my teeth like normal gummies.  (Tip: let them sit out for a few days.  They'll start to get a little tougher to chew.  Somehow, it helps the flavor.)<br /><br />I know the bag is huge, but gummy candy doesn't go stale quickly, so it'll last.  And you can give some away if you don't want them all.  Still worth it!

review/text: I order these pretty regularly and love them. Because I can't find them in my area and go through a lot, I order 5 pound bulk packages from Amazon. They arrive in a timely manner and the package is always in good condition, but the product can range from hard-as-a-rock to so sticky that they come out in one big ball. I'll keep ordering them because I don't have another option at the moment, but I wish they had better quality control.

review/summary: Gummy Frogs, OK
review/text: All in all i would describe these gummies as different from haribo brands, and definitely decent quality, but nothing to be a die hard fan of.<br /><br />I found the product to be chewy, similar in nature to a relatively fresh bag of standard haribo gummies, with the 'marshmallow' bottom slightly softer.<br /><br />The flavors were mostly indiscernible and the product seemed to stay fresh even while in an open bag over a 2 week period in my office.<br /><br />Grapefruit (pink) slices are great<br />raspberries/black berries are good and a different product<br />regular gummies are always a hit.<br /><br />I think this may be my last 'experiment' into the haribo brand for a while. I was expected some better flavor, but not good enough for my tastes.

review/text: The only issue I have with these is that they were not made in Germany, but rather in Hungary, I believe. To most American's this is not an issue, but my husband is from Germany, and he swears he can tell the difference. Regardless, he ate them all, and much too quickly, I might add. Anyway this a HUGE bag. It would be perfect for a teacher to give as treats to students, etc. HOWEVER, they are small and chewy, so don't give them to young children.

The white bottoms of the frogs have a marshmallow melting effect, which is simply delicious.

review/text: After I got the techno gummis along with this I was amazed at how unique the techno gummis taste was and was expecting about the same thing with the mini-frogs, but except for their marshmallow bellies the mini-frogs were just the same as the gummi bears you get at the store and in all to me they were like the shark gummis I can get at the convenient stores as well.  The bag is humongous and holds a great quantity so kudos for that but still I felt a little cheated that for this price I just got what amounted to five pounds of marshmallow gummi bears, and while I loved the techno gummis and have ordered another bag seeing as how my family and I have almost finished the bag I really doubt I will reorder this again unless the price goes a little more down to a reasonable price for this usual treat that's pretty much available at almost every store....

The cake by itself is average, and makes a reasonable if expensive treat for a low carb diet.<br /><br />The frosting on the other hand, is not that of carrot cake frosting, and it IS unpleasant. It requires cream cheese to make, and to be honest, you would be better off just spreading the raw cream cheese on the cake. We did not, but if I ever buy it again, I will try that.
