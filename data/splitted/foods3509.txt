review/summary: Just Weak Coffee, No Mocha To Be Had
review/text: I purchased Timothy's Mocha Java because of the price and I wanted to have a nice cup of mocha coffee.  What I got was a cup of weak coffee.  There is no mocha in this k-cup whatsoever.  I don't know how Timothy's defines "mocha", but is sure doesn't have anything to do with chocolate.  Do not waste your time and money purchasing this product!

review/summary: Where's the Mocha?
review/text: I have given all positive reviews for K-cup flavors except this one, where's the mocha?  Doesn't smell or taste like mocha, not sure what they were going for here but Mocha doesn't seem to be it.  It's not even really that good a cup of coffee, whatever they added in to try and be mocha just adds some bitterness and not much else.  I tried to drink them but ended up tossing most of them away.  Too spoiled by so many other good flavors to waste time drinking this one.<br /><br />Best Timothy's flavor is their Rainforest Espresso, oh wow that's good, and best flavored k-cup overall is Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla, you haven't lived until you've tried that one.  This Mocha, ehhhh, keep looking.

Thorson did: "This is an especially felicitous blend of crunchy pecans and chewy cranberries, spiced up with a little black pepper and orange zest.

Just yesterday I found the real thing again and decided to see if I could get it from Amazon. So glad to see I can. And very happy to see the 2oz size bags. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to stop before eating the entire 5oz bag!

review/text: I got a good price on these, so I gave them a try, and as a quick snack they're not BAD, but they have a slightly stale flavor (in spite of being nowhere near their 'use by' date), the dried fruit bits tend to be VERY small and hard, and over-all they're blander-tasting than I'd expect, considering the wonderful and flavorful ingredients that went into them.<br /><br />I can eat them for a quick emergency snack, and wouldn't hesitate to offer them to a guest, but I won't re-order.

review/summary: Dang that's good.
review/text: I tend to have good luck when it comes to vending machines, and always come across one that has something stuck in a rung, free for the taking once I shake it a few times. Recently I spotted a pack of these almonds in one, shook it out, and gave it a shot. I hadn't tried them before since they were in the 'healthy' vending machine where the cheapest thing is a fiber cookie for nearly one Abe Lincoln. But hey, when almonds are free, I won't turn them down. Almonds are already great on their own, and these suckers add other great ingredients to the mix, making for an excellent snack.<br /><br />You get the usual crunchy almonds, apples, flax seeds(!), balsamic vinegar, sea salt and red peppers. Flax seeds make everything better, in more ways than one, and I'm really glad that snack foods are starting to feature these more. The apple taste is faint but you definitely get it as soon as the almonds hit your tongue, and the red peppers...something that I've actually never had in my life, aren't strong at all. That was my only real concern with this snack when I was opening it. Despite my heritage, I've never had any kind of spicy foods, but I bit the bullet and I absolutely love these.<br /><br />As usual with great snacks, the only bad thing is the price, but Amazon has a pretty good deal on them. While 'soledad' might mean 'loneliness' in Spanish, you'll be able to overcome that feeling as long as you've got a pack of these babies around. Buy some immediately...or shake 'em out of a vending machine.

Unbelievable snack.  The taste was so awesome that I logged onto my laptop in the terminal to email my wife the link so we could find where to buy them.  You've got to try this snack.

review/summary: Oh, yummy--with a bit of a kick
review/text: I first saw these at my local Whole Foods, and as I am a vegan nut fanatic (they make for great snacking), I had to try them.  I love how there are no mysterious ingredients, no preservatives, just wholesome fruit and nuts (with a little sweetener).  The Soledad mix has spices that give it a bit of a kick, which is mellowed by the sweeteness of the apples, the brown rice syrup, and the date juice.<br /><br />My only complaint is that when I'm done snacking, many of the flax seeds wind up on the bottom of the bag.  Flax is very good for you--an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, but it's hard to eat a handful of tiny seeds.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a healthy wholesome snack, Sahale's Soledad is a great option.

review/summary: incredibly delicious and unexpected!
review/text: Soledad is an AMAZING mix--I love how low sugar and high protein it is. My husband loves it to (and he's a junkfood junkie).<br /><br />The cayenne definitely gives it a little kick/heat, but it's not unpleasant (in fact, it's my favorite part of this blend) and I noticed that the heat is strongest with the first couple of bites and then mellows out. It IS a surprising amount of heat compared the wimpy, over-sugared trail mixes/nut blends that are on the market, so be prepared. :)<br /><br />The almonds are whole, high quality, and gorgeous, and the apples are tiny, diced pieces so they're easy to eat, not too sticky, and not leathery. One thing that I thought was weird when I picked up the bag (I got it at Costco) was that the mix felt like it was congealed into one big piece. This is just how it is--the small amount of brown rice syrup makes everything stick together (no, it's not sticky to the touch), but it's very easy to break off chunks or individual almonds.<br /><br />Enjoy! I HIGHLY recommend this mix for any adult who loves delicious, high quality, satisfying, healthy snacks! :)

review/text: I have all of the flavors and never remember which is best, but they are all good.  Different nuts dominate each blend, e.g. walnuts, almonds, pecans, macadamias, etc.  They have a bit of dried fruit in each variety, again, all different, and an unusual kick to each.  One has notes of black pepper, another chili, but none are overpowering and/or "hot."<br /><br />One caveat, if you are like me and lack willpower, order the 2oz varieties.  I started with the 5 oz. packs and kept on eating until the bag was empty.  Way too many calories for me.<br /><br />Try the assorted product first and see if you have a particular favorite.  I enjoy them all.

review/summary: You won't believe how good this unique snack is!!!!
review/text: I am a flight attendant for a major airline. I was turned on to this delicious snack by a friend of mine as we headed back to Philadelphia from San Francisco over a month ago. She told me she got the Sahale Soledad Blend Almonds from Whole Foods before we left for the airport. After a few moments of her urging me to try the almonds, I gave in. The spiciness from the red pepper flakes, the sweet, chewiness of the apples and dates, and the crunchy almonds sprinkled with flax seed and the touch of balsamic vinegar was delightful. Though the ingredients mixed together provide a unique flavor for the almonds, none of the ingredients are too overwhelming as to disturb the enjoyment of the snack. The Sahale Soledad Blend Almonds are so much healthier than the candy bars, chips, or cupcakes I normally pack as a pick-me-up snack while I'm flying. I've already gone through two boxes of the almonds and will be ordering more soon.

It's high in antioxidants and low in sodium and I can actually eat it (with all of my<br /><br />sensitive GI issues).  I actually eat it for a meal when I'm on the road.<br /><br />You've got to try it!

review/summary: Got these in a variety pack....
review/text: These were good. Kinda sweet and salty.  There is a very distinct flavor of cumin to me.  I am not sure if that is something else causing the flavor, but it is overpowering.  These aren't hot spicy, just very flavorful  if you like cumin and sweet crystallized fruit, this is for you. If not, get the variety pack from Amazon and try them before you get a 12 pack.  This is a very good product as I have tried four flavors and loved them.  I just wanted to mention the CUMIN flavor screaming through these.  I just don't like cumin a huge huge ton.

review/summary: Great Flavor, Very Flawed Pods
review/text: I bought Timothy's Decaf Colombian pods, and 90 percent of the pods virtually exploded in my Keurig coffeemaker.  Grounds all over the counter.  I had to strain the coffee through a coffee filter so as not to waste it.  Too many grounds to be drinkable otherwise.  I like the coffee's flavor, but I won't use Timothy's.  Every other brand of pods worked fine.  I checked my brewer, and it was working fine, too.  I cleaned out the needle and did recommended maintenance, then tried again: coffee was full of grounds again.  My brewer is new, had it less than 6 months.  I checked the pods, too, and they were not damaged; just unable to make coffee without spraying out grounds.

review/summary: An all natural hot sauce that compliments not overpowers..
review/text: When it comes to adding a little kick of heat to some wings, or seafood, pizza or even a burger I turn to a brand of hot sauce that has not let me down in over 20 years of using it.  TABASCO.  What makes me stick to TABASCO pepper sauce, for some added heat, is how it adds the heat.  This hot sauce does not come across overpowering which will destroy the natural flavor of the food.  Instead it adds a sweet "kick" to your food, giving it added flavor while spicing it up a few notches.<br /><br />This product contains Distilled Vinegar, Red Pepper and Salt.  It is a very simple product that is all natural.  TABASCO "Ages" their Hot Sauces in wooden barrels like one might age a wine.  They re-use the barrels after a batch is done so with each batch the flavor continues to stay bold and get better and better.<br /><br />Is TABASCO for everyone? Probably not as it does have some nice kick to it.  However if you are a fan of spicing up the food in your life there is no better brand to have sitting around the house.  It works for almost every food product out there and I personally would say it has about a "MEDIUM" heat to it(2500-5000 Scoville units).  5 stars for a product that has stood the test of time for over 150 years<br /><br />**NOTE: If you are looking for a more "MILD" spice you should try the Green Pepper sauce.  A nice sweet green pepper flavor with very little kick (600-1200 Scoville units)<br /><br />**NOTE: If you want a more smokey flavor with your spice, try the Chipotle pepper sauce.  It goes great with BBQ or meats with a soft kick.  "MILD-MEDIUM" heat (1500-2500 Scoville units)

review/summary: Fast, Safe Shipping - Amazing (as always) Tabasco Sauce
review/text: First of all, I'd like to mention how impressed I was with the packaging! I received a box that contained padding to keep the Tabasco box from shaking around. Within the Tabasco box was the bubble-wrapped bottle of Tabasco sauce, packed so securely I actually had to pull it out with a bit of force. I was worried the bottle would come broken, to be honest, so this was a huge relief.<br /><br />As for the Tabasco, it's my go-to hot sauce. At somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 on the Scoville scale, the original red has just enough heat for my taste buds. Its flavor is so smooth that I can add a few dashes to almost anything I want (sweet treats excluded) without disrupting the dish's taste.<br /><br />If you've never tried Tabasco sauce, buy a smaller bottle to ensure you like it. However, if you are a fan of Tabasco and want a bigger bottle for all of your cooking and dining needs, this is the product. It gets to you quickly and safely with Amazon shipping and the Tabasco is tasty, as always!

review/summary: there is "hot sauce" and then there is TOBASCO
review/text: I have been a longtime user and a huge fan of Tobasco sauce for at least the past 13 years. I cannot get enough of it, it is flavorful and spicy and makes everything taste excellent. I use it for cooking and as a general condiment, it's also a perfect salt substitute because this adds a punch without as much sodium as table salt. Tobasco is especially great with chicken, seafood, beef, barbecue, Italian food, Asian foods, Tex-Mex, eggs and in sauces, casseroles and ground beef recipes. I always keep at least 2 large jars in my kitchen (a 12 ounce and 5 ounce one) that are literally used multiple times each day. It doesn't make foods "hot," instead Tobasco just adds to the natural flavors by enhancing what you're preparing. I will never touch or try another hot sauce because nothing can compare to the rich and full flavor of Tobasco. Tobasco is absoltely the best condiment that will ever enter your kitchen and mine.

review/summary: TABASCO  Sauce > Hot Sauce
review/text: TABASCO sauce was the best mistake my mother has ever made. She somehow accidentally purchased it instead of our normal "hot sauce" , and in the absence of "hot sauce" we had to use this wonderful concoction know as TABASCO sauce instead. I was skeptical at first when applying it to my food. Initially the TABASCO sauce seemed watery to me, it is definitely not a thick sauce, it appears diluted when compared other "hot sauces". I was worried it would not provide the same kick as my everyday "hot sauce", boy was I wrong. The TABASCO sauce provided more of a "kick" than my normal "hot sauce", this was a pleasant surprise, but that's not all. The thing I like most about TABASCO sauce is it taste amazing on food. I first tried my TABASCO sauce on fried fish, it was great, then the next thing I knew I was putting it on hamburgers. I have never put a hot sauce on a hamburger, but I figured why not - this stuff is amazing. TABASCO sauce blends perfectly with any food you would normally put any other "hot sauce" on. Another thing I like about the sauce is, if you eat a piece of food with hot sauce on it, you don't immediately taste the hot sauce. The heat slowly builds in your mouth. Which is how hot sauce should be.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Great Taste<br />* Not Very Acidic<br />* Heat Slowly Builds<br />Cons<br />* Pricy  It is worth it )<br />* Small Bottle  This stuff vanished in my house )<br /><br />Verdict : BUY this hot sauce, at least once to try it out. I guarantee you will not regret it.

review/summary: Timeless Classic.
review/text: There are a great many products which are vastly superior to ye olde Tobasco, but I still make use of it for a couple of reasons. First, it's cheaper than most of the other stuff out there and you can get a huge bottle of it for a cheap price (like you can here). Second, it has a nice kick to it heat-wise so what it lacks in flavor is compensated by its punch. I use it for in chili, soup, beans, dips, and with other recipes where taste is secondary to bite. This classic still has a lot to offer.

review/text: I wanted a classic cream of chicken soup to use in casseroles, so I thought I would try this soup.  Gluten isn't a concern for my family, and I definitely prefer the ingredients over something like Campbell's.  However, it is important to note that this is NOT a condensed soup, like most cream of chicken varieties you would find in the store.  That makes it difficult to use for some casserole recipes (makes it too watery).  I wish I had realized this before I bought it.  I did find a use for all 12 cans, though!  The taste is good, though I don't usually eat it as a soup.  3.5 stars overall.

review/text: When I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease a year and a half ago I had to not only change the way I ate, but how I prepared my feeds. Since my diagnoses there have been many favorite recipes I've stopped preparing because I had no gluten free creamed soup and making the soup to use in a recipe was way to labor intensive for me.<br />I was thrilled to find this soup to use in cooking. The consistency is a thinner than mainstream creamed soups, so the amount of liquid has to be adjusted. A small price to pay!

review/text: I have been on a gluten free diet for eighteen months and while some reviewers aren't so sure Celiac's should use this product I have had no problem with it the four times I've used it in cooking. It is really tasty, best thing I've found that compares to your standard cream of chicken. If you're using it in a recipe that you would normally add water to you will need to omit the water and just use more soup. So to make a casserole (or hotdish as we Minnesotans like to call it) you need to use quite a bit of soup making for a 'spendy' little hotdish. Enjoy!

Cans without BPA are being shipped now, so cans you find in stores now may or may not contain it. I am so happy to see a brand that I can actually find in my grocery store commit to not using BPA. Plus, I really like their canned tomatoes and think the quality is better than Hunt's. Their crushed tomatoes with basil actually contain whole basil leaves, not just basil "flavor."

You can see their response below:<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Muir Glen about bisphenol-A or BPA.<br /><br />Bisphenol-A is a component of protective coatings in metal food packaging, and provides an important food safety and quality function in canned foods. Scientific and governmental bodies worldwide have examined the science many times and have concluded that the weight of evidence supports the safety of BPA, including recent comprehensive assessments in Japan and in the European Union.<br /><br />In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced another review of BPA. This review in expected to take 18-24 months, and Health Canada and the World Health Organization (WHO) will participate.<br /><br />Most metal cans in the food industry utilize BPA in the can lining or can lid. Some of our products do, and many competitors' products do as well.<br /><br />Muir Glen continues to believe BPA is safe. However, we know that some of our consumers have wanted us to pursue alternatives. We have been working with our can suppliers and can manufacturers to develop and test alternative linings that do not use BPA for some time.<br /><br />One alternative has proven safe and viable in our processing of tomatoes - and Muir Glen is in the midst of transitioning to cans with liners that do not use BPA. It is an approved non-epoxy alternative. Can coatings used by Muir Glen also comply fully with all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for safe use in food contact applications.<br /><br />Your views are important to us. Again, thank you for contacting Muir Glen, and thank you for your support of our products.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Consumer Services"

review/text: I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!

All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: YOU'LL NEVER MISS THE SODIUM!!!!
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for products with low--or NO-- salt, because I have Meniere's Disase which requires an EXTREMELY low sodium diet. I found this tomato sauce in a local 'gourmet' type store, and decided to try a can. (The price was REAL scary, but it's SO hard to find good things...)<br />Well, folks, let me tell you - you'd never know this sauce is low-sodium!  It's perfectly seasoned and tastes delicious!!  A friend suggested I check Amazon.com, and was thrilled to find it; and at a significantly lower price.  I'm partway through my first 12-pack, and will definitely continue to order it. (I'm pretty sure I'm going to do "Subscribe & Save", and save even more next time.)<br />Just FYI, it's great on more than just pasta -- I've used it on both chicken and pork; eggplant and zucchini, and rice.<br /><br />As Julia Child used to say -- "Yum!"

review/summary: Has twice the calories of Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes
review/text: Muir Glen Organic Tomato Sauce, No Salt Added, has 175 calories per can.  Muir Glen Organic Diced Tomatoes, No Salt Added, has 90 calories per can.  Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes taste surprisingly good - almost as good as Muir Glen's canned tomato sauce.  As of June, 2012, the inner lining of Muir Glen's canned tomato sauce is shiny, metallic brass.  As of June, 2012, the inner lining of Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes is white plastic, probably BPA.  Both of these Muir Glen canned tomato products have no sugar added.  Apparently, the high calories in the canned tomato sauce results from natural sugars in the tomato fruit.  I've decided to go with Muir Glen's canned diced tomatoes because it's lower in calories and higher in fiber.  However, I prefer the shiny, metallic brass inner can lining to the white plastic (probably BPA) inner can lining.

review/summary: Dent problems and BPA for many cans with use by dates of 2013 (formerly "no problems")
review/text: Original: The cans arrived in great shape unlike some past orders of another product.  The packaging was very good.  The tomato sauce itself is excellent.  I will buy this product again.<br />---------------------------------<br />Back in 2011, the last time I ordered this product from Amazon.com, the case of tomato sauce cans had no dents and were BPA free.  Unfortunately, prior to that there were several dented cans in each case.  Because Amazon was out of this product when I ordered, last week (8/22/2012), I received a case from another reliable dealer in which half of the case contained dented cans and all contained BPA.  I wrote Muir Glen, which is a div. of General Mills, and a customer rep. called me today.  The cans are packaged by them in case lots by automated equipment.  She's sending the info on the dented cans to quality control.  As to the BPA issue, she advised that 2 seasons ago they stopped using BPA cans but some pre-2014 use-by-date cans may still contain the white lining/BPA in the cans.  About half of the cans that expire in 2013 contain BPA.  So, please check the "use by date" on the can.  My case lot had a use-by-date of 23Feb2013, the bar code number is (small 7) 2534228571 (small 4).  FYI, I'm not buying this product again unless I can see the "use by date."  It's still a great tasting, no-salt-added tomato sauce.  (Revised 8/27/2012)

review/text: Canned tomato products usually contain such high sodium content.  I was very glad to find this "no salt added" sauce from Muir Glen.  I don't miss the salt at all, and can add it to other sauces to cut the sodium.  Muir Glen products are always fresh and great tasting and are organic so we don't have to worry about chemicals.<br />Amazon's price makes it even better!

review/summary: The best black olives in the world.
review/text: We have eaten olives all over Europe and the Mediterranean - and these are without doubt the best ever. The texture is firm but soft -  neither too hard nor too mushy. The herbs used are perfectly balanced and they are not overly salty nor briny tasting.They are a perfect accompaniment with red wine and we love adding them to a tomato, mozzarella and avocado salad. Whenever we have served them to dinner guests they remark that they are the best olives they have ever tasted!

review/summary: Really Good.....And Different
review/text: I am a self confessed spice nut.  I love owning and experiencing all kinds of spices in an attempt to create tjat absolutely perfect taste.  As most people are aware, there are certain herbs and spices that are better suited for pork, than fish, or chicken than steak.  This really robust blend of garlic and herbs from Tones is one of the most universal spices I have ever used.  I regularly add it to pasta sauce, chicken, steak, hamburgers, roasts, pork, you name it and it tastes great on anything.  One thing I can promise you is that it has a very different flavor to it than you have probably ever experienced from any other common spice, or blend in your kitchen.  It's garlic taste is distinctive, but far from overwhelming.  The herbs come through in its aroma, and more importantly, in the final product that you are using.  This brand and blend is hard to find in stores in any size.  I buy it here regularly on Amazon and highly recommend it for your own kitchen adventures...

review/summary: Excellent Honey, but Be Wary of Shipping
review/text: The Orange Blossom "juicy" honey flavor is every bit as awesome as the other reviews rave. Much better than Clover honey. Overall, the flavor has a unique hint of citrus.<br /><br />The only con in this purchase (Why four stars after so many complaints), as mentioned by others, the seal on the bottle is not sufficient, and the honey was sticky-coated across other items packed by the Amazon fulfilled shipment. The bottle was inside a plastic bag, albeit not designed to properly seal, which is not sufficient. If you order this, make sure it is not fulfilled by Amazon or at least order by itself so that any spills will not affect combined items.<br /><br />If the shippers would wrap 1 inch clear box tape around the cap to secure it to the bottle as other vendors do, it would offset leakage.  Apparently they haven't had sufficient experience in logistics to discover this shipping method.<br /><br />Update 02/28/12: Amazon logistics took my packaging request seriously, and now ship honey bottles with lids taped tight.

review/text: I guess I got a bad batch from bees that went far afield of the orange trees. Mine is a medium to medium-dark honey and is definitely lacking the citrus taste I'm used to in other brands. Nothing light, fragrant or delicate about my bottle. This is typlical clover honey. Very dissatisfied and will never buy this brand again. I was looking for an alternative to the two brands available locally, which are very expensive. This was certainly cheaper but definitely not worth the money. I'll keep looking.<br /><br />But, for those who aren't picky about orange blossom honey being from orange blossoms, this is an OK clover honey. Depending on where you live, this might be cheaper than clover honey you can get locally and I'm sure you'll like it.

review/summary: Very tasty with a pure taste of honey.
review/text: I haven't used the honey in my granola yet which is why I purchased in the first place.  I did taste and try it in my spaghetti sauce and felt that it tasted very good.  The one thing is that it has a very strong honey taste which makes it have that pure taste to me.  My store bought honey was good but until I tried the Tropic Bee did I realize the difference was in the strength of the honey taste.  It's mild as far as not having that after taste of foods that are stronger in intensity from being a pure source of whatever it was taken from.  A good buy as far as I can tell.  I can't wait to make my granola bars to see if I get a sweeter taste than what I was getting with my store bought honey.
