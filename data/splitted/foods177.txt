review/summary: AVOID!  Price Has Doubled!
review/text: Like "Kitten Kisser", I must warn others to do the math and not order this item from Amazon.  Today I received the email notice that my Subscribe and Save order had been shipped and that the charge for this item was $16.10.  Since that is $0.67 per can (and I can get it locally for $0.40 per can), I wondered why I would have signed up for Subscribe and Save at that price.  I checked my account and discovered that my original (on February 3rd) Subscribe and Save order had cost $8.49; a good deal at $0.35 per can and no sales tax.  The Amazon price has now almost doubled.  Now I've learned to check the prices of my Subscribe & "Save" items more often and cancel when necessary.  Regular checking is essential because Amazon doesn't include the current Amazon price of the order in the "Order Shipping Soon" email.  Most incredibly,  the "regular" Amazon price has ballooned to about $0.79 per can, which is almost TWICE the price of the same item at my local pet store.  No, this is not a good deal.

review/summary: Great food, very meaty smelling and appetizing
review/text: My salmon loving Persian thinks this is her second favorite so I've bought enough of this stuff to own the company! She goes made for it and always cleans the bowl whenever it is served. Great stuff, but if you're looking for a higher protein content like I'm usually doing for this little girl, then go with the Fancy Feast version of this. It's almost double the protein and if you're working on a rescue cat, then that will make all the difference in the recovery process. I've sat on the floor for many hours hand-feeding wet cat food to this cat to encourage her to eat and this one, is her second favorite! But, check the price locally. I can get this down to about thirty-three cents a can when it's on sale and with a coupon. Pretty high here. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Great, daily sencha
review/text: The title really says it all - if you enjoy brewing tea and drink it daily, this is a great everyday sencha. It has a good, clean flavor you can only get from a full leaf tea like this.<br /><br />Now - a thing or two about Rishi's actual brewing instructions. This is the second Rishi tea I've tried, and like the first, the quality is great and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. If you follow Rishi's brewing instructions, however, you will get an overly potent, undrinkable mess instead of the mild, subtle yet undeniable flavor of a properly brewed green tea. Green tea isn't supposed to taste like the crap you get at Panera or from Lipton - you're not supposed to be assaulted by intense flavor when you drink it. If you follow Rishi's instructions though, that is what will happen and you'll probably end up writing reviews about how it tastes like grass.<br /><br />1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water is beyond overkill. Brewing that for 3-4 minutes is even greater overkill. Like most other full leaf greens, 1 TEASPOON per 8 ounces of water brewed for between 1.5 to 2.5 minutes is what the brewing instructions on this tea should be. If I were to put 3 tablespoons of this stuff in my tetsubin and brew it for 4 minutes. . . I don't even want to know what would come out of the spout.<br /><br />So, 1 teaspoon/8 ounces of water for 1.5 - 2.5 minutes (2.5 is even pushing it) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this. If it's bitter or you feel like you're on a green tea roller coaster, you've brewed it wrong.

review/text: I've had Teavana, Mighty Leaf and many other green Sencha teas, and this one seems the freshest and strongest, but not bitter.  In fact, I can use about 1/2 of this and get the same "oomph" as the other teas.  It REALLY swells up when the water is added.  DELICIOUS. It seems it's less stemmy and more leafy.  Yum.  I'm a green tea lover, and I understand that the Japanese green teas provide more polyphenols than most of the Chinese green teas, and Sencha is one of the best for polyphenols.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: very fresh and clean
review/text: Compared to a number of other brands I have tried, especially ones that aren't loose leaf, the taste of this green tea is simply great. Bright green color, fresh aroma, and a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />As the directions indicate, be careful not to steep the tea for too long and in overly hot water. When I leave the leaves in hot water for over 4 minutes, the color of the tea is no longer a clean green, but rather a yellowish green and it doesn't taste as good. Correctly prepared, it is one of the best green teas I have ever had.<br /><br />I usually bring water to just under a boil and steep the leaves for about 2 minutes. If the water does boil, I pour in some room temperature water and then mix in the boiling water. Using the same leaves, the first cup tastes awesome, the second tastes significantly weaker, and after that I don't really like the flavor anymore.<br />Also, use filtered water of some sort for the water if you can! It tastes much better than using tap water.

Some of the teas I've bought have a weak taste, but this particular tea has a great smell and a strong taste and can be re-steeped 3 times.  The price is high for better sencha, but the price on this Rishi Tea seemed fairly reasonable considering how good the tea tastes.

It is a bit grassy, but not strongly so and does not bother me.<br /><br />Only flaw is its small leaves which make it hard to drink when using my too permissive ceramic strainer. And it's also hard to clean the strainer since the leaves get stuck in it. Other than that, I'd give it 5 stars.

The tea is very easy to prepare. As the canister notes, 3-4 mins steep time at about 180 degrees. Is this the best green tea out there? No, but it could very well be the best on Amazon. Furthermore, Amazon priced this very well and would recommend you purchase it here.<br /><br />If you only drink bagged green tea, you are missing out on this quality sencha tea.

review/text: I have limited experience with sencha but I know what I like, and that is a fresh and somewhat flowery smooth taste.  I ordered this on a chance it would be good and am not disappointed. I followed the directions for water temperature and timing and I think that is important. I was then surprised at some immediate side benefits to drinking a few cups of this each day for the first two weeks I received it.  Without having changed anything else about my diet or health supplements, I noticed a minor skin rash that has plagued e for months began to diminish drastically.  It is not totally gone but is no longer noticeable to the casual observer and it has retreated significantly.  It is worth it for just this benefit alone.  I will reorder it but want to find larger quantities i the hope of getting a better price per ounce.

I wasn't expecting the natural sweetness to it, it's almost weird and grassy to me.  This probably means it's better and I just need to get used to it.  Heed the warnings to not steep too long - the bitterness makes it quite awful.  I was, however, able to save that first pot by diluting it and drinking it iced after adding sweetener and lemon.

review/text: So I have never tried Sencha before. Maybe it is just a "type" of green tea that I am not used to, but one thing is for sure, I am fanatical about my green tea. I've tried most of the premium brands at the premium stores, but never tasted a sencha like this before.<br /><br />Mine tasted like grass. No, I'm not stretching the truth; I still have it, and I'm considering sending it back. It smells like cut grass, and tastes like cut grass. Maybe I have a defect? Either way, the taste is absolutely putrid for a tea, and I think someone just mowed some grass, and put the clippings in a container.<br /><br />Again, I tried to like it after all of the hype. I steeped at the proper temperature for the proper amount of time, and even tried multiple attempts. Nope, tastes/looks/smells like grass clippings. Maybe I had the wrong expectation, but yuck.<br /><br />However, I would HIGHLY suggest the Silver Need Organic White produced by Rishi. It is now my favorite tea.

It has a very strong grassy smell and taste like grass too (more like medicine to better describe the taste).  I will need to mix this tea with some jasmine tea or something to mask the smell and honey to better the taste.  Overall, I think this tea is too expensive at $12 for 2oz.  I'll stick to my two leaves and a bud organic orange sencha from now on.

This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online.

review/summary: Fabulous Zing
review/text: Emeril's Original Essence is a way to add a fabulous zing to vegetables, meat or chicken.  I use it on steamed vegetables in the winter along with a heavy dose of butter, and my taste buds are awakened.  Great taste - use lightly, and the Essence lasts, and lasts, and lasts.  I think I had my last 2.8 oz for about three years.

They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy.

They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++

Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips.

review/text: I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir

They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon.

I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.

review/text: I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.

The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.

review/text: My husband (who, being Mexican, is very picky about his tortilla chips) and I absolutely love these!  The texture is light and crispy, rather than thick and crunchy. He actually usually prefers a very hearty, cruncy chip (Like El Ranchero), but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we're both thilled with them. The bean, rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful, and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that. We go through an embarrassing amount of them.  I never, ever like plain chips, but these I can eat without anything else, although they're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa.  I highly recommend these!

It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties.

The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast.

review/summary: Broken chips but tasty
review/text: I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida.  My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.

review/summary: The best chips ever!!!
review/text: I received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them. I searched high and low, but was unable to find them until I saw them here. I immediately ordered a case. These chips are light, crispy, flavorful, and good for you. I love them with dip, in chili, or just plain. Once you try them, you'll be hooked!

review/text: These chips are truly amazing. They have it all. They're light, crisp, great tasting, nice texture, AND they're all natural... AND low in fat and sodium! Need I say more? I recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store, and couldn't belive my taste buds. That's why I excited why I saw them here on Amazon, and decided to buy a case!

review/text: These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)

review/summary: Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE
review/text: Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of "Yeast Extract".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.

review/text: I love strong tea. I drink it in the morning, I have a cup in the afternoon, and if I'm tired on Friday night, I have a cup before I go out. For the last two years I've been fulfilling my strong tea cravings with Twining's Irish Breakfast Tea- it's strong and has a robust flavor. I never new what I was missing out on until I bought a box of Barry's Tea at World Market last week. Barry's has the most full, satisfying flavor that I've ever experienced in a tea. I can't describe just how wonderful this tea is. If you're a tea drinker, pick up some Barry's Tea ASAP- you won't be disappointed!

review/text: This tea was recommended to me by an Irish tenor--- no joke-at an Irish festival in Pittsburgh,PA about 10 years ago! If you want a rich full flavor, lovely golden/amber color, and great hot or iced tea then this is your tea also. If you want flavor-- add your own orange, mint, etc-- but so good just like it is, I rarely do that. Try it and see-- worth every penny you spend on this tea as it makes twice as much as most other black tea/blends.

review/text: If you're in the same position as I am, and don't live near a Whole Foods or World Market, you might be paying lots of money per box at local or online boutiques. This is the second purchase of Amazon Barry's I've made, and it's been really good. The stuff is fresh, the price is right (especially if you get free shipping), and the tea is Barry's. If you can't drink 6 boxes of 80 bags all on your own, get a friend or two to go in with you

review/summary: Worth a shot
review/text: I have had this for 2 weeks now and have tried various methods of consumption, the tea tastes terrible very bitter, although if you plan to make tea use lots of cinnamon to mask and maybe some honey as well. the best method (for my self) is gelatin capsules. you wont have to deal with any bitterness and this is the only thing that gave me any results. i believe it effects everyone differently, as for my self about 4-5 caps to notice any effect (more caps = greater effect). i had rather long detailed dreams that seemed to be much more real as compared to non-calea dreams. I remember waking up after my first experience with the capsules and having to think really hard to determine weather or not i had just been dreaming or if what had just happened was real. The amount of dreams i experienced in one night with at least 5 caps was double if not triple what i normally have, although no lucid dreams yet and I'm not sure if it helps my ability to lucid dream since it makes my dreams seem even more real. but this did not work right away, and i would not expect any thing super crazy to happen. start off small to gauge your own personal reaction to it and go from there. the effects of this are very subtle, but it will change your dreams I'm sure of it.

review/summary: No lucidity but MAJOR increase in dream recall and vividness!
review/text: I would take a tablespoon of the tincture and 1 Galantamind 8mg pill after about 4 or 5 hours of sleep and I started having extremely vivid and bizarre dreams with fantastic dream recall. I believe this would have induced lucid dreams for me if I was better at realizing I was in a dream. But the dreams were so "real" and vivid that it was tough for me to tell the difference. Definitely not complaining! This is an awesome product. Yes it is bitter, but, it's really not that bad if you just gulp a spoon full and then drink something right after. It also increased the hypnagogic imagery I experienced in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Will recommend and buy again!

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I've been using this product for almost a week now. Though I haven't a true Lucid Dream with it (yet!), I have noticed how much more vivid my dreams have become. I use about 2 droppers full in my cup of tea before bed (1/2 hour to 45 minutes prior to lying down), have no problems getting to sleep within 10-15 minutes, and wake up fully rested with no side effects whatsoever. I have been trying to compile my own dream dictionary for the past couple of years, but tend to have a hard time remembering most of the details from my dreams. Not a problem, since I've started using this product. If you're trying to get more out of your dreams, DEFINITELY give this product a try.

I have never ordered from this company & was a little nervous ordering over ocean, however my order came very quickly, was very well packaged, and the bottles are of good study quality. Price is also good for the 4oz & I didn't have to pay shipping w/ my order.<br /><br />I have had long term sleep issues and got these to help & they do seem to be helping - these are used in combo w/ Passion  Flower & 5HTP, which is a combo that I have created for my specific needs. I do put them all in a glass and add just a smidge of water to help them go down.<br /><br />I will buy more from this company - I like the variety they offer & the practices advertised.

review/text: I've only taken this product once as I recieved it two days ago. I must say that while I wasn't able to achieve lucidity just yet (I've only achieved this once and it was without the extract, several months ago- One of the reasons I was looking into this herb) my dream recall was much better. The dream was certainly more vivid, and I can see that with more practice this (Although admittedly vile tasting and smelling) herb extract will be a valuable tool for me. Thanks

review/summary: works, but it takes alot
review/text: Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep.

review/summary: A waste of money and time for me...BUYER BEWARE!
review/text: So, I have never been moved to write a negative review for Amazon but felt forced to with this waste of money and time...Having been a person who has had vivid dreams in the past and keeps a daily dream journal, I was very excited to receive this herb after all that I have read. The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly. BUYER BEWARE!

review/summary: Best Dog Food Available
review/text: My 16 year old german shepherd mix scratched all the fur off her abdomen. We brought her to the vets and nothing worked. Switched to Avoderm Baked Lamb and Brown Rice and she stopped scratching and the fur came back gradually until now she is back to normal. She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10-15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them. The ingredients in this dog food are baked lamb (not lamb meal) and the preservative is vitamin e rather than artificial preservatives. This is the only dog food that works well with all our dogs. I have only found one other prepared dog food with as much or more protein per mass. I am not even sure that advertised claim is accurate. Although the price is high, the dogs eat less of this than regular dog food, so it really does not cost as much more as it seems.<br />Amazon has the cheapest price and very fresh product, but I prefer to support local pet stores and purchase it locally when it is available.

review/text: We use this food for our two Welsh Corgis.  One has food allergies so he can't have any chicken.  The other has a slightly sensitive stomach so the non-baked version of this didn't work for her.  The food is about a half inch in diameter so it forces them to chew rather than gulp it down like they tend to like to do even for smaller dogs. They love it.  We think it's a better grade than most non-super-premium foods without all of the hype.  They're skin and coats are perfect with this food too.  This is on my regular re-order list.

review/summary: The best I've tried so far.
review/text: I really like this coffee substitute's flavor, but I could do without the hint of red chilies. This blend has a lot going for it, though. It brews really strong! So you don't need to use a lot. I use one tablespoon to a 15-oz mug! This is definitely a mocha, so coffee purists may not like it much. It has no aftertaste. Very smooth and rich flavor. After you kick your caffeine monkey, you will not miss coffee much with this alternative. So, it tastes great, rich, smooth, with no aftertaste, and it's economical. I'm going to try their mocha, which has no chilies in it. That should be just perfect. I have not tried some of the others as yet, so maybe I'll like one of them better, but I have a feeling that this will stay my favorite, since I like flavored coffees better than straight, unless its Guatemalan, which I love but can't drink anymore!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: After my doctor said no more coffee, not even decaf, I gave this a try.  We have a home espresso machine and a daily latte is part of my morning routine.  While this doesn't taste just like coffee, it is really good in its own way.  It has a deep, rich flavor like coffee, that tea just doesn't have.  I tried making tea lattes as a substitute at first, and they just didn't cut it.  Honestly, I would sometimes pick this over coffee.  It is really good.  The chocolate flavor is delicious.<br /><br />I put two Tbsp of this in my portafilter and pull a shot as normal.  You do need to scrub out your filter a bit afterwards and your portafilter needs to be completely dry before putting the teeccino in or it will stick together in a clump and the shot will not pull right.  It is stickier than coffee.  I also enjoy this as an iced latte.  For an extra treat, put a Tbsp or two of cocoa powder into the bottom of your glass, mix with the shot, then add milk and sweetener of choice, make a great iced mocha.  I use coconut palm sugar, which when mixed with steamed milk creates a kind of marshmallowy taste.  Combined with the teeccino, yum!

review/text: If you're buying this to break your coffee habit - this is a great way to start. Just mix some into your coffee to get started until your drinking just teeccino.The stuff tastes great - similar to but better than coffee. They say that it's actually good for you. I think it probably is. It has potassium and some other nutrients. The only downside is that I think that it probably still stains your teeth like coffee. And that it tastes so good (without the guilt) that you may even drink it more than coffee.

review/text: YUM. Really, I can see how people use this as a replacement for coffee. I think it tastes similar, but not really just like coffee. It is incredibly tasty, though. I have only tried this flavor, as the spicy chocolate was right up my alley. It isn't all that spicy when prepared, though, unless you make it uber-strong. I made the mistake of getting this package-- didn't realize it was the espresso grind--it is pretty fine, and I was using a strainer at first and now a french press, neither of which removes all the tiniest particles. It works just fine in a drip coffee maker, though--I tested it with my mom's. I would get the coarse ground next time, though, since I don't have a drip coffee maker. Other than that user error issue, it's a great product. Sweet, nice collage of flavors, with a similar depth and viscosity to coffee.

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: I have arthritis and have searched for a decent coffee replacement for years.  The Maya Chocolate hits the spot. The chicory gives it the bitter note needed, the toasted almonds add depth, while the chocolate tempers the chicory and adds fullness to the flavor. Whoa. Sounds like I am reviewing a great coffee...LOL! Good Stuff Manard, give it a go!

review/summary: Beware... It has "hint of heat from chiles" in it.
review/text: It is not fair to say I give this product one star as I haven't even tried it, but the label states that it has "hint of heat from chiles" in it. I can not eat anything with chile in it and would not have ordered it if it had been indicated on the web site. If you like a bit of heat you may love this and give it a 5star rating, just be aware.

review/summary: Great for kids with ADD/ADHD
review/text: This is the only one that Hawaiian Punch makes that does not have the red or yellow dyes in it. It is great for kids, or anyone, with ADD or ADHD. However, it is very hard to find in stock. I try to get it at Wal-mart, because there it is $.94 cents a box, 8 packets per box, and it is sugar free. Compared to Crystal Light that have 10 per box at $1.50 and not all are sugar free. The price on here is kind of high, but it is well worth it if you can't get it anywhere else.

review/summary: Sweeter then I expected, great for people that enjoy a sweet dill pickle
review/text: This may simply show that I was ignorant as to what a Polish dill pickle would be, but I was expecting something closer to a kosher dill, like let's say what's produced by Claussen or maybe Vlassic. Instead, these almost remind me more of a bread and butter pickle, sugar is used in the brine along with garlic and dill.<br /><br />Having said that for those that like a sweeter pickle instead of a more sour dill this would easily be a five star product, since it was my mistake to buy the wrong type of Polish pickle I'll still rate this product 5 stars. What impressed me even more is that the only ingredents were the cucumbers, vinegar, water sugar, dill and whatever other spices were used in the brine, no preservtives were used at all. So for those wanting a true all natural product, this is it.<br /><br />Addendum:  To clairfy, I looked up polish dill pickles on a couple sites, and I have to admit it was due to myself being clueless.  There are some that are more like what I wanted, then some like this product.  So, I should have researched the difference.  I'm going to raise the review to five stars since the mistake was all mine, I previously did have it at four stars.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was unsure about ordering this product because I didn't quite understand what it was. But, after a little nudging from a friend I bought it and I LOVED it. I personally use it as a pizza crust because it is much healthier than the ones you can buy at the store! But I also make it thicker and cube it up for a delicious protein in my salad. The Traditional is most versatile, but also be sure to try the Chili flavor if you like a little spice!
