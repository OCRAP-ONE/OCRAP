review/summary: DOUBLED IN PRICE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
review/text: The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online.

review/summary: Ritrovo Balsamic Vinegar - Delicious
review/text: This is a delicious, thick, sweet balsamic vinegar.  I have been using it exclusively for a couple years.  I first found it in a local gourmet shop for $32 and later found it at Whole Foods for $26 and then by chance, a manager's special at Metropolitan Market for $17.99.  I was about to order it from Amazon but see there isn't that much of a price savings.  I will keep looking because I love it; it's so delicious.  Sorry, Amazon, you usually beat prices elsewhere but not on this item.  To be fair, it's probably a dollar or two cheaper.

review/text: This is a pleasant balsamic, but only that. It has a pronounced flavor profile that begins enjoyably enough, but becomes reminiscent of molasses or burnt caramel. I wonder at the methods used to create it's silkiness and body, especially given its youthful age. As another reviewer mentioned, it tastes cooked. It's a decent balsamic, there are simply better choices available for the price.

review/text: The Ritrovo balsamic (same vinegar, new name) is a thick, viscuous vinegar that finds a way to accomplish what no 6 year old vinegar should have any business doing- being on the same level as a fine 15-20 year aged balsamic. No shortcuts are taken, like adding figs for sweetness and thickening Don't be thrown off by the price at first glance; for the quality here, you're getting a tremendous bargain. It's miles beyond the supermarket fodder and good enough to hold its own against all but the finest old balsamics.

review/summary: Incredible value
review/text: Provided you aren't a staunch traditionalist, this vinegar is astonishingly good, especially for the price. Maletti has figured out how to produce a 6 year-old vinegar with the density and concentration of much older, far more expensive fully traditional balsamics without resorting to obvious cheats like adding sweeteners and thickening agents. It's pure and unadulterated; wonderful over bruschette caprese (our favorite), salads, beef, whatever. It's affordable enough to experiment!

review/summary: The gift that got noticed
review/text: These nuts were purchased for an elderly uncle who is hard to please. Most of my gifts have bearly gotten a grunt out of him, including the deluxe mixed nuts from another company that I selected last year. I guess it pays to buy Planters. I won't say he raved about the nuts (raving is just not his style) but the cannister of nuts that he polished off in less than two weeks was a pretty good indication that he liked them. He is already well into the second cannister and is making hints that he'd like the same thing for Christmas. Whew, I won't have to wrack my brain for another gift idea. Nice, too, to pick a gift that has good nutritional value.

review/summary: Great Healthy Snack
review/text: It's a tub of mixed nuts, I'll spare you a long-winded review on them. I've tried the mixed nuts they sell locally, which have a lot of peanuts mixed in, and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable. These are much firmer, fresher, and just taste overall better. It seems the filler nut they used here were almonds, which is fine, and certainly better then peanuts, but it's unfortunate that pecans are scarce. Brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well, with moderate amounts of hazelnut (Filbert) and cashew. You get a lot of salt near the bottom, naturally, but otherwise there's just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone looking for a mixed nut snack. Much better than the rest I've tried so far.

review/text: I received these nuts in the mail with a SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE subscription and they arrived FAST even though I am overseas; approximately 6 DAYS. The NUTS are HUMONGOUS, if you want a MIX with no peanuts then this is the one to order and the SIZE will have you munching for at least a couple of weeks depending on how much you eat and I am constantly snacking on these daily. I bought some cranberries through AMAZON as well and the mix is PERFECTO. It includes almonds, HUGE cashews(MY FAVORITE), pecans, brazil nuts and hazelnuts. I dont really care for the other so called MIXED NUTS because they usually have like 50 - 70% peanuts but this has absolutely ZERO and I love it. I would recommend these because they are delicious and the quality of these nuts are worth every penny.

review/summary: My DH and I Love these !!
review/text: I have been trying to find nuts to suit my husbands taste ...that I also could enjoy. He only eats certain nuts and I love the ones that he won't eat. I have tried several different brands and styles.<br /><br />Well, I ordered these PLANTERS DELUXE MIXED NUTS. I liked the size  2lb+......I could see the cashews that I love and the Brazil nuts that Mr. loves. PERFECT !!<br /><br />This worked out so well. My husband was overjoyed about the nuts. The container was excellent --because it allowed you to pour some out and be able to close the lid to airtight again. The nuts stayed fresh all the time that we were eating them.<br /><br />The selection  and characteristics of these  nuts were excellent.  I believe because they are listed as DELUXE ...the nuts were of a very good size. No tiny pieces of walnuts or other nuts here. All good size delectible pieces.<br /><br />I am also happy about the change to sea salt that Planters made a while ago. I think it enhances the flavor of the nuts.<br /><br />The flavor of Planters Nuts is very good ! My husband prefers this sort of preparations as opposed to some of the other dry roasting methods---he feels the other  dry roasting leaves the nuts too dry.He will not touch the straight dried more natural methods with no salt or oil added to them--- as he feels the finish of them is just  too hard and dry and tasteless. So if you want the flavorful---great tasting--smooth biting--nuts---- GET THESE !!!!!<br /><br />We are only two people eating these nuts unless we have company over---so I can suggest that these  nuts would be great for small familys or large familys....or even singles....because of their  airtight packaging...and easily removed airtight lids.

review/summary: stale
review/text: I found this a few days ago when I was looking for a good snack to have around the house for not a whole lot of money.  The package came today.  I opened it up and had a few nuts.  they were chewy and smelled a bit off- both signs of staleness.  I checked the expiration date: 6/17/2012... It didn't make sense.  so I had a few more and wondered how I could make them palatable.  Eventually I came across some forums that said that staleness in nuts was the result of the oil turning rancid and hence is non-reversible.  Not to be defeated by something i bought to save money I did some more digging and found a forum that said that if you heat nuts at 350 for 10 minutes you can bring some life back into them.  I tried it and they came out burnt.  Tried again for 5 minutes instead of 10 and it worked.  They weren't perfect but they were crunchy and palatable which was a step up.  I give these 2 stars instead of 1 since they can be partially salvaged.  Too bad Amazon doesn't take returns on food.<br /><br />edit:<br />I just threw up.  I'm throwing these out and changing the review to one star.  Don't buy these if you value your GI tract.

review/summary: Durkee French's Pan Rich Brown Gravy
review/text: Durkee is a brand that I trust and have never had a problem with.  This however I purchased because the picture shows what looks like a tall slender plastic bottle that I thought would have a flip top plastic lift area to pour from.,, so I could use small amounts from the pantry as needed.  Instead, the product came in one paper type package that does not reseal itself.  of course I will use a sealed plastic container to store....but I will not take another chance of ordering related to the product pictured as opposed to what was delivered.

review/summary: My favorite baking flour
review/text: I love to cook and bake, and I experiment with a lot of kinds of flours. This is my standard though whenever I'm working on a new recipe.<br />It's very finely ground and works gorgeously in everything I've tried it with so far. In yeast breads it creates a nice fine textured bread. In baking powder/baking soda recipes like biscuits or cakes it's perfect. It's so light that it rises very well.<br />Last time I made dumplings using this flour, they got so light and fluffy they nearly came out of my pot. I use a combination of baking powder and baking soda in my dumplings with just a touch of vinegar in the wet ingredients for the baking powder and baking soda to work with, that technique combined with this light flour made them rise very well.<br />The flavor is nice if you like whole wheat.

review/text: For pastry type baking, pie crust, fluffy pancakes, brownies, etc. this is a really nice flour.  It works well with any recipe calling for baking powder and/or soda since it is very light. No need to mix whole wheat and white, just use this 100% stone ground flour. The yogurt pancakes on the bag are terrific.

review/text: I bought this basket as a gift. The receivers loved the presentation, the products, the idea behind the Project, and especially the personal touches, as the names and stories of the women who had contributed to it. I had omitted a card to go with it, and so my friends didn't know who had sent it. My fault. They called the company, but they were not able to find who the sender was, even with the order number. Maybe Amazon keeps the name of the customer? Or they don't have a good data base? Eventually, I asked these friends if they had gotten the present, and we had a good laugh over my absent mind! So, order the products, but don't forget to include a card if it's for a gift!

review/summary: Have never seen a cat who wouldn't gobble this up!
review/text: Fancy Feast Appetizers are always a hit and the Chicken and Beef flavor seems to be the favorite. The price is the same as I pay at the grocery store (and LESS than Petco) and it is delivered to my door. I get it on Subscribe and Save to save even more. I like the fact that there are only a very few ingredients - not full of fillers or too many weird things you can't pronounce. My elderly cat has Chronic Renal Failure and this is great for her. Low protein (12%) and high water content (85%) and not a lot of extra ingredients for her kidneys to process. The vet only gave her 1 year when she was first diagnosed and that was a year and a half ago and her bloodwork has remained the same and has not gotten worse and she has been given another year or hopefully longer. She said whatever I am doing is working and I truly believe that feeding her the limited ingredient Fancy Feast Beef and Chicken Appetizers (no fish flavors though) has a lot to do with it. If you have a picky eater you can not go wrong with this stuff, cats LOVE it!!

review/summary: Wonderful, moist & soft food for cats--my cat loves this!
review/text: This is my kitten's absolute favorite flavor of any Fancy Feast product. Though it says it's only 12% protein on the package, that is a higher protein content than most of the regular canned Fancy Feast products.  This also contains a lot of water, which is important, since most cats don't drink enough water. I do think this is much better nutritionally than any canned F.F. products, and my kitten eats this flavor up very fast. Definitely worth the money!

review/text: Ideally I wanted to reproduce mesquite shavings that were in a steak seasoning that I had purchased from Costco - of course it was a great product and as always Costco stops stocking those items.  I searched for four months to find mesquite in other than a powder form but was unable.  In the end the powder works well for seasoning and in some ways it is better than the shavings.<br /><br />This powder is very strong flavored, so a small amount gives a powerful mesquite taste - which is good since the jar will last a long time.

This is a brand and flavor that my dog eats regularly, which we purchase from PetCo and have purchased in the past from Amazon.  He has never had any problem with it until this case.  Some of the cans were dented and I believe it must have been exposed to high heat or something.  I've thrown out can after can that has caused him to be ill.  I have waited several days before trying another can, and again, the same thing.  He has been throwing up all day.  I will never purchased canned food from Amazon again.

review/summary: Different bag; different food
review/text: I have been buying Friskies dry cat food, mainly their seafood flavor but sometimes others, for 4+ years. My cats liked the taste and for the cheap price compared to others I was satisfied.<br />Until they changed the bag design, that is. I say bag because that is what the label said. "different bag, same great taste" or something like that.  When I picked the bag up from Target, I had expected to see the same food I had always bought.  When I opened it, I quickly realized this was not the same food.  The shapes were the same, but the colors were noticeably brighter and more vibrant.  It was eye-appealing, but apparently not taste-appealing.<br /><br />My cats barely touched it, one of them didn't eat it at all.  And when they munched it down reluctantly, they threw up and got diarrhea. ALL of them. We had to throw the junk out and buy a bag of something else.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my lack of money has forced be to purchase Friskies on and off frequently over the past year, though I no longer buy that flavor, OR the flavor of the bright orange bag. The other flavors seem a bit milder, and the cats only throw up every once in awhile, though they still get cases of diarrhea too often. If I had enough money I'd check them out at the vet (along with getting the cat-food tested).  Recently though I found another bag of dried cat-food that was a bit cheaper than Friskies and there's been a definite improvement in their stools since they tried it. No one has thrown-up. I may just stick with this one.<br /><br />I've looked up information about Friskies, and while I never expected them to be top-quality for the cheap price, I was more or less disturbed by the constant complaints customers had.  Almost every site I looked at concerning Friskies had people saying their cats died or were throwing up/getting diarrhea. Calling the company does little good, as their standard reply seems to be: "orly? This is first we've ever heard about it!"

review/text: This is a classic product to me. The flavor is like a Mary Jane candy, only it's low sugar, less chewy, and has a touch of ginger bite. I love ginger and peanut together in asian food, and it works very well here. They should just call it peanut ginger, as it has bits of peanut in it, no PB texture. They're too pure and healthy to be considered candy. I pop them to soothe my stomach, to help digest a big meal, or to curb hunger-- as it's all real food. It's a talented little product. If they get warm in your pocket they get delectably soft and nearly melt in your mouth. This is candy for grown-ups. I think they should be a staple in all stores, right next to the life savers. Maybe if they get more known, they'll get cheaper!

review/summary: but it's just a malted milk ball
review/text: Boy are these things good.  The innards melt down into pure sweetness, not unlike a mouthful of cotton candy, an irregular but constant reward for any consumer with the patience to allow it break down at it's own rate.<br /><br />Here's what I do.  I bite off the top quarter or so, munch it, then let the remaining milk ball rest flat side down on my tongue, to dissolve from the inside out, leaving the last lingering tastes of maltose to be quickly chased by the collapsing chocolate outside.  If you get really good, you can stick these in the freezer before hand and then really test how patiently you can eat these.  With practice you can enjoy a single whopper for 30 minutes.<br /><br />I just saw a recipe on the internet:  Crush up about 8 oz. of malted milk balls, mix it with 8 oz. of cool whip and a pint of vanilla ice cream, poor it on a graham cracker crust.  Sounds like something my grandmother would do, but I bet it's good.<br /><br />Buy Hershey's Whoppers.  They got it right.  Just the right mix.  Not too heavy on the chocolate.  You can find fancier, more expensive gourmet malted milk balls, but they don't improve on the basic Hershey's Whopper.  Thank you for listening.<br /><br />Kids: always brush your teeth after eating candy and visit your dentist regularly.

review/summary: Very nice for a sugar-free product!
review/text: My husband found this sugar-free chocolate with hazelnuts at a German deli here in town. It's made in Croatia, of all places. I'm a chocolate fiend and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur. Since going low-carb, no sugar, I have sampled all kinds of sugar-free chocolate. This one is pretty good. The hazelnuts are chopped and add a lot to the flavor. The chocolate flavor is light and not real chocolate-y (which I would like) but it is still tasty. I like that the sweetness is not overpowering. I've noticed that many sugar-free products from Europe are not as sweet as here in the US and they are much better, they don't knock you over with maltitol. The price is reasonable and fair. There are some truly crummy and awful sugar-free chocolate items for sale out there but this is NOT one of them. It's not a product to swoon over but it's a pretty good substitute when you want a chocolate treat at a good price. I hope you try it and like it.

review/summary: Phenomenal Sauce for Cooking & Seasoning! Spice it Up!
review/text: Unlike most bottles of 'hot sauce' Tiger Sauce tends to be flavorful without melting inside skin of your mouth away. Rare? Indeed. I first experimented with this cooking sauce when I discovered the Asian art of wok cooking and making home made stir fry.<br /><br />Like your food with a tinge of heat and LOTS of flavor? Then THIS is the cooking sauce you'll grab again and again for all of your cooking needs. It's good to add into stir fry, fried rice, soups, stews, chili or for when you wish to sautee some meat such as chicken, pork or shrimp. (While it's ok for beef, I find that beef tends to soak this sauce up more so than chicken, shrimp or pork does).<br /><br />How much to use? Let your conscious be your guide! But to start with I'd use no more than a tablespoon of it with some cut up chicken chunks in the pan. Figure you're going to use 2 T of peanut or sesame oil to coat your wok/pan with to cook your meat and then when the meat begins to brown on the outside, just pour in the Tiger Sauce and let that sizzle in and flavor the meat.<br /><br />This sauce is also good as a marinade that you can use for any meat as well.<br /><br />Give it a shot. I think you'll be as happy as I am with it!

review/summary: the BEST sauce ever created
review/text: I been hooked on this sauce for about 12 years now, ever since my dad randomly bought it from Shop Rite. I've got to say, its not so much hot as it is flavorful. It has a kick to it, but it is also savery. I put it on corn, potatoes, meat, chicken, fish, and in PASTA dishes. My mom thinks it is really gross even after all this time that we still drench everything in it. My taste buds are still intact as well! This is my secret sauce that I wont even tell my fiancee because it is too good to be true. It is very hard to find in stores, but the original Shop Rite he bought it from still has it to this day (Maybe because we buy every single bottle) it cost about 2.50-3.00 for a single bottle. Tobasco Sauce eat your heart out. Tiger Sauce all the way!

review/summary: Best Sauce Ever! No Lie...
review/text: It was about 2 months ago when I was in the aisle with the hot sauces. I came across this bottle that said Try Me - Tiger Sauce. I grabbed it, contemplating whether I was going to buy it or not. Well, it ended up in the cart by mistake and made it my way home. I first tried it with my home-made chilli and it was AMAZING! This sauce is not like others and it full of flavour. Ever since than I've consumed 4 bottles of it. As I type I have added some onto my spaghetti. It's a must have for every dish!

review/summary: Tiger Sauce Addict
review/text: HELP!!<br />HEEELLP!!<br />I'm addicted!<br />I'm a Tiger-holic! I've been drinking 3 bottles a day!<br />Just kidding..<br />Seriously though... I agree with the guy that said this is the best sauce ever created. No hesitation and no doubt about it. It's completely true, if you doubt that, then you've never tried it. For those that worry about it being hot, it's not very hot. But the flavor is AMAZING!!! Tobasco sucks compared to this stuff. Infact I think if the world would just give it a try all of the Tobasco bottles you see on resturant tables everywhere would be replaced by Tiger Sauce. My on complaint is that it's hard to find. You can't get it at Walmart or Target. On rare occasion you can find it at Cub but I have the best luck finding it at certain Rainbow Foods stores and a couple of other more high end stores. Usually when I see it I buy every bottle the store has. (This is not a joke or exaggeration.)

review/summary: The Roar of a Jungle Cat and the Purr of a Kitten
review/text: I first tried TIGER SAUCE during Lent. On Fridays, I only eat fish and I usually use tartar sauce with my fish. While I was at the grocery store picking up some pollock, I saw a 5 oz. bottle of TIGER SAUCE and decided to give it a try instead. I love this stuff! It's got an almost perfect blend between hot and sweet. It won't burn your mouth, but there is a bit of a kick. At the same time, there is a sweety flavor that lingers in one's mouth after the hot sauce kick is gone. It has the roar of a jungle cat, mixed with the purr of a kitten. I'm going to start using TIGER SAUCE on all sorts of other foods from now on. Use it as a marinade for grilled chicken or pour it into a pot of chili. It's all good. Try it and you shouldn't be disappointed.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I absolutely love this sauce. The flavor goes well with pretty much ANY dish (pizza, meat, potatoes, seafood, chicken, stir fries, rice, ramen.. you name it!) The local grocery store no longer carries it, so I'm looking online to restock. The $9.25 listed price as i write this review is WAY too high, (2-3 bucks for the 5 oz bottle is about fair), so I'll look elsewhere to purchase it.<br />The color of the sauce is very appetizing. The heat is pretty mild (half the heat of Sriracha, maybe?!), but a completely different (and arguably better) flavor profile. Some reviewers have noted a sweet/sour profile, and I would definitely vouch for that. It provides a ton of flavor in the foods to which it is added, but it doesn't overpower.<br />I have a much higher tolerance for heat than any of my friends, but never have i hesitated to suggest they try this. I've recommended this sauce to a number of friends and they're all addicted (when the grocery store had a closeout sale of the remaining bottles, one buddy bought 8!).<br />I can't wait to get some more of this stuff!

review/text: Let me qualify this by saying up front my family is Cajun and we like spicy food.  Tabasco is required on Cajun tables but Tiger Sauce is the go to sauce at my house.  Everybody likes it.  It has a kick but it's not too hot.  I use it on many things but probably my favorite is on sandwiches.  Tiger sauce on pastrami and swiss or a fried shrimp poyboy is delicious.  My family loves Tiger Wings.  Mix equal parts melted butter and Tiger Sauce together and baste wings on the grill.  They are delicious without being too spicy.  We also use it as a dipping sauce for many things. Try it, You'll like it.

review/text: I usually buy this at my neighborhood grocery story - where it costs over $4. Whole Foods stocks it in the dairy case and their price is better. The price here is even better than that!<br />  This is like a tart smooth yogurt. Tart, not milky. Greek style yogurt has become very popular lately because it is tart and thick, not milky and thickened with gelatin, etc.<br />  By those standards, everyone should be drinking kefir because if you like that taste, and I do, you'll love this.<br />  I usually can't keep the bottle in the fridge. I just drink at least half of it as soon as I get it. It's as refreshing and cooling as buttermilk in the summer. It has lots of healthy probiotics (helpful bacillus) that are good for your health but I'd drink it just for the taste and nothing else!

review/summary: Still the Best
review/text: Since moving to Ohio from Boston (where I was able to purchase this in a Cambridge gourmet grocery) I have been searching for Siljans hardtack. Given the demands on my time, ordering it from Amazon was a real bargain. Siljans is by far and away the best crispbread with full rye taste and without the slightly bitter aftertaste some of the other brands have. Try it with cold cuts, a slice of cheese and a slice of tomato on top (my favorite is Boar's Head lower sodium ham, Boar's head havarti and a slice of Campari tomato)--heaven! Or just some soft butter! This is far and away the best kn&auml;ckebr&ouml;d out there. You won't be disappointed. I was VERY sad when Ikea switched brands, but in my current midwest location, there are few Ikea stores within easy driving distance, and with gas prices lately, the shipping and time saved make this a bargain.

I order packs for my son's as stocking stuffers. 75% of my consumption is with peanut butter, the rest with cream cheese or chedder. As a youth we had a local market owned by a Swede and he always stocked a brand called Majornas? It had a picture of a girl in traditional garb holding a shock of rye. This brand was great but I have not seen it for 25 years, I now believe Siljans is even better. Other rye crisps do NOT compare. Our nearest Ikea is 50+ miles so buying on Amazon from this seller is really great. The product arrives fast and fresh. And yes, it really helps with irregularity. My wife suffers with it, but since our shipment arrived she has been very much "relieved". I did not inherit the cravings for Spaga Sill and other tortured fish concoctions as toppings but I have to have my Siljans Knackebrod (Connec-eh-bro). Amazon's subscription offers make buying often easy and inexpensive.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised...
review/text: They're huge!  You definetely get what you pay for.  Love the taste...not gritty at all.  Make sure you have storage containers available -- you will need to break it up into pieces.  The packaging they come in is not resealable.

review/summary: Crisp bread
review/text: This is excellent crisp bread.  It's so healthy with so much fiber. It keeps forever. The price is better than the grocery store.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I grew up eating this as a kid.  My mom always had a package in the cupboard set aside as a treat, but when she would go looking for it I'd have already eaten it.  I hadn't seen it for many years but found it in a local grocery store when looking for a low carb and high fiber alternative to regular bread after being diagnosed with diabetes.<br /><br />Nice to see it here on Amazon at about 60% of the local store price.

review/summary: Great carb substitute
review/text: Siljans knackebrod has been my complex carbohydrate mainstay for over 6 years.  Recently, the only food store in our area that carried it closed down.  When I found it on Amazon I was elated and ordered 5 2-packs.  They shipped it immediately.  The product helped me lose 65 lbs and keep it off.<br /><br />Hal Youngren

review/summary: my personal favorite crisp bread
review/text: I enjoy the many varieties of crisp bread, but always come back to Siljans for the taste and texture. If you like crisp bread but never tried Siljans, you are missing out.  Admittedly, the package size is a bit awkward to stash somewhere, but that is part of the unique charm of this brand.
