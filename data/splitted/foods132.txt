review/summary: Its a pleasant fizz
review/text: The names of these juice drinks rarely really reflect the majority of what is actually in them.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I've never heard of acerola and I want to know what the "natural flavors" are.  Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the "flavor".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?  (BTW I have this gripe about most nutrition labels).<br /><br />So, its a good drink, probably good for you and definitely better than soda.

review/summary: Sweet sweet Kiwi Berry
review/text: The Kiwi Berry drink may not have sugar addded, but it sure tastes sweet. Part of it may be the other fruit jucices mixed in (Apple, Grape, Raspberry, and Strawberry)with more Apple and Grape than Kiwi. For me it was too sweet and did not taste too much like Kiwi fruit.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor
review/text: Switch Kiwi Berry is quite delicious, the flavor is very enjoyable.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have with this product is the addition of "natural flavors" which unfortunately is a very misleading term and can be very unhealthy substances but we don't know what they might be hidden under this generic term the government allows manufacturers to use.<br /><br />Still, from the ingredient list, this appears to be far healthier than almost all carbonated drinks currently being sold.

review/summary: Tastes pretty good, BUT....
review/text: We got this in the mail and were eager to try it.  I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.<br /><br />TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.<br /><br />BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.<br /><br />VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just aren't there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.  Save your money

review/text: As the title says I'm not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks.

review/summary: Strike Three... you're out!
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br /><br />After tasting "The Switch" in Black Cherry, I was a little reluctant to even try the Kiwi Berry flavor. At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the "Switch" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also. Both during and after you swallow it.

review/summary: A more portable Switch
review/text: One of my friends and her daughter are big fans of The Switch line of drinks because it feels like drinking Hi-C or Koolaid etc, without the sugar or high fructose corn syrup that is in just about every prepackaged drink.<br /><br />While it is encouraging to make something out of 100% juice, I find this to be too sweet. I can taste the kiwi and strawberry, but overall am put off by its sweet taste. I would suggest buying a single or smaller pack before investing in a case of 24. Having said this, the 8.3 ounce can would be perfect for lunches without the problems of the bottle version.

review/summary: 100% Vitamin C but 34g. of sugar.
review/text: I have long believed that you can get anyone to drink anything as long as you add enough sugar to it.  And this drink is proof of that.  It's 100% vitamin C but 34grams of sugar.  I actually think it would taste better if it were not carbonated.  It's just a juice pouch with carbonation.<br /><br />I really liked it, my kids really liked it and it was a very tasty drink.  But again, 34 grams of sugar, wow.  It's also only 8 ounces.  I tried the strawberry kiwi, it left a syrupy taste in my mouth.  I would not purchase again, just because of the sugar level.  If you disregard than it is a good drink nevertheless.

review/text: When my daughter saw that I had a can of this to try out, she said, "Oh, you have Switch!"  Apparently it's her school's answer to soda.<br /><br />I really liked this product.  It's a very small can, but for the same calorie content as a similar amount of soda, one can have a carbonated beverage that doesn't have added sugar and has some vitamin benefits as well (100% of vitamin C).<br /><br />It was not too sweet, and the flavor was not too strong.  Normally strawberry kiwi is NOT my favorite flavor combination, but I'm glad I tried it.  I would definitely try it again.

Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Kiwi Berry flavor in particular tastes great.

While it has no added sugar or corn syrup, there are plenty of calories (135 for an 8.3 ounce can) and carbs. Also, looking at the price, I think it is way too expensive-almost a dollar a can.

review/summary: Good Tasting but Not Great
review/text: Switch promises "A perfect balance between juice and carbonation" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.  And it is a bonus that it is 100% Juice with no sugar added and no preservatives<br /><br />My main drawback is the can as the tall thin can is a little too small and regular soda cans that are shorter and thicker and stream out better than the taller, thinner ones like Switch.

review/summary: Nothing new here. . .but it tastes good.
review/text: Sparkling juices aren't anything new and the Switch simply gives us more of the same. Whether you are drinking Welche's Sparking juice or an Izze, it comes down to flavor, nutrients and cost.<br /><br />Izze flavors are Apple, Pomegranate, Black Cherry, Grapefruit and Clementine.<br />Switch offers Orange, Watermelon, Kiwi-Berry (the flavor I tried), Black Cherry and Fruit punch.<br /><br />Also Izze gives you 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 and Niacin.<br />Switch gives you 100% of your daily vitamin C.<br /><br />Izze currently is $21.62 for 24 cans at 8.4 oz.<br />Switch is currently advertised at about a buck more for 24 cans at only 8.3oz cans.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />With Switch, you pay a similar cost to get more vitamin C and different flavors than offered by the main competitor.<br /><br />Could a vitamin supplement give you more of what you really need? Sure. But it's not nearly as fun as drinking any of these sparking juices.<br /><br />So if you need a more healthy alternative to soda, determine if cost, nutrients and/or flavor is your thing then try a Switch or an Izze.

review/summary: Couldn't really find the Kiwi's or the Strawberries
review/text: Switch's Kiwi Berry drink I found a little on the light side, in many ways.  Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.  While this is 100% juice (from concentrate though) and nicely bubble (I shook mine up prior to drinking, no massive explosion or anything and I'm at altitude), I'd rather drink something something with either a little more flavor or a little more of it.

review/text: I was completely put off by SWITCH KIWI BERRY. Another entry into the already boring sparkling juice market, this flavor not only lacked anything new or interesting, but went a step further in its poor flavor.<br /><br />I didn't really taste kiwi, and the "berry" was bland and unidentifiable (raspberry and strawberry, according to the ingredients list); it was, like most of these juices on the market, mostly apple and grape and not much in the way of uniqueness. In fact, the can I tried actually had a metallic flavor to it--I don't know if it was actually picking up the tang from the container, or if it's just the poor flavor profile of the beverage. I really don't care enough to try it again to find out.<br /><br />Also, I don't know why they're calling this line SWITCH. It's probably a marketing thing--they want people to "switch" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. I won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink.

review/summary: I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry
review/text: Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn't a great combination, so I had the drink by itself and it was much, much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste. Oh, and the can is cool too - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling.

review/text: I tried one 8.3 oz of Switch in Kiwi Berry flavor. The can is very small, about the size of a Red Bull. The drink is said to be 100% juice carbonated, with no sugar added, no preservatives, no corn syrup, no artificial colors and gluten free.<br /><br />Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbs and 33g of sugar. On Amazon, the price comes out to about $1 per can.<br /><br />I like the fact that Switch is all natural, but the sugar content is still quite high (I believe a 12oz can of coke has 40g of sugar). Calories are not to be ignored either. The taste was OK, but not fantastic by any means - very sugary, not enough carbonation. In fact, the Kiwi Berry flavor did remind me of Red Bull as well, which I do not particularly enjoy. I think I'll stick to unsweetened iced tea...

Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation.

review/summary: Tastes like overly sweet apple juice, Trader Joe's version is better
review/text: Summary:  way too sweet, no berry/kiwi flavor, small serving.<br /><br />Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say "no *added* sugar", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying "no sugar" or "no sucrose" (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.

review/text: For someone who cannot resist kiwi-flavored juices, unfortunately, THE SWITCH did not appear to have a kiwi berry taste.  However, the berry half stood out as well as the 100 % carbonated juice and after taste sweetness.  Indeed, this drink will appeal to a younger crowd and those who love a sweet carbonated drink that is not too heavily bubbly as a soft drink or too mild as any fruit juice.  And no doubt, it may satisfy that temporary thirst where drinkers will be switching for more.

review/summary: a little metallic tasting
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry tastes metallic and fake.  Neither my wife nor I could finish off the can because the flavor was so off.  The Watermelon Strawberry flavor was much better.  I couldn't identify any kiwi flavor at all, and the berry flavor did not taste like any berry I have ever eaten.  In fact, strawberry is the very last of the juice concentrates listed.  They mixed apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juices together.  I think having just one juice flavor would have been better because this mix was just bizarre.  Also, the drink contains 135 calories per 8.3 ounce serving.  At that rate, I'd rather have a Coke if I want carbonation or regular juice if I want something fruit flavored.

review/summary: Switch Kiwi Berry
review/text: I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry.  I was looking for an alternative to soda and this really filled that niche for me.  This flavor was very pleasant in my opinion, but that is a personal thing that everyone will have to decide on their own.  The Switch is 100% juice so you can feel good about giving it to your family and it is carbonated so the kids will think they are getting soda, a win win situation! Although it may be a little high in sugar, that is because it is fruit juice, not because it is loaded with corn syrup etc etc.<br />I would recommend this product and feel very comfortable giving it to my grandaughter.

review/text: I loved the Switch Kiwi Berry drink. It really does quench my thirst, leaves no after taste, and is not overly sweet. I hope the company can speed up its distribution of this product inasmuch as it's difficult to find in the grocery stores where I live. I think it's really a healthful drink, and am looking forward to finding it in my local grocery store. Oh, it just occurred to me to phone them and see if they will start carrying the product. Thank you Amazon for providing this product for us to try out.

review/summary: Overly sweet
review/text: This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes, but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor. They would be easily fooled into thinking they're are drinking soda. But for an adult it is overly sweet.

review/text: I have to admit, I liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one, kiwi berry, but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant. Just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness, and I really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar. The small can size is also very handy because it's easy to slip into a bag and it's exactly one serving size. As I mentioned with the other flavor, this drink doesn't have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue--it's very clean and refreshing.

review/summary: Great Extract with Lovely Lemon Flavor
review/text: I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.<br /><br />Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.<br /><br />The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution.

review/summary: My Search Has Ended
review/text: On my third trip to work on Hawai'i (the island), Summer of 2010, I was determined to seek out the best Kona coffee. The $20/lb Morning Thunder at Costco was OK, but really not as good as the Guatemalan or Mexican coffees so common and inexpensive in my area, and certainly nothing to compare to Ethiopian Moka-Sanani, which I felt to be the best when properly roasted.<br />I tried a lot of roasts from small farms, recommended by friends, purchased in small stores, studied on-line...<br />I was getting closer, but the best of it was still a nice light little cup, like Tanzanian peaberry.<br />One day I was visiting some friends of a friend, sort of a community. It was lunchtime, and one of the guys asked if I would like a cup of coffee. I've been disappointed pretty regularly, but something in his eyes told me to say "yes". They poured it out of a big 5# bag and brewed it in a big drip maker.<br />I had no particular expectations, but when I took the first sip I was immediately enchanted.<br />This is very good! I exclaimed. What is it?<br />"This is what we grow here, the B-grade", he said...<br />I have been drinking a cup every morning since then, no matter what the distance, no matter what the price.<br />This is my new "best coffee in the world". There is even more complexity to the art of what they do growing and hand processing (and aging) these beans than you will ever find online. (And they only sell the "A-grade")

review/summary: best kona coffee but must buy direct
review/text: When I saw this listing for Hawaii's wings of the Morning, i was excited, thinking the price would be somewhat reduced. I was just in Maui, where the product runs anywhere from $25-$27 for 12oz whole bean. When asking grocers at local stores which of the kona coffee is best, they all said "Wings of the Morning". I must say I fell in love with kona coffee when trying this brand. I went to their website & found they sell the product for $22 without the cloth bag, & price decreases as you buy more. The shipping is $10 2 day fed ex for 1st package, $2.00 for 2nd, $2 for next 5. They also roast the beans per order! Check out their website: [...].

Over this weekend, i decided to scope out other plant sites. i decided no refund and no replacements. Lesson learned.

review/summary: Just Ask the Cat at the Center of the Universe about Kitty Kaviar
review/text: Mortimer Welch (http://twitter.com/MortimerWelch), who is the cat at the Center of the Universe, says:  "The one thing that would be better than Kitty Kaviar would be if I were the head taster in a sushi restaurant that only served those raw fish thingys."  In fact, Mort includes this passage in his "Lessons For Young Cats" series of lectures:  "First, observe and note where the Kitty Kaviar is kept.  Second, misbehave TERRIBLY.  Third, go to the Kitty Kaviar storage area and bang on the cupboard door, push something over nearby that's loud, wail miserably, WHATEVER.  When the house staff responds by giving you Kitty Kaviar, you must INSTANTLY re-behave and reward them with leg rubbing, head butting, decibel-shattering purrs, etc.  In this way you will eventually train the servants to supply Kitty Kaviar on demand."

review/text: Forget about just using it with milk and hot water, I put it in smoothies even when I put acai and other fruits in. I was just disappointed the way they shipped it, in a USPS Priority Mail envelope. They charge almost $10 for shipping, and I would expect it to come at least in a box, not just squeezed into a thin cardboard envelope. Otherwise, no complaints about the product, delicious.

review/text: I have been using the earlier versions of this product for about 15 years. It was without a doubt the best tasting cheese salsa on the market. I have tried many other brands and they are not very impressive. When I saw Pace Salsa Con Queso back on the market I was very pleased until I tasted it. The flavor and consistency are disgusting compared to the Mexican Four Cheese and original versions. I have contacted Pace without results. I would be embarrassed as well.  I think I will take these cans and smash them against a brick wall. This is just one more sorry replacement for a good product.

review/summary: BEST VARIETY RAVIOLI
review/text: I've purchased the cheese and meat ravioli previously- the cheese is very bland- the meat was a little bland_ but this italian sausage variety is VERY TASTY- and it really does taste like italian sausage- there are even little bits of sausage in the sauce- it's even a little spicy like italian sausage should be. At $1 or less per can with a long shelf life- the ones i ordered in OCT 2011 have a 'use by' date of May 2013- that's more than a 1 1/2 years to eat them- so order lots when the price is low. Would/will buy again.<br />------------------------------------------<br /> added june 14, 2012_in regards to the person who said these are factory rejects and all dented cans i have to say WRONG----i've ordered 3 cases of this italian sausage ravioli and not a single can was dented. i've ordered a couple cases of the mini-beef ravioli and they weren't dented either_ so out of 60 cans- not a single one was dented.

review/summary: Excellent value
review/text: I bought these despite a review saying they were factory seconds because all the cans had dents in them--I hate dented cans, but the price was too good to pass up.  None of the cans in my shipment had any dents at all, so maybe he just got a bad batch.  Anyway, it's 12 cans of pasta, almost a pound each, for 12 bucks and change.  It's relatively low in fat (even if you eat the whole can which is supposed to be two servings), low in cholesterol, and a can is 18 grams of protein with 10 grams of fiber.  Only the sodium is high, though lower than most canned soups.  It's hearty and satisfying, and the filling is spicier than most canned pastas.<br /><br />Folks, you can't beat an entree like that at a buck a can.  Order two cases and it's eligible for free shipping.  They have many other varieties too.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XUJ564">Chef Boyardee Big Overstuffed Italian Sausage Ravioli, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Almost half of cans damaged
review/text: I saw that some folks had problems with damaged cans but many more gave good reviews so I took the risk.  Turns out that 5 out of the 12 cans were dented...and I mean severely dented.  And those were all packed in the center of the shrink wrapped flat so as to hide the dents unless the can was unpacked.  I haven't tried the good product; I'm sure it's fine tasting since I like Chef Boyardee products.  I am very disappointed in Amazon's attempt to hide the damaged cans though.  There is no way those cans were damaged in shipping...the box was perfect.  This was deliberate concealment of damaged goods.

review/summary: Pretty good flavor !  Great price !
review/text: After reading all of the dented can reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I did get 3 dented cans out of the 12- one was a mild ding, one was fair, and one was such that if I'd been picking it out at the grocery store, I would have looked for a different one- I just ate that one first.  Oddly, they were cans that came from the MIDDLE of the case- so something that happened at the manufacturer- NOT Amazon.  The cardboard tray was unscathed.  ConAgra needs to  do a quality control check on their can dinging area.<br /><br />Anyway, the flavor is pretty good. The first bite wasn't impressive, but since I'm on a fixed income, I only throw away stuff that is about to make me hurl, so I kept eating it.  It got better, and I am glad I got the product.  There were 7 ravioli in the whole can. That is a bit skimpy, but since it was going to be the only thing I had, I ate the whole can and was quite satisfied.  The sauce is much more flavorful than the Chef-Boyardee regular beef ravioli that I had as a kid, and tastes more Italian.<br /><br />The WHOLE can has 480 calories, 10 gms of fat, 78 gms of carbs, and 18 gms of protein.  There are also 10 gms of fiber in the whole can.  The serving size says that  the can is about 2 servings.  Hmm.... maybe for a young kid, or if there was a good salad, and fruit on the side, but I have too much pain to make full meals.  I have to make do.  There are 1 1/2 cups of vegetables per can- so that's good.<br /><br />No preservatives or MSG.  Unfortunately, it probably contains GMO sources of soy and wheat.<br /><br />I originally got these to have on hand for power outages, as I have a gas oven and could heat this up.  The expiration date is for 2 years from now, so that's good.  I can keep them in the pantry for such occasions, but can also see being fine with eating them on days when it's just too hard to come up with anything else.

review/summary: The tastiest and most flavorful Chef Boyardee product yet
review/text: I've tried a number of Chef Boyardee products sold through Amazon.  I buy them because they're cheap and convenient. I don't buy them in the expectation of great pasta dishes although it's always nice if one of these products is better than my expectations. The overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli was one that was better than my expectations. Currently, this is my ranking for the products I have actually sampled:<br /><br />1. Overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli<br />2. Jumbo spaghetti and meatballs<br />3. Overstuffed beef ravioli<br />4. Beefaroni with whole grain pasta<br /><br />This product distinguishes itself from things like the Beefaroni by having real identifiable neat. It is better than the beef ravioli because the sausage is actually flavorful and tasty whereas the beef ravioli is bland. it is roughly on a par with the spaghetti except that I like the texture and taste better than the spaghetti (but my girlfriend prefers the spaghetti, which she gobbles up in no time).<br /><br />This ravioli is about as good as we're going to get in a can. Canning pasta faces one major chalkenge: it tastes like pasta stored in a can. Chef Boyardee hasn't found a way around this, and I'm not sure there is one.<br /><br />If you buy this product, be aware that each can has two servings, and each serving has plenty of sodium. Eating one full can will leave little leeway for more during the day if you have high blood pressure.<br /><br />However, I think this product is tasty enough that I will be buying more. That isn't true of the overstuffed beef ravioli.<br /><br />PS: Some reviewers claim that Amazon is selling seconds because some cans were dented. This is a very infrequent occurrence for me, and I tend to doubt that Amazon is selling something graded this way. Besides, I often see supermarkets selling dented cans--even more often than Amazon.

review/text: This is undoubtedly the best canned ravioli I have ever tasted. And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing. I just recently came across this variety in the market here and gave it a try.  Not only is the ravioli truly overstuffed, but the sausage they use is very tasty without being hot and spicy.  I have actually baked these with Parmesan cheese and some added garlic and onion for 15 min and had people rave about them being home made.  If you can't find this in your market, its a good deal here on Amazon by the case, and with free shipping.  Excellent home made flavor, and highly recommended... : )

review/summary: A classic, updated a bit.
review/text: It's classic Chef Boyardee ravioli, just stuffed with a very decent mild sausage instead of the beef we're all used to.  It also has chunks of the same sausage, exactly like boxed pizza toppings, mixed in with the sauce.  All in all, it's a great quickie lunch as is or a very decent dinner when prepared with the right sides.  A trick I learned as a youth when eating the classic ravioli for lunch most days, mix in a single slice of good quality American or Swiss sandwich cheese and carefully stir it into the sauce as it melts.  It adds another level of creaminess to the sauce and it makes it "done".  Serve it with some crusty bread.

review/summary: Great Stock Item
review/text: I ordered this Chef Boyardee Italian Ravioli and was greatly satisfied. First, let's face the fact that this is a can of Ravioli, not from Olive Garden or even home cooked! For a can, it is ever so tasty and full of the "things" a body needs. The fact that Chef Boyardee does not have to advertise on TV and still has really high market sells says it all! I am in my 60's and handicapped. To have good nutrition in a can and taste great is awsome! To have it delivered for free(Prime) in two days by UPS right to my kitchen is a miracle! For all thiis, the price is absolutely fantastic! I read all the reviews. My case was shrink wrapped very well and there was not one dented can! The experation date was 2014! I had a case of Libby's peaches in the same box and it was so bubble wrapped, I had to have my neighbor's help to get the wrap off and again not one dented can! Both the Ravioli and the Peaches make great kitchen stock items!

BUT Amazon came through as they always have and replaced the entire order for no charge and mailed them with Prime-1, even tho' I am a Prime-2 customer. BTW, that $79 per year has really paid off for me because what I order is always free shipping and always arrives in 2 days. This is the first year I have had PRIME-2, and I will continue every year from now on. Also, there is the benefit of so many movies to watch for free as part of PRIME membership. Good job, Amazon!

review/summary: ConAgra isn't QCing these before they go out
review/text: I have to agree that these are likely factory seconds -- one of the cans in the pack I bought was half-full and weighed only 9 ounces (including the can!). There's supposed to 15 oz of food in there, much less the weight of the can itself (full cans weigh about 17 ounces.)<br /><br />If ConAgra didn't even check the weight of the cans before shipping them to Amazon, it seems to imply that they are selling lower-quality product to Amazon. The rest of the cans in the pack was fine, and I'm sure Amazon will take care of my problem with this transaction, but I definitely wouldn't recommend purchasing these unless you're willing to gamble a bit.<br /><br />The ravioli itself is good - I'd agree with the other reviews, it is tasty and relatively healthy for something out of a can. I wouldn't eat it every day, but it is a nice quick lunch or snack.

Walmart brand and stuff that I buy at Save-A-Lot tastes WAY better than this. I had to water down the sauce just to be able to eat it.. It was just... nasty.<br /><br />It did save me from starvation, and one can lasted me all day.. so I can't fault it too much. However, save your money. Buy the cheaper generic brands. They taste way better, and there's more raviolis in a can - even if they aren't "overstuffed".

review/summary: Obviously factory rejects, but still fine to eat
review/text: I bought this item when it was heavily discounted (about $12) and it got here very promptly, since I am a Prime member. Every can has small dents. The discounted batch I ordered and recieved appears to consist entirely of factory rejects. They were bought 02/2012 and have a 12/2013 best by date, so not that big of a deal. None of the cans are punctured, just small dents. The contents are currently GTG.<br /><br />I'd say if you are planning on eating these within a few months to a year or so of purchase, go ahead and do it. If not, I wouldn't trust dented cans beyond their best by date, or even really too far before then.<br /><br />As for the contents, same as you buy in the store. Wife and kid love them, which is why I bought it.<br /><br />The price has more than doubled since I got mine. Perhaps I just got a reject buy... Be warned.

review/summary: Great tasting beer
review/text: This beer brewed extremely fast for me and actually foamed over the top.  I think maybe the temperature in my house was to high (80F).  Either way, it ended up tasting just fantastic.  I am highly impressed with the ease of the cooper's beer to make and how great the always taste.

review/summary: strongly recomend
review/text: wow...didn't think an extract brew would taste like that! I got this because it is easy and takes no time. That being true, comparitively to grain brew, this is not it's only draw. You wil not sacrifice taste...color...smell...or the joy of beer.

review/summary: I will never drink store bought beer again.
review/text: I have brewed Coopers Dark Ale, English Bitters and Irish Stout.  Much easier than the kits that require 1-3 hours of boiling. I simply add 4 pounds of everyday cane sugar, mix it with hot water from my coffee brewer, add 5 gallons of tap water and pitch the yeast. Sometimes it takes 1 week to brew, sometimes 2 weeks. I stopped using the hydrometer a long time ago. It's obvious when it's ready to bottle. I prime it with half a cup of cane sugar and bottle it in 2, 1, and 1.5 liter soda bottles. They work great. I also bottle some in the clear Mexican beer bottles and use my capper. Bottom line: Home brewed Coopers makes store bought beer taste like soda water.

review/summary: Better than any chocolate
review/text: This milk chocolate is made with the best ingredients. 6 ingredients. And they use all vanilla and cocoa butter and whole milk powder. Hershey uses vanillin...which is a wood extract..I have a bag that was given to me, and all I do is snack on it, letting it melt on my tongue to taste the almost orgasmic caramel flavor that stays with you for like ten minutes after eating it. Which ever chocolate you eat, let it melt on your tongue first instead of chomping on it. One, you eat less, and two, you appreciate it, and three, you can taste all the flavors.

review/summary: Its costly through this vendor, reached me melted and poor service
review/text: The service for return was poor. The product reached me melted and fully bloomed (chocolate was white with spots and streaks on the surface). Though this is something that can be reused by melting, not for the seeding for which I'd needed this. They were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable. I had to explain my need and purpose. They did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment. I ended up paying $25 for the return shipment. The product is a lot costly through this vendor. Actually double its price. I bought a 5kg block of the same chocolate from a local Callebaut vendor. Please research your local listings. Stop buying through these channels. If you want Callebaut chocolates, call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor. While through this vendor the milk/white chocolate for 1kg costed me close to $50 with shipping, I bought the 5kg block from the local distributor for just $47!!

review/summary: made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

review/text: Being from the mitten state I like my vernors & often by it. I have to let it sit for a while before drinking it, or it makes me sneeze. Other than that it's great! I'll keep buying it because it's Made in Michigan.

review/summary: Finally an impressive and felicitous single-pod option!
review/text: I was terribly excited when I heard that Nescaf&eacute; had finally decided to just touch on the idea of carrying a wide array of flavors and intensities for straight espresso (I've always been so jealous of Nespresso's collection of capsules) by introducing a new single-shot Intenso. As I've been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA">Espresso</a> option for ages, I've decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we're working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso's instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn't do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I'd say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I'd say there's a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, 'Well, you're comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who've been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you're missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand's mild espressos just weren't quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!

review/summary: It's okay, but there is definitely a bitter aftertaste
review/text: I liked this flavor a lot when I had it with the pods that came with my machine...alas, the thrill is gone.  I am most definitely a dark roast fan, but this actually comes closer to bitter.  It can be diluted with some milk, but it's definitely one of those tastes that sticks with you until you brush your teeth.
