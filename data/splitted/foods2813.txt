review/summary: Worse than even Tab, tastes like Battery Acid
review/text: I don't know how any human being can consume stuff like this and Tab. Its like drinking battery acid. This stuff will eat the lining of your stomach in a matter of a few years. You'd have to be nutty to drink this stuff. Apparantly this stuff is a big hit with retired servicemen in Germany, as sales of Diet Rite have increased 3000% in some German provinces lately. In fact, upon fears of hoarding of Diet Rite, the German government recently raided a house of a retired American serviceman named Mikey and found him sitting in his basement, nude, amidst hundreds of cases of Diet Rite cola, boxes and boxes of Zagnut candy bars, watching terrible second rate movies about time travel and German fisting porn. That is some wild and wacky stuff.

review/summary: DO NOT ORDER FROM BURBANK :"OTTOS (EUROPEAN) FOOD STORE" !!!SADLY - VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE
review/text: 2011. Sadly they were delivered very short before expiration date. My 20 pack came on 25th of the month prior to next month as expiration date. So do not buy a lot at once to avoid diabetic coma when you have to eat them all at once before they go bad... Yes - you keep them refrigerated at all times. I wish the sales pages would advise about SHORT SHELF LIFE.<br /><br />SECOND PURCHASE 2012:::The item arrived in January 2012, with expiration date in NOVEMBER 2011. After few emails with dismissive statements like :"the chocolates are still good for several months after the sell by expiration dates", I decided to accept 50% discount. I have suspicion that this was not a innocent mistake, because the bottoms of all 10 packages look like rubbed off so that the expiration dates were very faint. I was not happy with how the matter was handled and did not appreciate the attitude of representative, which I did expressed in my "Sellers feedback". Today I received 2 PHONE CALLS - first to me, but after I refused to discuss anything by phone, my husband , who picked up second call minutes later (which I see as harassment !!!), had to listen the threat that if i would not remove my review, they will set the lawyer on me !!! I do have my phone companies record for that. I never heard of so offensive handling of complaint !!! I do not want anything from this company &lt;&lt;Otto's Euopean Import Store>>> and will not buy from them in the future. All of a sudden the page here has ""different"" seller.

review/summary: THE BEST TASTING CANDY!
review/text: This candy is the best candy that I have ever eaten! I had my first bite when my Oma brought them over for me as a little girl & have been hooked every since! True the shelf life is short but they are longer over there as I discovered when I am lucky to go over. My suitcase is simply stuffed with them! Now that I want some there aren't any available & must wait for them to become available or use my family connections to sent me a package with nothing but Yogurette. Too bad they only have 8 sticks per package. So like all the other reviews have stated it's great! I simply want to have my candy & will have to wait until some come available.

The green tea and English Teatime are also quite solid, but I don't personally like them quite as well.<br /><br />It can be a better value to purchase these teas individually. The one-flavor boxes generally have 20 tea bags each (as opposed to 18 in this assortment), and sell for the same price. However, if you like all of these teas and don't want to buy a whole case of each, this assortment is a great option!

review/text: This Bigelow sampler is great if your new to tea or if you want to explore others.  You can try a bunch of black teas and the green tea to find your favorite.  The black tea itself is okay for me personally not great since I'm more of a green tea drinker, but still pretty good.  Caffeine content is more that green tea so these blacks are best for a morning cup to get you going.

review/summary: our twins did well on this formula
review/text: Our twins started a bit underweight and were on the high calorie Enfagrow for the first 1.5 months.  We were able to transition them to this formula without any problems.  They have always been good eaters and seemed to like Enfamil Newborn just fine.  So far they have been gaining weight well and are on track developmentally.  At month 4 we switched them to the Enfamil Infant formula without any problems (basically the same formula without extra Vit D).<br /><br />I like the packaging - the tub is sturdy and has a holder inside for the included measuring scoop.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Enfamil packages these in a "reusable tub" but does not sell refills for Enfamil Newborn - only for Enfamil Infant.

review/summary: Canned straw mushrooms usually have sand-like inclusions
review/text: I've been avoiding canned straw mushrooms from the supermarket because there are usually at least one or two straw mushrooms per can that have sand-like inclusion in them.  I would experience an unpleasant feeling whenever I unexpectedly bit a crunchy straw mushroom with something like sand in it.  With oysters and clams, the sand is real.  Canned button mushrooms can also have sand-like inclusions in them but not as often as canned straw mushrooms.  Anyhow, as far as I can tell, these canned Roland Straw Mushrooms don't have this problem so I give them 5 stars.  Although shiitake mushrooms get most of the praise and attention for preventing cancer and boosting our immune system, all nonpoisonous mushrooms, inclusing button mushrooms and straw mushrooms, are very good for our health.  Each species of mushroom has a completely different set of mycochemicals that end up preventing cancer and boosting our immune system.

review/text: We try to use olive oil for as many purposes as possible because of the health benefits.  The best olive oils are first pressed/cold pressed because there is less processing involved and the oil has higher levels of the good stuff, plus it is generally of a lighter nature with a less pungent taste.<br /><br />The latter is particularly important when you are cooking for picky little kids.

review/summary: Extra light olive oil has its place
review/text: Olive oil is a key part of my kitchen supplies. We cook with it, use it in salads, and use it in many recipes. Normally, I prefer extra virgin olive oil. Healthy for one; it has some taste to it.<br /><br />However, there is also a role for extra light olive oil. For one thing, its lack of taste makes it palatable for people who may find extra virgin olive oil not to be to their taste. Second (and this is a bit exotic), this is one of the approaches to the so-called "Shangri-la" Diet. I tried that diet once, and lost about 10 pounds--and have kept most of that off since then (A long story, but the Atkins diet helped me shed 20 pounds, much of which came back--I tried Shangri-la to retain some of the gains from Atkins--and it worked!).<br /><br />Anyhow, while I prefer Extra virgin olive oil (and I do like the Bertolli brand), this Extra light has a useful role to play.

review/summary: Bertolli Extra Light Olive Oil - Good Quality, Some Considerations
review/text: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHR2MU">Bertolli Extra Light Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a> is a nice product.  There are definitely some considerations though.<br /><br />First of all, make sure you are getting the proper oil for your needs and recipes.  I only got this light olive oil because it was called for by a recipe I had to make a lot of.  Nine times out of ten I very much prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHPNI0">Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Super Value Size, 51-Ounce Bottle</a>.  This light one doesn't have nearly as much flavor, especially for salads or simple recipes where you are really tasting the oil.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that olive oil is generally more healthy than other oils.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is the price.  This is one of those products where it really pays to subscribe.  It's on the expensive side anyway, but subscribing makes it more bearable.<br /><br />This is a staple that gets used quickly, so even though it's a nice sized bottle don't be afraid to subscribe!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I don t know what to think about this oil right now. The oil in the last 2 bottles I bought is cloudy. The first one was slightly cloudy but it didn't bother me The second one is more cloudy. The cloudiness is constant It is not a question of temperature. I have kept several bottles of oil in the same location for yrs and I have never seen this happened  Smell and taste don t seem to be affected. What is the reason?

review/summary: King of the green
review/text: I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right.

review/summary: Solved my sensitive cat tummy problem
review/text: I've tried a lot of "natural" cat food but still had one or more cats tossing their food fairly regularly (we have 5 cats).  I saw this in Whole Foods on special and gave it a try.  Well, a month later, not a single tosser since the switch and they love the taste.  Have had nothing but great response to the food.  It smells like real food, not revolting pet food, and the canned food, which I give occasionally as a treat, is also well received.  The canned food looks like canned stew for humans, though I wouldn't eat it, but it was impressive to me nonetheless. Reading the labels for this food shows it's all natural foods and supplements and none of the fillers or other byproducts that my cats are so reactive to.  Every animal is different, but this food solved, at least so far, all of my sensitive tummy issues.

review/summary: Loves the taste; Did Nothing for Sensitivities
review/text: I had read a lot of great reviews about this food. My kitty has had a lot of dry spots around her head that cause a lot of itching since I brought her home from the shelter. At first, I thought this had been related to the flea infestation she suffered from when originally brought to the shelter. When it did not go away after a few months, I decided to switch her food to something organic. Spot's Stew for Sensitive Cats in the seafood flavor was my first stop. Although Jemima loves the flavor, the dry spots on her head and neck region continue.<br /><br />This food does seem to have an appeal flavorwise. She started wanting to eat a lot more when I switched her to this. Clearly, she must love seafood more than a chicken and rice blend. With the exception of her skin still being excessively dry with the sore spots, her coat is gorgeous and she has not had any issues with throwing up.<br /><br />Jemima recommends this for organic snobs like herself.

review/text: This is truly some of the best blueberry jam available for sale!  I would just suggest buyers check out the 3.75 oz. size (6 pack). Even though the price is slightly higher at .82 cents/oz. as compared to .70 cent for the larger jars, with the smaller jars you can get free super saver shipping.

review/text: My husband and I actually bought a jar of this when we were in Bar Harbor, Maine.  It is just wonderful.  There are real blueberries in it and it's a pleasant sweetness--not too much and not too little.  This is by far the best blueberry jam I have ever had.  It makes especially good peanut butter and jelly(jam) sandwiches!  Brings back fond memories of Maine too.

review/summary: Best Blueberry Jam Ever!
review/text: I am not a big jam or jelly fan.  I usually make my own strawberry and peach, but Stonewall Kitchen's Wild Maine Blueberry Jam is probably the best jam I have ever tasted.  It is made with tiny Wild Maine Blueberries, and is so delicious.  Everything I have tried from Stonewall Kitchens has been wonderful - I buy their pancake mix, which makes great fluffy pancakes, and their flavored syrups are the best.  Try the Wild Maine Blueberry Syrup - it has little blueberries in it, and is delicious on blueberry pancakes.  At Christmas time, try their Holiday syrup too.  I love Stonewall Kitchen!

review/summary: Yum Yum Yum...Best tasting jam in long time...A++++
review/text: While in university, I used to visit friends at a farm where they made jam from scratch, baked their breads and hunted for meat. Our friend Gladis was an excellent cook, and had a spread for us on weekends. After  I graduated, moved away to a big city, busy life and purchased food off grocery shelves to whatever fell within arms reach...:0) Although the Smucker's jam was not bad, I decided to try the stonewall sold on amazon. I was in for a treat. Just like the good ol days..Tasted fresh, they used cane sugar, no sweetener ,  and it was filled with berries.Just like how they made it on the farm...

review/summary: my favorite jam!
review/text: I love a great PB & J sandwich once in a while. This blueberry jam is my favorite. There are small blueberries in it, making it meatier and wholesome. It's not too sweet. Have tried many fruit spreads, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JU6H2">Polaner, Pol Strawberry Fruit Spread 10, 10 OZ (Pack of 12)</a> This product is a nice splurge once in a while. It is a tad pricey. I've given it as gifts and received good feedback from friends.

review/summary: deceptive
review/text: You see beautiful little wild blueberries popping out of the jar in the picture but below that first 1/2 inch it looks and tastes like grocery store grape jelly. So very disappointed. Overpriced for just average jelly. I also went to their website and was swayed by the hype. Unfortunately none of their propaganda is true. Buyer beware, still looking for good quality jam. UPDATE Aug. 2012: I now feel more angry at the deception from this company's advertising. I have gone through 2 jars (out of the 4) and may give the last 2 away. Poor quality. All the other terrific reviews must be from owners/employees or friends. Don't waste your money.

review/text: I haven't eaten Kraft Mac and Cheese for years because it wasn't organic and it was filled with chemicals and flavorings, etc. So I figured it was just something I couldn't have, and the organic brands at the grocery store were ridiculously expensive and tasted awful! Well, after reading the reviews here, I decided to give the Back To Nature Organic Mac and Cheese a try and I wasn't disappointed! It kinda felt like a treat to be able to eat it again! I didn't have regular milk on hand, so I used buttermilk instead and that gave it a really good, tangy flavor and seemed to enhance the cheese flavor as well. I did the Subscribe and Save option, so each box averaged out to about $1.65. I will definitely be ordering again!

review/text: I admit that the first box of Annie's Mac and Cheese was not so delightful since I followed exactly the measurements on the box. The pasta and sauce was just to runny so I cut back the amount of milk required and added more butter. I prefer a thicker mac and cheese so its just my preference. I've enjoyed a couple of boxes and its better because its healthier.

review/text: I've been eating organic for years now and had a hard time finding an easy to make mac and cheese that tasted as good as Kraft. I feel great eating this because I know its organic and I can actually read the ingredients! I love Annie's as a brand but their mac and cheese mix clumps and doesn't taste good. It dries out easily no matter how much milk and butter I add. :(<br />When I tried this because it was on sale at Whole Foods, I was sold. I only buy this brand now and I've branched out to try their crackers, cookies and more and I'm really impressed! Great tasting food that is organic! Yay!

review/summary: Quality control problem or Poor Storage?
review/text: I had bought this product before from other vendors (three bags on amazon.com from Pet Zone USA in June and one bag in a local pet store in May), and I knew that my mother's dog adores this treat. So I was puzzled when I visited her last week and she complained that this recent (August) shipment of 2 packages was "bad--yellow and hard--not like the other packages" (of the same brand treats) we had bought before. Today I wrote the vendor, PetFoodDirect, and asked them to look into this. Perhaps there is a quality control problem at Whole Life, or maybe storage issues. After receiving the "bad bags," my mother bought 2 bags of the same treats at her local pet store and they were fine. The pet store lady told her that sometimes there are bad pieces due to being undercooked or not dehydrated properly--sounds like she'd encountered this issue before (which makes me think it is a quality control issue). Unfortunately my mom mixed the contents of the bad bags with her good bags, so I can't return them...but I'm eager to hear what the response is from Whole Life and PetFoodDirect, and I will post again after I've heard from them.<br /><br />My mother's dog does love these treats, and I can see why: they are light fluffy/flaky pieces of dehydrated white chicken breast--and look so tasty that I'm tempted to try one!

review/summary: Best treats for finiky cats
review/text: I only buy top quality food for my very fussy Himalayan cat and was having a hard time finding something he would eat.  I had to take him off all dry kibbles even the grain free kind because it was causing him bladder stones.  He was not really eating his wet food -- just licking the gravy or juice. The store where I get his wholistic canned food introduced me to Whole Life freezed dried chicken. Despite my doubts, he went crazy over these treats. I give him pieces morning and evening once he eats his canned food.  Works like a charm! I tried the beef but it is too hard for cats to chew.

review/summary: Perfect healthy treat
review/text: So first of all I want to say that it's amazing how these treats compare to the Halo freeze dried chicken treats. You can pay about $9 or $10 for a 2.2 oz container of the Halo treats or you can pay a few more dollars for these Whole Life treats and get twice the amount. So naturally I chose these. While Halo seems to have marinade as an extra ingredient in their treats, these are 100% pure chicken, which is good because I don't think cats need marinade in their meat. I also like that they're made in the USA.<br /><br />The thing about freeze dried chicken is that it is 100% healthy because it's a 100% chicken. And the best thing is cats seem to prefer it over any and all other treats. My cat is on the small side and she's a very finicky eater and I often worry that she isn't getting enough nutrition. With these I can supplement her diet to ensure that she gets enough protein. In the bag there are a lot of large pieces as well as smaller bite-sized pieces. I crush the small ones to put over her food or feed dry and I soak the larger pieces in warm water. Since my cat won't eat wet food, giving these soaked is the perfect alternative as she seems to love them even more soft. Upon being soaked, they soften into a meaty texture right away.<br /><br />Overall, freeze dried chicken is the best treat you can give your cat and the size and price that these come in is perfect. I hope Amazon never stops selling these.

He even starts meowing at me if I forget to give him one during the day.  He has stomach issues and this treat doesn't upset his stomach at all.

review/text: Works really well for teaching him to do tricks (sit, lay down, roll over--yep, he can do it all). Using these treats works great for increasing his motivation. He is literally salivating and staring at my hand the whole time (I use hand gestures for each trick, in addition to voice commands). Another good use for the treats would be giving them to someone you want your kitty to warm up to (e.g., staff at the vet or boarding place)--this should help promote positive interaction.<br /><br />My cat also likes "Cod" treats by the same company (Whole Life), but chicken is his fave. Whole Life makes cheaper-priced "Liver" treats as well--these he didn't like near as much--would eat may be 1/2 of the amount and leave the rest; I wonder if that's because liver accumulates toxins.
