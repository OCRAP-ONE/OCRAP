review/summary: Not for a smaller dog
review/text: This gizmo is HUGE!  If it weren't so much trouble I'd send it back.  Looks like a great product for a St. Bernard, but for my 13-pound Shih Tzu it's overkill.  There may be a smaller version, but I can only imagine what the hard plastic would sound like on my tile floors!

review/summary: didn't last long
review/text: My pup and I really enjoyed this in the beginning.  She very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out.  We were starting to learn some other things (adding balls inside to change how the food fell out, etc).  Screwing the cap on was always difficult, with it needing to be lined up exactly right.  Soon, however, the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the "cap" on.  Now it is useless.

review/summary: not good for chewers
review/text: I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to break by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one.  Another new toy, doomed to failure.  &lt;sigh>  oh well, at least I tried.

review/text: My dogs are not rough at all, one is 4 years old and still has toys from when she was a puppy.  Within one week, she broke the cap into 3 pieces anf got all the kibble, Superglued it back together which lasted another week.<br /><br />I would not purchase again.  I went for the hard plastic Kong that dispense hard kibble.  They have barely scratched it although they can get the food out more quickly.  I throw larger treats in to slow dispensing action.

review/summary: Not recommended for tough chewers
review/text: If your dog isn't a chewer/destroyer-of-toys like mine, this might be fine. But my lab destroyed the rope and ate the plastic stopper very quickly. Also, keep in mind if you live above someone and don't have carpets, the dog will repeatedly drop the bottle on the floor to get the treats out. So had my dog not eaten this toy, I still couldn't have used it very often because it's very loud.

review/summary: Awesome food toy, but not durable at all!
review/text: This toy is phenomenal.  It keeps both of our dogs (1 silky terrier, 1 boston terrier) busy, and actually keeps my boston's farting problem at bay (I'm serious).  The only downside is the plastic top that you have to screw off/on to put food into it is NOT durable.  I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but they sounded surprised because the tug-a-jug is apparently made of ballistic plastic (I don't even know what that means).  The 5 jugs I've gone through say otherwise...<br /><br />Note: I will continue to buy these anyways.

review/summary: Broke in less than a week
review/text: I was very disappointed when this toy broke in less than a week. It was advertised as being durable plastic, but it couldn't stand up to our beagle dropping it repeatedly to get the treats out. The plastic lid on the bottom cracked and broke off less than a week after our dog began playing with the toy. The broken plastic pieces are very sharp and would have been dangerous if our dog had not been supervised.

review/summary: Great but noisy and treats fall fast
review/text: This is great thing to try to distract dogs with, but I do have two caveats.  One, I would never use it in a house with hardwood floors, especially if you are noise sensitive! The bottle is quite hard and it does create a lot of noise if your dog becomes on who picks it up and slams it on the floor, as one of mine does.  The other spins it around and as a result is a bit quieter.  There is also no way of regulating how fast treats come out of the jug.  Once the dogs learn the concept of the toy, most learn not to touch the tug, otherwise you restrict toys from coming out.  In terms of safety, I have not had my dogs try to eat the rubber tug handle or the ball at the top of the bottle.  The biggest problem I have with them is that of massive hair accumulation from the dogs dragging it all over the carpet.

review/summary: Dog gets distracted by the treats
review/text: My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the "scent holes" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately.

review/summary: Less than 12 hours to chew up the rope making it useless
review/text: My 11 month old Welsh Corgi figured this out the first time she took it from my hand.  However within a matter of hours she had the rope soaking wet and chewed mostly in half.  The rope is now soft and not a useable tool to get the treat out.  The knot was also too big and frayed to let any of the snacks out of the bottle.  You should also know that the snacks this company makes are too big for the extra small bottle.

review/text: My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy.  He chewed the rope apart in one day.  Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball.  It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats.  Kept the pup occupied for two hours.  Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats.  the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.<br /><br />This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher.  the design is great, especially with the ball addition.

review/summary: Not a good treat dispenser
review/text: My Akita mix pup then, and even now as an adult does not like this toy.  There are much better treat dispensers on the market, like "Bob a lot."<br />The purple dispenser is a large neoprene container similar to a water bottle for hiking.  My dog was afraid of the toy until I helped him get some of the treats out with the rubber attachment that slides in and out of the bottle.  He had no interest in trying to get them out on his own and still doesn't.<br />I have a 4 month old lab pup and she has no interest either.<br />I think it's a poor design.

review/summary: Keeps Dog Entertained, But Too Loud
review/text: My one year old pit mix is incredibly food motivated and can clean out any kong, no matter how tightly stuffed, in 10 minutes. I got this toy to keep her busy, and while it does take her a long time to clean it out, the toy is simply too loud. Roxy likes to kick this toy across the floor, sending it flying into the wall or the table. The hard plastic of the toy scrapes across the hard wood floor and then makes a loud "bang" as it slams into things. Not only is the noise really annoying, but I am also worried she might break something because the bottle is very hard.

review/summary: not for a chewer
review/text: My 10 month old Lab needed some brain toys, and this seemed like an ideal option. There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food - what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.<br /><br />And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total.

review/summary: Save your money
review/text: This toy lasted about ten minutes.  First one i purchased had a rope tug, which my pup quickly chewed through, rendering the toy useless.  I bought another one after i saw that they had changed the rope portion to a rubberized "rope" and it seemed like a better solution.  Wrong! The rubber rope took my dog (who is not much of a chewer) about two minutes to completely chew into small pieces, again leaving her with nothing but a purple plastic jug.  Product is a great idea if they can figure out what will work better as the "tug" mechanism, but as is (both versions) are just poorly made and a waste of $$$$.

review/text: If you have a smart or highly persistent dog that will chew bits off almost any toy except a Kong, skip this.  I would have, but it was a gift.<br />The first time I left this toy in the crate with my smart, 6 month old blue heeler mix puppy, I came home to find she had somehow managed to unscrew it and eaten all the treats. The second time she played with it all over the house, and the noise drove me crazy. Bang, boom, bang. She kept rolling it down the stairs, off a ledge, and knocking things over when it rolled behind them. But she was thoroughly entertained, so I let it be. The third time she played with it while I was cooking. A few minutes later, I looked down to see she had unscrewed it again, and was chewing on the various pieces happily. I didn't stop her since the brochure said it was virtually indestructible material. When I picked it up a bit later, her chewing had apparently ruined the threading so I could no longer screw the lid back on. Went right into the trash.<br /><br />Entertaining, but not durable at all.

I specifically ordered this product because it showed the jug to have a plastic rope and not an actual rope (my dog loves to tear apart ropes,  and I'd had a tug-a-jug that had the plastic rope previously and that was a great product. I'm not sure if they're making it with the plastic rope anymore, but I assumed that since that was what was shown, that's what I'd receive.) I'm not really happy with this bait and switch because I have to closely monitor my dog with this toy to make sure she doesn't shred the rope and render it useless.

review/summary: They shoud re-name this the "Tug-A-Huh?"
review/text: I have two dogs: one is not very good at figuring out puzzle toys, even with scaffolding and attempts at teaching him, the other is like a dog genius. That, coupled with her highly food driven motivation, usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly. This is the only item I've ever purchased that she can't manipulate well. Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible. Regardless of the number of dogs in your household, this is one toy I'd pass on.<br /><br />Update: My medium chewer has now completely chewed apart the rubber pull rope with this. If I could change my original 1 star rating to a zero, I would.

review/summary: Not worth it...you'll need to spend more money
review/text: So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'.  It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.  I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy.  They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought.  AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.  It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and/or up the quality of this product.

review/summary: Great Idea, but no match for a smarty
review/text: I was so excited when I bought this toy, imagining the hours my dog would spend entertaining herself with this toy. Unfortunately my mutt took two seconds to size it up and decide that the best way to get the treats out was to chew the rope off, which she did promptly. She was right, and I could hardly be upset with her, but I was disappointed that such an expensive toy was so easily destroyed.

review/summary: $10 thrown away
review/text: My dog destroyed the rubber "cord" in 5 minutes (worse yet, swallowed it), got very nervous trying to get the treats out and almost attacked my other dog for trying to get it from her (which she never before did). I had to take her toy away and wish i could get my money back. $10 is not a cheap tog toy, so it could be at least durable. I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave, but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested. And that would cost much more... Better stick to Kong toys, the only ones so far my chewing dog cannot destroy it!

review/summary: Great toy for an energetic dog
review/text: I was looking for a durable toy that would hold the interest of my 5 month old Border Aussie puppy and the Tug-a-Jug has been a great find. He was a little hesitant of it at first but once he figured out that the toy dispensed food, he is having a great time figuring out different ways of getting his kibble to come out. It is also a very durable toy, which is what I was looking for. He is an aggressive chewer and has chewed through a lot of his other toys - even though he has tried to chew on the jug, he has not been able to inflict any damage to it so far (we've had it for about 3 weeks now). The Tug-a-Jug is made of very durable plastic. The bottom opens so you can fill the jug with kibble or treats and I was happy to find that it has extra threading so it screws on very firmly and stays on even with my dogs wild play with the jug.

review/summary: Love it for most dogs
review/text: I've used this product, and others from Premier, for years.  For most dogs it's GREAT (I've fostered dogs and have my own).  I have both the small and medium sizes, which actually both work well for my 50 pound dog but I change them based on the size of kibble I feed.<br /><br />I like that they changed from the plastic-type "rope" which could easily be chewed and swallowed, but I don't like the new cotton rope - it's simply too difficult to clean and doesn't dry quickly enough.  I cut it off, purchased a piece of non-toxic acrylic rope, and have been satisfied (just have to tie the ends and burn them so they don't unravel).<br /><br />Kind of a pain to have to get a different rope and wish they would change it, but the replacement only cost me 50 cents.  The jug itself is more durable in the medium size than small, but I use it in a crate that has thick soft bedding now and has lasted almost a year so far.  When my dogs used it on hard floors the bottom of it cracked, although that was after 5 months.<br /><br />There were a couple very powerful chewers that managed to break the tops of these easily (I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLWJ1G">Premier Busy Buddy Linkables Dog Toys Value Pack</a> for them).  However in general they've worked out great and my dogs love them.  You can try making it more challenging by adding a rubber ball inside or pieces of carrots.

review/text: Oh I mean, I love my dog.  A lot.  But he is FAR too dumb to figure this out.  He instead just whacks me in the knee with it until I pull the rope out and bring some treats out.<br /><br />Hmm...maybe he's not the dumb one.<br /><br />It's definitely challenging.  Frustrates my dog more than entertains him and is pretty formidable when connecting with sensitive kneecap tissue.

review/summary: Excellent for the right dogs and play areas
review/text: As far as treat dispensing toys go, this is by far the best design. My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking.

review/summary: "Grandson" love it!!
review/text: Purchased for my four year old Dobie "grandson". He's a full blown case of a four legged kid who has a terminal case of the "terrible twos".<br /><br />Daughter said  it didn't take him long to figure out how to make the treats spill out. She loads it with dehydrated banana and papaya chips and it keeps him occupied for a good 45 minutes with each fill.<br /><br />He's figured out the bottom comes off and tries to find ways to take the bottom off, hasn't managed to do so .....uuummm.......yet ;).<br /><br />She also has five cats who are fascinated by the toy and when the Dobe let's them near it they bat it around and pounce on the rope. She's put some dry kitty food in it a couple times and the cats "team work" to get the food to spill out.<br />Dober-baby is only allowed to us the toy on carpeted floors because he tends to swing and bang it on the floor, the cats are put in a room with tile and they shuttle it around until it is empty.<br /><br />I would purchase again and expect I may have to...and soon...... if they cats decide the dog doesn't share fair.

I'm giving it fours stars because the bottle is much bigger than what I expected(It could be my fault for not understanding the dimensions).  The dog food comes out easily at first and as the food level drops it does get more challenging.  It keeps him engage and slows down his intake of food.

review/summary: Dog ate the rope, but this thing has endless possibilities!
review/text: This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!

review/summary: Definitely not a Kong....
review/text: The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.<br /><br />Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!<br /><br />I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!<br /><br />At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive!

review/text: We had gotten the biscuit dispensing Kong, but as far as activity, our yellow lab puppy got the biscuits out within minutes (even if they were well wedged).  He has been working on this Tug-A-Jug (filled with kibble) for the last 2 1/2 hours.  Amazing.  We plan to give him at least one of his three daily meals in this to keep him occupied.  He is 4 months, and in that teething stage, so this toy is a real life saver. We'll get him another one when he chews his way through the rope on this one. This was money well spent.

review/text: My dog loves this toy. I have a 60lb Shepard mix and she will spend hours with this thing. She is the type of dog to scarf down her food in a second flat if it's in a bowl, so I give her breakfast and dinner in this thing and it can take upwards of 2 hours for her to get it all out. I notice that she doesn't act as hungry or bored during the rest of the day which is great! I also have a kong toy that I would fill with treats but that was way too easy for her. The bottle is made out of hard plastic and so far she has hardly made a dent in it. Beyond a collar and leash this is by far one of the best investments I have ever made for my pup.

review/summary: Broke On the 4th Day of Use :(
review/text: Last night, I visited a friend who had bought this toy for my yellow Labrador.  My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.<br /><br />When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x/day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13-year-old Labrador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat-dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short-lived.

review/summary: Dangerous and not durable
review/text: This is the second "Tug-a-Jug" food puzzle I've purchased for my wire fox terrier. The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried, so I decided to purchase a second one. My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't "play" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding.

review/text: 3 dogs, 1 loves it and uses it as intended.  The only complaint there is that he's become far too good at it and learned how to push the rope in and out very quickly.  He 48 lbs, gets his regular meals in it and finishes in about 15 minutes.  I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!  Worked great for the second dog for a few weeks, he wasn't as good at it, so it took him a bit longer to empty it so we thought it might be perfect for him.  We were wrong, he chewed the rope in half one day.  :-(  Third dog is just kind of dumb and just smells it and looks at it.  The plastic is really rugged though, they're able to toss it around on stained concrete floors without breaking it!<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this company's toys.  One of my dogs chewed a Kong but hasn't been able to destroy Premier's Squirrel toy.  Dumb dog likes the Twist 'n' Treat, it doesn't take very much brain power...

review/summary: Awesome product for many dogs!
review/text: This is our 3rd jug. My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!

review/summary: Good Toy...
review/text: We have a JRT Mix and he is too smart for his own good.  The first time we used this 'puzzle' toy it took him about 45 mins to get to the end.  By the third time he had figured the most efficient way to get food to fall out and he now employs that same technique to finish off a scoop of kibble in about 10 mins.  He really enjoys focusing on this task for the 10 mins, as the JRT is an obsessive breed anyhow.  It gives him a good job to work on.  I recommend this simple toy as we have seen good results and it performs exactly as advertised.  Durability is good, our guy is tough on toys, but if you give it to him with food in it and then remove it from him when complete, there are no issues.

review/summary: Excellent Busy-Buddy Tool
review/text: This is one of the greatest inventions for Dogs that either eat too fast or need to be preoccupied with something to do. We have been using the jug about 8 months and have stopped feeding our dog with the dog dish and now only use the Jug. It takes him several minutes to get his food out, keeps him entertained and he actually chews his kibble instead of inhaling everything in 10 seconds like he would do out of the dish. The jug can also be filled with treats and is a great tool for dogs with attachment issues. For example, our dog used to go nuts and tear up the house when we left, but now we fill the jug with kibble before we leave to keep him busy. It keeps his mind occupied long enough to forget about us leaving and as a result he no longer becomes destructive when we are away. If you have a dog that is too smart for his/her own good and needs a good toy to keep 'em busy then I would recommend the Jug hands down. I have gone through more dog toys in the last 18-months than I care to admit and this has been the most effective, long-lasting items that is actually worth more than what you will pay. Your dog will thank you too!

review/summary: This has Haven-and-Coda Australian Shepherd Approval
review/text: I've been looking for this toy forever.  Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes "how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?"  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo -- may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn.

review/summary: Durable enough for a Mastiff
review/text: I am always looking for play toys for my 120lb, 2 yr old Mastiff. So far the ONLY toys that lasy over 2 days are the Kong brands (which I HIGHLY recommend). But anyways, this toy keeps him entertained for a long time here are my pro's & cons for it:<br /><br /> Pro:<br />-not expensive<br />-has several different areas to hold his interest (the bottle, the rubber spike ball & the rope)<br />-durable<br /> Cons:<br />-If your dog shakes toys around then that hard heavy plastic bottle can do some damage to you or your walls<br />-your dog may do what mine does & bring me the toy to set it up for him to get treats, defeats the purpose of him figuring it out<br />-my dog didnt love the treats that are made for the toy, so I just bought small size dog treats & cut them in half, works great!<br /><br />The pro's definitely outweigh the cons & I highly recommend this to other dog owners, especially ones that are strong & destroy other toys

review/summary: Awesome toy but maybe not appropriate for apartment dwellers
review/text: My bloodhound mix loves, loves, loves this toy. She walks around carrying it from the rope until she can settle into her favorite corner to "go to work". The only problem is that we live in an apartment building with hardwood floors.  The hard plastic hitting the floor is definitely LOUD and our dog likes to throw it up the air for added effect, which creates an even louder THUD.  I would definitely recommend this toy but if you have neighbors downstairs, they might hate you.

review/text: I have three dogs.  A grouchy old schnauzer, and two English Springer Spaniels, one of whom is 10 month old puppy.  Our puppy is, lets say...going through a very distructive stage. Our vet suggested toys that keep her attention for long periods of time.  We already had several kongs, balls, bones, etc.  LOTS of toys.  So, I saw this one and thought we would give it a try.  IT ROCKS!!!!!  It keeps her attention for HOURS!!!!!!!  TOTALLY worth the money.  In fact, I am going to order two more, so each of the dogs have one.  I completely recommend this toy.

review/summary: Fantastic way to feed your dog
review/text: I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot, you probably don't need the big one.

review/summary: Could not be more pleased with the tug a jug
review/text: I have a basset hound who loves to get in trouble if he's not occupied.  He's also highly motivated by food.  These two things make the tug a jug perfect for him.  I started him by taking the rope plug out initially (this can easily by done by unscrewing the jug and pulling the plug through).  I lined the rim with peanut butter and put his meal inside.  He quickly learned that rolling it around and tipping it made it dispense food.  After a couple of days of this, I put the plug back in.  He now spends 1.5-2 hours a day trying to empty this thing.  When he's done, he collapses and sleeps.  It's a beautiful thing.  I feed him all his meals in it now and it's his favorite toy.

review/text: It took a little while (15 minutes or so) for Maya to get used to this and figure out how it worked, but now that she has it has become her favorite toy.  At first, it'd take her about 40 minutes or so to get all the food out (I put her kibble in it), but as she got the hang of it, it would only take her about 10 minutes.  I put a tennis ball inside the jar with the kibble to make it a little harder for her and now, on average, it takes her about 30 minutes.  She loves this toy and I love watching her toss around the jar and fiddling with the rope to get the kibble out.

review/summary: There's no tugging with Tug-a-jug
review/text: I have two large dogs that are super chewers; they destroy just everything so I was excited to try the tug-a-jug out because of the claim of durable construction.<br /><br />The plastic bottle itself is holding up well.<br /><br />The "rope," which is a rubber/plastic flexible piece that plugs the top of the jug is another story. The half of it that extends out of the jug that is meant for tugging was chewed off in about an hour. It did not crumble or flake though, which was a relief interms of safety. Thankfully, another reviewer had the same experience so I kept a close watch on this. The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.<br /><br />The other rubber/plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug/bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing! The dogs could care less that they can see the treats because they are too busy trying to stick their faces into the open end. This is not a noisy toy.

The rubber on it can be chewed off (so supervision is required), but even with chunks of it gone, it still works great and keeps them busy. Besides the rubber being no challenge to chew through (especially the cord), the biggest down sides are that the plastic is so hard that it could damage some furniture (and feet) and it is loud when they throw it around

review/summary: Best Food puzzle I have found Yet!
review/text: I love to challenge my dog with food cubes. The thing is great--most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~! I highly recommend this one ( i have 2 other puzzle cubes and this is by far the best).

The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn't fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy.

review/summary: Tug a Jug
review/text: I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber "tug" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it.

review/summary: My GSD's absolute favorite toy
review/text: I recently adopted Jake, a 3 yr old German Shepherd Mix from a GSD rescue organization and was excited to introduce him to a variety of new toys.  Most he destroyed within minutes. The Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug is his favorite toy and keeps him challenged and entertained for long periods of time, while other toys get tossed aside.  He has easily figured out how to maneuver the bottle to obtain the kibble inside and it's adorable to watch how excited he becomes when he wins the prize...each and every time.<br /><br />I know that other reviewers have complained that it's difficult for the dog to get the food to come out. Perhaps the pieces are too large or the rope is not extended.  Keeping the rope fully extended for him, Jake is able to retrieve the kibble...not with complete ease...but with a little effort and determination. I would highly recommend this toy for a dog in need of a fun and durable toy that will keep him mentally stimulated.

When i came back to check up on her she was trying to use it but couldn't figure it out.  There was also the same amount of food when i came back.  I had to try to help her with it and it was still hard for her.  It was pretty sad because she was going ballistic because she couldn't get the food out.  It seemed like a good idea at first but i dont think my dog very much liked it.  There are scent holes at the bottom and she could see the treats inside so she would try to eat the plastic!  Either this wasnt a very well thought out toy or my dog is dumb! Hope this review helps.

review/summary: It keeps him occupied, but annoying to hear
review/text: My dog Cooper enjoys this toy as much as he loves his Kong toys.  He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.<br /><br />The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet.

review/summary: This thing was made for terriers
review/text: My husband and I have two English Jack Russell Terriers under six months old. They're both much more interested in playing than eating, but my vet was adamant that letting them graze all day would make house training significantly more difficult.<br /><br />The answer has been to make their eating more of a challenge. We've got two oversized Kongs that we'll fill with their breakfast, but they eat out of the kongs very quickly. In the evening, we needed something that would keep the puppies busy for at least ten minutes, so one of us could get some food in our own mouths before it was time for the pack to go out.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug has been great. Both puppies are challenged by it, but not so challenged that they lose interest. There's a perfect balance between work and reward. It holds a lot of food and assorted small treats, it's pretty easy to load, and the beasts haven't figured out how to unscrew the bottom lid.<br /><br />Some of the pictures for this product on various websites show a rope. Mine actually came with a silicone "rope" that's got a cone shape at the end, which ensures something gets scooped to the neck almost every time they pull on it.<br /><br />Only downside for my two is that if the food drops below a certain level they lose interest... might be because it's too much work, or it might be because they're full. Either way I have to make sure to dump the leftovers into a kong or a dish at least once a week so they get to eat the food before it gets stale.

review/summary: Perfect Snack!
review/text: I think these bars are so much better than other granola bars.  They are so full of nuts and good fruit!  They are a very generous size....sometimes too big for in between meals!  Love, love, love them!!

review/summary: KIND
review/text: Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot. The coconut and almond bars were chewy and crunchy with just a hint of sweetness and they were filling. One bar and I was ready to go for the morning! Mr. MVP had one KIND bar and a yogurt and a piece of fruit and he was on his way. Our supermarket had them for $1.50 per bar so $1.20 per bar is a decent price!

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I was given one of these bars by a friend and began ordering them by the box the next day!  I have an extremely sensitive stomach, and they are a great source of energy for me.  Eating one at the first pangs of hunger buys me a hour before I need a real meal, which is a life saver.  I have taken them on road trips and camping, and they are great there as well.  I love the fact they aren't covered in chocolate, as I'm not a fan of using candy for food.  The fact that they are gluten free means I can bring a box for celiac friends without concern, also a big plus.  I only wish I could buy them locally, but the Amazon subscription is almost as good.

review/summary: Best Bar Ever!!
review/text: This nut bar is made to perfection. It has the right amount of sweetness and the textures are unbelievably amazing. The ingredients make this one of the most delicious snacks and it's just enough to keep you going because it fills you up. You cannot go wrong with these bars, they are my ultimate favorite snack to keep on hand. I could live on these!

review/text: I really enjoy eating these bars they have a very natural and clean taste to them.  The only thing I would like to suggest is a less sweet version of these bars are offered, they are a little too sweet for my taste but that does not take away from my enjoyment of eating them.

review/summary: Hm-hm, good stuff
review/text: My wife tried several different brands and types. Although I am not a big fan of snack bars, I liked this one. Pretty good, nutty, fruity,  not too sweet, not too "healthy", nothing exaggerated. Just feels natural. I like them as a snack with a tea or cofee during a brake at the office.

review/summary: sooo good and no guilt -- what could be better?
review/text: I love these bars and even eat them once in a while as a substitute breakfast with yogurt.  They are so good, and not fattening and make a great on-the-go snack in the car or on the plane.  I have tried many other bars, but none even come close.  Every time I give one to a friend, they are hooked.  My 3-year old grandson loves them too, and I feel good that he asks for them as they have no artificial anything and aren't that high in carbs.  The deal on Amazon is the best with automatic shipping.  In most places they cost $2.00 or more each.  In bulk on Amazon they are $1.50 with no shipping charge.  This one is my favorite flavor, but I like most of the others almost as much.  So, happiness in a bar. . .

review/text: O-M-G...what can I say?  These are the absolute best bars I've ever had!  They are LOADED with coconut and nuts but, most of all, FLAVOR!!!  Gluten free to boot (though that doesn't matter to me), but someone that it does make a difference to...I encourage you to treat yourself to these...chewy, chewy, chewy and so flavorful...did I mention, chewy?!?!  The more you chew the more flavor you taste...just the right amount of honey, NOT the bland old sawdust granola bar you may think of...get them!!!
