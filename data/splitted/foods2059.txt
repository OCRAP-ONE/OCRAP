review/summary: Awesome addition for my son's 6th Birthday
review/text: These were great.  We did a LEGO theme party and used these as cupcake toppers and decor for the food & present tables.  Kids played with them and ate them too.  Not the best candy, but great for the LEGO theme!

review/text: These candies taste better than I expected, build well, the kids loved it, excellent addition to our lego party. 3 lbs is less than you would expect, but still enough that all the kids got some to take home and some was used decoratively, and we still have some left.

review/summary: Love the blox hate the product info
review/text: I purchased these for my son's 5th birthday party because they fit his Lego theme perfectly and he was really excited to get them. The blox were so neat however my son has a severe allergy to both milk and egg and the product came with no allergy information or ingredient list. So I figured I would scan the code on the package and go to their website and get the information there, nope no allergy information there either. I bought a product that I can't give to my child for his birthday tomorrow because I don't know if it will kill him or not. I am really amazed that between Amazon, the companies website, and the packaging that none of them have allergy info. Big fail.

review/summary: Looks much better than the photo
review/text: I ordered this one hoping that the blox were solid colors, not varied, pastel, and weird as shown in the photo, and I was very pleased when I opened the package.  They're blue, green, yellow, and red... just what I wanted.  I didn't see any broken ones (just a little candy powder).  And they do indeed stack together.  I can't wait to use these for my son's lego-themed birthday party.  I haven't tasted them yet, but the taste is actually not as important to me.  Very happy with the colors, stack-ability, size, and shape.

review/text: Purchased these blocks for my son's Lego birthday party and used them for a tower building event.  The blocks were good quality and you can easily stack them up.  They were a big hit.  They are definitely solid.  I did not allow my child to eat them- he doesn't like candy anyhow.  Older children seemed to like the candy though.  Quick shipping and decent price.  At the local candy store they were selling this for three times the amount online.  Was able to use the blox candy as party favors.

review/summary: much smalller than regular pigs ears - my dog says .. OMG THESE ARE EVEN BETTER TASTING ..... YUMMMMMMMMMM
review/text: My human opinion - these are gross, greasy and nasty dog treats that are a part of a once living animal and disgust me out to no end  .....<br /><br />Translated into "dog" .... ONE OF THE BEST EVER TREATS I'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN .....<br /><br />The crazed look of excitement in his eyes when I pull one out is unbelievable.  My dog REALLY LOVES THESE!<br /><br />As for being smaller than regular pigs ears - I actually think that's almost a good thing.  Pigs ears are so fatty, greasy and not good for dogs in large quantities and certainly contribute to any weight problems dogs usually have.<br /><br />Also, due to a heart condition I suffer from, it is physically impossible for me not to respond to my baby dog's face when he wants a treat (my baby - a massive APBT who is the sweetest full grown baby of a dog).<br /><br />Because of my own heart condition, I don't want to over feed/treat my dog, and make him suffer from being overweight because of my own physical needs .... so the smaller size is better.

review/summary: A Chip Off the Ole Coconut
review/text: Since going Primal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207786">The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)</a>), I've been incorporating healthier fats into my diet, including coconut.  I bought this because it contains no added sugar, has a decent price, and I was able to get one pound instead having to buy multiple packages (many of the other brands have to be purchased in bulk).<br /><br />Because of the fat content in coconut, I store these chips in the freezer.  The chips are 3/8" wide and the longest pieces I've found are about 1.5".  The chips are similar in size and shape to pencil shavings from a sharpener.  One pound, for me, was about 8 cups.  The coconut tastes good - like coconut - but I do find that the flavor is a bit more subtle than some unsweetened shaved coconut I also have.  That could be a result of the sulfites in the shredded coconut (that I did not purchase from Barry Farms - just the supermarket).  The coconut is dried - obviously - and quite brittle.  If you pinch a bit between your fingers to pop in your mouth, they'll crack.  Once in your mouth, they'll get almost chewy when they rehydrate bit.  Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase but might try a different brand next time just to be able to compare the flavor.

One item to look out for is the shipping charges, it ranges from $9-$35 dollars for a single package to a case.(stateside vendors)<br /> Everyone should try at least one pack!

review/summary: Happy Hippos make everyone who eats them, happy!
review/text: O.K. in the category of calorie-laden, sinful things that should not be allowed on Planet Earth---The Happy Hippos are right up there with Marsmallow/chocolate Smore's, Mickey Mouse Chocolate Ears ice cream bars, Chocolate Fountains at Fancy restaurants with Strawberries on a stick, Bubble-Gum Ice Cream, and Cotton Candy, etc. etc. If you are a fan of unreal creamy chocolate/hazelnut flavor and "Ferraro-Roche"-esque crunchy flakey bon-bons, then you'll go bonkers for Happy Hippos! I discovered these on an Asian Foods website of all Places (They are actually from Europe/Great Britain I think?) and bought a box for my Daughter. She went nuts over them, so I bought a case of ten (50 Hippos total-five to a pack) from Amazon.com. They aren't a frozen treat, they're like little puffed cookies (Three chambers in a row hooked together) with creamy filling inside and wonderful crunchy flakes stuck all over the bottom. I took them to work to let my co-workers try them and it almost caused a Happy Hippo Riot!! Every single person who eats one usually goes, "OMG!!" and then they immediately want to know WHERE I got them. Try a box and you'll be hooked for life. Don't say I didn't warn you, as Happy Hippos are VERY addicting and can cause irrational behavior in grown men and women!

review/summary: Amazingly decadent.
review/text: I tried these little hippos for the first time while on a trip to Germany and kicked myself for not bringing boxes of them home for gifts. Despite the cute little hippo design of the treat itself, this is not chocolate for the palate of little kiddies. This is not to say that the kids won't love them, because they absolutely will, but this is the kind of chocolate you savor with each bite. So buy the kiddos a Hershey bar and save this for yourself when you want to treat yourself to something special or just need comfort chocolate.<br /><br />The only disappointment was receiving these with an expiration date that gave me about a month to either eat them or give them away as gifts. I bought an entire case (10 boxes of five hippos) and had hoped to give them away gradually over a few months time for birthdays or special ocassions...if I didn't eat them all myself, anyway. I know that they don't have artificial colors, preservatives or hydrogenated fats, so they have a shorter shelflife, but since I still had two months shelflife on the packages I did bring back from Germany, I just assumed I'd get product with at least a couple of months to go. I'm eating one as I write this, and its very delicious though outdated, but I'm still disappointed because gifting now includes having to explain that even though the expiration date has gone by, they're still awesome. Awkward. Considering that each one of these little suckers has 119 calories, at this point, I'm really trying to control the urge to just eat through the hippos I have left so as not to waste them. :o) Treadmill, here I come!

review/summary: Very smooth, but does not taste like Ethiopian :(
review/text: I ordered the Equal Exchange Organic Ethiopian Coffee after receiving a notice (prior to my subscription shipment) that the price had gone up on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> , a coffee I discovered after a long search and many pounds of not very good coffee.  The price on the equal exchange was about 15-20% lower; what i had been paying for the other when I subscribed, and had a lot of good reviews so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />It is a nice smooth mild and non-acidic coffee *BUT* it does not have the distinctive taste of Ethiopian, or any African coffee I have tried.  I love African coffee.  In fact, the only reason I am ordering coffee is that noone brings African coffees into Hawaii :(  :(  For many years I had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061FZ1GG">Single Origin Coffees Tanzanian Gombe Reserve - Whole Bean 10 oz</a> on subscription, but then they raised shipping to $30 making it impractical.  I first tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWH4S6">Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean Coffee, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> which was either burned, or poor quality beans; tasted burned and left a bitter aftertaste.  I had a similar experience with their Kenya reserve, and so with 10 pounds of bad coffee in my freezer tentatively tried a sampler <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UFSOXE">Coffee Masters Around The World In Twelve Coffees Variety Pack, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)</a> and was very impressed with the quality and roast, and so ordered several of their single origin whole bean.  All of them were very nice and it has been my roaster of choice here (I have several of their ocffees on subscription) until the price hike.<br /><br />However, I would say that this coffee in no way compares.  I read the bag, revisited the site to see if it is a blend.  It is not described as such, but I doubt that in a blind taste test anyone familiar with these coffees would identify it as Ethiopian, or even African.  I does not have the choclatey undertones or floral scent  In many ways it reminds me more of Kona (i live in Hawaii, and have ready access but do not like Kona coffee; mild, smooth but non-descript, in my opinion.  It is, however, everywhere here and part of the reason we do not get nice varietals from other lands).  For me, this coffee is a big disappointment.<br /><br />If you are just looking for a smooth, non-acidic coffee you will probably like this.  If you are anything of an aficionada, like African coffee, or Ethiopian in particular, are looking for those distinctive notes, the chocolate flavor for which Ethiopian coffees are known.... you will not find it here.  I am glad, that at this juncture I am not in the same place I was when I got the poor roast from coffee bean direct.  i do have a good option, know where to find a nice Ethiopian.  I just have to accept paying more, or maybe get it less often :(  But in my opinion the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is vastly better.<br /><br />I gave this coffee 4 stars because it is still a nice coffee, well roasted: a light roast, not burnt or acidic... but also not distinguishable as Ethiopian coffee.

review/text: This coffee was not only organic, delicious and full bodied, it also is fairly traded. This ensures that the small growers of the coffee beans get a fair price for the coffee and are not exploited by large companies who make all of the profit.  I have been a big fan of fairly traded coffee for many years now. Equal Exchange is a great product and a great concept.

The best coffee I ever had by far was African Kitamu by Starbucks, and it has been discontinued. Took a chance here and wasted $30 on three bags. I actually used my local purchase the next morning - it was that muddy tasting.

review/summary: Roasting is the Difference
review/text: Here is what I am thinking about this coffee. The roasting seems darker than any other Ethiopian I have ever had. I think that reduces the distinctive African flavor of the brew, making the more flavorful aspects less distinctive. I taste and smell those aspects of Ethiopian in this roasting yet it is definitely been subdued. That is not a good thing in my book. Green Mountain Roasters Ethiopian Organic and Fair Trade is a lighter roast. I really prefer that. If you compare the beans side by side, this coffees' beans are darker and shinier. Not to the point of Starbucks but definitely in that direction. The local supermarket which carried it is now greatly reducing its GMRoasters stock for some reason. So, I am trying to find a replacement. As a an espresso, I can taste more of the characteristic flavors of Ethiopian. I am drinking it now and it is pretty good.

review/text: It took awhile for it to be delivered, about 2 weeks, but was worth it. Not sure if the delay is normal, maybe they only keep limited stock and turn it over quickly so you get fresh tasting coffee and not one that has been sat on the shelf for an age.<br /><br />I use the coffee with a Cafeti&egrave;re (French press), course ground, so my comments are for this.<br /><br />The coffee is rich, dark and chocolately, at times I had the after taste of a good dark chocolate left on my palette, hmmmm...nice, and not bitter at all.<br /><br />I'm no coffee connoisseur, but got fed up with the drip machines not delivering the taste I like, so I went back to using the Cafeti&egrave;re, which I had been using for many years in the UK (I'm now living in the US). I will try the coffee in the drip machine just for comparison, but the coffee taste so good from the Cafeti&egrave;re I'm in no hurry to check!

It tastes better than the Starbucks I usually buy. I like that it's fair trade because when third world coffee growers are paid a fair price, they are less likely to have to put children to work. I like that's it's organic because if I wanted to ingest chemicals and polutants, I would move to L.A. and inhale (I've already done that). I'd highly recommend this coffee to all serious coffee drinkers and even those who aren't.

review/summary: Crisp, Organic Nori...but a product of China
review/text: I started purchasing Nori in an attempt to get my picky toddler to eat SOME kind of vegetable (he turns his nose up at nearly every other veggie I give him).  Well...he and his twin sister love it, and it has become a daily "treat" for them.  I just purchased this product from Amazon, because I can't find organic Nori locally.  It is basically the same as what you can buy at your local grocery store - although for some reason, it is lower in some of the key nutrients than the conventionally grown stuff I was buying (particularly Vitamin A), and I'm not sure why.  Also, though I'm sure it says somewhere in the product description, I didn't realize this was a product of China - I would prefer to find a product sourced from somewhere I had fewer environmental concerns about, but I haven't yet.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWZWA">Eden Sushi Nori, Toasted Sea Vegetable, 0.6-Ounce Packets  (Pack of 6)</a> is harvested from "environmentally protected" waters off the coast of Japan....maybe I'll try them next time.

review/summary: IMO, the perfect canned beef frank
review/text: You can't lie, you love vienna beef. And what the best way to make vienna beef avail? Cou can it and preserve it in gelatin (basically gel with not nutritional value). This is all beef. I use to be a fan of pork sausage/franks but the manufacturers often load it with loads of sodium. The manufacturers of beef franks however don't. I do like my franks with a snappy casing, but with beef franks, you can almost always make an exception.<br /><br />I like these prepared by boiling it in a pan or pot with the water meeting about half way and let it low boil. remember to give the can some air either by puncture or lifting the tab. 5-7 minutes is usually enough. I love these served with gravy. Any gravy will do. I also sometimes just throw these on a hot dog bun (about 3 so a can serves 2) add sauteed peppers, onions, sour kraut, slices of hot peppers, light chedder and a line of texas chili (no beans, remember texas chili has no beans! I only make an exception if the bean is skinned and split [ soaks flavor and imo enhances vital texture])

review/summary: EEEYUCK!
review/text: I bought a case of these because our city was threatened with high flooding last Summer, and I thought I'd make better preparations for my home just in case there may be a repeat situation next year. And, this was my first try at buying foods online as well.<br /><br />I wish I could leave a better review for this item since I really do like this brand of Vienna Sausage, but when my package arrived about an hour ago and I opened up the carton to inspect it for any dented cans, I came across the occasional can that had *DEAD DRIED MAGGOTS* laying on the top! I didn't see any obvious dented cans or compromised seals that could have attracted these critters and the cans didn't put out any "off" smell that could have indicated a bad can, so I'm baffled to how they got there.<br /><br />All I can say about ordering any food online is "caveat emptor". I'm certainly going to be a bit more paranoid about it in the future.

review/summary: Bogus nutritional info?
review/text: Desired to purchase a very light low calorie higher protein snack for those occasional late night cravings. After some searching and reading of those nutritional statements seems all such amazon products have decided this sausage given the wondeful price would be fine. Yet upon receipt of the cans and reading of the cans' nutritional info, became very saddened.  Within 1 Vienna sausage 'lite' serving 45 of its 70 cal were from fat [a normal Vienna serving has 100 cal of 120 cal total from fat - oh man! ]  The Amazon listing stated in a 128gm serving there were only 2 gms fat total - a 600%+ increase in fat concentration was what was received vs what was 'hoped for'.  Go figure?

review/summary: Not a good buy
review/text: The first thing I noticed when I open the box was, the whole foil pack seems too light, so I weighed it, the whole foil pack weighted merely 8.5oz while the foil was pretty heavy one, after took the fish out of package, I weighed again, without water, the fish was exactly 6oz. So here comes the question, why the manufacturer stated "Net weight: 8oz", 8oz is the weight include water and foil packet, even with the added water, I would say not more than 6.5 oz. when you buy this brand, take it into account, for whatever the price you paid, you are not getting 8oz (half pound) but 6oz fish.<br />The taste is nowhere close to real smoked salmon from the better brand, the fish was soft(contain too much liquid), fragile, very light smokey, taste more like a canned tuna in the water.<br /><br />Fortunately I did not buy from Amazon, and did not pay the $22/pk price, I paid $9/pk at local grocery store and now I know why, I was able to return 2 out of 3 packs after ate the first pack. will never buy this brand if I can remember in the future.

review/summary: My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!
review/text: When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the "chicken flavor" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended "Golden Aloe" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these "doggie crack", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!

review/summary: Natural treat our Bichon loves!  A plus for his joints!
review/text: We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!

So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.

review/text: Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have "that talk".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!

review/summary: Doggy Likes!
review/text: My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.

review/summary: Nearly Miraculous
review/text: I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his "golden years" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D

However, I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten.  (I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful.)

review/text: Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!

I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: I love these!
review/text: My dogs love the flavor of these.  I have tried both the chicken and peanut butter and they go nuts.  Though I will admit the peanut butter has a less-intense smell than the chicken for human noses.  I can see the difference in the dogs' coats almost immediately!  I highly recommend any Zuke's products.

review/summary: After a month, I am a believer
review/text: I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.

review/summary: My PUPPY loves these!  They aren't just for older dogs
review/text: I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage/joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit, they smell good to me too, haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically, and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life - there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China, and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.

review/summary: Absolutly a Godsend
review/text: This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!

review/text: Mz Sparkle loves these and I was working out of town and couldn't find a place that carries them.  It was so easy just to order them from Amazon...I had gotten the Prime membership for kinda the same reasons...new city and difficulty finding my "go to" purchases.  Sparkle was delighted.

review/summary: Love these treats!
review/text: I have an older shih-tzu who is over weight and starting to have some hip problems. We bought here these treats to hide her daily pills in. They are so perfect, they are so soft that they can squish around her pills easily. They are also easy to chop up into smaller pieces and use as training treats!
