review/summary: Really? Tastes good AND has 20g of protein???
review/text: For fun, I went to the nutrition store tonight and bought about 2 dozen different protein/nutritio bars.  My daughter and I decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off Amazon.  It was a rather expensive endeavour, especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite.<br /><br />Well, as you might imagine, there were quite a few BLECH! bars - virtually inedible.  There were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed 'edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options', and then there were about 3 that were really really tasty.<br /><br />Muscle Brownie scored the very highest honors with YUM!  I'd even eat that for dessert!  You have to be careful though - one brownie is 2 servings and it would be oh so easy to eat the whole thing at once.  Of course, if you eat it to replace a meal, that's probably ok.  If you eat one serving (half the brownie) it is 170 calories and 10g of protein.<br /><br />I do wish it had some fiber in it, and that it was a little more nutritionally complete, but just the fact that I am now looking to buy a case of them should tell you something.

review/text: I first purchased one of these brownies at Seven Eleven and I was instantly hooked.  Although they don't taste exactly like a normal brownie, and are DELICIOUS, and when you look at the nutritional label you will be surprised.  I use them as a snack prior to hitting the gym,  and as a dessert after dinner.

review/summary: Awesome Protein Dessert!
review/text: These are by far the best protein bars I've ever eaten! I like many of the options out on the market today, but these are by far the best tasting and pack a good punch of protein in one bar. Although I have found them $4 cheaper than the going subscribe & save rate right now, this is still a good deal. Don't be afraid to try these-they really are good! You get your chocolate fix and your protein all in one-perfect for on the go, etc.

review/text: Not the first time I have tried Dave's but I must say, my new favorite is Hurtin' Jalapeno. It goes great on anything and has a fresh taste like no other jalapeno sauce out there. The Insanity Sauce is not for the timid but goes great in chili, soups, rice dishes, pasta, etc. The Roasted Garlic is great on just about anything. The bottles are the larger 5-ounce size so you definitely get your money's worth.

review/summary: Insanity is good, but Garlic and Green are too bitter
review/text: The insanity sauce is great, just as a food additive more then a sauce.  I add a drop or two to a bowl of chili to really spice it up.  The other two could be good hot sauces, but it had this weird bitter taste due to adding acetic acid.  You could really taste the garlic in the garlic sauce, but it was just over whelmed by the acetic acid.  Some like bitter, I don't.  Would buy the Insanity again, but not the other two.

The filling has a richness & depth that are reminiscent of caramel, the chocolate is superb, and you can enjoy it with total peace of mind. I'll take that any day over a sugar-bomb of "real" caramel!

review/text: What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and "Caramel", are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

review/text: At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, "Caramel"). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar.

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the "caramel" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was.

review/summary: What you would expect from Wild Honey
review/text: I bought this honey due to the fact its not cooked and is raw which provides more nutrition than Grade A honey( Any Grade Honey is Cooked and filtered). This Honey is really cheap for the price if you subscribe. The honey is not as sweet as clove honey or regular honey because its from gallberry and palmetto honey. I'm glad I tried it and will probably continue to buy this honey for what I use it for(Make honey lemon water, and etc) but if your looking for a sweeter honey look else where, this honey is a more balanced taste. I recommend palmetto honey for a sweeter taste which can be found here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045H25X4">Tropic Bee Palmetto Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)</a>.

review/summary: Yummy and wild..
review/text: I bought this one, and the company's orange blossom honey.  I'm a bit of a honey fanatic, and have tried many types of honey from all over.  For a wildflower, though, I love this one.  It's a typical wildflower, but with just a bit more spice and complexity.  Great stuff, very acceptable price if you do the subscribe.  Middle of the road in sweetness, not too spicy, but not bland either.  A very good all-around honey. Could put it in teas or in cooking equally well.  It reminds me of when I was younger, going to a flea market, and getting one of those straight-from-the-beekeeper pieces of honey comb with honey in it. :)<br />I will probably still buy other honeys for their specific traits, but I think this may be replacing the clover honey I bought before it from Amazon, as the clover was a little too pungently, well, "clover".  This is complex enough a flavor, that it's not overwhelming you with any particular flavor.  Also, no bitter after taste like some honeys have. And you just can't beat knowing that it comes from lands not tainted with pesticides, and being a product of the US! :)<br />Containers come wrapped in plastic, just in case of breakage I guess, and it has a little white bit you have to remove from under the squeeze bottle top, which is nice to see.  It looks like it shouldn't have a squeeze bottle cap, but it does, which is nice.

review/text: Using Subscribe & Save, I got a 48 oz bottle of wild flower honey for roughly $12 and change.  This product is the real deal, produced in the US and packed in Florida, not imported and adulterated. It has a mild wildflower flavor that's perfect for everyday use and baking, my primary reason for purchasing honey in bulk.  The honey is uncooked, so it may crystallize after time, just reheat gently, and unfiltered, so it appears a bit cloudy, but that's a good sign.  This is one of the best deals in honey I've seen in awhile, as I've been buying it from local NYC beekeepers for upwards of over $12 per lb.

It has a caramel, fruity quality to it that is quite pleasant and does not leave an aftertaste. It looks to be as advertised "raw and unfiltered" though I would say somewhat unfiltered because it is cleaner than some honey I have purchased that seems like it was pressed out by barefoot kids in a tub. It is a little darker than the picture. It is definitely a keeper considering our taste test.<br /><br />Cons: Most of the honey producers we have dealt with list their honey in fluid ounces or in pounds.  The conversion to weight makes a big difference in pricing for the fluid ounce measurement.  This advertiser states 48-Ounce Bottle. Well, the bottle surely isn't a 48 fluid oz bottle as you might be led to believe.  So if you thought it was 48 fluid ounces of honey and you just got 3 lbs of honey you just paid a premium for your honey because 48 fluid ounces of honey should be 4.5 lbs. The advertisement should state 3 lbs. of honey. A 48-Ounce Bottle is misleading and maybe done so on purpose. I'm amazed that other reviewers mixed the terms and didn't catch this. If it doesn't say quart or pounds I guess the question needs to be asked up front about what we are buying. It makes one appreciate the "Dutch Gold Company" with their "Bulk Orange Blossom Honey - 5 lb."  No mistake here and they have great packaging.<br /><br />Bottom Line :(  I paid $4.90/lb verses $3.25/lb. but it does taste good. Generally I try to keep the price to $3/lb and have received a good value like from "honeydabber" on Ebay though the product comes in thermally sealed bags for that price. Also the Dutch Gold Company on Amazon does it right too.  If it were not for the good flavor and what appears to be raw honey as advertised I would have given this three (3) stars because of the duplicity of the advertisement.  They are not the only ones to do this so buyer beware.

review/summary: Great honey, great price.
review/text: I love the value in this honey.  It's difficult to find good unfiltered and uncooked honey and this one fits the bill at a great price.  Note: because it is a raw unprocessed honey, the taste and color can vary from batch to batch.  I haven't had a bad batch though.

review/text: My daughter gasped so loudly when I opened the box of Angry Birds Fruit Snacks that I thought she had gotten a large paper cut.  She then held the box up to better see these wonders of modern molded fruit goodness, and said, "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"<br /><br />After opening a package and tasting them, she declared them delicious and immediately started sharing them with her (equally dramatic) group of tween friends... which means I need to order another box.  The fruit snacks are soft and flavored well, but the real genius was marketing them with the adorable Angry Birds.  :)<br /><br />Since my daughter and her friends enjoyed these snacks so much, I will recommend them to others!

review/text: I was glad to have found these, but after trying them, I was sorely disappointed. All the gummies were HARD! They were hardly chewable by me, an adult, so I don't know how kids can chew this. I was disappointed that I had to give these away. They were lacking in flavor too. Only the red angry bird gummies were half soft, the rest were all hard. I don't recommend them, at least not from Amazon. Try somewhere else before you buy so you can give a quick squeeze to see if they are soft. I would have returned these if I had ample time to get replacements, but I didn't.

review/summary: Major Disappointment
review/text: I've been a "connoisseur" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.<br /><br />The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture.  It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.<br /><br />The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.<br /><br />On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.<br /><br />I would not order these again.

If you like your tea to have the liquid chewing gum aspect, you just might like this tea, but I'd rather they have kept it simple and let the green tea be the dominant flavor, but the mint ingredient overpowers everything and I've never been a fan of mint flavored teas.  I don't plan on buying this tea again unless they toss the spearmint, but I heartily recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EDBL3Y">Tazo Passion Filter Bag Tea, 24-Count Packages (Pack of 6)</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JXVT3S">Tazo� Black Iced Tea Bags (20-pc.)</a> iced teas.  I've also found that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B2SVOS">The Republic of Tea, Double Green Matcha, 50-Count</a> makes a good iced tea, you just have to use about 5 of the smaller bags to get similar strength as compared to the one large Tazo bag.

review/summary: Beautiful Tree
review/text: I just received my Brazilian Rain Tree an hour ago.  I want to first say that I have received several trees from Brussels and Brussels trees bought through Amazon.  They are always very well packed.  I have learned a great way to get the tree out.  I open the top of the box and remove the invoice and brochure.  Then I open the bottom of the box and set it inside a large trash bag.  Pull up on the box slowly and pull up the sides of the bag.  I was able to get my tree out and remove the peanuts with only four peanuts touching the floor.  It takes awhile to pick out the peanuts around the tree but it is worth it having a safe tree delivered.<br /><br />I am very surprised with my rain tree!  It is 20 inches tall from the soil and the trunk is almost an inch wide.  The tree is not straight up and down but has a beautiful curve too it.  There are tons of leaves and smaller branches.  This tree looks much older than I expected!  Right now the leaves are all folded up since it has been in the dark box for a few days.  There are no blossoms at this time but there are a bunch of thorns!  I am very happy and can't wait for the leaves to open up.  I gave the tree a drink of water and will baby it for a couple of weeks since it has had a few rough days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that it is better than other trees I have seen online.  I really struggled with deciding on what indoor tree to buy.  There are not many photos of this tree type online and the best ones are obviously specimen trees that are much older.  One of the main photos of the Brazilian Rain Tree seems to be copied a million times and used on many sights.  I will try to get some photos soon and put them up on Amazon.<br /><br />I have only had this tree for an hour but at this point I would recommend it!

SO... if you buy it, yank it out of it's pot (careful, they use some thick sharp wires to hold it in place) and place it in a large container and allow it to grow out a bit.

review/text: I don't know if most people know this or not, but in Japan we put loose green tea leaves in a pot and just keep pouring hot water over it until the "taste" is too weak. All the water must be poured out after no more than 3 minutes or else the tea will be biter. Thats why most Japanese tea sets are so small. Green tea isn't meant to be left in a teapot like english teas. So my first cup of green tea was actually a little stronger than I am used to and I actually got 3 uses out of ONE k-cup. I highly recommend using them more than once if you are making the tea one cup after another....and it will save you MONEY!

I wanted a green tea like the Celestial Seasonings Green Tea but was looking for a better price than Green Mountain coffee website offers. I do not drink hot tea so I cannot comment on how it is for a cup of hot tea. I drink my iced tea plain - no sugar or lemon and I found this tea very crisp and refreshing but not strong like the black tea. I would say the taste compares to the Celestial Seasonings green tea. I have 2 brew sizes on my Keurig and I brew on the large cup and just add ice ~ if you wanted a stronger tea, of course you could brew on the smaller cup.

review/summary: Very good tea
review/text: I've tried other k-cup green teas and find that the Twinings was the least bitter.  Every morning before I go to work, I use a small Rubbermaid Mixermate container and fill it up at 11 oz with one flavored herb tea bag at the bottom.  Green tea generally doesn't have alot of flavor so I add something to it so I still get the benefits.

review/text: I'm mostly a coffee drinker but I do try to drink a cup of green tea everyday. 50 Count seemed like a lot but in the grand scheme it's a month to six week supply so very affordable. The tea is great tasting and same quality as in the bags. The only problem I have with tea from the Keurig is that I like my tea hotter than a cup of coffee. Coming through the k-cup doesn't really seep the tea.  If that's not a big deal to you, then this is great for your keurig.

review/summary: Our 2 Dogs Have Eaten Them Daily for 4 Years w/ NO Problem!!!!
review/text: Our 2 Dogs (German Shep Mix & Flat Coated Retriever) have eaten all sizes (mini, small, medium, large, rings, goof balls) daily for over 4 years and have never had a problem of any kind.  They love these things almost as much as going for a ride in the car and that's saying a lot. They are perfect because not only does the rawhide provide the chewing dogs need for their teeth but they have a meaty middle that adds flavor to what would otherwise be a plain white bone. We wouldn't trade these Dingo bones for anything, they are the best!!!!!!

review/summary: Dog loves these.
review/text: Enough said - dog goes crazy for them.  Good size for small to med. dog.  Only negative is that sometimes dog swallows pieces of it that he's bitten off and then vomits or gags.  But that is probably inherent to any type of rawhide bone.  I wish they were a little tougher though and took the dog longer to chew/eat both for his safety and the fact that they are not cheap at all.  It would be good if the cost went down or they sold in bulk for affordability. One bone can last just a day or two if your dog really likes them.

review/summary: My dog's Favorite Treat
review/text: I have been giving my 2 dogs Dingos for many years.  While I have also provided a variety of other high value treats, Dingos remain their favorite.  I keep them in a floor level cupboard and keep other treats in another floor level cupboard. My Lab sits in front of the cupboard containing the Dingos waiting to get one.  Sometimes, when he is there and I give him another type of treat, he just drops that other treat and goes into his kennel, as if to say, "if I don't get a Dingo, I don't want anything".  Unfortunately, because these are relatively expensive to give to 2 dogs at a time, he often ends up not having anything.<br />Great treat that my Dogs love.

review/text: Our dog loves these Dingo rawhide bones with meat in the middle.  He sits at my feet when I get one ready to cut open the package, he can hardly wait.  I was concerned that the red meat might stain the carpet, but that has not happened.  Our dog is part lab and can eat a whole bone in one day.  But it keeps him busy even when company is here.  This brand was suggested by our trainer because the product is labled and you can read the ingredence.  Other rawhide produces say not for human consumption, this one does not.

review/text: DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.

My 26 pound terrier swallowed a piece of one once and was able to throw it back up on his own.  A week later he swallowed a whole bone.  Lots of heaving, seizing, a doggie Heimlich maneuver and 20 minutes later it was out.  Dogs love the flavor but the whole bones and the pieces that come off are too easy for them to swallow, even while supervised.  We have switched to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPH1T8">Dingo Big Chew Large, 5.5-Ounce</a> and haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or choking.

review/summary: Great to keep at work
review/text: I keep these soup cups in my desk at work.  They're really easy to make with the hot water from the water cooler.  Be careful because the cup becomes too hot to hold sometimes.<br /><br />This is my favorite flavor from this brand line, though it smells funny to coworkers who aren't used to miso!  I think it tastes great and makes a good snack or goes great with a sandwich or salad to be a lunch.  The noodles are a great addition--regular miso soup is just too watery to be filling.<br /><br />The seasoning comes in a packet so you can use less and get just as flavorful a meal but have less salt in your diet.<br /><br />Note the nutrition info link at Amazon is based on half the package.  I can't imagine anyone saving the rest for later, and 180 calories for the whole thing isn't exactly too much food!  The cups I have purchased locally list it as one 180-cal serving so perhaps packaging has changed.  Meanwhile I've had some cups seep a bit while eating them so it's not a container that's going to hold your soup longer than your mealtime.  Put a napkin under the cup just in case.<br /><br />I give it five stars for flavor and convenience but only four total because of the details/execution (leaks, hot cup, half portion nutrition labeling).  It also seems a little pricey at two+ bucks each in my local grocery, but it's much better than traditional Ramen.
