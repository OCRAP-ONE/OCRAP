review/summary: This is the BEST LICORICE
review/text: Haribo Gummi Licorice is simply the best of all the licorice. It is imported from Germany and Amazon always seems to have it in stock fresh. I open the 5 pound box and repackage it into heavy duty zip lock bags. Freeze two and keep one open to nibble. I share it with special friends and even if they don't like "regular" American style licorice thy frequently love the Haribo Licorice Wheels. Try some at this great price and I think you will like it too.

review/summary: Pretty Good - Not too sweet
review/text: Every brand of licorice has its own unique taste so licorice lovers need to embark on a quest of tasting each one to find what they like and what they don't. This brand is relatively inexpensive, actually its a bargain at this price, and includes a little salt and not too much sugar. The result of this recipe is a not overly potent taste and sweetness - often found in Australian recipes. This, in my opinion is a double edged sword. On the one had very sweet licorice is addicting - hard to stop eating or craving which results, at least for myself, with eating thousands of extra calories. Sugar is addictive, the more you eat the more you crave - can you take only one bite out of a snickers bar? I have never been able to buy a 6-8 pack of licorice and not finish it quickly - certainly within 24 hours. This recipe is not as potent so one can enjoy it and have the willpower to stop eating - when you have 5 pounds of candy this can be critical, especially for licorice lovers that don't desire an expanding waste line. So if you want super sweet then this is not for you. It is also best eating when one unrolls the wheel - this extra effort also slows down the eating unlike other brands that have pieces that are finger thick and full of flavor which can result in consuming at least twice as many calories per sitting.<br /><br />At this price is it worth a try. I had mixed feelings at first taste but when I realized that it is not as addicting as most other brands I tried, and could stop eating after a few pieces, I realized this as a benefit. Anyway, if you want a burst of super sweet, potent flavored licorice then don't consider this brand. As mentioned, each brand is unique - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001APXYW">Panda Licorice Natural 7 oz.</a> was the first brand I tried that got me hooked on real licorice but even the 7 oz box never last me longer than an hour making it dangerous to buy in bulk to save money, unlike this brand. If you like licorice and want a brand that makes it easier to manage portion control then give this a try.

review/summary: Not terrible, but somewhat tasteless. Real black licorice fans should seek out Haribo's Pontefract Cakes instead
review/text: These licorice wheels aren't bad. The texture is great, and the flavor is OK. But it's just OK. Not particularly pronounced, and sadly a little to similar to the fairly tasteless (or artificial tasting) American stuff that you typically find.<br /><br />Haribo actually manufactures a very very good black licorice, the Pontefract Cake: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVMLWK">Haribo Gummy Candy, Pontefract Cakes, 6.6- Pound Bag</a>. THAT is a real, deeply satisfying licorice bite. Made the way that licorice has been made (in Europe, anyway) for centuries.<br /><br />These? OK, but too modest.

review/text: We love our licorice, but spending $10 a pound on average isn't a luxury we often afford ourselves. When finding this HUGE bag of wheels on Amazon we had to give them a try. Though not as "licorice-y" as we'd like, they are good. They offer a hint of salt on the front with a slight sweetness on the back. You can't beat 'em for the price. The downside: Just try and keep your hands out of the bag.

review/summary: Unpleasant Aftertaste
review/text: I've consumed quite a bit of licorice over the years. I'm not a connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination but I know an unpleasant taste when it's in my mouth. The Haribo Gummi wheels start off very well, great bite and chewability, very nice initial flavor. But.... every now and then (not always but enough to warrant not buying again) I got a nasty sulpher-like bloom on my palate. So: Caveat Emptor

review/text: I have grown to like licorice and I eat all the licorice jelly beans at easter time. I've been trying out lots of different gummy candies here by both Haribo and some other makers and thought this would be an interesting combo. Unfortunately this product listing is misleading - these are NOT gummies. They are just licorice wheels - like regular licorice coiled up. I like the flavor, but they leave a pretty nasty aftertaste. As such, it's going to take me a long time to get through 5lbs of this stuff. It's not terrible candy, but left me VERY disappointed.

review/summary: Taste and point of view
review/text: I tried this tea on recommendation in Homeland, and becaue the varieties in it are the same genetic strains as in Taiwan #18 tea, which is one of the truly best in the world.  I should have been more cautious about a recommendation from a TV series that also portrayed the Blaser R93 Tactical LRS2 as a fantastic rifle rather than just a very good one, and then demonstrated only amateur level accuracy with it.  To quote Buffy, "My bad".  This tea is excellent in the spectrum of English teas, especially those FOR teabag/ball use.  Compared to the genetically related Taiwan #18, it is poor.  Compared to Sun Moon Lake Black, it is very poor to terrible.  However those teas can't be used in bags or even small strainers for brewing, and are at the far extreme height of taste and quality.  This tea also is best made in bags or very close mesh strainers, not those designed for larger leaf teas.  Rated as 2 stars because it is acceptable if all my other teas are used up and out of stock.  And to remind me how good the others taste.  However, that compares it to Sun Moon Lake Black or Yunnan TGFOP black.  Compared to the standard Engislh or Russian tea, it is very good.  If that is the standard of comparison, it would be a fairly solid 4 star rating, although more costly than some.  Incidentally, it does taste like an Assam with African tea flavoring, not Darjeeling or Ceylon teas.<br /><br />For what it is worth, I asked someone else to try this tea, who always brews loose leaf tea, usually an "English breakfast" mix of some type.  The rating was significantly lower than mine ... 1 star compared other "tea bag" type loose leaf teas.  Couldn't even give it away, which surprised me.  I thought it was better than that!

The Dilmah has a hint more grass note to it, probably because Taylors blends in another leaf to neutralize it, but you won't detect it at all once you add milk or citrus to your tea.  I suggest anyone falling in love with this tea also try the Dilmah, before stocking up any further on this over priced Yorkshire Gold.

This is something you let the customer know immediately; you don't let the shipping time frame expire and make the customer contact you to find out what the heck is going on. The product didn't ship until a week after the shipping time frame expired.<br /><br />The product arrived and was missing the recipes that were promised in the product details. I e-mailed the company and received a PDF version within 24 hrs; so they did make up for it. Still, such oversight is a bit ridiculous.<br /><br />Next the dropper inserts aren't actually made for these bottles. With the dropper inserts on, the bottle cap does not screw on. It is definitely the inserts. I bought the exact same bottles in bulk from another company and the inserts provided by the other company work perfect. I contacted the seller and explained that the dropper inserts don't work since the cap won't screw on with the dropper insert. The seller contacted me and told me that they do work and refused the acknowledge the problem. They just kept saying that it works.<br /><br />Horrible seller. Defective product.

review/summary: My favorite coffee
review/text: I started drinking this coffee when we lived in Portland, Oregon. There was a Torrefazione coffee shop in our neighborhood (Irvington). I loved the people and love this coffee. That's why now that I live about 3,000 miles away on an island off the coast of Georgia, I order it from Amazon. It really is the best coffee in the world.

review/summary: Great Vegetarian Substitute
review/text: Since becoming a vegetarian, I have looked for replacements for some of my favorite things, including brown gravy. Now, if you are expecting this to taste the same as brown gravy, you may be disappointed. However, this gravy is amazing. It is very herby and gets super thick, just the way I like. It is also just as easy to cook, although it does come in clumps that have to be broken up first in order to not have lumpy gravy. All in all, it makes great gravy.

review/summary: Just okay Coffee
review/text: This coffee is not quite what I thought it to be. Taste a little on the strong side. It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just "ok", so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the brew of coffee. I shall keep my eyes peeled for the cheapest place to buy my kcups. The day break of the caribou is the best variety of the caribou brand.

review/summary: Taste is obviously subjective
review/text: I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the "My K cup" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang.

review/summary: Very Smooth - Best Keurig Coffee I've Tried, So Far
review/text: I'm a big fan of Illy coffee. It is a very smooth coffee. I was tired of having to work (clean stuff)to make my coffee so I purchased a Keurig.<br /><br />I purchased a sample pack. The only coffee I was impressed by was the Caribou. It's a slight bit weak for my taste but it is oh so smooth and flavorful. I actually purchased this pack because it was so good. It's as close as I can come to Illy on my Keurig, so far.<br /><br />I also purchased the Caribou Mahogany but it has not delivered yet. I'm hoping it's stronger, yet smooth like the Caribou blend. I like strong but smooth. I'm not interested in bitter.<br /><br />If you want a delightful smooth full bodied coffee, this is it. I drink coffee more for the taste than anything else and I'm extremely picky so I was pleasantly surprised when I was pleased by the Caribou Blend.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point. What is important is how fresh the coffee is. I found that each cup had the same freshness so that's a nod to consistency. As for my own personal taste preferences, I drank Folgers Classic Roast for years and since that isn't available in K cup, I've been drinking the Caribou Coffee blend as a replacement. It tastes fine to me and the caffeine keeps me going all day.  I haven't had any problems with using the Caribou Coffee K cup either. When company comes, this is one coffee I don't share :)

review/text: The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I brewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.<br />The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and brandy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.<br />It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...

review/summary: Doesn't Bite back
review/text: I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I brewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend; not harsh not weak and it doesn't try to be something it is not. I know that sounded a bit odd but that was my first impression. This is my third cup this afternoon so I would like to try another cup without the nuances of the other kcups on my palate<br /><br />Not to be redundant from what the other reviewers have written; it's very mellow yet rich and doesn't bite back and leaves no harsh after taste. Can't wait to try it later @ the 7.25 mug size.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well I just had my Caribou @ the 7.25 mug size and it was as delicious as the larger mug size. A bit more after taste but again not offensive. Though I read that this coffee is a medium roast, to me, it tastes more like a light roast which I seem to gravitate to. I will brew it @ the larger mug size just so I can enjoy it longer. Caribou differently hit the nail on the head with this one. So it wins a spot on my top ten favorite Kcups list.

I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn't like it.  It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it.  This one's for you if you like a more bitter/bittersweet coffee--it just didn't appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste.

review/text: Caribou Coffee is one of my favorites in spite of the fact I have to order the regular type online since we don't have any where I live. I ran into these K-cups at Target and thought I'd give them a go.<br /><br />I have occasion to offer people coffee in my office and the K-cup Keurig brewer is perfect for this as it makes just that cup for that person and it's fresh. Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K-cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well - you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).<br /><br />This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase. Enjoy!

review/summary: This is hands-down, my favorite coffee on my Keurig coffee maker.
review/text: Hi!  I have that coffee maker at home - the Keurig thing.  I love it.  And I love coffee - I have some every single morning.  I can't live without it.  I love my coffee maker - and I tried many, many, MANY of the numerous types of coffee that are available for it via these "K-Cups".  Let me tell you, that as an avid coffee drinker, this is hands-down my #1 favorite brand to make at home. It's mild, it's not overly bold, it's nice and mellow, it's not bitter in the least, it's not watery, it's PERFECT.  I like my coffee with milk and sugar and this one is just the BEST.  I am sick of the "Extra Bold" coffees they make for this machine - they all taste the same and are just too harsh for me.  This one - this Caribou one - ROCKS.

review/summary: This is what coffee is supposed to taste like
review/text: Wonderful coffee. I have tried many different k-cups, and like Goldilocks, I found some to be to strong, some to be too weak, but this one is just right. No bitterness, no acidity, just pure coffee taste. I enjoy flavored coffees but sometimes just want a plain old coffee, and this is THE ONE for me. After having experimented with many others, I will stick with this one.

review/summary: Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers
review/text: I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on "we listen to our customers" and more corporate-speak BS.

review/summary: Caribou Wins Hands Down
review/text: After sampling about every K-Cup out there, I have to say the Caribou blend is the best one for daily, regular coffee drinkers. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees, nor do I love the dark, bitter, bold types. I simply want a smooth cup of Joe I can drink daily and feel comforted it will be consistently the same tasting and awesome. Caribou's are the perfect fit for me. I would go as far as to say that brewing Caribou in K-Cups at home has kept me from going to Starbucks for over a month...it just tastes better!

review/summary: Amazing coffee!
review/text: I received a Keurig machine for Christmas and was eager to sample all of the coffees that were included.  Unfortunately the Caribou Blend was absent in my sampler.  Lucky for me I decided to pick up a box of this coffee once the sampler was depleted.  I can sum up my experience with one word... "WOW!"  This coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor, even on the largest cup setting.  I was taken aback when I took my first sip; the subtle hint of berry and chocolate was so pleasant.  I would say this is one of the best, if not THE best, coffees I've ever tasted.

review/summary: What happened to my old Caribou Blend??
review/text: LOVED Caribou Blend.  Found a great price at Amazon, ordered enough to last 5 or 6 months.  K-Cups had a different logo than my previous purchases, and tasted sooooo bad I couldn't drink it.  After opening several boxes and brewing several cups from each box, each cup as bad as the last, I decided to return the unopened boxes.  BUYER BEWARE--I had no idea that the seller would refuse to take back or refund anything on "consumable" products.  I'm out a lot of money for really bad coffee and can't find another brand that is as good as my old Caribou Blend.  Any suggestions??

If you love a light brew then you will love this.

Free shipping, 10% off when you order 4 boxes, coffee club rewards program.  Just take a look.

review/summary: Pretty much a perfect all-around drinking coffee
review/text: This coffee is just great.  Not overpowering, but still relatively complete, even when brewed as a "large" cup, or even 2X small -- many of the K-cups come out tasting thin when you do this, but not this one!  It's so mellow that some may find it to be lacking in unique personality, and I suppose that being a "medium-bodied" blend, it doesn't shout out anything at the drinker.  Still, this is a very nice, all-around coffee that is great for everyday drinking.

Haha, on a personal note, my hubby has been drinking this at work for a month. He made the cup for me, and waited anxiously to see what I thought...

review/summary: Caribou Coffee Blend K-Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers
review/text: Caribou Coffee Blend is our family's favorite K-Cup flavor. It's strong and smooth in the extra bold package so you can make a max-size cup without it tasting weak. Other flavors we've tried (and like, just not quite as well) are Green Mountain Double Black Diamond, Coffee People Black Tiger, Brooklyn Bean Colombian, Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian. The Caribou Coffee packs seem to be more fully filled with nitrogen which makes them puffy and seems like it may keep the coffee fresher.<br /><br />NOTE: We tend not to prefer dark roast so this review may not help you if you like darker roasts.<br /><br />Also, if you read the other reviews, AZS was correct that these 80 count packs are cheaper at S*ms. Wish Amazon was a little more competitive on the price.

We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it.

review/summary: A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...
review/text: The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.  We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.  I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.

review/text: This is a great mid morning coffee, best for drinking after I have already had my jet fuel. It is a medium strength coffee, but has great aroma and flavor.
