review/summary: Junk food
review/text: If you read ingredient labels, you would know this is basically cheap by-products, calcium CARBONATE (chalk) and a bunch of additives, colors and preservatives. NOT a healthy diet for anyone interested in good nutrition for their pet. BUT...our 18+ tiny rescue mutt isn't long for this world and has taken a liking to this doggie junk food above all else. It was either cave in and buy it, or she was going to starve. But don't get your healthy young pet hooked on this slickly marketed product, designed by Mars to use up the waste products that aren't good enough for human consumption. There are much better choices that will provide better nutrition at the good pet specialty stores!

review/summary: Dogs Love these
review/text: I have two westies and a maltese. After trying many brands of canned dog food that my dogs would not eat we finally discovered these. All three of my dogs love this dog food. They enjoy many of the different flavors. The trays are not large but are just right for one serving for dogs about 20 pounds and under.

review/summary: Terrific for picky dogs
review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/text: Normally I find great prices on Amazon, but I'm shocked that this product is so much more here than it is at Costco, where my husband just bought a bag for only $11.99 (exact same size).  Be that as it may, it's one of those treats that even finicky chewers will eat and I highly recommend it. One of my dogs, who had a very small appetite because of cancer, was chewing on them to the end. The ingredients are pretty decent for a dog product, although I'm not clear on how it can be gluten-free if it has wheat in it.  But I'm not a gluten-free freak so it doesn't matter.

review/summary: UNPARALLELED HOT SAUCE!!!!!!!!
review/text: This hot sauce is one of a kind. I am always hesitant to try spicy foods because of the taste of hot sauce.. but when I tried Rocky's I was transformed. Other hot sauces seem chemically to me but Rocky's has a homey flavor that is incredibly diverse-- so much that I have been using it on eggs, tacos, as a marinade for chicken and on grilled cheese!! My family and I have been through six bottles of Rockys in the last two months. I can honestly say this is a first for our family, but certainly not the last as Rocky's has become a staple on the table for every meal. Thank You for creating such an amazing hot sauce and FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED IT: ORDER NOW!<br /><br />Bar-B-Que Notes: Love love love the barbeque flavor on grilled cheese. It is a staple as a snack or appetizer or a side for lunch. Honestly your grilled cheese is missing out. Also perfect on tacos for some extra smokiness.

review/summary: Better and much less expensive than Theragum
review/text: (Reviewing as I'm chewing)<br /><br />As an avid gum-chewer, I'm always looking for something to satisfy my oral fixation, but I try to avoid the usual artificial sweeteners (i.e. Aspartame, Sorbitol, etc.) and sugared gums (for obvious dental decay reasons).<br /><br />I first ran into Xylitol, a sugar alcohol, in Trident gum, but the amount of Xylitol was minimal - Trident primarily sweetened its gum with aspartame and sorbitol.<br /><br />I later discovered Theragum, a product of 3M-Omni corp., which was 100% Xylitol.  A good gum, but 3 times more expense than Spry gum "and" it seems to break-down more readily than Spry gum.  Theragum tends to disintegrate after chewing the same piece for an extended period of time, which I commonly do.<br /><br />Sprygum, as I mentioned, costs 3 times less than Theragum and seems to hold-up to extended chewing time (further experimentation forthcoming).  I need about 4 pieces of gum to get a decent wad of gum to chew though.  :(<br /><br />I have only tried Peppermint, but have Cinnamon, Spearmint and Fresh Fruit samples to try.<br /><br />Conclusion:  best gum I've found so far and the price is reasonable.

review/summary: The ingredients are not correct! Very upset!
review/text: I ordered this gum from this same store before because they didn't sell spry with titanium dioxide in it. I read the ingredients again before I ordered this time and it still said ONLY "Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier) and beeswax (glazing agent)." Yes I copied and pasted it here to show you all just in case it gets changed. I refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it. Why you ask? Here you read for your self. "Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen ''possibly carcinogen to humans''." [...] AND " Titanium dioxide is an inorganic compound used in a range of body care products such as sunscreens and makeup. It appears to have low skin penetration but inhalation is a concern." So I don't want to chew something that is bad if I breath it in. I am VERY upset over this discovery, being I give this gum to my kids. Now I have to find a Xylitol sweetened gum for my family, again. I have been chewing this gum for years and loved the ALL NATURAL ingredients, not anymore! By the way here is the ingredient list for the new bottle " Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier), titanium dioxide (natural coloring) & beeswax (glazing agent). " I DON'T CARE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, I CARE IF IT IS HEALTHY!

review/summary: The Best (Dental) Chewing Gum On the Market!
review/text: This is by far the best gum on the market!  Spry utilizes Xylitol, a sugar-alcohol that has no carbohydrate action, yet bacteria ingest the Xylitol and cannot metabolize it, thus starving the bacteria!  Thus, with consistant use, it rids the mouth of harmful cavity-causing, gum-disease causing bacteria!  This is truly a unique gum.  One of the few gums that all dentists recommend!<br /><br />Avoid gum chewing if you suffer from TMJ.  Gum chewing aggravates TMJ's, so this is to be avoided.  This is the only contraindication to this product.<br /><br />This is a great product for the average person, child or adult.  Chew one to three pieces a day and your oral health will improve.<br /><br />Jim Koenig, DDS

review/summary: LOVE this stuff
review/text: I love Spry gum...high % of xylitol per serving, no gross/weird ingredients, great peppermint flavor. The flavor may fade a little faster than some conventional chewing gums, but it's better than consuming the carcinogenic, disgusting artificial ingredients they use. Also, this is an amazing value for Spry gum...previously I was ordering the 100 pc. tubs from a popular online herb store; that worked out to about $1.10 more per 100 pieces. At local health food stores, a 100 piece tub is even more expensive at about $7-7.5 each before tax! This is a good value anyway, as I have seen tubs of conventional chewing gum cost more than this per 100 pcs. The only thing I wish were different is I wish that you could order bulk Spry in bags...I feel terrible with this growing collection of plastic tubs! Amazon, please work something out with Spry to offer something like 1/2 lb. bags...

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: I am very disappointed with this gum. I used in for a long time and noticed that the formula had changed a few months ago. I called the company and was told that the gum base was changed. That was a big mistake to me because it doesn't last very long and within about 10 min. or less it becomes very rubbery. I am now trying a different Zylitol gum hoping for better alternative.

review/summary: Beware - made in China ingredients
review/text: I previously bought the 10 piece packs, and the packaging indicated "Spry is a product of XLEAR INC., Orem, UT, USA".  On the 600 count package it also says this but also says "Packaged in the USA/Raw materials from China & USA".  China is mentioned in much smaller print than "Packaged in USA".  It seems they are trying to hide the fact they use ingredients from China.

review/summary: It triggers my migraines
review/text: At first I loved this gum.  I have read a lot about the benefits of xylitol so I was very reluctant to believe anything bad about it.  Then, by process of elimination, I found out that every time I got a migraine, I had been chewing this gum.  I experimented by chewing extra for a few days and then going back to xylitol.  Indeed the xylitol days were marked with severe migraines.  I know I am just one person and a single person's experience is not scientifically rigorous.  That said, if you notice yourself getting headaches, ask yourself if it might not be the xylitol.  Also, please be cautious if you're giving this to children.  They might have a bad reaction to it even if you don't.

review/summary: prevents tooth decay
review/text: I am a Dental Hygienist and there is a lot of supporting research to show that xylitol actually helps prevent tooth decay and reduces ear infections.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that cannot be eaten by bacteria the way carbohydrates can.  It also creates a surface on the tooth and mucosal tissue that is inhospitable to bacteria.  Therefore, you reduce the number of bacteria in the oral cavity and eustachial tube area.  Studies first conducted in Finland showed a reduction in chronic ear infections in young children who used xylitol.  You need at least four exposures per day of about 3-5 minutes each.  Spry also makes mints, toothpaste, gel for babies without teeth and mouthwash.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRI6J4">Xlear - Spry Toothpaste Flouride Free, 4 oz toothpaste</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LSVJGK">Spry Baby Oral Gel</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VKWHO">Xlear - Spry Oral Rinse, 16 fl oz liquid</a>  You can buy a nasal spray as well to help with sinus infections.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M4W2E6">Xlear Nasal Spray, 1.5 fl oz liquid</a>

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I purchased this product for my husband as an alternative to over-the-counter sugarless chewing gum. He is a former smoker and Nicorette user and sugarless gum helps him a lot.  Most of the sugarless gum products were causing him to have reactions on the inside of his mouth and gums due to sensitivity to the chemicals in the products.  Spry offers him a great alternative and he has been chewing it for several months without any reactions.  While the flavor of the gum does not last as long as traditional chewing gum, he really likes the product.  Another benefit is that it does not stick to dental work like some chewing gum is known to do.  The vendor is very reliable and we have placed two individual orders for the 600-count gum.  Each have arrived before the estimated shipping date.

review/summary: Vastly prefer Xyloburst brand
review/text: My wife and I have been going through the different brands of Xylitol gums/mints/products for the past 2 years.  We decided to try the Xlear Spry stuff because it was cheaper.  Boy can you tell that it's cheaper.  While it does the job of delivering Xylitol, it fails at the part of being a "gum".  It's hard, and gets harder after a few minutes.  I think the longest I was able to "chew" the Spry stuff was 5 minutes, then it became so hard that it was decidedly uncomfortable to chew.  On top of that, after a few minutes it actually started to dry our mouths, and it has a weird (and not pleasant) taste at that point too.<br /><br />It's bad enough that we knew within a few weeks that the price difference was Well worth it.  After all our testing, Xyloburst seems to be the clear winner in terms of best quality for the price.  It stays soft/chewable for as long as you want to chew, it never drys the mouth and the aftertaste is markedly less, and takes a lot longer to appear.

review/text: I have purchased the cinnamon flavored Spry in the past, and while the flavor was intense at first, it quickly diminished.  I am pleased to say that the peppermint flavoring lasts much longer.  It may not last quite as long as sugar-sweetened or aspartame-sweetened gum, but it comes pretty close.

review/summary: No Such Thing As Too Much
review/text: I go through a lot of gum, probably 10-12 pieces a day (I always chew more than one at a time,) so your average pack of gum doesn't last me very long.<br />I found a pack of this at Whole Foods and thought I'd give it a try, and I really liked it, so I was thrilled to find it in bulk.  To be fair, the flavor isn't as intense or long-lasting as Trident (one of my favorite brands) but I love that it's free of aspartame or other sweeteners you usually find in sugar-free gum.<br /><br />On a totally selfish note- people know I always have gum on me, so they're always hitting me up, but most of my friends don't like the Spry flavor- it's not as sweet or intense as "mainstream" gum, which is what I like about it.  It's pepperminty but not intense, it's pleasant but not sweet- yes, it was an adjustment but now I love it.  And the best part is nobody hits me up for gum anymore HAHAHA!<br /><br />I keep the tub in my pantry and pour the gum into an Altoids tin, it's convenient and travels really well.  I usually chew 3 at a time, but I have a pretty big mouth, I'm sure most people could get away with 1-2 per serving.<br /><br />Oh, and my dentist says my teeth are doing great (and it feels really good to chew after a meal- between brushing and Spry, my mouth is ALWAYS clean. :)

review/text: I chew Spry Gum due to an illness that causes dry mouth.  Dry mouth can have a negative impact on your teeth and gums.  The  Xylitol used as a sweetener in the gum is much better for your teeth than other artificial sweeteners.  For someone who must have gum in their mouth during waking hours,  protecting my teeth and keeping my dentist off my case are important.  I find the best online prices through Amazon.

review/summary: Awesome all-natural alternative for gum lovers
review/text: I love chewing gum, have since I was a kid. Mostly I love the minty freshness after a meal that works so much better than mints. As an adult I have tried to improve my diet, including cutting out artificial foods. Bummer was all the gums at the grocery store contain aspartine and artificial colors, and the natural "glee" gum I found at Trader Joes has sugar. I was so happy to finally find Spry a couple of years ago. Not only is it all natural, it is sugar free, good for your teeth, and really tastes great! It's a pretty big out-of-pocket at once for the big canister, but it lasts me almost a year so saves money in the long run. I can't say enough good things about this gum!

review/summary: Solid natural alterantive
review/text: After realizing the amount of chemicals that go into your standard chewing gum, I decided to try this alternative. Based on natural ingredients, Xlear Spry is a solid substitute. The flavor is good. The texture is similar to the alternative. I knocked off one start because the gum lasts less time compared to the chemical laden one. Given the natural ingredients this is expected, but several minutes of chewing fun is less than a complete chomping experience. Still, this is a solid, natural alternative.

review/summary: Best gum in the world
review/text: For those who are not allergic, and most people will not be, this gum is absolutely fantastic: good for your gums and teeth, good chewing texture, long lasting flavor.  In a time of fancy flavors and harmful artificial sweeteners, such as sorbitol and aspartame that most all gum companies seems to think necessary to put in their "sugar free" products, Spry is a clear winner in the category!  If you miss the old traditional gums like Juicy Fruit and Peppermint, which now have aspartame in them (for heaven's sake why?), then give Spry a try by all means!  My dentist keeps little packs of it in his reception area, which is where I first heard of it and tried it.  Now I hear lots of people raving about Spry gum.  If they ever fiddle with this recipe, I'll be doomed to gnawing bark I guess. *Note: there have been reports of dogs having seizures if they eat this gum because of the xylitol, a sugar alcohol, so keep it away from your pets!

review/summary: Keep out of reach of pets...
review/text: After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums. The mints are also delicious and not overly sweet.<br /><br />Keep out of reach of pets.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: SPRY PEPPERMINT GUM * ASPARTAME & SUGAR FREE
review/text: After serious review of everything I digest in a day in order to get really healthy, it became evident that aspartame and sugar had to go, but equally important was to enjoy the simple pleasures of gum and treats to the standard we're accustomed to in sugar and aspartame.  Spry peppermint gum is the solution for anyone from the random chewer to the gum-aholic, and the Xylitol in Spry is all natural and actually beneficial, instead of detrimental, to your physical and dental health.  It should replace all the aspartame and sugar poisoned gum at the checkout aisle. On taste alone, it's fresh and long-lasting without after-taste. As a lifestyle change, it may be the best first step in cleansing your body from the constant influx of inflammatory agents found in sugar and aspartame gum.  Spry peppermint gum is the answer to my quest for great gum without sacrificing personal well-being.

If it is made in China, I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food, cat food, jewelry, tooth paste, baby formula, and more.  I avoid anything made in China as China manufacturers only care about profits.  They have no regard at all for people as long as they make money. I suspect this may be garbage made in China because the price is awfully low, which is a tell-tale sign it was made in China.

review/summary: Anchovy Fillets by Scalia Extra Virgin Olive Oil
review/text: Hmmm, I cannot say that I am a huge connoisseur of anchovies but I do enjoy them on a variety of dishes.  My mother even made an amazing anchovy dressing in my honor.  So it goes to say that I have tried a number of them and enjoy them thoroughly.  Now the jar is nice, it has a strange plastic thing in it which I do not care for personally, I think it is to hold the anchovies up or something.  The olive oil is not anything special, extra virgin it may be but given that it is not organic and had a piece of plastic in it, I cannot really vouch for there being a superior aspect in that department.  As for the chovies themselves, fairly standard.  Nothing really spectacular or amazing about them other then the fabulous price tag on these bad boys.  $16.00 for a jar of anchovies that in and of themselves do not distinguish themselves from any other standard anchovy.  I tel you this much, I will pay for a product if it is good, even if I don't think I would pay that much given the option, I will pay it rather than not have that delicious taste.  This, I will not be buying again.  I will stick with Crown Prince Anchovies in their little glass jars.  Thank you.

review/summary: Easy on you
review/text: This is a very silky feeling water.  I had to take a lot of medication and continue to since an automobile accident.  One of my medications really did a number on my stomach lining which in turn creates a lot of acid reflux on a normal day to day basis.  So I thought giving alkaline a try couldn't hurt.  And it most certainly did not hurt.  It was nice not to have to take meds before and after meals. I was down to just one acid reflux pill a day.  Normally I end up taking one a hour before every meal and possibly one or two after meals.  I just took one in the evening and that was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />I would certainly buy this again.  Other members of my family liked the texture of the water too.  I sort of wish we could get in our five gallon jugs for the water cooler.

review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)<br /><br />This is a difficult thing to review. It's bottled water. There are some basics to consider. How does it taste, well, like water. Clean, crisp, refreshing, water. Essentia does that very well, no faults at all. The bottle has a description on it as "A difference you can taste." This  can be true, but I've been drinking different bottled waters over the years and I must say there is a smoothness that I do notice. It kind of reminds me of my youth in summer camp in the Pocono Mountains of PA. There was a stream that was fed by a rubber pipe in the ground. This has that heavy smooth cold taste that I always remembered. Nothing before, has reminded me of that experience. Am I imagining it, I don't think so. It really is different.<br /><br />I like the water very much. I was only given one bottle to evaluate. I can't talk to any long term benefits of the pH or electrolytes that are in the water. It's very good water and I'll leave it to you if the price is worth it to you. Cheers!

review/summary: alkaline water in a plastic bottle
review/text: One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water. Those units can be very expensive, so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia's 9.5 pH water may be a good option. It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes, though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits. Since it comes in a plastic bottle you'll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn't make the water absorb plastic chemicals. If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option, though to be more eco-conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics.

review/summary: Tastes like water to me...
review/text: My son and I recently decided to go up on a nice hike to one of the local caves. The forest service recommended bringing at least 32 ounces per person. This bottle of Essentia looked like a good way for us to bring the recommended amount, and yet still have some left over. Needless to say, after climbing over 1000 ft in a mile and a half, we found ourselves glad we had this product. It touts having lots of essential vitamins, etc to help you with such situations. I'm not sure if it really made that big of a difference compared to regular drinking water. It certainly tastes about like regular water, so nothing really bad to say about the taste of the product. In our case, it was water (whether enhanced or not), and it helped us achieve our goal of visiting the cave and having the water we needed. It certainly served its purpose. The question begs, though, would our experience have been any different had we just had regular water? The entrance to the cave even had natural spring water you could fill your containers with.<br /><br />I'm one who certainly gets daily headaches if I do not drink enough water. I've personally found drinking things like Gatorade or Propel certainly help me more than just drinking water. I suspect Essentia is going to be similar, despite its taste being basically water. It probably fools the mind more, compared to having some sort of flavor enhanced water/drink.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably. The pricing isn't bad for a 12 pack, and you certainly get a good size bottle for each of the 12 units.

review/summary: Eh.It's Water
review/text: There's no doubt that water will taste quite different from source to source, but for the most part, unless you live in a town with a high sulfur or arsenic concentration, you don't NEED bottled water. A good PUR, Brita or Zero Water filter should be enough. So no one actually needs to PURCHASE Essentia. That said, if you're on a long car ride or visiting another country, bottled water makes sense. Essentia is a high pH water (on the base side. Low would be acidic and you wouldn't want to drink it). It tastes...okay. I've have better and I've had worse. It's a little pricer than most bottled water, but I'm happy that it is Electrolyte infused and that the bottles are BPA and Phthalate free. That makes Essentia a better choice than Aquavita or even Fiji which has a massively high carbon footprint.<br /><br />All in all, it's water. I can't say I'd go out of my way for this as I'd prefer to get Smartwater for my electrolyte enchanced h20 (better tasting), but I'd pick this up over a lot of the more common mass produced, secretly just tap water brands.

review/summary: Tastes Good
review/text: Previous reviews have been negative on the taste of this water, but to me, it has less taste than some common brands (Dasani, Aquafina) of water.  In that sense I like it more: I can't stand the slightly bitter/metallic taste of those waters.  This one "tastes" more like water.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is advertised for having the "correct" pH level, and as being electrolyte infused, but I have noticed nothing special about it in terms of how it impacts my workouts: it's wet, just like any other water.  So in this facet, I rate it as being less than advertised.

Can't compare to this water due to the pH. Didn't notice any benefits of drinking water.

review/summary: Helps me get better results when baking but doesn't taste much different
review/text: I ordered this to try primarily becuase I come from a part of the East Coast where our Tap water or Well water is naturally more Alkaline  than it is here in SOuthern CA.  For almost 20 years I've tried to make a decent crispy pizza crust or the right combination of tender on the inside, crsuty on the outside homemade breads.  I tried addiing things that should make the PH of my doughs more alkaline, hoping to reproduce the baking of my upbringing and yet.. I always failed.  Shortly before she died, an italian neighbor of mine from back east suggested I carry back some bottled water from our own well and save it just for bread baking.  well, after 9/11, you couldn't do that and it seemed all the bottled waters out here in CA tasted like sulfur and made my bread crusts tough.  The Good news is that I tried making several different types of bread using the Essentia and it DID seem to do the trick.  That may be a silly reason to buy bottled water but if you want to bake your great-grandmother's bread for the holidays, then what'sa few bottles of special water gonna hurt?<br /><br />As for taste?  It tasted fine to me - no better or worse than the best waters I've had. I can't say speak to the issue of GERD and acid reflux but if this water helps somebody with that, it's a lot better than getting hooked on Proton-pump inhibitor prescriptions that cause even more problems than they solve.  I read many of the reviews from people who were buying the Essentia for that reason and many of them seem to have found this water gives them more natural relief.  It's an interesting approach and one worth trying since the environmental impact and carbon footprint of relying for life on Prevacid or Nexium is far worse than simply swithing the bottled water you drink.  In a perfect world, we'd all toss our bottled water and use Tap filters but Essentia's Reverse Osmosis process followed by Ionic Separartion tech is a little bit.. no.. way above the cost reach of most home-owners.<br /><br />Me, I'll use my tap filter for drinking water but when I bake anything, I'll likely use Essentia as the water called for in the recipe because it most closely mimics the effect that the natural well water of my youth had on the baking process.  Water is not simply H20 - the minerals in it contribute to the outcome in cooking as does the pH.  Sure, I could just dump some extra baking soda in but that never worked in the past as well as Essentia has worked in my recent baking spree.  I'm a believer in it's chemcial differences vis a vis baking.  If helps some people reduce acid stomach without medication then they've found a unique way to help others.  You know how much a year's worth of Nexium costs?  Do the math and then you'll see my point.<br /><br />I don't think essentia will rock the world of bottled water but like Coconut water, caffiene water and even mint water, if it ain't HFCS soda, it's not as bad.  Sure, we should drink tap water but some people can't.  Until we all have Triple filtering technologies, there's Essentia.

review/summary: From someone who doesn't like bottled water, I enjoyed Essentia quite a bit...
review/text: Bottled water to me always seemed like a gimmick.  I grew up on tap water, unfiltered, straight from the hose or sink, and didn't mind it at all.  As I grew older I wanted the mineral taste to the water that you find in tap water, and spring water just seemed so bland and boring that the only time I ever actually liked drinking it was when I had run a marathon and was exhausted and any water would do.  Even now I bring bottled water to work, quickly finish it, and then drink tap water for the rest of the day.  I don't understand why people bring gallons of bottled water to work or the gym, or bring 4 16 oz. bottled water with them.  Made no sense.<br /><br />With Essentia I think I may have been turned.  Maybe it is the pH balance, but whatever they did to the water I absolutely love.  Crisp and fresh tasting, more so than normal bottled water.  I can see myself purchasing this and keeping it stocked.  They do come in rather large size bottles.  The one I had was 1.5 liters, but you receive 12 of them for around $28, which comes to a comparison shop of a little under a $1 per 16 oz. bottle.  From someone who doesn't like bottled water, I did enjoy this one quite a bit.<br /><br />5 stars.

review/summary: All Water Is Not The Same IMO
review/text: I have been drinking filtered water for many years. Ever since I was young I remember growing up drinking distilled water because my Uncle had sold my parents a distiller. Since then I have learned that the mineral content of the water is very important and also lends to a more smooth and refreshing drink. If any of you have tasted distilled water then you know what I mean.<br /><br />When I moved out and purchased my own house, I installed an R.O. filter under my kitchen sink and drank R.O. water for several years. R.O. water like distilled water has had most of the minerals removed during the filtration process. My local tap water has a pH of about 7.6 and a TDS (total dissolved solids) average of about 356 mS. My own R.O. water brought the conductivity down to around 30 mS and the pH to around 7 or slightly less. (I currently use my RO filter along with a de-ionizing filter afterwards to create ultra pure 0 mS TDS water for my Reef Tank) I do not drink it.<br /><br />I was introduced to "Kangen" or "ionized alkaline water" while I was traveling in Japan. It is water that has been filtered (usually thru a sediment, then a carbon block cartridge) and then run past energized Platinum plates to create 2 water streams. One stream is acidic and one is alkaline. The acid water can be used to clean, water plants and put topically on the skin amongst its many uses. The alkaline water is what you drink. Apparently during the ionizing process the water molecules are also altered. Usually water clusters together in 12 or so molecule clusters, while ionized water has smaller clusters of around 6-8 molecules. Supposedly this allows the water to cross the cell membranes in our bodies easier and promotes more rapid rehydration.<br /><br />Despite all the theories and studies, the real evidence for me is the way the water works for me. Before drinking alkaline water I would get heartburn or acid reflux occasionally after a long day of hard work or after eating certain foods. After several months of drinking alkaline water I never got acid reflux. Three years later since I first started drinking alkaline water I have only had acid reflux maybe twice. I would attribute that to the foods I ate that day and stressful work as well as not drinking the filtered water for several days prior. Alkaline water has improved my health in my opinion and am still drinking and prefer it to any other drinks when I am thirsty. It hasn't however kept me from getting sick occasionally or making me look many years younger. It has overall generally improved my health and I do feel better drinking it on a daily basis.<br /><br />Since I own a several thousand dollar alkaline water ionizer filter and drink the water daily. Own an R.O. filter and water testing equipment and understand a moderate amount of water chemistry principles. I was very curious to try this bottled version of alkaline water and see how it compares.<br /><br />It states on the label that the water has been R.O. filtered. Then minerals have been added back. It lists Sodium Bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. After the minerals have been added back then it is "alkalized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology. All of this sounds very familiar as this is exactly how alkaline water ionizers work. The water needs to have minerals added back to be able to ionize the water. Here is what I discovered after trying a bottle:<br /><br />Taste: I like the taste of it. It's not bad. It's light and refreshing and very similar to my own alkaline water.<br /><br />Smell: Clean. No noticeable "off" odors.<br /><br />Hydration Ability: Better than tap, but, "nano-clustered" water supposedly looses its smaller clustering formation over time measured in days. I wonder if the water is still structured the same by the time it gets to us to drink. Didn't seem to refresh quite as well as freshly made alkaline water.<br /><br />pH: Label states a pH of 9.5 which is on par with my ionizer unit which can produce a range of pH strengths from 7.0 to 12.0 I usually drink alkaline water with a pH of 9.<br /><br />Overall I like the water and would choose it first over any other bottled water at the connivence store. Its benefits would be the fact that it is filtered, has a proper mineral content (unlike distilled and RO water only), and has an alkaline pH. It's limitations to me seem to be the age of it thus potentially losing its small water clustering, as well as the plastic bottle is comes in. Many alkaline water aficionados recommend using glass containers first, stainless steel second and BPA free plastic third as the hierarchy of best water vessels to use. While not providing all the benefits of freshly made alkaline ionized water, it does provide a good many of them. Currently a 12 pack of 1.5L bottles on Amazon cost $28.75 and this translates to roughly $0.80 per 16 oz of water, which is not bad compared to $1.25 16 oz bottles at my local store. I think the 1.5 liter is a good size and a good quantity of water to drink per day of this water for most people. That amount to $2.40 per 1.5L bottle. I make my own for pennies on the dollar, but when including the initial investment of purchasing the ionizer along with replacement filter costs, buying these bottles will be cheaper for a long payback period. However if getting the absolute full benefits of alkaline ionized water is very important, you may want to consider purchasing an ionizing unit. These also would be a good way to test drinking this type of water before purchasing your own unit. In conclusion I think Essentia water is making a very good attempt to bring the benefits of alkaline ionized water to more people and I would purchase it over any other bottled waters.

review/text: This water is amazing.  After getting a bottle at Whole Foods, I knew this is the water I like and I immediately ordered a whole case of it.  The taste is awesome, does make you feel more hydrated upon drinking (electrolytes), and the very high pH level aids in bodily functions such as digestion.  My body loves it.  I've tried many artisan (aka= pricier) waters out there available on the market and this water now made its way to my groceries list.  The 3 waters I now drink everyday are Fiji (it has high silica content, which is great for the skin), Hawaiian Springs (an all-rounded good water, and the bottle is pretty so I drink it when I go out), and now Essentia.  I also suggest people to really look into the pH level of the waters they are buying; don't bother if it's lower than 7 because it won't really benefit your body much (you'll be amazed at how many of the pricier waters are below pH 7; and surprisingly, Whole Foods 365 water is a nice water that is price-friendly).

review/summary: Keeping One's Body Alkaline is Essential for Good Health.  Drinking Essentia Helps.
review/text: After a strenuous workout, one must drink plenty of water in order to replenish the electrolytes that were lost through sweating.  Water with an optimum pH level of 9.5 is better absorbed into one's body.  Most tap water and bottled water has a pH level of 7 or below.  Not only is Essentia enriched with electrolytes but it has an average pH level of 9.5.  Therefore, these electrolytes, which are essential for rehydration after a workout, are more readily absorbed into the body.  Bodybuilders have begun carrying gallon jugs of electrolyte rich water with a pH level of 9.5 to their gyms.  Over a few months, most of them have noticed that they recover quicker from their workouts.<br /><br />  I enjoy using one of the elliptical trainers inside the clubhouse at Holly Point Apartments where I live.  Usually, I drink Glaceau Smart Water [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T1302A">Glaceau Smart Water, 33.82-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>] after each of my workouts.  It tastes very refreshing and hydrates me better than ordinary tap water.  It is called Smart Water because it is rich in electrolytes.  Recently, I received a 1.5 Liter plastic bottle of Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water from the Amazon Vine Program.  Essentia is also rich in electrolytes but boasts a pH level of 9.5, which is essential for ensuring that these electrolytes are absorbed by the body.  As far as taste and smell, there is no difference between the Essentia and Glaceau.  (See the photograph that I have posted on the web site for this product.)  Odorless and colorless, both brands are very refreshing.  They readily quench my thirst after thirty minutes on the elliptical.  I've tried other brands of tap water {e.g., Aquafina (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042YSWLE">Aquafina Pure Water - 32 / 16.9 fl. Oz.</a>) and Dasani [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZY7Y9M">Dasani Purified Water (02762) 0.5 Liter (Pack of 24)</a>]} and they look and taste no different than my tap water.<br /><br />  Many nutritionists are constantly shouting that good health is obtained by eating fruits and vegetables because they make our bodies more alkaline (higher pH level).  An alkaline body resists disease.  Highly processed foods, junk foods, sugars, and meats cause our bodies to become more acidic (lower pH).  Acidic bodies are prone to disease and illness.  Cancer cells are fueled by foods that are acidic.  It only makes sense that our water is best when its alkaline level has a high pH level such as 9.5.  I've noticed that I feel more energetic after a workout when I drink Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water or Glaceau Smart Water in lieu of ordinary tap water that has been flavored with my favorite MIO sweet tea water enhancer [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  The MIO probably inhibits the absorption of much needed electrolytes.  Now, I only drink water enhanced with MIO at mealtime.  I continue drinking Essentia or Glaceau during and after my workouts.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/text: And that is pretty awesome.  It is silky smooth and rests well on my palate.  Sometimes these bottled waters, especially those with ulterior motives, can have an almost thick texture, but Essentia goes down with ease.  Now, this water is infused with electrolytes and is formatted to help reduce acid reflux and help with indigestion.  I must admit that this works rather well in that regard.  I've had an issue with indigestion for a while (years) and while I can't say that this has cured me entirely, I have noticed a difference in the way I feel.  I'm glad that some have compared this to Evian, because Evian is one brand of water I cannot stomach (talking of thick water), but Essentia is clean and smooth and serves its purpose beautifully.

I rarely drink bottled water, but when I do I often find the taste doesn't impress me much. Water is wet, tasteless, hydrating, that's it.<br /><br />I can say, as far as water goes, this Essentia water had zero funny, minerally, chemically taste to it. Pure and tasteless. I did appreciate that. I can't speak to the added pH factor because I'm not really sure what the benefits of that would look like in real time. I suppose if I only drank this water for a month through all the cycling, running and swimming I do I might see a difference, but that is a costly experiment for someone on a budget.<br /><br />All in all, decent bottled water, but nothing supernatural about it that would make me switch from tap.

review/summary: Silky, Smooth, pH Balanced Water
review/text: Disclosure:  I'm a tap water drinker at heart.  Give me a Camelback bottle and an hour in the refrigerator and I'll gladly drink our city water as is.  When I got the chance to try Essentia's purified, pH balanced water for review purposes, I jumped at it, mostly to find out what I was missing.  On balance, I like it better that tap water or some of the store bottled waters.  I'm probably too stingy to buy more myself, but if you think it would make the difference between drinking water and going without, I would highly recommend Essentia.<br /><br />Flavor:  Essentia is osmotically purified, then electrolytes* are added to mimic the subtle mineral flavors that you get with groundwater.  The result: A very clean water flavor, with an almost silky feel as you drink it.  The difference isn't huge -- it's all water, after all -- but it's definitely there, and it's definitely an improvement.<br /><br />pH Balance: As stated, this is pH balanced at 9.5.  I have to confess I haven't read anything on why you might want water this alkaline, and I didn't notice any difference while drinking it.  Still, if you're looking for an alkaline drink, this fits the bill.

review/summary: Great tasting water and good hydration!
review/text: Essentia is great tasting water. I don't like super cold water and most taste awful at room temperature so that is the temperature I judge water by. At room temp this water tasted great and I felt hydrated after drinking it which is the most important thing. I used reverse osmosis water before and no matter how much I drank I would still get dehydrated because of the 0 mineral content your body just doesn't hydrate. This water left me feeling great even after a very strenuous workout I didn't feel like I had to keep going for more and more water. This water has good mineral content and hydrates well and tastes really great what more can you ask for.

review/text: Essentia 9.5ph Drinking water is pretty much...water. It advertises a "silky smooth taste", but I think it just tasted like plain old tap water. We passed it around a group of people, sampling it and everyone agreed there is a definite metallic taste. I would take a pass on this brand.

review/summary: It's water
review/text: I tried this product while hiking Mount Whitney - you need good hydration while hiking and the electrolytes are a plus too.  Now I only had one bottle with me on the 20 mile hike so my experience is limited and the weather was perfect for hiking (i.e. not hot but very warm)<br /><br />The following is from the product page:<br /><br />"Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste."<br />- The perfect water has no taste and this had a slight bitter taste<br /><br />"Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive."<br />- On the trail, this water lasted a long time.  Therefore, I must assume that the hydration claim is valid<br /><br />"Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance."<br />-This of course is virtually impossible to evaluate<br /><br />"It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."<br />-Again, this is virtually impossible to evaluate.<br /><br />I would guess that if you are just looking for drinking water, this is a waste of money but if you are looking for water to drink while exercising or other physical activity where hydration is very important this might be worth looking into.

review/summary: Have you ever had...dry water?
review/text: Essential water sounded great...in theory. Just what I needed after running. After trying it, I guess i will stick to Gatorade to replenish electrolytes.<br /><br />I tried this water over several days and I have to say,  have never felt so thirsty whilst drinking so called "water". Let's start with the taste. I have tried spring water, as in 'put my hand in a spring and drink water' spring water and this can't taste any further from it. It tastes metallic and artificial at the same time. It leaves my mouth  with a horrible after taste. Not only that, after drinking it I was never dated. I have never been so thirsty after drinking water... Ever.<br /><br />The price of this is well above anything I would pay for water. At least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NPUTSq">Vitamin Water</a> tasted good.

review/summary: Not Better Than My Filtered Water
review/text: A couple years ago my dentists told me that tap water was rotting my teeth.  So it was time to make change.  Usually I just drink from the filter I attached to my kitchen faucet since bottled water is not good for the environment and sometimes bottled water manufacturers have been found to just put tap water in their bottles.  Essentia hypes "silky smooth taste" "hydrates better" "electrolytes infused" and "Best available pH at 9.5".  Okay, the last two sound like marketing mumbo jumbo.  It does have silky smooth taste, but really all water I have drank aside from unfiltered well or city water has silky smooth taste.  It does have a slight weird taste to it.  Not bad weird or good weird, just different taste to what I am used to.  As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.  Essentia will not get me to change from tap water, but if you only drink bottled water you may want to give it a try, it is a bigger bottle which makes it slightly better for the environment than the smaller bottles (but not s good as just buying a filter).

review/text: The makers of the water claim that Essentia is purified through reverse osmosis, is electrolyte infused, hydrates better and has a pH of 9.5.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I didn't think it was particularly smooth - I much prefer the taste of Fiji. I drank 1 glass a day for about a week and can't say I feel any miraculous results. I can get just as well hydrated with water from my Brita filter and not spend almost $30 bucks for 12 bottles of water...

Hydrates well although I think it is rather expensive and I personally didn't notice it hydrating any better than Arrowhead water which is what I normally drink. If, however, you have already discovered that high ph water helps you more than other types this water tastes good and would be a good choice.

review/summary: It is water.....
review/text: Other than orange juice in the morning I pretty much don't drink anything except water.  I received a 1.5 liter bottle to try of this purified water.  I think "purified" in the name says something.<br />The bottle says that they have "proprietary technology" which has purified the water by reverse osmosis then infused it with electrolytes for taste, alkalized and restructured it using ionic separation technology.  Okay, we will take their word for it, but none of that sounds any different from any other reverse osmosis to me and adding the "electrolytes" is what changes the pH of the water to make it alkalized and restructured, if I remember my chemistry correctly.  The ingredients are listed as purified water, sodium bicarbonate dipotassium phosphate magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride.  The bottle never gives a source but you can find Bothell WA, so most likely it comes from the public water supply there.<br /><br />More bottle information - Doctor recommended to protect improve and enhance the quality of your health.  Silky smooth taste, infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste 9.5 pH.  I have been told by my doctor to drink at least 2 liters of water daily.  I am a distance walker and live in a hot dry area of the country so any outside work or exercise requires a replacement of fluids and most likely electrolytes.  I don't like sports drinks.  So water with electrolytes is perfect for me.<br /><br />This water did taste good.  It was smooth.  I am just not sure that I want to drink water from a public water source when I can get water from a spring, drop in an electrolyte tablet and have the same thing.  So while I can't argue with any of the claims made on the bottle, I am not convinced enough that this is a "can't live without it" purchase.

review/summary: Noticeably great tasting water compared to regular bottled water
review/text: The Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water has a noticeably distinct taste compared to the regular bottled ones you buy in the store. And I say this from a bottled-water drinker perspective. Water in my part of the country is specially hard, even when applying consumer filtration. That is why we have regular drinking water delivery. But after trying Essentia, I have a brand new perspective of what drinking water should be. Nothing beats water that has been industrially treated with the right minerals and ph balance. Unlike other consumer grade bottled drinking water, the Essentia undergoes the usual filtration: reverse osmosis, UV, etc. but what makes this a truly long lasting hydrating liquid is that it is infused with electrolytes and life essential minerals that you cannot get with consumer-grade bottled water. Essentia hydrates better making drinking water fun and far in between. Very highly recommended!!

review/summary: Health claims aside, it's a unique tasting water
review/text: There are a number of interesting studies surrounding alkaline water and its health benefits.  A google search can be hard to find a good source given the amount of salesmanship surrounding this type of product.  However, I felt the livestrong website had a well-sourced write up ([...]).  Having only had one bottle to sample, the long term benefits are not my concern for the purposes of this review.<br /><br />What I did notice right away was that this water does actually have a unique taste -- as subtle as water tastes can be.  I thought it was actually quite pleasant and clean -- certainly better than the filtered tap water that comes out of my fridge.  The electrolytes, which can sometimes have an oily taste, are undetectable.<br /><br />The hydration factor is noticeable to me.  I would go out on a limb and say that it may even surpass the hydration factor of electrolyte water on its own (which can be made easily by buying electrolyte packs to add to water).<br /><br />Now, is the hydration factor and *potential* long term health benefit something that's worth more than double the price of, say, Poland Spring?  That's up to you.  There's not a lot of information surrounding how much of this stuff you'd need to drink to see health benefits.  So using it as a long term product might get quite expensive.  Using it for hydration after a long day, or when feeling sick would be my choice.

I can say that I did feel better hydrated first thing in the morning drinking this instead of my water.<br /><br />It tastes MUCH better than the majority of bottled waters out there that are little more than tap water. This is a thousand times better tasting than tap water. Essentia has no smell and no aftertaste. I will be using this before my morning workouts from now on.

review/summary: Superbly Refreshing
review/text: I drink water from my jug as I work through long days, and I love water so much, I usually drink more from a glass when I get home as well. Water is my drink of choice.<br /><br />This Essentia pH balanced water has an advantage over plain water when it comes to refreshment. I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.<br /><br />Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out. In every bit of honesty, I savored this bottle of water. I chugged, at a reasonable pace, every drop. I found it delicious, smooth and refreshing.<br /><br />Sure, it's more than just water; actually, it's purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide. Like most commercial beverages, this one has a formula as well, and it works out great.<br /><br />In the end, it's still water, but there is something favorable about water with a pH of 9.5. When chilled, this stuff is remarkably enjoyable. If you're a water connoisseur and you buy bottled water anyway, then definitely try Essentia - it's very nice.

review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is very refreshing and delicious.  I drink a lot of bottled water, and I'm very particular when it comes to taste.  This brand tastes better than most.  It ranks right up there with popular French brands when it comes to flavor.  I also enjoy that I can get a good electrolyte drink without calories or sugary taste.  There are times when I just don't want a sugary drink but I do need the added benefit of an electrolyte boost.  I'll try this brand again.

review/summary: Too much hype
review/text: The description for this product makes some rather bold claims such as normalizing your blood pressure, proving a better night's sleep, boosting heart health, and muscle strength.  When I see these sorts of claims, I get very suspicious.  I'm not a scientist, but these sorts of claims bother me when no studies are cited.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the 9.5 pH level is achieved by the addition of sodium bicarbonate, the same ingredient in many antacids.  If you really hate the taste of antacids, trying this water to get relief might be worth it.<br /><br />I have to admit that this water really does taste great.  It's difficult to describe the taste exactly, but it tastes much better than most bottled waters.<br /><br />For some odd reason, this water gave me a stomach ache, so despite the taste, I won't give it another try.<br /><br />I marginally recommend this item if you want to give it a try for relieving indigestion.

review/summary: Beats the heck out of the tap!
review/text: I have to take several pills each day and the rusty dirt that the local municipal water company seeps out of our kitchen faucets doesn't particularly further my eagerness to swallow them. Choosing instead to use Gatorade or the Mio water flavoring is neither ideal or inexpensive in the long run either. I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find the Essentia pH Drinking water a nice alternative to flavorings plus the bottle that was supplied by Amazon was much larger than I expected. At the current price point this offers very good value for money especially when compared to the little 8oz bottles you can get at the store.<br /><br />Now I can't comment on the additional positives added by the pH levels boasted on the bottle, nor can I honestly say whether this water tastes 'good' compared to others. It tastes like clean water. I can say that some of the pills I take (steroids) taste awful so it's nice to be able to down them with a cold refreshing bit of aqua instead of brown sludge or sickly sweet drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, if like me, your water supply is less than stellar then you can't go wrong with this brand for cost or quantity.

If you are going to purchase bottled water it's a GOOD thing that the bottle is BPA and Phthalate free plus recyclable. I drank some of the water plain, tasted like regular water to me, and made a pot of coffee with most of it, it DID make a GOOD pot of coffee!

review/text: If this water tastes like your tap water, we should all live where you live!  My tap water is terrible and this is some of the best tasting water I have had.  I am already a regular drinker of PH water but it is  8.4 and this particular one is 9.5.  I have found that PH water really does give me more energy and I have found that it allows me to eat some foods I love that I used to have more problems with because of the acid, like  tomatoes and uncooked apples.<br />I know this water  is man made but they do the job right with reverse osmosis.  I  love the extra things added to this water because many of us need them so much in our busy lives, things like electrolytes and potassium. I will buy this water as an extra when I am out and about or when I run out of water but I am sticking with my 8.4 alkaline water because it is cheaper, has the same smooth, good  taste and is natural as well as less expensive than this one.

However I'm not to sure how impressed I am with it overall.<br />The water itself seems to have a filmy taste to it although my kids didn't seem to notice,if the water is chilled its somewhat less noticeable. The price for 12, 1.5 liter bottles seems to fluctuate quiet a bit on here since the price yesterday was double what it is today. The size of the bottle is nice especially for a work environment so you don't have to get up as much for refills.<br />As far as this water is concerned  I think ill just stick to tap water or something like mountain spring bottled water instead.

I couldn't.  It tastes like water, refreshing when cold.  After drinking it for a few days, I didn't notice any significant difference in my biological functions.  Perhaps drinking nothing but pH adjusted water for weeks would make a difference.  It didn't do much for me.<br /><br />In short, it's decent bottled water.  If you like still bottled water in plastic bottles, then you probably would enjoy this as much as any other.

It's certainly something I would try, as it SEEMS to have more benefits than other bottled water.
