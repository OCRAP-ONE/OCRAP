review/summary: A favorite!
review/text: This (creamy bacon), in my opinion, is one of the best Walden Farms dressings. It is thick and has a good bacon taste. Another rater mentioned that if you like vinegar dressings, you will like this. I guess that's true, because I like to cut this dressing with organic apple cider vinegar and liquid zero calorie sweetener, which makes a nice sweet bacon vinaigrette dressing - that reduces my sodium intake. Even so, it just as much straight from the bottle. The only other flavor or dressing I like nearly as much is the Balsamic vinaigrette one. I thought this was Creamy Bacon dressing, so the review belongs with that flavor, not bacon ranch. Sorry!

review/text: This may be healthy but the bacon flavor is bad. I let my wife try it and she did not care for either. Amazon has to charge Prime customer's shipping so I don't buy it any more. I buy Walden Farms barbecue sauce and love it. It is pricey but is worth it.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: I was told about this company by my weight loss HCG doctor. Never heard of it before. By now I've tried quite a few of their products, and this one was just OK to me. It works great, however, when poured on salad, but on chicken, fish and on its own, it doesn't taste too good. Resemblance with bacon is far fetched. But I guess being on the diet of 500 calories a day everything would go just to add some taste to the food.

review/text: The reviews are evenly divided between one stars and five stars. I'm not sure why they taste so bad to some people.  I like all their dressings, especially this one.  But I'm a serious health food nut (always have been) not by choice but by necessity.  And I think that people who don't like them are used to full fat, full sugar, msg, etc., I keep reading the labels, hard to believe there's little or no junk in something with almost nil carbs, calories, etc.

review/summary: European formula is delicious
review/text: I moved to the US after living in Europe for almost 9 years. While living in Europe, I always had Ovaltine on hand; it's great to have with warm milk at night. After moving to the US, I bought Ovaltine here and was horrified to find so much sugar in it. Why must everything in the US be laden with sugar??? Anyway the "European" formula is great and I'm relieved to know I can still get it.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add.

So, I just made the switch to the european brand b/c it has way less sugar.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a chocolate flavor, but I I started mixing it in w/ his American malt chocolate ovaltine and now he drinks the european one straight without even noticing the flavor difference.  And believe me, there is a huge flavor difference.  My husband is repulsed by this european brand which tastes like brewers yeast and barley, but my son thinks he's getting a special treat!  I personally enjoy the flavor.

review/text: Wonderful to find a guilt-free pleasure like this product. To me there was NO aftertaste and it was just sweet enough without being overpowering. The cocoa tasted rich and I found that I only needed 1 tablespoon to 1 cup of hot water, which means my hot chocolate drink had only 10 calories if I calculate correctly. I can't imagine needing 4 tablespoons to 1 cup of hot water as the label suggests, but then I rarely eat any chocolate or sugar at all. Anyway, this was a very pleasant surprise and a fun treat to indulge in. I'll be ordering more....

review/summary: No difference from real Hot Cocoa
review/text: This is a great low calorie/sugar replacement for hot cocoa. It tastes just like the real thing, though not as sweet; that's easily fixed by adding an artificial sweetener, however.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the instructions suggest a crazy powder to water ratio; something like 4 tbsp to 1 cup. I cut it down to 2 tbsp and it works nicely. Aside from that, it doesn't dissolve into hot water easily. The first time I made it, I only stirred it for a few seconds, and ended up with a lot of grit. I've since learned that you need to stir it vigorously for a minute or longer to make it fully dissolve.

Coconut has been vilified by some in previous years for being a saturated fat, and therefore unhealthy, but more recent evidence suggests that although it is a saturated fat, it is a different type of saturated fat than the saturated fats in animal products, and in fact is especially healthy. The more recent evidence suggests that coconut, especially coconut oil, helps with weight loss and is heart healthy.<br /><br />All I know is that it fits in well with a lower carbohydrate diet, has plenty of fiber, and can be used in many recipes.<br /><br />In fact, I'm about to have my hot brekafast cereal containing almond meal and coconut.

I've only found these at one small grocery store chain in Utah (Macey's), and so I am happy to finally find it available on Amazon. Before, there were one or two sites I found after much searching, but the shipping charges (I live in HI) were outrageous.  On Amazon they are a fraction of the price found elsewhere.<br /><br />This candy has the perfect flavor and consistency--clearly grapefruit and chewy rather than gummy.

If you are looking for NONspicy, "americanized" ramen, this is it. Give it a try.

I'm a ramen lover and if you're one too, this will last you a while and you will enjoy it all the way to the last bag.

review/text: Was able to get this type of noodles (creamy chicken) before one of our major grocery stores folded. No one in the area has the selection they used to carry. This was my favorite & I have missed it for years. Couldn't even find it on the Maruchan sight. Once you try them, your in love. Great lunch for on the go!

review/text: Love this stuff. But as you notice, the price jump from around 4 dollars with S/S to 8-10 dollars the last week or two is just amazon trying to catch subscribers that sign up to pay for double the price.<br />I wish amazon would lock in the prices on subscription stuff when you purchase it the first time (lock in price) , but they don't , so buyer beware.<br />If you can get it for around 4 dollars get it. :)

review/summary: My kids love this creamy chicken flavor
review/text: My kids love ramen noodles, and although I know they are high in salt and fat I buy them as an occasional treat.  For years their favorite has been the regular chicken flavor, but I bought these creamy chicken flavored ramen noodles after reading the reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />The kids love them even better than the regular chicken ramen flavor.  They are expensive here on Amazon - .35 cents each as opposed to .20 for the regular chicken flavor at the grocery store.  But with a $25 purchase you get free Super Saver shipping. And I've never seen the creamy chicken brand in stores.

review/text: As I said, I really like this stuff but couldn't help but comment on the price. I thought I was seeing things. $27.00 for 24 0f these. I just bought a 24 package at Wal-Mart for around FOUR BUCKS ($4.00). You can buy singles for .18 a piece in a varity of flavors. That's EIGHTEEN CENTS. No wonder the seller has BANDITT in their name. I'm a prepper and stock up on these pretty much every time I go shopping. I probably keep 100 or so handy and they are still quite good a couple of years or more beyond their expiration date. I just ate some 2010 and they were fine.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: After seeing so many 5 star reviews on this flavor of Ramen, I was anxious to try it so I ordered a case. It arrived 5 days later. I am a fan of instant Ramen but haven't tried many flavors since ones like these aren't sold in my local store. I cooked some for lunch with some veggies, adding about 1 1/2 cups of water. The flavor was great, it was delicious, rich and creamy. Though the amount of water I added was probably too much, I shouldve only added a cup -1 and 1/4 cups, the broth wouldve been richer, but then again I do have 23 more packs. If you are looking for a rich instant soup, Id recomend this. this is hands down the best chicken flavored Ramen Ive tried. It may even be my new favorit flavor. It seems like it would be great with eggs added to the soup. Try this ramen, you wont be disappointed. Very tasty and delicious. Though if you are looking for authentic asian Ramen, this isn't it, it's a very americanized flavor.

review/summary: Standard Maruchan, flavor/smell NOT for everyone
review/text: I am a college student that has been out of part-time work this term and ran tight on a budget. I feasted on ramen noodle for months, and Maruchan is a familiar brand name. I've eaten them before and they are definitely the most cost-efficient option around. In terms of doing its job,a normal pack of Maruchan ramen gets a 5/5.<br /><br />That being said, there must be a few notes included:<br />-If you are used to eating Asian ramen, these do NOT compare texture wise and taste wise. After eating Maruchan for 50% of my meals for a month, switching back to Asian ramen noodle made me realize how poor Maruchan is. You get what you pay for, but personally I feel just as satisfied eating one pack of Asian ramen vs 2 packs of Maruchan<br />-I have been eating ramen for a while, so when I saw this flavor on Amazon I was intrigued. However, the smell is just weird for me, and I prefer regular chicken flavor over this flavor. It's not for everyone<br /><br />Overall, it does its job. After getting giftcards online for Amazon, I can't complain getting practically free food 12 meals. That said, I would prefer other more standard flavors, and that's why this gets a 4/5, even though it's so standard.

review/summary: Pretty good, but not too different from the regular Chicken flavor.
review/text: Given all the rave reviews I figured I'd give this a try.  Been eating the regular Chicken flavor Maruchan for years, and recently tried the Lime Chili Shrimp which is quite good.  The Creamy Chicken tastes like a slightly diluted version of Chicken with a bit of additional richness in the soup from the cream.  It's pretty good, and seems to be less salty than Chicken, with less MSG/artificial taste.  Don't expect anything wildly different, though.

review/summary: Waffles got high rating from my TEEN!
review/text: I have a teen that literally *cringes* everytime I cook something "whole grain". She is a fan of white bread, regular pancakes, etc. I have no idea why this is as she was raised on whole grain - but some things just are I guess.<br /><br />I made this mix as waffles this morning. They turned out amazing - held their form and came out slightly crispy on the outside and cooked inside. That's not always the case with whole grain waffles. They are heavy and dense but very tasty. I added less milk than the recipe called for (about 1/3 c. less) and added 2 tbsp of whole wheat flour and they turned out perfectly! They'd probably  be o.k. with just the milk adjustment (too runny!) but I like to tinker.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for us - the bonus is that as filling as these are one box made a whole lotta waffles - so we'll have breakfast for the next several days!

We like this, but it's definitely an acquired taste.<br />- Separates if too much liquid is added so you can't make thin hotcakes or crispy light waffles with this mix.<br />- The boxes are tiny, a lot of product goes a little way. We get two breakfasts plus a few to freeze per box.

review/summary: These make me want to eat salad
review/text: I've never been a big vegetable eater but in the interests of living a healthier lifestyle I decided to start having a green salad every day. Sadly I used to regard this salad as a dreaded chore; that handful of lettuce and veggies just seemed so insubtantial and unappealing that I had to talk myself into eating it each time.<br /><br />Enter Texas Toast Garlic and Butter croutons. These things are absolutely delicious, they go with pretty much any dressing, and they are big and crunchy enough that they've successfully transformed my salads from mere exercises in self-discipline into legitimate, full-fledged meals. It's gotten to the point where I actually crave my daily salad, something I had never thought possible.<br /><br />So to conclude... these things taste pretty darn good and I highly recommend them.<br /><br />PS: You can probably find them much cheaper in your local grocery store than you can on Amazon.

However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are.

review/summary: No Maltodextrin!!!
review/text: This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly.

review/summary: shake diet
review/text: Okay, I bought this product to do a shake diet. Instead of two scopes, I use one unless I was going to exercise, then I use two scoops. This is real good. I use water for my shakes so it won't be more calories. If you ever decide to do a shake diet, just know you're going to piss it off if you use water, milk have you on the toilet so it's best to do the water. I love this product! I've bought it two times and I've dropped off 20 pounds just doing a shake diet.<br /><br />Do one scoop [do two scoops thirty minutes to an hour before going exercising]<br />Do this every hour [you can have two solid meals but don't go over 250 calories, and no drinking shakes or eating after 8]<br />Use water instead of milk<br /><br />That's how I did it and I lost a lot. I would have gave it five stars but the price went up. When I first bought this product, I paid twenty-five dollars and some cents. Now it's almost thirty dollars. They need to go back down on the product. But if you're not doing a shake diet and just use this for workouts and stuff, I don't know how it's going to work you. Well I do know when you workout, you going to feel it like with any other workout but the next day, you will not be sore. That's why I love it. When I'm exercising, I feel the burn, the pain. I even feel it once I'm done but later that day or the next day, the pain is gone! If you buy this product, you'll love it! Great taste too if you know what you're doing.

review/summary: Great taste, Great Results
review/text: This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results.  This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake.  It fills me up, it can be used as a meal replacement.  It also has helped me increased muscle size much faster then previously.  This product is great and I recommend it for anyone from an everyday Joe just trying to get into shape to people who are very serious about working out.

review/summary: Very nice flavor
review/text: I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.

review/text: Althought he price wasn't the cheapest around, I was in a pinch and decided to use my prime account to get this protein really fast. I love it. It tastes like brownie batter - best protein out there, although its a MRP so the calories are a bit higher than a standard whey pr casein. Nice blend and great product.

review/summary: I use it as chocolate dessert replacement.
review/text: If one loves chocolate, this works great in a very low carb diet instead of sugar laden cake one can buy. I use 1 1/2 of the enclosed measuring spoon full of it and add very little water to it. Have it with my afternoon coffee like a small bowl of chocolate. My cravings for sweets have vanished. (1) Have taken the glamor out of chocolate. (2) Have made it practical. (3) In spite of being near the fridge all day working from home, I restrained myself to looking forward to this one dessert once a day. Now I'm used to it and feeling in charge.

I'm going to try ordering something other than the Vanilla Ice Cream .

review/summary: Alright
review/text: I have just started using this supplement after workouts and it has taken me a bit to figure out a taste combo that I can live with. The milk-shake flavor may be a little bit overboard. I would probably like just a normal chocolate flavor. The recommendation is two scoops but I use one and I still feel the taste is quite strong. I mix one scope of this with 2 cups of almond breeze almond milk and sometimes some frozen strawberries - blend it in my blender and it is a great drink. It also provides enough chocolately flavor to cure any possible sweet tooth I might have.

review/text: Labrada Lean Body is the best tasting meal replacement shake available!  I've been buying MRP shakes for over 10 years and I haven't found another brand that comes close to this.  It tastes great and mixes completely.  No clumping.  I have only tried the chocolate ice cream flavor ( and the chocolate peanut butter in the packets) so I can't speak on the taste of the vanilla or strawberry.  If you are looking for a good MRP, this is it.  Don't waste your money on anything else.

review/text: Tried this product after doing a little research online (including here).  The product lived up to its good reviews.  Like most protein shakes, this is best cold.  I usually make a drink after exercising but with classes starting back up, I plan on switching to mornings since I'll be preoccupied during class.  The only downside to the product for me was trying to find the perfect amount of 10oz. of water to get the shake to taste perfect (I think I managed that feat twice), but nonetheless, it's still good.

review/text: Look, I know there are nasty tasting whole earth raw shakes out there that are seriously nasty, and as an industry we've come a long way in flavor with these, but this vanilla ice cream powder is so nasty that I cannot describe it other than to say that it smells like a cheap "buttercream cupcake" candle, and it tastes like a whole truckload of quarters and fake Splenda sweetener rusting in your mouth...the way your mouth is cold when you haven't slept all night, like all that nasty at the same time.<br /><br />Now with all that said, the chocolate ice cream flavor is the best ever!! I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe. Get the chocolate and give it a little more water than it calls for, it's great.<br /><br />Gonna try the strawberry one next, hopefully it's like the chocolate one.
