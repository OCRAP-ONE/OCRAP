review/summary: Expensive Tea
review/text: This tea is just ordinary without any distinctive flavors. The thistle tastes just like the whiskey flavor. The bags are small but brew a strong cup of tea quickly. For the price, I was hoping for more.

review/text: Purchased these while in Scotland in 2009.  Been drinking them ever since. Originally had to order from Scotland and have them delivered to the US.  Thank you Amazon for providing them in the US! Have to agree with the other review - each one does have its own distinct flavor. While I use a little sugar, I do not use milk/cream. I add a bit of Whisky to the whisky flavored one for a bit more kick! Wonderful teas! Thank you!

review/summary: Wonderful way to start your day!
review/text: I was originally searching for a Scottish Breakfast tea when I stumbled upon this 4-pack. I am a tea person and can't think of a better way to start my day each morning. These teas are delightful! Each tea has a subtle difference in taste, but it's made more evident when you add just a bit of milk. These are also very strong teas and I would recommend adding sugar to suit your taste. I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.

review/summary: To Die For!
review/text: I'm in love!  My husband brought me a Caramel Cob from Utah while on a business trip - he thought it would be a fun little gag gift.  He was so wrong - one bite and I was in love with the soft, sweet, buttery caramel corn shaped like an ear of corn.  I was immediately hooked and went (a little) nuts looking for Caramel Cob in Las Vegas.  I even called Caramel Cob headquarters but they weren't able to find a distributor in town for me.  I went to the next best place - Amazon!  I found Caramel Cob on Amazon and it was a much better buy and it was also shipped for free.  When my box of 18 Caramel Cobs arrived it was difficult to pace myself and eat only one a day.  And as for sharing, well, let's just say, if you can find out where I've hidden them you deserve to have one!<br /><br />One of the best ways to eat Caramel Cob is to open the top of the wrapper and heat it in the microwave for about 15 seconds - the caramel softens a bit and the warm buttery taste will make you swoon.  Don't miss an opportunity to fall in love!

review/text: I bought a couple of these from my local grocery store and was so sorry I had not bought more. These are so gooey,chewy and full of flavor. I never did try them warm just straight out of the bag! I have been looking for them for the last few months and have not had any luck in finding them in stock. So as always Amazon comes to the rescue and was able to order them. Like one of the other reviewers pointed out "If you like hard and crunchy these are not for you".

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!
review/text: I moved from Texas to Ohio a few weeks ago and happened to run across these at a local farmer's market. I bought one solely because I thought the packaging was cute and I love popcorn balls and this is essentially a popcorn ball shaped like an ear of corn. I've searched far and wide for good store bought popcorn balls and usually couldn't find them until around Halloween and even then they were sub par. Same goes for up here, the only place I could find these was at a farmer's market where they were selling them for $3 a pop! So until now I was stuck making my own which is really a pain. As soon as I sunk my teeth into one of these I was in love. The popcorn is rich, buttery, and delicious, they are oozing with caramel which is exactly how I like it but surprisingly they aren't overly sweet. Everything about these is just right, the crunch, the sweetness, the softness, the butteriness, everything is just perfect. I raved to my husband about how awesome they were but how I couldn't find them anywhere besides that one place but they still were over priced and he surprised me by buying me this 18pk. I'm going to have to pace myself and not eat them all in one day which I could certainly see myself doing with how delicious they are. Now I must add that this stuff is soft and very caramely so if you are looking for the crunchy caramel corn that comes in the holiday tins, this is not what you want to buy.

review/text: I live in FLorida and there aren't many places to get good carmelcorn.  This is chewy with lots and lots of carmel.  If you like hard and crunchy this is NOT for you.  If you like to have the caramel dripping from the popcorn, try this, it is awesome. It is like getting it from the copper bowl all chewy and warm.

review/text: My bride enjoys carmel corn. Except for one or two mom and pop shops scattered around the country, she has not found what she considers really good carmel corn. She went so far as to start making her own. So I bought her this product as a Christmas stocking stuffer. SHE LOVES IT! Great chewability and not overly sweet. She softenens it up by putting it in the micro for 10 to 15 seconds. Looks like I'll be buying this on a regular basis.

review/text: This yummy, chewy, sweet treat is the best thing I've had in a long time.  I had tried 2  purchased in a supermarket and once I tasted they lasted all of 20 minutes (long enough for me to get the second one open).  Went back for more and they had none left so went online to search and thankfully found them, and at a great price, thanks Amazon!!  If you want a chewy, carmelly treat this is what you've been looking for.  I've already ordered 4 cartons (we have a large family and everyone loves them,and especially my 94 yr. old mother, for whom they are soft and chewy enough).

review/text: I have bought many times from Amazon but never written a review. But I am totally addicted to this caramel corn. I had bought one a time or two when I saw in stores. It was great and much softer than the bagged or boxed types I had tried before. Tried making Orville R's microwave version and it was messy and popcorn turned mushy. I recommend this heated, I break them in half and warm on a plate in the microwave (about 30 seconds in mine). The result is a plate full of warm, gooey caramel popcorn. Just ordered my 3rd case!

review/text: I read multiple reviews prior to purchasing this product.  Most all of them RAVED about this product, so I was really anxious to receive the shipment so I could try for myself!  What a letdown!!  They aren't at all crunchy... You could kindly call them "soft and chewy" or describe them as they seemed to me, more "tough and spongy".  After eating part of one, I threw the rest of that one away.  Then I gave the other 17 in that box and another whole box of 18 away {As I said, I was impressed with the reviews I had read and kind of over-bought!!).  The general feedback I got was maybe 50-50.  Some liked them, but alot had the same opinion as I did. The actual taste was OK... it was the texture that killed them for me...  Just one opinion from Oregon.

review/summary: Best I have found
review/text: First, I want pure coconut milk when I buy coconut milk. Please, read labels when buying this product, as there are many out there with fillers and chemicals which have no place in coconut milk. There will be a bit of thickener (Guar gum, as a rule), but nothing else should be there.<br /><br />Second, this product is very versatile. It can be used in soups, sauces, salad dressings and deserts. One of my favorite uses is to make a chocolate dipping sauce with cocoa and stevia - Diabetics and low carb eaters - this is WONDERFUL for fruit. It has great flavor, although very mild, and does not dominate other flavors when used in recipes. Yummy!<br /><br />You may find it has "separated" slightly when you open it. This is normal, just stir and use. I put mine in a glass storage container if I need to do this, as it is easier to stir in something other than the can.<br /><br />Enjoy!

I would recommend taking at least a 5-7 tablespoons  full if you want any noticeable effect on your first dose (think I've taken up to 15 at once). Anyway, I'd recommend buying the 2lb bag for the price break. I liked this stuff so much that you'll also see another review from me on the 2lb bag! Everyone should know about this stuff... Long story short, buy this stuff because at least in my case it helped heal my gums, gave me more energy, decreased my sugar cravings, and increased my sex drive. Try it once and review it, this product could truly change your health.  Oh yeah, I should also mentioned that the stupid shipping company lost my order the first time, but GoBio! was nice enough to send a replacement by Expressmail...

review/summary: Great Tasting Low Salt Mix
review/text: I recently bought some of this at a local market.  I decided to try it because for quite some time now I have purchased Morton's Light Salt to cut down on the some of the sodium I take in.  This Diamond Crystal blend is not only cheaper than the Morton's for a generous amount more, but it also taste better in my opinion.  Like the Morton's, it contains a full one third less sodium.  But where the Morton's uses the popular substitute Potassium Chloride that has a slight metallic taste to it, the main substitute ingredient in this Diamond Chrystal blend is Silicon Dioxide, which to me has a much more natural salt taste.  I prefer it over the potassium chloride, and as already mentioned, you get more for your money with this blend making it a sure deal. It took me no time at all to get used to it, and I use it in my cooking as well as in the shaker as well.  If you have trouble finding it locally, I suggest you pick it up by the case here on Amazon and you will be set for a year or more.  A real good salt substitute, (that does contain real salt as well) that I recommend...

review/summary: Carmel Corn Clusters with Cranberries and Nuts!
review/text: This was a really surprising delicious caramel corn. The kernels were very large and the caramel was really buttery and flavorful. There were not as many cranberries as advertised on the package but it was a tasty treat.<br />  This is not for anyone with tender teeth as the nuts would easily cause some folks to seek dental work after consuming. The almonds in particular were very tough to chew and the caramel is a tougher type akin to hardball/crack stage of making homemade caramel.<br />  This product is of a much denser consistency than the typical grocery store Fiddle Faddle or Cracker Jack brands.<br />  Overall it was something completely different and would be enjoyed by most at the holidays.

Easy to understand directions, although I couldn't read it the directions had pictures that were step by step. My husband loves the fact that the seaweed is kept apart from the rice, so that the seaweed doesn't get soggy. These are great with smoked salmon in the middle!

review/summary: Great, Great, Great!!!
review/text: After living in Japan for about 8 years, I got used to picking up different flavors of "rice triangles" at the convenience stores off base.  They made for the perfect breakfast, lunch, or snack.<br /><br />The REALLY neat thing about how they are packaged in Japan (and in this set), is that the seaweed sheet is wrapped inside its own little plastic section so it doesn't come in direct contact with the rice unitl you actually open it.  That way the seaweed doesn't get soft and mushy because of the moisture in the rice.  All you do is peel the tab at the top of the rice triangle to expose the seaweed (like unwrapping a pack of cigarettes), and then slip off the 2 halves of plastic, and you have your perfectly wrapped little treat - crunchy seaweed and all!<br /><br />When I rotated back to the U.S., I really missed them, and am very happy to have found these.<br /><br />The directions on how to make the rice triangle and wrap the seaweed around it correctly are fairly easy to follow (pictures, thank God).  I already have Japanese friends here asking where they can buy them.<br /><br />Also, I was the envy of those sitting around me on the plane when I whipped two of these out and everyone else was stuck eating either junk food or over-priced airline sandwiches!<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: A great set
review/text: If you love rice/onigiri, this is a must-have. You will get one rice mold (mine was pink instead of blue, as in the picture) and a package with 10 sheets of nori wrappers. The instructions for the wrappers are a little hard to follow, but after doing it twice it is relatively easy. I bought these so I could make an onigiri in the morning, toss it in my bag and have it for lunch at work. I'm not confident enough in my wrapping skills to throw the onigiri in my bag quite yet, but I will get there.<br /><br />These sheets of nori are packaged individually between one sheet of shiny plastic and one sheet of non-stick plastic. They are air-tight. This makes the nori unbelievably fresh. In addition, the nori itself is thinner than the nori I usually use, which allows the nori to stay stuck to the rice (thicker sheets tend to unpeel themselves), and makes it easier to bite into. In short, they are designed especially for onigiri.<br /><br />... but the really special thing about these wrappers is the layer of nonstick plastic between the rice and the nori. When you peel away the wrapper, the rice and nori meet for the first time. When I bit into the first onigiri I made from this set, I was absolutely blown away. Never have I had nori so fresh. Texturally, it's a totally different experience. Instead of chewy or soggy, the nori is dry and crunchy. It breaks apart easily. If you have had sushi before, you know that the seaweed wrapped around the outside is kind of chewy and impossible to bite in half. This seaweed is exactly the opposite because it doesn't absorb any moisture from the air or the rice until the moment you're ready to eat it.<br /><br />I know that these sheets are used all over Japan to package convenience store onigiri. Because they are made especially for onigiri, they are especially good. I will be repurchasing more wrappers in the future. They are really wonderful!

Starbucks is more expensive than the everyday coffee brands so anyone shopping for those would find Starbucks expensive. I recommend to all my Starbucks loving friends, family and YOU to buy it here on Amazon where the price is great and shipping is fast! Italian Roast may not be your favorite but search for yours on Amazon and I'm just about sure you'll find it!

review/summary: A worthwhile bargain
review/text: When you "subscribe" to one of the Starbucks products, you set a schedule for them to send you coffee at a discount, every month or whatever. The price is right, and you can hold off shipments if you overestimated, or invoke an immediate shipment if you're running low. The only complaint I have about this great deal is that you have to purchase 3 packages of the same type of coffee at once. This can get monotonous if you don't roar through coffee (at work, say). A good deal, it could be made better.

The whole thing works together beautifully in my opinion.<br /><br />This goes great with shrimp as a cocktail sauce, and that is where the rest of my bottle went.  I will be buying this again.

review/text: This is one of the few times that Amazon has really let me down.  According to the company that sold this item -- Nutricity is the name of the company -- Amazon mispublished the price of the item.  I was supposed to get 60 of the Numi pots for the price they advertised, but I only got 10, because according to the company that these pots came from, Amazon made a mistake.  No one called me to correct the mistake, but it was corrected on Amazon when I back on-line to see what had happened.  I kept a copy of the advertised price that I bought the pots for.  I am terribly disappointed that I was not contacted by Amazon and told of the mistake.  So, instead of 60 pots for $265+, I got stuck with 10 pots.  I called the manufacturer and asked to return the pots with them paying the postage for the mistake.  The rep at Nutricity said she'd get back to me.  I never heard from here again.

My machine states I can use both cotton candy floss or hard candy, so I thought we'd give this floss a try. We purchased both the pink vanilla and blue raspberry flavors. They arrived today and I couldn't wait to try it. This stuff worked so much better than the hard candy.  We used the scoop that came with the machine, and I was surprised how big and fluffy it turned out. One scoop made a regular sized cotton candy just like at the carnival or fair. With the hard candies I was getting just a small amount at a time. The flavor is the flavor I remember from my youth. Absolutely YUMMY!!! Will definitely buy this again when needed. But the 4lb container is so big, it should last us a very long time.

review/summary: Sweet, delicious treat!
review/text: So happy I placed my order with this company! Order shipped quickly, was delivered before promised and size is great for the price. Took my cotton candy maker to my classroom for a fun activity for my fourth graders at the end of the year and they had a blast spinning their own delicious treats! The pink vanilla is my favorite flavor and is usually what I order but this floss sugar has the best flavor of any others I've ever ordered so I'm confident I'll be a return customer and may even try some of their other delicious flavors! I recommend this product with complete confidence to anyone with a sweet tooth and a cotton candy maker!

review/summary: cotton candy
review/text: It took a little long to get going in the machine, but once it did it tasted great. The kids loved it. It tasted just like the pink cotton candy at the fair. It's much better using this than trying to crush hard candy and put it in the machine. This cotton candy floss makes light and fluffy cotton candy.

review/summary: Awesome - the real deal
review/text: I ordered this to go with my Nostalgia cotton candy machine (which didn't come with any sugar/floss).  This is just like the stuff you get at a county fair.  It was nummy and easy to do.  The smell is incredible.  I have even eaten some of the sugar without flossing it in the machine.  :) (naughty me).  If you want to do cotton candy at home--this is what you are looking for.  Be care - the 4lb bottle is enough for a hundred cones.

review/summary: It works
review/text: It's a shame that Amazon doesn't offer more choices in the sizes of this product. I read the reviews and I thought this flavor would produce the original pink cotton candy flavored floss, but it's not quite the same. It's close, but the flavor is slightly different and the floss isn't quite as soft as I expected. I wasn't looking for any other flavor of floss, especially since the machine I bought works with any flavor of hard candy you want to try, so I'm a bit disappointed that I'm stuck with this huge container of sugar that isn't quite what I wanted. It would be nice if they offered smaller sizes, like pints, of original flavor floss sugar, and even nicer if they included one with the machine when you purchase it.

review/summary: Nice spice
review/text: Got the 5-pack of this because it came with free Prime shipping, so 1 bottle (without Prime) would've cost about the same as the 5. It's nice, I actually use it quite a bit, but it's sort of bland. I was hoping it would have a more distinctive vibrant flavor, but it's more of a "background" spice blend, to use when something needs a little more body. Works well for that.<br /><br />Out of the 5 bottles, I gave one away, 2 others were fine, 1 bottle has a horrible 45 degree "lean" like it was exposed to a lot of heat at some point but the contents seem OK, and 1 bottle was chock-full of live moth larvae. I've gotten a number of spices and grain products over the years that have been infested before opening, so I guess it means they didn't irradiate the spices here, which is a good thing!?!? One bug-egg can easily make it through processing, especially since herbs aren't usually heat-treated, but together with the leaning bottle I'd have to say their quality metric wasn't exceptional.

review/summary: Konriko Seasoning makes good jerky great..
review/text: This product was discontinued in my shopping area.  I found it on the web and ordered a case. This is by far one of the best cajun seasonings I have ever found and I've done a lot of shopping for different flavors for my chili and beaf jerky.  Every time I make a new batch of jerky people say that the last batch was much better. Usually the only difference was that I left out my old standby Konriko. I have turned every meat I can get into jerky.  I know a little bit about what people like.  Spicy, not hot.

review/summary: Konriko Creole Seasoning
review/text: Konriko is my favorite Creole Seasoning and  it's hard, no, impossible to find in local (Mesa/Phoenix AZ) grocery stores. Other brands of creole/cajun seasoning can't hold a candle to this one for overall great taste and just the right amount of heat. Found Konriko  online with best price/lowest shipping cost at Amazon. However, lowest per-unit cost  was achieved by buying the 12-pack.  More than I really needed at one time, but it's nonperishable, and extras should keep  OK stored in freezer.  Easy transaction and the 12-pack of seasoning arrived in a flash--- excellent order fulfillment!

review/summary: 100% Kona - not easy to find!
review/text: Many coffee brands that advertise their beans as &quot;Kona&quot; are blends, containing only ten percent beans from the highly desirable region, but these Aloha Island Gold beans are pure Kona, all from plants grown on the Big Island in the designated microclimate that produces some of the smoothest coffee beans in the world. While the Aloha brand may not be Hawaii's best, it is certainly one of the more available brands on the mainland.  Store in the freezer to maintain optimal freshness, and grind the beans immediately before brewing.<p>For coffee connoisseurs, two phrases light up their eyes, &quot;Jamaican Blue Mountain&quot; and &quot;Kona.&quot;  If you want to give a gift sure to impress a sophisticated coffee drinker, you've found your beans.

Emma (Pres) relayed the shipment would go out immediately and apologized for the delay. Thought it was done...  A few moments later, Anna calls back and goes into some diatribe with my wife not knowing what coffee is.  If the president of the company resolved the issue, why is someone else from the company calling to stir it up?!<br /><br />Another call back to speak with Emma and she apologized for the actions of Anna. The coffee and a "for your trouble" gesture would be sent along that day. They are located cross town about 10 miles away and most shipment are next day...nothing came.<br /><br />A week passed and still nothing. Another call. Emma relays that it should have been taken care of and will call me back next day to confirm. Next day came, went...nothing. We are quite disappointed by this company. They got the $$ and we received empty words.

review/text: When I got to enjoy a cup of Kona on our vacation to Hawaii, I thought I was in Heaven.  The smooth flavor was something to enjoy at any time of day or night.  This Kona brand seemed very strong to me - I even tried not using to much coffee and more water and it still seemed too stong.  I missed the smoothness and flavor of the Kona I remembered in Hawaii.  For that reason, I do not think it's the same Kona I loved so much and would rate this coffee at a 3.

I still have cat food on the floor every morning, but nothing like before.  We have two cats, one who isn't messy with her food and the other makes up for it.  My two year old cat is very lazy and will lay on her side and pull the food out of the bowl with her paw, making it land on the floor by her head.  This way, she can eat laying down! Yes, I did say she was lazy!  :)  Great product and was shipped nicely as well.  No complaints. :)

review/text: I have had two of these mats for a number of years.  I use them for my two cats food bowls.  Sometimes the cats manage to push little bits of wet food out of the bowls and it's nice to have it land on these mats rather than my floor.  They are also excellent for water bowls.  One of my cats liked to dip his paw in the water and lick the water off his paw rather than drinking directly from the bowl and the mat was great for catching little drips.  These mats are very easy to clean and they've held up wonderfully and still look great.
