review/summary: smooth!
review/text: I'm no coffee expert but since purchasing our Keurig, I've been trying lots of different kinds of coffees to find an everyday, dependable coffee that tastes great.  Newman's Own is bold without being too bold (I didn't care for the French roasts--too strong for me) and has that restaurant-brewed flavor that's so hard to find.  No bitter aftertaste. It's nutty and delicious with a bit of half and half and no sugar (the way I drink coffee). I purchased these at our local grocery store as the price was a bit better than Amazon (sorry Amazon!). If you like great tasting coffee without your socks being knocked off (by a super dark roast), then try Newman's.

review/summary: Perfect for me with 8 ounces of water
review/text: The first time I tried Newman's Own Organic Extra Bold K-cup, I had used 10 ounces of water and thought the coffee to have a nice flavor but a little on the weak side.  Then one day I brewed a cup of this coffee and forgot to set the water level to 10 ounces and with my Cuisinart coffee maker, 8 ounces is the default.  The result was a perfect cup of coffee, absolutely no bitterness, with a nice bold flavor that is not overwhelming.  I just wish it would taste like that with 10 ounces

review/summary: I have tried them all
review/text: Having been in the traditional coffee, espresso cappuccino business for 25 years I was very hesitant to try Keurig period. But I succumb to progress and bought a M60 tried 25 or so different types some very good some ok. But this one folks is a 100% winner. It is without a doubt the best cup of coffee I have ever had all machines, Europe, French Press, ect. ect. Acidity, body and flavor profiles perfect.<br /><br />Save your time and money Green Mountain and Newman got this one right; now all we have to do is hope they don't change it. Buy it in the 80 count and you get the best value and you wont get sick of it its that good.

review/summary: Good Cup of Morning Joe
review/text: If you're looking for what I consider a true "bold" cup of coffee, I think you are going to be disappointed and may want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but this one does just fine for me with no bitter aftertaste.  I enjoy this one more so than most breakfast blends, and if you like this kind of coffee you might, too.<br /><br />To put it in perspective, I seem to alternate between the bold and what I consider a "regular" cup of coffee with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, and (believe it or not) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>.  Divergent, yes, but alternating between different levels of taste depending upon the time of day (or attitude, I guess).<br /><br />Bottom line is if you enjoy any of the other brands I mention above, give this one a try - I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: This is the only K Cup we buy!
review/text: As far as Keurig coffee goes, you have like, a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word "strong" or "dark" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.  I brew it in the afternoon, and it gives me that last-half-of-the-day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.  If you like strong coffee, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Best K-Cup out there if you like strong coffee
review/text: Has the richest flavor. Other K-Cup brands taste really bad after you try this one. Flavor might vary a bit between batches, but they are all good and strong. It is a waste to prepare a "large" cup with this, since it can easily handle a "large+small", which amounts to ~400ml of rich coffee. If you like espresso, go with small. Worth every penny, thank you Newman :)<br /><br />PS: Decaf is equally good.

This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not "extra bold" at all.  If you want your coffee "slap your face" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example.

I bought an 80 pack of Newmans Own, Special Blend at Sams Club for $40 just to try it, and we were hooked after our 1st cup.  This is a delicious balance of a darker roast that isnt too over powering.  I would recommend this to anyone - 5 stars.

review/summary: Definately not a Medium Roast Coffee! Too bold and bitter!
review/text: Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff.

review/text: A box of these was included with my new Keurig system. I fear and detest weak coffee, but a 10oz serving of this is still strong, with a satisfying body to it. Another positive is that it's not sour, like I found the Kona to be, nor it is especially bitter. But, though I'm fine with dark or French-roasted coffees, the Newmans Own Special Blend tastes flat-out burnt to me. Next job is to try a sampler pack to find my perfect K-cup.

review/summary: Really Good Coffee
review/text: Obviously, one's preference for coffee is a personal thing. I happen to like this particular coffee very much. It is strong enough, but not bitter. I bought two boxes on sale, but the regular price of the K-cups has been rising beyond the point that I will spend for a homemade cup of coffee. Instead, I have been using pods for the Senseo machines. I got an adaptor for the Keureg, and they work fine for less than half the price. I also have an adaptor for ground coffee, the cheapest alternative, so I always have lots of choices for coffee flavors.

review/text: This is the fourth different type of coffee I have tried with my Keurig coffee maker. At this point, it is tied for my favorite with Starbuck's vanilla coffee (I use the attachment for ground coffee to brew this).<br /><br />Is this peoduct extra bold? It certainly has a smoother taste than that of some of the other coffees that I have tried. It does not have the acidic edge that another company's product manifests.<br /><br />One of the nice things about a Keurig machine is that--through outlets such as Amazon--one can experiment with a variety of brands and tastes to find what works best for one. And this Newman's Own K-cup is a highly successful experiment!

review/text: I should have known not to get the extra bold. This usually refers to the amount of coffee, but when I brewed it on the "tall" setting so that it is not so strong, it still was way too intense for my taste. I only ordered this blend because of the reviews, which I cannot really understand. I have to mix almost a half cup of almond milk to cut the bitterness. I will probably not buy this again.<br />Side Note: I only got this to use with my office keurig machine. At home, I use Equal Exchange Organic Coffee and it is WONDERFUL!

review/summary: Newman's Own IS Newman's Best
review/text: I use many Newman's Own products and I was glad to see Newman's Own Coffee K-Cups. I use K-Cups and I like bold coffee so I tried Newman's Own Bold. I  really like it. It makes a strong cup of coffee. I drink this round the clock, whenever I want a cup of coffee. I guess you can say, I am kind of a round-the-clock coffee drinker. Newman's Own Bold is very good.

review/summary: My daily driver
review/text: This was the first coffee I tried on a Keurig.  At first I wasn't a fan.  Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast, even though it is listed as 'bold', it is more of a medium through and through.<br /><br />The flavors are good.  There is a nice tail on this one.  It is a tiny bit on what I consider to be the tart side.  Not necessarily bitter though.  However, I am the only one in my family still drinking this one.  They've all moved on to the dark roast all the time.  For me, I like slightly less strength for my first cup of the day.  Yes, I do drink 3 cups a day... So there is still plenty of time for the stronger cups later on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o flavor<br />o smooth tail<br />o great for 10oz or less<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit on the tart side<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this coffee for smaller cup sizes.

Also makes a lovely iced tea for us who, despite the sacrilege, must have some, sweet, on the hot sultry days of a southern summer.

review/summary: Yummy DesserTea!!
review/text: This drink is a favorite in our house (yes, we subscribe & save!). We love it with a chocolate or fruit-based dessert, or on it's own, as a zero calorie treat.<br /><br />It's considered a Rooibos, premium herbal tea. It's Caffeine Free. The box features 3 certified organic symbols (USDA, QAI, & Canada), a Fair Trade certification symbol, & a Green Choice 100: 100% recycled, 100% clean energy, 100% carbon neutral paperboard.<br /><br />It also reads:<br />"sustainably harvested on a fair trade certified community farm in the Cederberg Mountains of South Africa..." Taste Profile: "First: sweet and decadent taste of chocolate. After: refreshing burst of mint." And, "contains 90% fair trade certified ingredients by dry weight".<br /><br />Good to know:<br />- If you like your tea to sit a bit, as i do, it's good to remove the bag once it has released its flavor. Leaving it in can alter the taste past its prime. This "tea" tastes good both warm or cool. (I don't drink hot or cold drinks much)<br />- speaking of taste, the last ingredient listed is "organic flavor" (not sure what it is, but it seems to be less than 10% of the ingredients)<br />- the cocoa powder, while organic, is not listed as fair trade. If it were, this would be a 10-star, 100% perfect product!! It's possible that it's fairly traded, but not certified, due to extraneous cost, etc.<br /><br />This "tea" is delicious and has been approved by everyone in my home and any guest who has tried it!<br /><br />And, if you like a tasty treat at night (like I do!), this can be a healthier, Eco-friendly option, reducing the chance that you'll reach for a cookie! This is a yummy, healthy, treat that has become a "standard stock" item in our home!<br /><br />I rely on amazon to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you in the same manner! :)

review/summary: CHECK STORE PRICE FIRST! CHEAPER IN STORE!
review/text: lol, I read that this item was cheaper in stores and almost bought it here.<br /><br />I am so glad I checked out my local oriental market first.<br /><br />I bought it for 8 dollars at the Asian store.<br /><br />Even on eBay this is expensive. It also is not from Japan, it is from Taiwan. Still good.<br /><br />All you need is 1/2-1 teaspoon for a cup of tea or to put in anything like juice or non-dairy milk (like Rice, Almond or Soy milk). I personally tried 2 teaspoons and I could not sleep LOL! 1 tsp is enough for the whole day.<br /><br />You can also put it in just about anything.<br /><br />This also looked a bit low grade (faded green color), but oh well the higher grade is so much more expensive.<br /><br />This went down good with a chocolate flavored drink I have (called Ensure)!<br /><br />Though I question if this is Matcha... I mean it tasted like green tea. I'd have to try another Matcha brand to see if this is real. I read one a matcha website that the brownish green tea is imitation Japanese matcha from the Chinese or Korean and well... someone said how this mostly has Chinese writing on it, and it's from Taiwan! Then, there is even imitation matcha from the Japanese themselves, where it is just regular green tea powder, and claiming it is matcha. :(<br /><br />UPDATE: I will post a picture of a comparison of this powder and another. I bought Matcha that is from (or claims to be) from Japan and is called "drinking grade". This is a brighter, healthy looking green as opposed to this Taiwanese green tea. Or, the Taiwanese tea is made from different leaves, and not the ones that Matcha is traditionally made out of. Or, the other Matcha is simply a higher grade. Not that high though, as I am aware top notch Matcha is a very very bright green.<br /><br />However, this Taiwanese green tea is great. It keeps me up and 1 teaspoon is enough, or even half. I tried 2 teaspoons (morning and lunch) and I was up all night, so this stuff is real haha. I'd drink just 1 teaspoon for the morning or a 1/2 teaspoon in the morning and another 1/2 during lunch (I personally don't have time for that). Not disregarding the product at all, I love it. But those who want the bright colored Matcha might think differently of this product.<br /><br />This stuff is great for people who do not get enough sleep as well. Put this in some orange juice and that will be your energy drink for the day, and it lasts a very long time.<br /><br />Oh and I paid 45 dollars for 150g of the other Matcha. I plan to use that one only on exam days or something. Or even during an all-nighter.

review/text: I just recieved this yesterday. I made a cold glass of tea without sugar and it was okay. I also think I used too much powder (a teaspoon) and it was too strong, had some clumps, and tasted like kelp. I then made up another batch of cold tea using the tip of the teaspoon, stirred alot before filling the glass completely to beat out the clumps, and sweetened with Stevia and it was fantastic! Now I know why the Japanese tea ceremony sets have those matcha scoops, it's easier to control the amount than with the width of a spoon. I may just pick up a tea ceremony set or just the scoop.

review/text: I'm a big matcha drinker, usually in matcha latte form.  This product (which I bought from a local international market) is not a good variety of matcha.  It's not even an OK variety.  It is quite bitter, and yet the matcha flavor is very weak - how do they manage that?  Another Amazon variety (sold by NP Trading, and by Vita Life?) is better.  I only use 1 tsp of that but I need to use 2 tsp of this and it still isn't as good.  I think I might throw away the rest of the giant package that I own.  :(

review/text: I found this at the Farmers Market on Buford Highway in Atlanta, GA. It was about $8. I personally do not like the flavor, but I use it in my protein shakes where I can barely taste it. I know it's in there and it is good for me. I'm a cheap MoFo so I refuse to spend a fortune trying to live like the Jones'. I don't care where it's from as long as it's green and safe. I haven't had any adverse reactions to it and I've been using it for 6 months. I will continue to use it as long as I can as I can get it at this price. Always check your Asian Food Stores and Farmers Markets before you buy online if you have access to them.

review/text: This is certainly not top quality match, or even "real" matcha. It seems to just be grounded up regular green tea. Also it is not from Japan. All that aside, it's still green tea and still tastes pretty good and includes many if not all of the same health benefits of other green tea powders. Also you get a lot for not much money. I find that it tastes pretty good sweetened or in smoothies. Not as good straight as some other more expensive brands of matcha. Overall it's a good buy if you want green tea powder at a low price.

review/summary: This tea is very good!
review/text: I work and study at the college, so I have no days off. This tea helps me like anything else. I've tried vitamins and some herbal teas before, they help too. But Matcha works much more better. I mix 1 tsp. with my milk shake in the morning, and I am full of energy all day long. Besides, it is natural antioxidant, that is very important for health.

review/summary: Perfection
review/text: This is excellent matcha.  I just made my first batch of green tea ice cream with it and it came out tasting exactly like you get in a restaurant.  The recipe called for 1 tablespoon of matcha powder, I used 2 to increase the flavor.  At first I was concerned about the high price of matcha thinking it was just too expensive to keep around the house, but after using it I realized that it is extremely potent in small quantities.  This 8.8oz bag will last a long long while.

review/summary: Something screwy with the Price...
review/text: Mahatma Saffron Rice is our favorite yellow rice.  Despite the fact that it has icky MSG, it uses Saffron to attain a bright yellow color and doesn't use Yellow dye #5 like Goya.  It cooks up easily and it is a quick choice to serve as either a main dish -- with cut up chicken and chopped up veg -- or a side dish with Kielbasa or just about any meat, even fish.<br /><br />If you're on sodium restricted diet, or are sensitive to MSG, give all pre-packaged yellow rice a pass.  BUT if you want a rice that super easy to make, and which taste wonderful, give it a try.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/chief cook<br /><br />note:  The price of a 5 oz. bag should be no more than 1 buck!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:::<br />ice Long Grain Enriched (Rice, Niacin, Ferric Orthophosphate [Iron], Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Folic Acid (Vitamin aB)), Saffron Yellow Seasoning (Salt, Sugar, Onion(s) Dehydrated, Monosodium Glutamate, Turmeric, Garlic, Corn Starch, Spice(s), Safflower, Saffron, Silicon Dioxide As An Anticaking Agent)

review/summary: Wonderful flavor ....
review/text: I first tried this a couple of months ago after purchasing it at my supermarket for more than double the price here.  I was blown away at how easy it was to fix, and how tasty it is!  It's not too salty, and makes quite a lot.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon, and quickly calculated that the price of 10 packages of rice PLUS the shipping was less than the cost of 10 packages from my local store.  I can go through 10 packages in a couple of months, so ordering from Amazon definitely makes sense.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, reducing the amount of water just a bit makes for a fluffier end product.  I use this a lot when I make Indian dishes (using sauce mixes I also purchase from Amazon), and also with baked herbed chicken.  Yum!!

review/text: I can remember making this yellow rice for a ethnic food tasting party back in elementary school. I always loved the vibrant colour and flavor. Since moving to a small town, I was unable to find this rice at the local food store. Giving thanks for it being sold on Amazon.com. I highly recommend this rice to anyone who wants a easy, less expensive way to make saffron yellow rice. I just put the contents in the rice cooker, with 1 2/3 cups of water, and a little olive oil and wa~la... a lovely dish that goes great with either a veggie stir-fry, local grass fed beef, free range chicken, or by itself.  I ordered 30 bags. Super fast delivery, and now I am stocked-- for a little while. :) Blessings~

We often throw it in the rice cooker with pre-cooked bratwurst links for a quick dinner.  It isn't gourmet fare, but it is a tasty side dish that can stand up to a strong-flavored main course.

review/text: I LOVE the saffron flavored rice!  It tastes great served with lots of different things especially chicken.  My son (7) could not stop complimenting the meal though when I made this rice, some sesame crusted salmon, and a can of asparagus.  The meal was so easy (I made two packets of this in my rice cooker, the asparagus was canned, and the fish was just coated in the seeds then cooked in the skillet in a tiny bit of olive oil) but he could not stop raving.  I was shocked.  He kept telling me that I needed to share the recipe with grandma lol.<br /><br />I would NOT buy from Amazon though as I cannot believe the price!  This is under a buck NORMAL price at my Kroger (free when a $.50 coupon is doubled) so I was shocked to see this price.

review/summary: My favorite brand of almonds
review/text: For most of my life, I've considered the Blue Diamond brand synonymous with almonds. No more. I picked up these on sale once, and found them tastier than any Blue Diamond variety I've ever tried.<br /><br />Their taste is not as heavy as Blue Diamond, and lacks the garlic overtones. They don't have the powdery salt/flavor coating of Blue Diamond either.<br /><br />They're lighter on salt too, though still pretty salty.<br /><br />The Emerald container is far superior; the screw top lid will keep the almonds fresh for weeks. So if you just have a handful every now and then, you'll really like this container.<br /><br />Of course, if you don't eat any more almonds than that, this product may be a bit too high a quantity. You'll get four containers, which lasts me for several months. If you just want to try them, you might want to pick up a single container at the grocery store, if you can find them.

I've tried other brands, both brand-name and generic, and none have come close to the flavor I enjoy with the Emerald brand.  (I also tried the chocolate-dusted ones, didn't like as much.)  One reviewer claimed the almonds weren't really smoked - I responded in a comment to that review, linking to [...].  That site, in announcing the brand, states that they are smoked.<br /><br />I won't comment on sodium.  One thing at a time ;)<br /><br />High recommend.

review/summary: Almonds for the Pour
review/text: Almonds are famous because of their antioxidant capacity. The almond is rich in the antioxidant vitamin E. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, can play a role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and in slowing down the ageing process. The magnesium in almonds helps strengthen bones and plays a role in different enzyme processes in our body. Almonds are, like all nuts, rich in unsaturated fat.<br /><br />These are some tasty nuts even if they've already been smoked. Most of the skin-on almonds are whole and all are visibly coated with salt and seasonings. The smoky flavor is quite pleasing, but never overbearing. Eating these delicious nuts is an almond joy made even more delightful by playing some Almond Brothers music in the background while snacking. The coating of salt and seasonings on these guys is quite generous and could transfer to the pages of something you are reading, for example the latest edition of the Almondac. It's best not to eat Emerald Almonds directly out of the canister because there's a clear and present danger of eating the contents all at once. It's best to allot yourself a sensible portion of almonds, close the container's lid, and then savor the nutty goodness and almost bacony flavor. The Emerald Smoked Almonds are a hit with this snacker. If you like almonds, you'll probably love these.
