review/summary: Excellent service
review/text: The product came very quickly, and it was in fact 15oz sized boxes (I was worried since the stores seemed to carry 14.1oz boxes and I couldnt imagine there actually being two different sizes for such little difference, and ofcourse I was looking for a better deal than store prices).<br />The cereal itself is great, except I find it a touch too sweet compared to other Kashi brands, so I actually like to mix this cereal with the High Protein and High Fiber cereal half and half. But ofcourse everyone's going to have different preferences when it comes to taste, so I'm still giving 5 stars for the service and the quality of the cereal. Natural ingredients that taste good and are actually quite healthy.<br />If you're looking to beat store prices, you'll end up saving a couple bucks, but you'll save more if you purchase with the automatic renewal enabled, which can always be disabled anytime after or set to 6 months renewal. Not sure how fast one can really eat 6 boxes of cereal. It's taken me 3 or 4 months now I guess.

review/text: This  cereal is great to snack on while watching TV or a DVD.  My children even love it.  It is sweet enough that they eat it dry right out of the box.  Yet it is crunchy enough to keep things interesting.  Believe it or not they prefer this to a bowl of greasy popcorn.  Actually, I do too.  :)

review/summary: One of the Best Cereals
review/text: Most cereal either tastes good or is bad for you.  GoLean Crunch has the best of both worlds - it tastes as great as most full-calorie granola cereals but it has lots of Fiber and Protein, which most people just don't get enough of in their diets.  I even keep a box of this stuff at work for snacking!

review/summary: And I don't even like cereal
review/text: I never have liked cereal-probably because I hate milk, but I wanted to eat healthier and kept seeing the ad for Kashi so I bought it. This is the very best snacky-breakfasty-anytime food I have ever had. I love the flavor, and because I do not drink milk, I eat mine in a bowl with a 1/4-1/2 cup of raisins-mmmmmmm...I swear its so good that you'll want to feel guilty for eating it!! Its is crunchy, but that's a good thing. Instead of reaching for the chips when I want to crunch, I reach for the Kashi. Love Love Love it!!!! I suggest you buy 2 boxes at first if you are married. My husband practically ate an entire box with in 2 days : )

review/summary: Bad For Your Health and Bad for Your Teeth
review/text: With a whopping 18 grams of sugar, this cereal ought to be banned for anyone with high blood sugar, hyperglycemia or diabetes.  Nobody concerned with being healthy ought to consume more than 4 grams of sugar in a meal.<br /><br />These sugary nuggets are so hard, if you have veneers or crowns, new or old, there is a good chance of them cracking and breaking off.  I've been to the dentist twice -- in order to get repairs done due to consuming this -- let's call it what it is -- breakfast CANDY!  My dentist entirely arned me off of consuming this garbage.<br /><br />"Oh, but it's so good for you!  Those whole grains!"  Hogwash.  It's got more sugar than protein.  There are much better foods for the (non-hypocritical) health-conscious person.

This is significantly healthier than many of the sugar cereals that are marketed to kids. Even my 1 yo enjoys eating this dry. Between this and Honey Nut Cheerios, I don't have to feel guilty about giving my kids "bad" cereal.<br /><br />From a price perspective, you can't beat Amazon's Subscribe & Save. My family of six will work through these four boxes pretty quick. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: My Favortie Cereal...Next to Cinnamon Toast Crunch
review/text: I've been eating Kashi GoLean for about two years now and I can't live without it. It's just sweet enough to satisfy the kid in me and it's healthy enough to make me feel good about eating it. Though I do tend to eat really-sugary cereals like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Kashi GoLean is a great substitute. Come to think of it, I haven't eaten Cinnamon Toast Crunch in a while, probably because I've been eating GoLean just about everyday. The only downside is that the fiber can make you go the bathroom quite often. But if you balance your intake of cereal just right, you should be fine. In addition, the cereal tastes really good with Vanilla soy milk. I eat my GoLean with Silk Very Vanilla.

The clumps at the top of the box are quite large, and towards the end you're left with powdery stuff. Not a big minus, but I like my granola to be uniformish.

review/text: I'm generally not a big cereal eater. I eat this cereal dry as a snack, which has been great for my waistline. Instead of eating junk, I can eat something healthy, high in fiber, and filling. I don't get hungry for hours. Sometimes there are big clusters and other times a lot of crumbs, depending on settling, but it always tastes good. A slight cinnamon flavor with a satisfying crunch. It's hard to watch TV while eating due to all of the crunching. :-) It's definitely worth a try (I have never commented on a food before, so you know this has got to be good...)

review/summary: The health-conscious Honey Smacks
review/text: ...And that's a good thing, in my book. It has to be said that for cereals with this much nutritional content, it is an uncharacteristically sweet blend. But GoLean Crunch doesn't share the artificial, high-fructose corn-syrup taste of your favorite childhood cereal. The honey and cinnamon deliver a restrained but vibrant flavor that satisfies the sweet tooth and saves you the toothache. In time, you'll wonder why your body kept craving the kid's stuff at all.<br /><br />Kashi cereals are generally very satisfying--after downing a bowl, you feel a rush of energy and a lightness that many competing high-fiber cereals can't deliver. Along with a hot cup of coffee, fresh fruit and maybe some yogurt, this is a highly recommended breakfast item for anyone looking for sustained energy throughout the early hours of the day (and who isn't?).

Usually something that is so good for you does not taste so good. Well, in this case I don't mind eating the healthy cereal or buying my own blueberries to go with the cereal! It's that good. Very crunchy and just enough sugar to satisfy your taste. It really is the best cereal I've tried in a long while.

review/text: When I'm dieting I crave crunch food. Kashi GOLEAN is the lowest carb cereal I could find and a portion size larger than 1/4 cup. It's very crunch and stays crunchy even in milk (not forever but longer than most cereal). The flavor is pleasant and it needs NO sugar or sugar substitutes. Very good.

review/summary: Great.........For A Snack {3 Stars}
review/text: This stuff is great as a snack.  As a breakfast cereal?  Not so much.  For some reason, the taste totally disappears once they come in contact with skim milk and they get soggy (and extremely chewy - like chewing coconut) in less than 3 seconds.  So it's like chewing on wet cardboard with a hint of cinnamon or something.  Maybe it's just me.  Oh well, go figure.  I do love them as a great finger food.  So I recommend these as a light, healthy snack right out of the box, but if you're looking to buy this as a breakfast cereal, I recommend looking elsewhere.

review/summary: Wow!  The crunchiest!
review/text: Billed as good tasting cereal that is also nutritious, the Kashi Golean Crunch  definately delivers the crunch.  Comparing the side nutrition info panel with other cereals shows low fat, low sugar, good fiber and a fair ammount of vitamins.  As with any granola based cereal, adding rasins, bananas, berries, etc. helped vary the taste immensely.  Even so, after 6 boxes I was ready for an extended break.  I expect I will enjoy it again later.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Wonderful, easy, tasty, healthy
review/text: For decades I have cooked barley the long way - simmering for almost an hour, watching the pot so it doesn't boil over, scouring the sticky, gooey pot afterwards. I recently gave this product a try and am now a convert. No more long vigils at the stove watching a pot simmer.  This is wonderfully flavorful, full of all the healthy stuff we are looking for, and so much easier to cook, in a lot less time. I used to freeze the long-cooking kind and now I cook batches of this and freeze in smaller portions as well.<br /><br />I have even simmered this quick cooking barley along with whole wheat orzo together in the same pot, drained it and frozen it for future use in soups, stews, etc.<br /><br />Never again will I waste an hour of precious time cooking barley the long way. This quick cooking barley will now become a staple in my cupboard.

review/summary: Great for soups
review/text: I could not get the quick barley at Albertson's so turned to the internet.<br />Although 12 boxes is a lot of barley, I was able to sell some of them to friends for cost at $3.17 each, which includes the S & H. Also a local grocer dealing in organic foods took a couple of them.<br />Putting barley in any soup home made or canned adds a flavor I really like, so in two weeks I have used up one 11 ounce box already. It only takes 10 minutes heating the soup with the barley to cook it, either in the microwave or on the stove.<br />Just thinking about it makes my mouth water, mmmmmmmmm.<br />R

review/summary: The product is great, but there are serious service problems
review/text: First, let me say that this product is high quality--once you get it, it is great.  Getting it, however, is a hassle.<br /><br />When I ordered this item, I was sent only a single box of barley, instead of the case (12 boxes) I had ordered and paid for.  Trying to get this problem resolved involved frequent interactions with customer service.  Amazon attempted to fix the problem by resending the order, but made the same mistake again, sending only 5 BOXES instead of the 5 CASES I had requested (and paid for).  Ultimately, I was told that Amazon was unable to fix this glitch, and my order was cancelled.  Until the problem is rectified, it doesn't make sense, in my opinion, to purchase this item.

review/text: As a curry fan, I like the savory aroma delivered by the finished product. Unless your taste buds are really sensitive, don't be fooled by the "hot" designation; this is at best somewhat spicy, and downright mild compared to restaurant curry. But when prepared and served as directed, it makes for a satisfying cool-weather meal; I recommend using diced chicken meat, carrots, onions, and green peppers.

review/summary: Like English toffee has been turned inside out! Delicious!
review/text: Hershey's Symphony milk chocolate candy bars with almond & toffee bits are one of my favorite chocolate bars EVER! I'm not a chocoholic, but when I really, truly want good chocolate, I'm either looking for one of these bars, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZDXV4">Cadbury Fruit & Nut Chocolate Bar 49g England (12 Pack)</a>, a good Ghirardelli square (preferrably the solid chocolate mint, not the mint cream filled), Dove milk chocolate, or English toffee for some good crunch & sweet with a chocolate kick. This chocolate bar by Hershey's has been one of my favorites ever since it came out, way back in my college days (if I remember correctly). It really IS like someone turned a big chunk of English Toffee inside out & added extra chocolate. The chocolate itself is smooth and creamy without being too, too sweet, and the crunchy chunks of toffee & toasted almonds inside of it make for a delicious, sweet surprise.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this confection by Hershey's yet, pick one up at your local drugstore or grocery store. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!

review/text: I purchased these candy bars to give as little gifts to thank people who took a Salvation Army Angel card at our annual "Spirit of Christmas" concert. When I was putting decorations on the bars, I noticed the bars had expired. I am assuming the company sent them at the end of the month of expiration so they were "legal"...but, by the time, I gave them to people on the 11th of the following month, they were expired. It could have caused the orchestra a lot of grief. I will not do business with them again.

We can use it a little at a time in smoothies to hide it but there is no way we can get through it all a little at a time before it expires.

I am a fan of chocolate, but I wouldn't have believed that you could make it work with *wasabi* without tasting this masterpiece for myself.  As my friend said when she introduced me; you simply *must* try this.  It will transport you.

review/summary: Seems Processed Too Much for Raw
review/text: Good but not great. We've used Wee Bee in the past and have been seeking a cheaper alternative, and that's what brought us here.<br /><br />This honey seems processed too much, due to the lack of the classic light-colored look of raw honey. I suppose this is a factor in not having the "crust" on top, which is a bonus not to have to scrape it aside before enjoying.<br /><br />Also, the taste was not as sweet as the other raw honey we've been using. The texture was a bit "sandy" as I rubbed it between my tongue and the roof of my mouth. I think for the cost and size, this is a great deal overall. I don't think we'll be buying again, simply because we have to use more to get the same result.

review/text: This honey WORKS!<br />More than taste...<br />It is really hard to find honey that truly has all the good "raw honey benefits".<br />Many, many beekeepers feed bees sugar water.<br />I contacted Stakich.....they do not feed their bees sugar water.<br />What matters for me most is how it works for me.<br />I have nearly comsumed my first 5 lb. jar.<br />I don't take it every day.  I am on a medication for arthritis that suppresses my immune system.<br />I have found that when I have a sore throat...or what feels like a cold or a "starting to get sick" feeling..that I can take a big spoon of this honey....maybe through out the day a total of 2 or 3 big spoons...and then perhaps some the second day.....and I am feeling good again...<br />I woke up in the night with a "fluey" feeling, and my stomach somewhat in a turmoil....I took a heaping soupspoon of Stakich honey, and it seemed to instantly soothe my stomach. That was last night, and I am feeling pretty good today....just going about the day as usual!  But my honey supply was getting low, so I just ordered another 5 lb. jar...I really don't want to be without it...IT WORKS, and that is what is important to me!

review/summary: Good Quality, Sweet But Gritty
review/text: This is raw honey without a crown and it is sweet, sugary in comparison with Y.S. or Wee Bee raw honeys'. It has a nice after-taste and works well as a sweetener. The detractors are: it's not organic, and it's packaged in plastic. My health food stores were sold out of Y.S. (my preferd brand) so I purchased this honey due to the price, which is the same per pound after shipping...I had my concerns. Sure enough FED-X left the package in my entry-way and didn't ring. Of course it was in direct 'Florida' sunlight. So the top two pounds of raw honey are now golden liquid. So I poured it in a glass jar and will use it for tea. I slathered some on a piece of turkey eariler and...I'll be doing that again. So be aware that FED-X and the USPS use high power X-rays on some or all of their packages where as UPS does not. Purchasing from a store is probably best. I knew I was taking a chance and the honey taste good so I wont complain. If you prefer a mild flavor and smooth texture this honey is not for you. Try the others I mentioned.

review/text: We've never bought raw honey before; so we were a little nervous about how it would look and taste(would it have lumps of honeycomb in it?) We received it in three days from Fed Ex in very good shape.  When we tried the honey it was excellent.  It was light colored and smooth(not lumpy). It was sweet but not the extremely sweet honey taste you get from the grocery store.  We use it on our peanut butter sandwiches instead of jelly and last night we spread a little on our baked yams with some butter, yum. So we would recommend this honey to anyone.  We will be getting some more when this is gone.

review/summary: Inconsistent quality control and poor management
review/text: As a long-time Stakich customer, I have noticed extreme inconsistency in their raw honey products. One time the honey is very dark in color, and the next time it is very light. One time the honey is very soft (almost like soup) and the next time it is very hard and can barely be removed with a spoon. When I call them, they tell me to heat it up to soften it up. The taste is also inconsistent, but they always have an excuse for that.<br /><br />The owner Steven can be difficult to deal with. He is very selective about which of your emails he will respond to and has a "my way or the highway" attitude! He once double-charged my credit card for a single order. It took me several days of fighting with both Stakich and my bank to figure out what happened and to get it straightened out. After some fighting, Steven finally agreed to offer me a free gift, but the catch was that it had to be on my NEXT order....figures, right? So when it came time to reorder, Steven was very rigid and did not allow me to have any input whatsoever in my free gift. He tried to offer me a bracelet /shrug. I tried to be very reasonable and I chose 5 different options that I felt would be appropriate. Steven chose to ignore my emails. I emailed him again, and he responded that he could not make a profit if he chose one of my options. I made him aware that my choices were cheaper on his site than the bracelet and he once again ignored my email. I then emailed him and told him that I was taking my business elsewhere where it would be more appreciated. He once again chose to ignore my email.<br /><br />Bottom line: I rate their product with 3/5 stars because of quality control issues, and I rate their management and people skills 1/5 stars. Trust me when I say this...you are worth very little to them as a customer. It is their way or the highway and they don't care if you go elsewhere. I was a loyal customer of over 10 years and they let me go over $10. I spent well over $1000 with Stakich and they greedily argued with me over a $10 item. I will shop elsewhere even if it costs me a little bit more.

review/summary: Quite good..
review/text: I have processed honey available with the tea/coffee service where I eat, I never use that stuff since I bought this product, it's just a lot better. The price is quite good, I can pay $10 for a little "bear dispenser" of organic honey at my local food co-op store which would be about 5 times as much per ounce...

review/summary: Excellent Raw Honey from Amazon
review/text: I have been using raw honey as a sweetner for some time and it can get really expensive.  So, when I saw this on Amazon I bought a 5 pound jar of Stakich's.  It really is the raw form of honey ( all the other's weren't as raw) and the taste is really good.  I'll buy this again since I use it in my coffee in the morning.  Thanks Stakich and Amazon.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices. I ended up at my local health food store and found Stakich Raw Honey. It is produced about an hour from me, so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies, and liking to support local businesses, I decided to give it a try. I LOVE it. The taste is delicious and sweet. I've used it to replace all of our 'regular' honey uses, and no one in my family can tell the difference. The texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey, but that's to be expected. I mix a tablespoon of Stakich Raw Honey and a teaspoon of Stakich Bee Pollen into my Greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: One of the best stevia based sweeteners
review/text: If you're expecting the stevia flavor to be present, you'll be disappointed. This is not a true stevia sweetener, because it only contains reb A and none of the other compounds found in stevia.<br /><br />Truvia is very similar to another brand called PureVia. They are pretty much equal in quality and flavor. Both are very effective at tasting close to sugar without the typical stevia flavor. Truvia differs from PureVia very slightly. PureVia has a slight creamy flavor, and Truvia is a little sweeter per packet (each packet contains more). Both are primarily sweetened with erythritol and purified reb A (another name for rubiana). Erythritol is a natural nearly zero calorie sweetener found in fruit. Reb A is a natural zero calorie sweetener isolated from stevia leaf. Unlike stevia, which is known for a leafy licorice like aftertaste, Reb A has almost no aftertaste and is intensely sweet. Because it's present in Truvia in isolated form without the other stevia compounds, Truvia tastes nothing like stevia.<br /><br />Truvia contains erythritol, reb A, and natural flavors. PureVia differs in that it also contains isomaltulose and a tiny bit of cellulose powder. One big difference between PureVia, and Truvia is that Truvia contains far more erythritol, so erythritol has more of an impact on the flavor than it does in PureVia. Erythritol tastes more like sugar than reb A does, but it has a watery quality to its flavor and a cooling effect. Reb A has a thin sharp sweetness to it. When the two are combined they greatly enrich each other giving a more full bodied sweetness.<br /><br />Truvia, NuStevia, and PureVia are the best stevia based sweeteners you can get when it comes to stevia sweeteners without the stevia flavor.<br /><br />PureVia tastes better in coffee because it has a creamy flavor. Of course most people love cream in their coffee, so PureVia has an upper hand there because of the creamy flavor present. The creamy flavor of PureVia goes well in some things, but not all things. Truvia is not creamy tasting, is sweeter per packet and is better suited for general purpose sweetening where a creamy flavor might not be desired.<br /><br />I did taste tests with my family using PureVia, Truvia, and Sun Crystals, three of the newest stevia based sweeteners. PureVia and Truvia were liked by everyone with PureVia judged slightly better for things requiring a creamy flavor and Truvia scoring better for things that taste better without a creamy flavor. Sun Crystals has the taste of stevia in it, and for that reason it scored lower, because the flavor of the stevia was a negative in some taste tests. Of the three PureVia tasted the most like sugar, Truvia the most like erythritol, and Sun Crystals the most like stevia. One thing that was interesting during the taste test that we found was that when PureVia was tasted plain after Truvia was tasted plain, PureVia tasted better, likewise when Truvia was tasted plain after PureVia was tasted plain it was judged to taste better, but when tasted together the flavor wasn't as good.<br /><br />If you're looking for an effective all natural zero calorie sweetener, this is about as good as it gets. The taste is very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners, it has it's own unique flavor. While PureVia tastes a little more like sugar and has a creamy flavor, it's not as sweet as Truvia. Truvia is a better deal because it's sweeter per packet. The difference in flavor is very minor. Also PureVia relies more on reb A for sweetening than Truvia does. Reb A is great in small amounts, but not so good in large amounts, so when more sweetness power is needed Truvia is a better choice. Very large amounts of reb A will taste bitter, but when used in normal amounts, it doesn't taste bitter. Reb A is similar to saccharin in that way. Small amounts taste better than large amounts. There's a sweetness threshold with reb A, and if that threshold is passed, it starts tasting less sweet and starts tasting bitter. That's one thing you need to know when using a reb A based sweetener. Because Truvia relies more on erythritol for it's sweetness than reb A, this is not as much of a problem as it can be with PureVia. You can use far more Truvia packets before you get a flavor "overdose" of reb A than with PureVia.

review/summary: Yeah Wow, I'm giving it two stars!
review/text: Ok, I had my daughter pick me up some Truvia at the grocery store. I was pretty excited about it, after all the hype, because the grocery store that carried my Sweetleaf  Stevia all of a sudden decided not to carry it any more. Go figure*sarcasm*<br /><br />Anyway, I was pleased until my daughter brought it home, and then I got a look at the ingredients. Have you ever seen the ingredients listed anywhere online, the way they are on the package? I looked around online (this was right before it hit the store shelves) and I even wrote the company an email. I went to the Truvia web site to check it out the same day it was announced. I got an email back saying that the ingredients were Stevia and "natural flavorings'.<br /><br />That didn't answer my question, because I asked them in the email what the "natural flavors" were exactly. I believe I've still got the email saved somewhere on my hard drive.<br /><br />Well, I don't have much of a problem with erythritol, except this product is mostly erythritol and very little stevia. It doesn't taste like stevia or pour like stevia. If I wanted erythritol I can order 100% erythritol. I like the health benefits of stevia. I don't mind a touch of erythritol but this product has too much of it.<br /><br />I'm sorry but as far as I'm concerned this product being marketed as stevia is deceptive marketing at its' best.<br /><br />However it does taste sweet, and if my only choices were table sugar and Truvia, I'd take the Truvia. So it gets two stars for the taste without the health benefits.<br /><br />I was very unhappy with Truvia and the people who make it for not telling me the whole truth when I emailed and asked them directly for a clarification of the ingredients.<br /><br />I will not be buying Truvia again, from any source, online or not.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have been highly averse to "sweeteners" ever since I was a kid watching my mom dump equal in her coffee in the 80's. To this day she still uses whatever fake stuff she can get her hands on. I don't like the taste of any of them, splenda, equal, sweet'n'low. ick. For that reason I've only used raw sugar or when I'm low on $$, white processed sugar just because it's not a bag of chemicals, and that's a plus in my book.<br /><br />Lately I've been hearing about the stevia based sweeteners, and figured it might be time to give it a try. Stevia has been a bit controversial, as it was banned in 1991 by the FDA(but isn't anymore) and now is ban in Europe and a few other locations. But the reasons for banning are vague and don't seem completely investigated, just that there was "pressure from the market" to stamp them as unsafe.<br /><br />It was important to me that it be natural, because I go as much organic/natural as possible. I knew I wouldn't be using a boat load of it, so I'm not concerned about the controversy. I compared a couple of the stevia based sweeteners in price at the grocery store and this won out as my first to try. To be honest, it's pretty darn good! From a picky taster to you, this is worth giving a try. Dipping my finger in it, it has a cool(as in, cold)super sweet taste. I'm using 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in my coffee, and this was about 1/2 a packet or less to make it how I like it. I've only put it in my ice coffee so far, but I'm not noticing a huge taste difference between this and my usual sugar, which is great. No after taste to speak of. The price is do-able and I'll definitely buy it again, but I'll also be checking out the other brands.

review/text: A powerful, chemical aftertaste that rendered anything I tried it on/in - cereal, coffee, tea - close to inedible.  I've found that the other artificial sweeteners are palatable, but this stuff is pretty dreadful.  And if you read about it, it's no better or worse than the others despite their claims that it comes right from the garden and is made in a cottage by granny and some elves. As well, I would submit that some of the rave reviews are corporate plants - seriously, look at their list of other reviews.  Most importantly, despite the "green" website for Truvia, it's manufactured by Cargill.  Last I looked, Cargill was a giant corporation that converts field crops into industrial products.  Go ahead and try it but know that you were warned.

review/summary: A great alternative to Splenda
review/text: I'm a die-hard fan of liquid sucralose (liquid Splenda like EZ-Sweetz), but I heard that erythritol is a much better sweetener for chocolate recipes.  I've used Truvia in three different recipes with cocoa, unsweetened chocolate, and apples, and it improved the flavor dramatically.  I will be using Truvia in recipes where granular sweetener is required and to counteract the aftertaste when using lots of suralose.  A 1:2 or 1:1 ratio of Truvia to liquid sucralose works really well.  It also saves money since Truvia is more expensive.

review/summary: Delicious with Very Little Bitterness
review/text: I have tried many Stevia products. I have used other brands that were bitter and caked in the packets.  Not this one! I really enjoy Truvia! I have cooked with it and use it in my tea and on my fruit salads. I use it in my fruit smoothies as well. Even my finicky, sugar gobbling, family members didn't know I had used it in their smoothies! It holds well in the packet. I have had these packets in my "sugar bowl" now for a month and they haven't caked. You don't have to use as much as the others either. In my opinion, this is one of the best Stevia sweeteners on the market.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Z7AEW6">Truvia Natural Sweetener 80 Pack</a>

Not only did it taste "funny" in my drinks, it also left a disgusting aftertaste.  If I had to choose between Truvia and table sugar, I'd take the sugar, despite diabetes and its associated health risks.  Truvia was truly THAT unpleasant!

review/summary: Truvia, at last a low calorie sweetener I like
review/text: I came across Truvia in its little jar format 3 months ago and decided to give it a try. I love strong tea with milk and sugar which I make "English" style and is a family tradition; but have had a struggle with trying to lose weight and found it impossible to give up or lessen the sugar I used, 1 1/2 teaspoons per mug suited me to perfection. Every sweetener I have tried to date put me off with its flavor. To my surprise and joy a little less than a teaspoon of Truvia gave me a very acceptable alternative which I have been enjoying ever since. I am delighted with this arrangement. I have noticed that Truvia gives a generous sweet flavor which goes with my milk tea very well (I use 1 or 2 % milk) and a home made blend of Assam/English breakfast/Earl Grey tea. I am going to use Truvia for my other sweetener needs. I prefer getting my sweetener in this form rather than in the sachets.

review/text: In trying to keep my promise to myself that when I turned ?? I would become a much healthier eater, I've been trying to have a lot less regular sugar. Unfortunately I started with using splenda.Then upon noticing myself gaining a lot more weight in a short period of time i did some research on it and....lets just say, I will never touch the stuff again. My Trainer gave me 3 packs of different kinds of Stevia extracted sweetners. I decided to stick with Truvia. The taste was great in my tea and cofee. I haven't baked with it yet though and I'm happy to know that its a lot healthier for me. I know because it has less actual stevia than some of the others its a little less healthier, but since it taste better and i'm getting enough fiber else where, ill definetly stick with this. I do wish it came in bags like splenda does so i can start to use it for cooking, but seeing the prices online for the bigger boxes, i'll start with that.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I've tried other stevia sweeteners, and they can't compare to Truvia. It is just like sugar -- not bitter like the others. I love it!

review/summary: Avoid AVOID this is revolting
review/text: This was possibly the worst sweetening product I have ever tried. Put 1/3 teaspoon in my tea, drank 2 gulps and it was disgusting!! After eating my dinner, a banana and 2 mandarins, the revolting  chemical metallic aftertaste still coats the inside of my mouth.  I'm off to brush my teeth, floss and gargle with mouthwash. What a waste of money, I'd rather go unsweetened than ever have Truvia again. Straight into the bin, I'm not even going to take it into work for others to have, I wouldn't wish it on anyone!!

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: Have been a Splenda user for years and tried Truvia as it was supposed to be healthier. After tasting it the first time in my coffee, I promptly poured the coffee down the drain. It has a weird strawberry taste with a VERY unpleasant aftertaste. I will be throwing this $7 container away and looking elsewhere for my sugar substitute needs.

review/summary: Not white chocolate, but tasty and lower in fat/calories
review/text: Ghirardelli doesn't include "chocolate" in this white sauce's name for a reason:<br /><br />Unlike white chocolate which consists of cocoa butter, condensed milk, and sugar, Ghirardelli "Classic White Flavored Sauce" consists of high fructose corn syrup, sugar, food starch, and carrageenan (which makes the sauce thick and creamy). The sauce contains no cocoa butter, and its unspecified dairy flavors are way down the list of ingredients.<br /><br />in short, this sauce gives my coffee drinks, hot chocolate, and desserts a sweet and creamy consistency with a flavor similar to vanilla or, more accurately, doughnut or pastry frosting.<br /><br />The good news: Unlike real white chocolate, this is fat-free, it's marginally lower in calories, and it pours easily.<br /><br />For a more authentic white-chocolate sauce -- including the saturated fat and additional calories -- try Fontana White Chocolate Mocha Sauce. It contains all the key ingredients of real white chocolate; it's Starbucks' choice for the coffee chain's white-chocolate drinks; and (contrary to the sauce's name) it does NOT contain "mocha" (coffee).<br /><br />If you buy Ghirardelli's sauce in the 64-ounce bottle, be sure to pay less than $20 for it. Some vendors grossly overcharge.

review/summary: Best sauce for white mochas I have found
review/text: I've tried just about every sauce out there, trying to duplicate the "Starbucks" style iced white chocolate mochas. The Torani sauce is close, but I tried the Ghirardelli sauce, and it's by far my favorite and the one I will stick with from now on. It doesnt like Starbuck's white mochas, but exactly like the other coffee shop's that I frequent, which I prefer. So if your looking for Starbucks equivilent look elsewhere, but this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />Like others have said it has a taste of its own, which I happen to like better than any other sauce I've tasted. It was the last one I tried, because it seemed to have the worst, or at least mixed "love it or hate it" types of reviews. I happen to love it, but taste is simply a matter of opinion so you will have to see for yourself.<br /><br />This does come with a pump so don't waste your money like I did and pay two (it should say this in the description, at this time it does not).<br /><br />I had some problems with pumps not holding their prime at first, but finally got one that works perfectly. If you have any problems, Ghirardelli customer service is great and quick to help you.
