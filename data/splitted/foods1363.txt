review/summary: Easy to prepare and great taste
review/text: The Punjabi Rajma, red kidney beans cooked in a tomato sauce is really a great like side dish.  We had it with naan, and it was a great blend of taste and spice.  I still think one of the best parts of the Sanskriti line is the easy prep time.  I didn't realize it but the other key benefits are no preservatives, gluten free and authentic made in India.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: Great option for a quick meal!
review/text: I've been keeping this type of packaged food around for a couple of years as a quick and tasty meal option.  Before Sanskriti, I used to by Tasty Bites - but Sankriti is so much better! The food tastes fresh, not too oily (like Tasty Bites) and they don't skimp on the ingredients.  The packets are also a super convenient way to add side dishes and create a complete meal when I have dinner guests! A great product!

This is really tastes good, I like to mix this with haryali rice and then add a squirt of lime... really adds a kick.<br /><br />When i host parties, i use this as an alternative to Chilli for the vegetarians.

review/summary: Blast From The Past
review/text: I enjoy this product a great deal.  Even when I am dieting this is the ideal snack because it is reasonable in calories and cures that sweet tooth craving.  It's not a candy bar and not a hard candy like peppermint candies.  It is somewhat inbetween.<br /><br />I think the reason I enjoy them the most is because I remember them from when I was a kid.  I personally prefer the variety packs vs. the single flavor rolls.  The single flavor rolls can get old quickly since you can't have just one.

review/summary: Not your grandmother's condensed soup!
review/text: The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  This Simply Tomato soup is mildly spicy with Indian flavors and is not at all bland but for more of a bite, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UUXPPG">MTR Spicy Tomato Soup</a>.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I make it as directed but substitute ï¿½ cup of milk for some of the water.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, milk, sugar, edible starch, salt, refined sunflower oil, onion, ginger, jeera (black cumin seed), garlic, and black pepper.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains milk.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup so each serving would be a little over half a cup which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 70<br />Calories from fat 20<br />Total fat 2.5g<br />Saturated fat 1g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 10mg<br />Sodium 950mg<br />Total carbohydrate 10g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 7g<br />Protein less than 1g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4.8g of sodium.

review/summary: A piece of Home
review/text: My wife and I have been unhappy all these years with any fish sauce brand here in the US since they either have the unnatural sweet after taste (Thai fish sauce) or too strong of a smell and salty (Philippine fish sauce). No matter how we tried to mix or fix them, they still don't come close to the fine taste of quality fish sauce that we sorely miss (good fish sauce needs not to be mixed to taste good). My father, a Phan Thiet's native and his family used to own a Nuoc Mam factory therefore we know what true extra virgin Nuoc Mam should taste like!<br />Until not too long ago, I stumbled across this brand on Amazon, bought a pair ... and boy, my wife and I were blown away. We will be buying more as gift for our family and we're sure that they will be thrilled - We are huge fans of this brand now!

review/summary: Wonderful Phu Quoc fish sauce
review/text: We were given this fish sauce as a sample and were really impressed with it.  It has a pure, nutty, distinctive fresh taste and is very clear when you look at it.  Other fish sauces seem to have little bits of things floating around in them, but this was beautiful and clear and very rich tasting.  It was explained to me that this is because it is authentic sauce harvested and processed locally in Phu Quoc, whereas some other sauces just use the name, but are not actually from there.<br /><br />We love it and use it in several recipes given to me by our Vietnamese friends.  I love it in particular on Imperial rolls.

review/text: This brand of fish sauce came recommended from a cooking blog that I follow.  She was always demonstrating the versatility of this sauce and how many different recipes it could be used in - from something incredibly complex to something as easy as zesting up morning scrambled eggs.  I love that the sauce is pure with no added ingredients, especially no sugars which are common in the grocery store brands.  I use this all the time now - in my thai recipes, in sauces, and even in my morning eggs.  The flavor is fantastic and it always seems to add that extra layer of depth in anything I cook.  Strong purchase.  My kitchen pantry can never be without it again.

review/summary: Nectar of the gods!
review/text: All my life, I have avoided canned anchovies, because they taste horrible.  I  read some wonderful things about this sauce on the internet, but it is made from anchovies.  I considered it a real gamble to order a bottle of the Red Boat Fish Sauce.<br /><br />WOW!  This stuff is tasty and the flavor is so intense.  I do not know anything about Asian cooking, but this sauce is truly nectar of the gods.  A few drops of the fish sauce will add a truck load of flavor to your seafood dishes.  I use it to reinforce the flavor of fish with a milder taste.  I am finding it to be a very versatile flavor enhancer.  Yesterday, I composed a dressing for a green salad.  A few drops of fish sauce whipped into a little olive oil and rice vinegar produces a nice savory dressing.<br /><br />As a another reviewer noted, this is a finishing sauce.  I add it after the food is cooked.  I believe the quality of the sea salt in this product makes a huge difference.  If you want to add a savory flavor to your dishes, give it a try.<br /><br />P.S.<br />I still hate canned anchovies.

I put it on my pizza so I can have a little light anchovie flavor that my family can't stomach near their slice. I put it in my ramen and slip it in stews. It doesn't have a real fishy taste so it ads a good flavor people can't put their finger on. I rate it 4 star as it is expensive but it is additive free. Only salt and black anchovie, no MSG.

review/summary: Just Right  -- instant appeal and gone!
review/text: I've been perfecting my South East Asian skills for a few years and I've always been cautious/nervous about adding Fish Sauce to my meals as they tend to overpower the dishes with heavy saltiness.<br /><br />I've no problem with adding fish sauce to my dishes but the big-box-grocery store versions were just very dangerous to me while I made meals.  Too much and it could turn a day's work into a SALTY MESS!  (yes it takes almost an entire day to make a wonderful SEA or Korean meal)<br /><br />After some research I bought this Red Boat.  It came in the mail today and I couldn't wait to taste it!<br /><br />At first it had all the wonderful salty fish taste and in an instant it was gone!<br /><br />I quickly tasted my old brand to experience the difference and it was night and day.  The old brand stayed on my palette for 15-30 seconds or so.<br /><br />I did the Red Boat taste again and noticed it's, "flash of taste" with much less lingering -- almost no lingering acid "throaty feel"<br /><br />You have to try this and test it out for yourself and come back here and tell me I'm wrong!<br /><br />***** stars!

review/summary: Good stuff.
review/text: Good stuff, dogs love it.  Made a big difference when I switched from another brand.  My dogs seem healthier, and have lost excess weight which they gained while on the other food.  Their bowel movements are more normal now, and they no longer have problems with their anal glands getting full/hard and needing to be emptied like they did with the other food.<br /><br />I was surprised to find negative reviews for this food.  I understand the one review about the dogs not being interested in the food, but please, people of amazon, don't write negative reviews for products because your local store sold you an expired bag.  1) that has nothing to do with amazon, and 2) that really has nothing to do with the product quality -- the manufacturer didn't sell it to you that way, it was probably just on the shelf for too long.  It's misleading to people looking for products when something has 2 stars because someone got an expired bag from A DIFFERENT STORE.<br /><br />My dogs love this food, and I don't think I'll ever switch.  Their health is important to me, and this food seems to deliver on that.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: We have 6 dogs, all sizes, varieties & ages.  The oldest is 12 years old and the last several years, she has developed a spring/summer skin condition that causes her to itch and scratch and lose her fur.  She would lay on the floor next to us and chew and scratch to try to get some relief.  Her skin would get an oozing rash and she was miserable.  We tried different shampoos, lotions, steroid shots - anything to give her some relief.<br />My wife suggested she might have an allergy to the carbohydrates/gluten in her food that got worse in the south Texas heat.  We ordered a bag of the Blue Buffalo dry dog food and after the first feeding, she laid down next to us and did not scratch one time all evening.  Her fur has grown back and she no longer has the patches of nasty, smelly rash on her.  She now has energy to run up the stairs, run around in the yard and acts like she did as a puppy.  The change in less than a week is amazing!<br />We have ordered more Blue Buffalo for all 6 of our dogs and our cat. Their coats are shinier and their eyes sparkle more.  Thank you for making our pets healthier and happier.

They've trimmed down (lost some excess weight), coats are sleek and shiny, and they have much more energy.  And it has NO CORN!  Both our dogs are rescue animals.  One has had a problem with odor - she simply STINKS.  Blue Buffalo dramatically improved her odor, too!  We love Blue Buffalo and will continue to feed it.

review/summary: I swear by Blue Buffalo for my dogs
review/text: My father adopted a dog a year and a half ago to train for search and rescue work.  My dad considered diet to be an integral part of keeping the dog's mind and body finely tuned for search and rescue work so he conducted a few trial months of various dog foods, monitoring changes in energy level, coat health, bowel movements, and general interest in taste.  Blue Buffalo performed the best.  My dad's dogs coat is now extremely plush with no dry flakiness he had when he was first adopted, at a very healthy weight with tons of energy, has had no illnesses whatsoever, and happens to thoroughly enjoy his meals.<br /><br />I adopted a dog for myself about 5 months ago.  The previous owner warned me of his having an sensitive and irritable stomach (prone to diarrhea and bloating) and being picky about foods. Because of that, they'd had him on some ridiculously expensive prescription foods.  He wasn't at a healthy weight and had dry itchy skin with excess shedding, and was a little lethargic.  I immediately switched him over to Blue Buffalo when I got him home, since it worked so well for my dad.  His skin has since totally recovered.  He hasn't had any bowel problems, even when I give him the occasional table scrap. He's now has a very sleek athletic body. And I get compliments all the time about how glossy and beautiful his coat is.  I swear by Blue Buffalo to keep my furry friend healthy, comfortable, and happy.<br /><br />Also, even though it's more expensive upfront than some other main brands, the food is so nutritious that he doesn't need to eat as much of it as he does the others, and it actually saves me money in the long term.

review/text: My dogs are crazy.  I've tried for years to get them to eat high quality foods.  We've done Innova Evo, Wellness, Canidae, Call of the Wild.  They always act like I'm torturing them.  So I would end up feeding them Purina Pro Plan and feeling bad about life.  One day, my husband accidentally purchased a bag of Purina One and then they insisted that was the only food for them.  They decided to bunch Pro Plan in with the health foods and boycott it.<br /><br />One of my dogs is pretty skinny with a very high metabolism, so I can't afford him showing ribs and convincing people I'm not feeding him.  So for a while I gave in, and just mixed a high quality food in with the Purina One and let them pick out the pieces.<br /><br />Anyways, I decided to try Blue Buffalo because I was almost out of food and my car was acting funny and there it was on Amazon Prime... HOLY HELL they love this food!  They just eat it right up, no complaints, no looking back at me expectantly.  They enjoy it even more than they enjoyed their garbage food, and I don't have to feel bad about what I'm feeding them!<br /><br />The ingredients are great, the caloric content is good and pretty dense for my skinny boy, and the kibble size is good for my three sized dogs (XL, Medium, and Small but Fat).<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors and perhaps trying a higher quality Blue Buffalo food, but for now I'm just glad they're eating something decent for once!

review/summary: A little more expensive, but worth every penny!
review/text: We upped our amount that we were willing to spend on our dogs' food and haven't looked back!  Prior to Blue Buffalo, our dogs usually got Pedigree or a store brand that might be on sale at the time. We have really noticed a difference in their coats & energy levels since making the switch.  Their fur is so shiny and they don't just lay around all of the time as they did before.  They don't seem to eat as much of the Blue Buffalo either as I guess that it keeps them fuller longer.<br /><br />Our black lab has some skin issues and many foods make her itch like crazy.  We did try the Chicken & Rice Recipe of Blue Buffalo and it irritated her as well so now we stick to the Lamb and Rice Recipe.  At any rate, if you are considering making the switch I would definitely recommend Blue Buffalo.

review/text: I switched my dogs from chicken soup for the pet lovers soul to blue buffalo and immediately my dogs and my cat started shedding so bad that I had furballs rolling around my house like tumbleweed! I kept them on it to see if it was just an initial reaction to the food change only to find that they started itching like they had fleas and had so much dander they looked like they had rolled in powder. I then read the ingredient panel to find the second ingredient in blue is chicken meal... Chicken meal could be anything! So after much reading of ingredient panels the one food I have always known to be five star was Merrick and they love their wet food so I switched them to Grammys pot pie dry food and viola! Instant change! In less than three days my dogs dander has gone away, their coats are shiny and beautiful again and the tumbleweeds of hair have stopped. I think that with all the advertising by blue they just have their name out there more but really it isn't much better than a grocery store dog food, I mean really chicken meal?! When it claims to be so much better then other foods I expect it to make them look beautiful not dusty and shedding like crazy. I only write this so that people can know that it all depends on the dog and that sometimes the less flashy things are better. Merrick dog foods have never let me down and I shall not be switching unless something changes. Oh also I noticed that Blue had a voluntary recall of their dry dog foods due to too much vitamin D, it's on their website all the details so check your bags sell by dates to the ones listed. Hope this was helpful!

review/summary: Stopped the siezures
review/text: My Beagle/Terrier mix was having siezures. At the time I was feeding her food you can buy a grocery store. After a particularly bad siezure, I researched the internet and saw something about diet contributing to siezures and the bi-products in cheap dog food. I switched her to the Blue Buffalo, she loves it, eats less and has not had a siezure in over 2 years!

review/summary: Fantastic dog food
review/text: We have 2 dogs, Dachshund and a German Shepherd.  Our GSD has a food senitivity to many commercial foods which was narrowed down to the fillers and other junk found in many dog foods, even "premium" brands.  Our astute vet recommended a food with high quality meat protein and a novel carbohyrate source such as sweet potato or rice, but one only.  After several foods, (all "premium", at least in price) we tried Blue Buffalo.  Problems disappeared in a snap.  She competes in working trials and Schutzhund work and has more energy and vitality; coat looks shiny and great.  She's been on this food now for 2 years and has done fantastic, both dogs love the taste.  I'm not a holistic tree-hugger, but this is a top quality product--ingredients are nothing you couldn't feed a person.  Read the ingredients on the food you feed; corn is garbage in dog food and a filler only, it is poorly digested by dogs and has zero nutitional value in a canine.  So many companies also use "meat by-products" which can mean anything from feathers, beaks, hooves and other scraps to outright rendered road kill, diseased and euthanized animals--I've actually called a couple of other companies to inquire about what exact forms of "meat" they use, and ALL refused to elaborate.  This food really is not much different in price than many other "high end" dog foods and is clearly a healthier choice for your best friend.  And no, I do not work for Blue Buffalo.

review/text: Since using Blue, my active English Pointer hunting dog is more lean and muscular. And, when I changed from a major brand dog food to Blue Brown Rice and Lamb. My dog just looked healthier. His endurance noticeably improved. Bottom line, Walker just was better off.<br />We just did not know what an improvement the Blue would produce. my dog is very valuable. He works hard. He brings great joy to us. I order Blue online, and have it delivered. I always valued nutrition for my kids...same goes for my hunting dog !

review/summary: From dull coats to Shiny
review/text: Our 3 dogs (Lab, Border Collie and Pomeranian) are all doing very well on this Blue Buffalo dogfood.  We feed the older dog the product they make for older dogs!  They are healthy and happy and their coats are shiny again.  We  had been using Iams for many years, and something changed in the last year or so, and they didn't have the shine, and I find that to be an indicator of good health.  Also they were shedding more than normal.  I switched to this food, about 4 months ago, and they are doing so much better.  Our dogs are not picky eaters, so I am not sure if all dogs would love it, but they do! We will continue to feed them this brand.

review/summary: A Golden Review
review/text: We started using  Blue Buffalo Dry Dog Food because our Golden Retriever was constantly scratching, and her coat was dull.  I was told that the retriever breed is often sensitive to corn and the other "fillers" used in the less expensive bags of dog food, and was told to look for kibble that is corn and filler free, with protein and vegetables as the most prevalent ingredients.  Voila!  The scratching stopped, her coat is shiny, her teeth are tartar free, and she is thriving.  Happy, healthy dog, happier dog owner.  It gets delivered right to my front door, so I don't have to lug the thirty pound bag.  Thank you, Amazon.

review/text: Our 4 dogs have tried just about all of the lamb and rice foods out there at one time or another. Blue Buffalo is my first choice because they gobble it right up without adding anything to it! I will buy another brand if the store is out of this, but I have to add grated cheese to entice them to eat it! This one they love right out of the bag!

review/text: Blue Buffalo is amazing. I have a 90lb lab and 20lb mutt, both get Blue Buffalo and love it! We have tried other brands (Evo, Nutro, etc...) and Blue Buffalo is by far the best.  Our lab gets ear infections from any other type of food and our mutt is a picky eater. Both of them scarf this down with no problems! We also have switched our cat onto Blue Buffalo, and he loves it. HIGHLY recommended, worth the extra money and is it of good quality and you actually end up feeding you pet less of this food than others.

review/summary: Explosive Beagle Farts
review/text: It's hard for me to rate this stuff, since I've never tasted it myself, but my Beagle absolutely loves it. He had no trouble transitioning to this brand from the crappy stuff his previous owner was feeding him. To be fair, I kept him on that food until the bag they gave me ran out too, so I know what he was like before the switch too.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it is, as the title of this review suggests, the flatulence. Ever since I switched him over to this food, he's been healthy and happy, but he now has the stinkiest farts I've ever smelled and he unleashes AT LEAST one a day.<br /><br />Sure, it's hilarious when he does it in my room mate's room, but not so much in my own or when we have company over.

review/summary: Ok for about 6 months, then...
review/text: My Scottish Terrier was eating varietals of Blue Buffalo for 6 months+ with no problem. Suddenly she began vomiting and having bloody diarrhea. The Vets recommended a 24 hour fast with a pure chicken and rice diet for a few days. Problem solved. She was back to normal. I integrated the Blue Buffalo back into her diet and the bloody diarrhea started again. Another visit to vet and a more detailed discussion about her diet... the vet's response: " Oh yeah, we get a lot of cases of that with Blue Buffalo. "<br /><br />She was fine as soon as I took her off of it 2 months ago and has been totally normal since.<br /><br />I will never recommend or buy this product again.

review/text: My husband and I had to look for a new dog after our little guy kept having stomach issues.  Isn't doesn't help that he's a goat and eats everything is site (even if it's not meant to be edible).  I had heard good things about this brand and it has done wonders for friends who have pets with severe food allergies.  It was definitely the right choice for us.<br /><br />Both of our dogs have been on the Lamb and Rice for almost a year.  The only reason I gave this excellent food 4-stars instead of 5 is the price.  I don't care where you get this food, it's MUCH more expensive than other foods.  We tried to switch our dogs off Blue for that reason, but they simply didn't do as well.  Their coats are shinier, their bowels are more regular (TMI?), etc.  We'll stick with this food for as long as we can!

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: I thought I was buying my 3 year old rat terrier (she weighs about 20 pounds but is just a bigger rat terrier, she is quite trim) a good dog food when I took my vets recommendation of Purina Pro Plan.<br /><br />Turns out I was wrong.  She has always had tons of energy, trim build, and shiny fur, but since we've switched her to Blue Buffalo the change has been pretty astonishing.  Her hair is so shiny black that in this springtime sun she looks like she's glistening.  Even from switching a dog from a horrible dog food to something like purina pro plan I haven't seen this much of a change.  I highly recommend this brand.<br /><br />I got her Lamb and Rice, which she loves.  With the old dog food she would eat it, but you could tell she didn't really like it all that much.  She comes running when I fill the bowl up now.  She's silly and she picks the little "vitabits" or whatever they're called out but will eat them when I put them back in the bowl?<br /><br />I do recommend switching a dog slowly to this if you're coming from a lower quality dog food.  It can be hard on their stomachs...if you've ever switched to a very healthy diet very quickly you can probably relate.

I have not noticed weight loss in either, but they are happy, healthy and love the food. I like the food because there is no seafood in it, which gives our dog's bad breath. There breath is fresh (or at least not smelly) with this food.

review/summary: Helped my dog's skin condition
review/text: My border collie mix was having itching so intense that I had to put a cone on her to keep her from destroying her skin. Otherwise, she would chew until she had raw wounds. We took her to the vet and they suggested she may have food allergies. They wanted us to try a pricey kind of Science Diet, but said that we could also start with a lamb and rice formula. The Science Diet was expensive and had of a lot of unnatural ingredients, so we decided to try this dog food instead. It has been great for her. As soon as it arrived she was sniffing excitedly at the bag. We put her on this food immediately because we wanted the itching to stop. I think as a result she vomited a few times in the beginning due to the abrupt change. She also had gas. Now she is nearly through the bag of food and those issues have all but disappeared. Her hair has grown back and her coat is shiny and healthy. No more incessant chewing and no more raw spots!

One is that it's expensive and my dog goes through one full size bag a month but she's totally worth it so even if I had 5 dogs I'd feed them all Blue. Second is that she gets bad gas at times and I think it's from the food but I am not 100% sure.

review/summary: Dogs love this food
review/text: I switched the dogs to this food from Eukaneuba Natural Lamb and Rice when we rescued a lab.  The trainer gave us a list of recommended foods and I read great reviews about this one.  Our golden retriever always had a good coat, but it was a little stiff.  It is so soft since switching 3 months ago.  I don't mix anything with the food, my dogs make little happy noises when I feed them because they like it so much.  Works great for us!

review/text: My dog developed an allergy to poultry products  and I tried this as an alternative. He absolutely loves it. I often mix it with Beneful simmered Beef or Beef Stew. He's getting great nutrition and snarfs it up as soon as set it on the floor for him.

review/summary: Only food i use.
review/text: With dog food i learned,  "You get what you pay for"...This food is a great meal for my Pit-bull at a decent value.  The nice thing about this food is because its not full of preservatives,  you do not need to load your dogs bowl up with food.  My dog is medium sized and eats 2x a day.  I spread the bottom of the bowl about 2 layers deep with food and that is more than enough for her until her next meal.  The Bag lasts me about 1.5 months before i have to re-up.  Its also awesome not having to lug around a 50lb bag...AMAZON PRIME FOR THE WIN!!! Right to the DOOR!!!

review/text: My dog seems to eat this food better than others.  Although, I must say I mix the Blue Buffalo with a handful of Benefeful (for the veggies) and half can of Alpo (for the gravy).  I feel BB has more protein and plan to buy more when this bag is used.

review/text: The UPS driver just delivered the first bag of food for my dogs to try.  Their interest was peaked immediately upon bringing the package into the house.  They quickly followed me into the kitchen and even tried to help me with opening the bag.  I no sooner put the food into their bowls and they immediately started chowing down.  I'm pretty sure they love it!  In fact, I've already reordered the next bag for them.  *****

review/summary: Blue Buffalo is good food
review/text: Recently my German Shorthaired Pointer started eating a ton of grass. He does eat anything he can find, like an old clif bar that he found on the side of the trail or a croissant that he grabbed out of the front seat of some guys car at the trail head, but grass was unusual. So I started researching the food I was feeding him, which was Science Diet active, and it is kind of a junky dog food. After hemming and hawing over what to feed him I decided to go with Blue Buffalo. It isn't off the Richter scale expensive, about 10 bucks more than the science diet, and the ingredient list is pretty good. It has changed his coat which is beautiful and soft, but he hasn't stopped munching on grass and he has insane gas thus the 4 stars. I am purchasing a second bag and we will see how it goes, but I am not too worried because he hasn't has diarrhea and has regular movements which is good for a neurotic dog.

review/summary: Noticable changes .... but watch for GAS!
review/text: All my dogs love this food ... but I ended up switching to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XGDG">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Salmon Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a>. My lab and dachshunds did just fine, and I could really tell the differences in their coat and they are so much more energetic. But my Great Dane, although loved the food, wouldn't stop having soft stools and I think her shedding got worse. We allowed 3 bags ... so about a month plus/minus a week or so to make sure the new food settle in, but her stomach really didn't like it so we switched the brand. I gave it 4 stars even though we switch because my lab and two weiners didn't have any problem and they liked it just fine. Wilderness is much more expensive, I think, but now all my dogs look and behave even better. It has more nutritious, and it's a different premium level than this one. So ... if you can afford it, try that one. But this is still 1000 times better than craps like Iams and Kibble n' Bits!!!!<br /><br />04/27/2012 UPDATE<br />So we completely switched to Eukanuba since then. We tried all the Blue products that was available -- nothing worked for my Dane. Her stomach isn't liking anything from Blue. So far Eukanuba is the only thing keeping her from diarrhea. It got so bad that I think our vet bill run up to almost $500. Not cool :(

review/summary: Really liking the lamb Blue Buffalo
review/text: Growing up, my family always gave our dogs good quality foods like Nutro, so I wanted to make sure my own pets ate well.  I'm on a tight post-college budget, but Blue Buffalo is totally worth it.  My 35 lb corgi mix gets 2/3 cup twice a day (plus whatever falls on the kitchen floor), and a 30 lb bag of Blue Buffalo lasts us 2 1/2 to 3 months.  My dog's coat is beautiful, her stools are normal, her weight is healthy and doesn't fluctuate.  She's a very happy dog, and when I think about how I'm feeding her for $20 a month, I'm a happy owner.<br /><br />We originally had her on the chicken and rice flavor for the first year or so, but when Amazon stopped carrying it we switched to the lamb and rice.  My dog seems to like the lamb even more (though to be fair, she's a corgi mix and will eat anything).  I've also noticed she has significantly less eye boogers than she did on the chicken flavor.  I was wiping substantial boogers off her eyes once or twice a day before, and now I clean just dried stuff off her face maybe twice a week.  She doesn't have any health conditions, so I guess there may have been an allergen in the chicken flavor that's not in the lamb.

review/text: Love, love, love the ease, convenience, and PRICING of this dog food!  Bought one small bag at PetCo locally before ordering the 30-lb bag thru Amazon, and paid almost the same price.  Downside:  We have a spoiled "Princess" dog who is very choosy about her food, and to be honest, there has been none that she seems to like (and we've tried 'em all....)  So if your pooch is a fan of the Blue Buffalo brand, this is definitely the way to go....ESPECIALLY with the free shipping.  Can't fault this product because we have a finicky-appetite dog.

review/text: The ingredients are good. I have heard many great things about this dog food. I rotate Kendrells' food every bag and she didn't care for this much. Also, I'd like to add that I purchased this from amazon when I normally go through K9 cuisine and was very disappointed that the food was about to expire in a month... they should be checking the expiration dates before sending out. 30 pounds is a lot of food for 1 dog to be eating and there was no way she would have finished it in a month.

review/summary: Wished it would have worked out
review/text: Our veterinarian recommended Blue Buffalo. We have a very itchy corgi mix and was hoping this food would be the answer. We switched from Iams premium protection. He had no stomach troubles with the switch which we did over about a week. He has been on it about five weeks now. At first it seemed to be helping, but I had also started bathing him more frequently. This week I noticed more hair loss than normal and now he has some bald patches and sores in his armpits. I guess we will be switching him back and try to find something new.<br /><br />I don't think that there is anything wrong with the food, but there is something in it that makes our dog's allergies worse and not better.

review/summary: Great upgrade over Purina. Worth the price.
review/text: This food is certainly more expensive than the 50# sack of Purina we were buying at the local club warehouse. From $.50/lb to $1.50/lb. I noticed the dogs getting less interested in the Purina, some health issues creeping into their 6-month exams and I had heard wonderful things about Blue Buffalo. The food is loved by the boys. They have dropped the weight they were packing on, back into prime shape. I cannot say for certain their coats are so much nicer but I do feel confident in the food being better for them. Cockers have a lot of health issues. I figure this is an investment, a money saver in the long run to feed them right than treat the problems with the lesser foods.

review/summary: Customer Service?
review/text: I was a Blue Buffalo advocate from day one when I purchased it for my dog.  The ingredients were fantastic for a pet-parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken (which is hard to find).  I'm a trainer at Petsmart and told all of my clients about this product.  This was before I had to deal with their customer service department.  On my way home from work one night I realized I needed to stop and get a bag so I swung by a Complete Petmart and picked up a bag.  I got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year.  On the bag it said they guarantee their product 100% and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date.  Why did I have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates?  In my Petsmart, Blue Buffalo has a store rep who is supposed to be rotating product and she visits every week.  How is this my responsibility?  They kept sending harassing e-mails and would never really answer my question as to why the store representative let a bag of what is supposed to be a high-quality brand sit there expired for almost a year.  I have since switched my dog to Evo and happy to report his stools are much more solid and he absolutely loves it.  I'm sad the customer service for this company doesn't exist because I truly believed in their product.  The only reason it got 1 star is because the first ingredient is actual meat and not a meal.

review/summary: Some of the best gum I've tried
review/text: For the most part, I found myself not generally a gun person. I would chew a piece or two a day to have decent breath, but if I could get my hands on a breath mint then I would opt for that instead. Now, the original trident never really suited the taste I was looking for- it was a sharp and strong mint flavor that, to me, was simply unpleasant. Of course, it was good for your teeth, so I grabbed some everyone once in a while anyway.<br /><br />Eventually I heard about this stuff. Supposedly amazing for your teeth (helps the enamel which means it isn't quite as sensitive to cold and heat), this gum caught my eye in the store and I had to try it... I fell in love at first chomp. It tastes, to me, like a combo of chocolate and mint. It has become my anti-chocolate, with an added bonus that it helps my teeth out! Unfortunately, it is pretty hard to get your hands on, so I order mine online in bulk. :)

review/summary: Might be Worth a Try
review/text: $20 for this product is okay.  I've been chewing about 6 - 8 pieces per day for 6 weeks, and I haven't really noticed a difference in my teeth, so it's hard to know if it's doing anything to strengthen them.<br /><br />Walgreens sells individual 14 piece packs for $1.50 each.  CVS sells 3 packs for $4.  I usually buy it at RiteAid.  It goes on sale every 3-4 weeks or so for 99 cents per individual pack, and I buy about 20 packs at a time.  If it were more expensive, I don't think I would bother.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, I have tried cool mint, peppermint, and spearmint.  The spearmint flavor wears out very quickly for some reason.  The cool mint is slightly "mintier" than the peppermint.  I think the cool mint and the peppermint flavors are both fine, and frankly, I don't notice a whole lot of difference between them.<br /><br />I've read that for the Recaldent chewing gums to work, you have to chew a LOT of it, so if you really REALLY like to chew gum and you don't have a RiteAid or CVS near you, buying this gum through Amazon for $18 - $20 is reasonable.  Again, it's hard to tell if it works, but I think it is worth a try.  Ask your dentist what he or she thinks.

A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

review/summary: Exceptional product!
review/text: I've battled horrific periods for years, especially after the birth of my second child.  I wish I would have known about this many years ago!  This tea is absolutely fantastic.  I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.

review/summary: Makes tasty bread
review/text: I used this to make some foccachia and to make regular white bread and it smells so sweet compared to the yeast i found at the grocery store. I used it just as the breadmaker recipe suggested without any complicated preparation or activation with water before hand and the bread came out very nicely.

review/summary: Tastier and less sugar than Gerber 2nd Foods Bananas with Apples & Pears
review/text: I used to order Gerber 2nd Foods Bananas with Apples & Pears until I tasted it. I found it extremely sweet, so I did some research online to find out that it contains 15g of sugar per container.<br />When I looked for a substitute, I came across this fixed fruits, "Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit", which has 50% less sugar (10g per container) and has apricots in addition to apples, pears and bananas.<br />My son loves this mixed fruit puree and I love it too!

review/summary: Great fruit mix, but contains 50% more sugar
review/text: This is a great mix of fruits with apples, pears and bananas. However, it contains 50% more sugar than other Gerber 2nd foods such as Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit and Gerber 2nd Foods Pear & Pineapple (10g of sugar instead of 15g per container)<br />I did not realize how sweet it is until I tasted the food.

review/summary: Sweet but good
review/text: These come in plastic containers and not glass which was a plus for me as they are easy to transport without the risk of breaking.  My daughter loved the taste, I guess because it is fairly sweet tasting.

review/summary: My baby loves prunes!
review/text: We try to buy her Nature's Best Organics but they frequently do not have prunes and Delia demands prunes. Prolly because Earth's Best used a lot of bananas which can stop a baby up. Trying to wean her off...but as long as she wants them, I'll order them for her.
