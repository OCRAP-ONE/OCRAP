review/summary: Very versatile
review/text: I use coconut oil for many different things:<br /><br />1. My hair: it is very moisturizing and gives me soft, silky hair like no other product has ever given me before. I've used other oils on my hair before (such as extra virgin olive oil), but coconut oil is the best. It is the only oil that can penetrate the hair shaft.<br /><br />2. My skin: coconut oil moisturizes my skin very well. It is also a very good makeup remover. I use coconut oil on any dry spots on my skin, but I do not use it on my face. While many people have no problems using coconut oil as a facial moisturizer, it can be a problem for someone with acne prone skin.<br /><br />3. Cooking: coconut oil is great for cooking. It adds a really great flavor to a bowl of oatmeal. I sometimes even add some into my coffee. I've made cookies and bars with coconut oil and have had great results.

review/summary: the best
review/text: I am now a confirmed addict of this stuff. If I run out, I start craving it. Popcorn is just not the same without melted coconut oil and sprinkling of coarse sea salt. Cannot be morre specific than to say that my body 'feels' better--joints, mobility, sense of well being since I started consumming it regularly. The scent of it is intoxicating as well. I for one don't need a scientific "paper" to tell me what my body needs and responds well to.

review/summary: So tasty, so good for you!
review/text: It's rare to find a food that's both utterly delicious and, at the same time, fantastically good for you -- but this is one of those.  Coconut oil isn't just a great, healthy fat, it's also a fat that adds a delicious coconut flavor to anything you cook with it.  I was used to coconut as a sweet thing, but through working with this I've found that it goes wonderfully with a wide range of savory foods too.<br /><br />I've no experience of any other brand of coconut oil, as this was the first one I tried.  However, it's such good quality that I'd not consider trying another one now.  Really excellent, and something to make sure you always have in your cupboard, especially if you're following a Paleo style of diet.

review/summary: Nutiva Is The Best Brand!
review/text: When it comes to taste, texture and scent, this is not only by far but the best brand out there! This is made in the Philippines - one of the top three countries where coconuts are bountiful. Trust me! There are so many health beneficial you can get from coconut oil. Google it or read a book about Lauric Acid, which is the main source of the coconut oil. You will find other great health benefits of this product. As for me, I take 2 tablespoons everyday.<br /><br />The price went up a little bit because the consumer demand is getting huge! But still Amazon has the cheapest price out there. You can compare the price to any herb/organic retail store. Ordering through Amazon will save you more.

review/summary: Very Good Oil
review/text: This is a very good organic coconut oil.  I think this one is the most selling coconut oil in the market right now.  I'd highly recommend this oil, but not Amazon for buying it.  It took them an entire week just to prepare the shipment, and they couldn't give me a good reason why they took so long.  I placed another order through via different website yesterday, and I've already received an e-mail today and indicated that I'll receive this shipment tomorrow!  This oil has a strong aroma, and I like it.  However, my husband hates it, and if you don't like the smell of coconut, I'd recommend Jarrow brand that is brown bottle.  It's also organic, but it's expeller pressed, so I heard it's almost odorless.  I'll also buy Jarrow in the future to use more widely in cooking.  I use Nutiva from head to toe, and I also use it to make scrambled eggs.  You can smell the oil in the food, so if you don't like the coconut smell, that'd be a problem.

review/summary: Gives a Good Hint of Coconut to Food
review/text: Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil tastes so good in all the pan fried foods I've cooked so far.  I've fried up char-siu fried rice, shrimp fried rice, scrambled eggs, and even made grilled cheese sandwiches using this oil.  Everything comes out tasting great, with just a tiny hint of coconut aftertaste - not enough to overpower the dishes, but just enough for people to go "what was that extra seasoning you used?  It's really good!".<br /><br />The bottles pictured are not exactly the bottle you will receive - I got two smaller looking tubs of the coconut oil.  There were no problems with shipping, but I did notice that on a 70 degree day that my bottle of oil went liquid, so I can see problems arising when shipping during summer.  I haven't tried using this product on my skin or hair, but I can imagine it would smell nice - I love coconut!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great Product & Amazon Service. Expect Greasy Delivery in Hot Weather.
review/text: The benefits of organic Coconut Oil are endless and this brand is wonderful.  Another reviewer had warned about ordering cocounut oil in hot weather days. Coconut oil is liquid at room temperature, so it'll probably leak & evaporate from jar at 85*F+  (wildly guessing here).<br /><br />If you look at the same item in FL store shelves, their jars are kinda greasy too especially in the spring/summer months.<br /><br />I got my shipment today. Amazon did a superb job in packaging. And yet no matter how well packaged, the jars in bubble wrap, plastic bag & box, leaked the same.<br /><br />Gotta expect the oil to leak from jar while in transit in hot weather and also be prepared to do some smart cleaning upon receipt.  I suggest leaving jars in bubble wrap + bag. Place all on paper towels and put inside fridge for 1/2 hr. When oil is solid, remove wrappings. Rinse jars under warm water, use oil residue on hands, arms, face (never let a good crisis go to waste!)  Inspect lids & seals. All should be intact, maybe just a tad oily. After rinsing & once product is partially solid, there should be NO leaking from anywhere. If so, then the jar must be cracked. Remove oil and place in another container -- a glass jar would be best.<br /><br />The product is great and perhaps worth the hassle if ordering in hot days. Another option, would be to place orders in cooler months. No mess. No stress.

review/summary: Delicious smelling body lotion and hair treatment
review/text: I had been using Barleans organic coconut oil for cooking and as a body lotion and a conditioning treatment for my dry curly hair.  I decided to order the Nutiva brand because it was about half the price.  All in all I am pleased with  my purchase.  I slightly prefer the Barleans because I think it is smoother and has a fresher scent, the Nutiva smells more sweet and has a bit of a lingering smell. I have not used the Nutiva brand in cooking yet. But I love organic coconut oil and Nutiva has a great price on amazon.

review/summary: New user and LOVE it!!
review/text: I was searching for a lotion for my husband's psoriasis and the search engine brought up coconut oil!  I thought that was unusual, but decided to start researching coconut oil and its uses.  Wow!  This natural oil has so many uses and is extremely healthy!  It is anti-bacterial, anti-microbal, anti-viral, and anti-fungal.<br />  I've been putting it on my husband's psoriasis for three days, but it hasn't been long enough to tell yet whether it will help; I'll keep you posted.<br />  Awesome moisturizer--I've been using it for the last week as a body oil after I shower and everynight on my face before bed, and my skin is so smooth and soft!  It soaks right in as long as you use it sparingly with no greasy feeling.<br />  Natural deoderant--I found a homemade deoderant recipe on the internet today and will let you know in a later post how it works.<br />  Toothpaste Booster--Since it has anti-bacterial properties, I have been using 1/2 and 1/2 of my usual toothpaste and coconut oil to brush my teeth!  I know that sounds disgusting, but coconut oil does not feel oily in your mouth...honest!<br />  I have been taking 1T morning (with my calcium pills because it's supposed to help your body absorb nutrients more efficiently), noon and night without changing what I eat and lost two pounds in a week!  I was pleasantly surprised when I felt full for longer periods of time and was also eating less at each meal because I felt satisfied.  Another plus was that I was no longer constantly snacking in the evenings, which has been my worst habit to break but now I don't even feel like snacking!  Some people mentioned they<br />  I found my dog loves licking my skin after putting on coconut oil, so I've been researching to find out if it's good for dogs.  From what I've read so far, it is just as healthy for her, too!

review/summary: Taste fantastic with just about anything and not strong...
review/text: This is the best-tasting oil on the market for 1 simple reason.  Unlike my other fave, evoo, it is not strong in flavor and you can fry chicken with it or use it for "buttering" cheese toast and although the coconut smell is stronger, the taste is sort of mildly bland, barely there at times, if you use it sparingly.<br /><br />What I absolutely love are the monounsaturated fat health benefits you derive every time you use this certified organic cold-pressed coconut oil.<br /><br />I cannot believe how absolutely positively fantastic I feel.  I wish I had thought to baste the organic Plainville farms turkey I got a few months back with this oil, I think it would have been a treat!  There are so many yummy ways you can use this oil to bring out even more flavors from you food.  My husband loved stir-fried KFC chicken breast and some frozen veggies together in lots of the coconut oil.  And I stir-fried roast Asian duck, and crispy Asian pork with this oil and some frozen veggies.<br /><br />It is versatile and although bland-tasting when used sparingly can add delicious and unique carribean or island flavor when you use it more generously.<br /><br />I love this brand and I am hooked, line and sinker on this oil.  I will be considering looking locally for their hemp and other products to compare with Amazon.com prices as well.

review/text: Love, love LOVE Nutiva EVCO.  Previously I had been using the 365 Brand which is an in-store brand provided by a health food store.  It was ok, but it had zero scent and was a bit lumpy.  This brand is SO much better, I love the scent of light coconut and the packaging is plastic which is great because its not super heavy like the glass jars I usually encounter (and the fact that I am a bit clumsy and could easily drop and shatter it).  Its super versatile for cooking, I give it to my dog and cats for their overall health and well-being, and I use it as a hair conditioner which is by far my favorite use for it (as a preshampoo or overnight conditioner).  HIGHLY recommended.

There is a slight coconut undertaste that cooks away at higher temps.  I have a Presto Microwave popcorn popper and it works well with that. I also used some on my hair to see if it would stop the breakage I'm having due to medications but no change yet.  It has however made an improvement on my finger cuticles so maybe with time it would help my hair too. I say give it a try, you don't lose anything if you use it in place of another oil you were going to buy.

review/summary: Tastes like coconut, is delicious and healthy!
review/text: I wanted to try coconut oil after hearing about the health benefits.  In the winter, you don't need to worry about it spilling in shipment because it is solid below 76 degrees F.  I don't actually like shredded coconut but I love the taste of this coconut oil (guess I don't like the texture of coconut!).  I've only used it once so far, and that was to cook a Mexican-style fajita mix with vegetables (onion, garlic, peppers, tomato, and chile) and black beans.  There was a hint of the coconut flavor in the finished product, but it tasted really good!  I am trying to figure out how to eat more of this oil, but I will definitely use it in place of olive oil for sauteeing vegetables.  It is safe for cooking up to 350 degrees.  It melts quickly.  This is good quality coconut oil for a great price!  I bought it here on Amazon because I wanted to try it and the price was much cheaper than elsewhere online.

review/summary: I really enjoy it's clean fresh taste and light texture.
review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has become my favorite cooking oil since I discovered it about 2 years ago. I really enjoy it's clean fresh taste and light texture. I now only use real butter about 10% of the time for it's butter flavor and extra virgin olive less than 5% of the time in a few Italian dishes.  I no longer use shortening or margarine or other cooking oils for cooking or baking. I keep small amounts in fancy recycled jars in my bathrooms,bedrooms and purse to use instead of hand lotions or massage/body oils.  I love how it softens and protects my skin in Idaho's dry climate.

review/summary: Great for kitchen and bath use!
review/text: I had never heard of using coconut oil for either cooking or body use.  It wasn't until my massage therapist starting using it for massaging, that I became aware of it's many uses.  I just rec'd. my second order and continue to find more and more uses.<br /><br />I use it primarily for hair and skin.  A small amount rubbed through my hair at night covered with a shower cap, and shampooed out in the morning leaves my hair soft and shiny.  This works much better than chemically laden and costly hair products.<br /><br />In place of commercial lotions, this leaves my dry skin soft and smooth.  The coconut fragrance is light and dissipates quickly, so it doesn't interfere with any other fragrances you may use.<br /><br />It has worked well with what little cooking I do!  LOL  Add a couple of spoonfuls to homemade smoothies.<br /><br />As for cost...Amazon's price is exactly half of my local health food store, for the identical brand.<br /><br />I do agree with many others regarding the packaging.  A glass jar would be preferable.  The plastic is too flimsy for the product.

review/summary: Excellent Coconut Oil
review/text: I use this oil in cooking. I've made muffins, cake, pancakes using this instead of butter - all turned out excellent and the recipes didn't require any finagling. It does impart a coconutty scent to a dish though I don't think that the flavor itself is noticeable. I especially like using this for stir-fries. It holds up to heat well and gives an extra dimension to the many scents/flavors in asian dishes. It pairs really nicely with lots of chili and lime.<br /><br />I also use the oil as a body moisturizer. It is absolutely wonderful for the skin after a shower. I've even used it on my hair. a little goes a long way but i like to smear it on when still in the shower and dry some of it off. Its also great for the lips throughout the day. My skin is very soft and the smell fades as you dry.<br /><br />I love this package because I can put one tub in the kitchen and one in the bathroom.

review/summary: Organic extra virgin coconut oil
review/text: I decided to purchase this coconut oil at the recommendation of various nutrition experts because of the medium chain fatty acids in coconut oil.  I learned that coconut oil consists of predominately medium-chain fatty acids which digest more easily, are the kinds of fats in mother's milk, and are preferentially used by the liver as a source of fuel to produce energy.<br /><br />Cooking can significantly affect many fats and oils causing the formation of toxic compounds. However, coconut oil is safe for cooking because it is the oil with the largest amount of saturated fatty acids and the least amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Ninety-two percent is saturated and only 1.5 percent is polyunsaturated. You can use coconut oil for cooking without having to worry about it harming your health. It is so stable you can reheat the oil and use it several times without damaging it. Not only does coconut not form harmful toxins when heated, but it also has many health benefits.<br /><br />For more information on coconut oil benefits, I recommend Dr. Bruce Fife's books on the subject.<br /><br />I love the taste of this oil and use it almost exclusively for cooking.  I put it in our morning oatmeal for a wonderful coconut flavor and the added health benefits that it gives.  I use it in most of my baked goods, as well.

review/summary: Many different uses!
review/text: This has been incredible as a moisturizer, I use it like butter on toast, and cooking with it gives everything an awesome flavor.  It's one of the best things in the world for you, and I make sure my son gets at least a spoonful of it a day.  Only difficulty I've had with it is that I just moved to a warmer climate, where it is 80 inside instead of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, so instead of having the consistency of butter, it stays liquid unless I put it in the fridge, where it gets hard as a rock. So I leave it out since the liquid is easier to use, but I miss that in-between state where its a soft solid so I can spoon it instead of pour it. Not going to run the A/C all day just for my coconut oil!

review/summary: best coconut oil I have found
review/text: I am happy to say that I found the texture in the jar to be harder then I thought (though it may have been a bit frozen from outside in the box). It definitely smells like coconut, like a mounds bar. I was so concerned about the popcorn tasting like nothing but coconut. I was VERY surprised buy the wonderful taste it gives the popcorn, I can't believe I never realized at the movies that the reason the popcorn taste so good is that bit of coconut flavor to it. It also left my popcorn machine very clean, when the other oil coated the whole machine in a greasy gunk. Combine with Eden Organics Organic popcorn kernels from Amazon for a total organic popcorn. I received a mini popcorn machine like you would find in a theater for Christmas. After going through the sample packs of yellow gunk oil that came with it for popping I searched for a more healthier and natural way to make popcorn. I read a lot about different oils people use, but one thing was always the same, if you want it to taste like at the movies use coconut oil.

review/summary: This is What REAL Coconut Oil Should Be
review/text: I've heard of the benefits of coconut oil towards overall health and how others have used this product for their hair and skin. I use this as a hair and skin conditioner. It is much easier to apply than extra virgin olive oil, but works just as well for healthy hair growth. As for my skin, I've stopped buying regular lotion because it softens and conditions it on its own.<br /><br />I can't offer a review about cooking with this oil, although coconut oil in general tolerates higher temperatures than other oils due to its primarily solid state. I'll have to buy more and test it out:-)

review/text: I use it for cooking and as a supplement. I take 2-3 tablespoons during my workout and I am totally pumped. This is a great product if you are doing low-carb and need that extra energy kick for intense exercise, since the MCT in coconut oil are absorbed and burned very fast. It also aids in weight loss. It tastes great, too.

review/text: Well it is coconut oil... So yeah, good stuff. lol I use it on my two month old's face and even in her hair for cradle cap. It works really well for a skin moisturizer especially for babies and toddlers because it is so mild and smells like food! I caught my three old daughter licking her hands after I put it on her one day.<br />I have yet to cook with it since I just started using it like a week ago, but I am actually planning on using it in the kitchen.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I use this on a daily basis for cooking. I love sauteing mushrooms and onions in it, and my day doesn't go so well without my eggs fried in coconut oil. It is so good for you! Before anyone knocks the amount of saturated fat in it, do some research on the benefits CERTAIN KINDS of saturated fat. They are not all equal. I have also been using this as a diaper rash remedy for my two year old. It works way better than any other cream I have used. And I have used them all...

review/text: I purchased this and the shipment was fast which is a big plus. Ignoring the fact that it's in a plastic container, this stuff is awesome. It smells and taste just like when my mother makes coconut oil so I know that it's organic and all natural. All the other oils I've purchased usually have a strong overpowering smell and usually remain liquid even in cold temperatures letting me know they aren't good. I've made my own but it only makes a bit so I thought I'd try Nutiva and I'm glad I did. This stuff has the light nutty smell and solidifies quickly true to coconut oil. I'd definitely recommend this stuff.

review/summary: Great for cooking and skin/haircare!
review/text: I did a lot of research and EV Coconut Oil is the healthiest oil to use for high heat cooking. Don't mistake healthy for bland tasting either, the coconut flavor actually enhances the dishes I cook. The oil is solid at room temp, it quickly turns to a liquid when heated. I also use this product as a leave in hair conditioner. This is no exaggeration when I say it works better than any commercial hair conditioner product I've tried. It works well as a facial moisturizer too. To use it on your face or hair, just put some of the oil in your palms, it will be solid so to liquefy it rub both palms together in a circular motion, after a few seconds you will have a natural, effective skin and haircare solution in the palm of your hands.

review/summary: Coconut oil can seep past the new opaque white plastic Jar.
review/text: I really enjoy this oil; it's great for cooking and has many other uses as well. What I didn't like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that Nutiva now uses for the coconut oil. I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar. This was not a problem with the previous jars. Nutiva should address this problem right away.

review/text: You can't find coconut oil in many stores. While I hope that changes soon, I need to get my "fix".  Nutiva has a clean, lightly coconut scented product with good prices for the size. It's organic and cold pressed so heat hasn't rendered away any antioxidants and benefits. I use it like butter on bagels, and for my cooking oil. I use olive oil for salads because coconut oil is a solid under about 70 to 75. I also use it for oil pulling for dental health. I mildly dislike the plastic container but I've read that the grade is good and won't leach chemicals into the contents.

review/text: I use coconut oil almost exclusively now and had this set up to deliver monthly, but found a cheaper brand (Luana) at Wal-Mart, so had been buying that instead.  Well, ran out of Louana brand and found that I had a bit of this left from my last order.  When I opened it up the smell of coconut was a pleasant surprise.  I opened the louana tub again, no smell.  I love making popcorn with this oil and one of the things I liked was the coconut scent and flavor, mild though it is.  So I'm back on a monthly subscription service with the Nutiva again :)  It's a good value compared to others that I have looked at also.

review/summary: Nutiva vs. Barlean's
review/text: Both are organic and cold-pressed. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a> discernibly smells more of coconut. The consensus seems to be that it has a smoother texture and stronger coconut flavor. So if you're eating it by the spoonful or spreading it on toast or want a shot in your smoothie, that would be the way to go, if you don't mind paying a little more.<br /><br />I'm mostly using coconut oil for cooking, so I like the more subtle fragrance of Nutiva. I can use it for most anything that calls for canola oil without everything tasting of coconut--mostly it just adds a certain savory quality, like umami, and makes your kitchen smell amazing.<br /><br />It's also great as a deep-conditioning treatment for hair. I leave it in for a few hours and my hair feels soft and unprocessed after washing it out with my regular shampoo. I love it because it changes the texture of my hair without weighing it down.

review/summary: Awesome Product
review/text: The coconut oil's aroma when I put it on toast or rice is just heavenly. The taste is amazingly good too! Since it came in two tubs, I have one in the kitchen for consumption and the other one in my bathroom for my hair since I researched and found that coconut oil is supposed to be good for natural hair. My mane is definitely softer to touch although it is typically not course or difficult to manage. I just got it last week so will see how it goes. The hot oil treatment with coconut oil is next on my to-do list. Careful when you use it on hair though, when I don't wrap my hair, I wake up with zits (prolly from the oil on my pillow). Some say it works to relieve acne, some say it causes acne. I blame it for the acne I have since I had been acne free for weeks until I applied the coconut oil on my hair.<br /><br />Overrall, I will be a regular buyer of this product.

review/summary: Well Worth Trying
review/text: I had been debating on buying a jar of coconut oil to try after having read about how versatile it is. I'm really glad I did and that I tried Nutiva first.<br />  I use one jar for "lotion" and to put on my daughter's diaper area when I change her. I was very pleased to see that it absorbs quickly and it leaves your skin super soft. I'm prone to acne and I have yet to have a breakout from using it. It smells awesome too. I'm not sure about the effect it has on diaper rash. I think it's more for prevention than treatment.<br />  The second jar, I keep in the fridge (it stays pretty hard in the fridge)and periodically eat a small spoon of it to help my acid reflux (I'm 24 weeks pregnant) and it tastes delicious. It's just like eating coconut flakes without all the sugar. I made a batch of fudge with a quarter of the butter substituted for coconut oil, and it came out so smooth and it tasted like a "Mounds Bar".<br />  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I have.

review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is pretty good but truth be told, this particular variety of coconut oil is exceptionally sweeter than the other brands which isn't really a benefit in my world.  I prefer just a taste of coconut- not to be overloaded with it.  Still, it is what it is.

review/summary: excellent product - great for baking
review/text: I heard all the hype about coconut oil and had to see it for myself.<br /><br />So far, i have tried it in place of unsalted butter for baking with a lot of success. I made chocolate chip cookies using it - and used my exact recipe but swapped coconut oil for butter. The cookies looked a little different than usual, but had a delicious crispy exterior and chewy interior. In fact, my kids preferred them.<br /><br />I also tried making brownies w/ them. I melted the coconut oil w/ my 63% chocolate over a double boiler and it looked more liquidy than when i do butter + chocolate. But i proceeded w/ the recipe and honestly, the brownies were delicious and i wouldn't have known the difference.<br /><br />I have been using it instead of canola oil for my eggs in the morning -- again, great results.<br /><br />I think it's an excellent cooking and baking fat and ordering it from amazon is very convenient. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: SO MANY USES!
review/text: I have a hair loss problem (female) and heard that this oil is an excellent conditioner. I apply a little amount to my hair, just enough to cover it from the roots to the tips, and a little to the scalp, and let it on for a couple of hours. After that I wash my hair a couple of times to perfectly remove all the "grease", and for a few days, even after a one or two additional washes, my hair feels so full of body and shiny that I love it (If you have few hairs you must make the most of them!!!). Be careful: if you apply too much and do not wash your hair properly you might get the contrary effect (a greasy dead hair stuck to your scalp)<br /><br />It smells so good! just like a tropical sweet... I tasted it and it is not bad but it certainly smells better than it tastes... as a matter of fact I would say that it was almost tasteless to me. I read about the benefits of oil pulling (rinsing your mouth with it and making it pass between your teeth to remove bacteria) and it is not disgusting at all, I will continue and see how it turns out. This oil pulling alternative has also proven useful for a relative that has Alzheimer's disease as a complement to brushing his teeth, which he sometimes finds difficult to accomplish properly. Allegedly, oil pulling provides better results than using Listerine or similar mouth washes, which by the way can also be "too spicy" for children and the picky elderly because of their content of alcohol.<br /><br />I have also applied it over rashes in the skin and minor scratches. Many people cook with it too, although I have not tried it for cooking.

review/summary: Excellent product!!!
review/text: Nutiva's brand of organic EV hexane-free coconut oil is awesome. First, I admit it's the first and only one I've tried, but after reading scores of reviews and my holistic health practitioner suggesting I take in 2 Tbsp. a day, I wanted the best. And at Amazon, you get the best prices, especially with Subscribe & Save (how great is that?)!<br /><br />When I opened the jar the very first time, I was amazed at the deliciously fresh coconut aroma. It's intoxicating! I do like coconut, so that helps. But it took me a while to get up the nerve to heat it up and pour it into my frozen fruit smoothie (frozen banana, strawberries, blueberries, juice). I thought somehow it'd solidify back up and I'd get big chunk-o-fat globules in my shake. Not at all!<br /><br />When I heated it up on the stove so that it'd liquify, the scent was of toasted coconut (mmmm, so yummy), so I thought it'd taste great in my smoothie. What surprised me was that it added no taste at all. I'm now using it every day, as suggested.<br /><br />Then it took me a while to try frying with it because I figured it'd impart mild coconut flavor to my savory dishes (potatoes, chicken, eggs), which I wouldn't want. But I just tried it over the past two days, a little with scrambled eggs and a lot with searing boneless breasts of chicken (which were finished in the oven on a tray coated with more coconut oil). I tasted zero coconut flavor in any of it! I am so psyched about this! So now I'll be using organic olive oil for dressings and other raw applications and coconut oil with nearly everything else.<br /><br />Also, I read that the plastic tubs it comes in are BPA-free...fabulous! Haven't tried baking with it yet, but I did use it on my very chapped hands, and it was great. Smells like ole Hawaiian Tropic!!! I love that beach smell!<br /><br />I highly and enthusiastically recommend Nutiva Coconut Oil...it is awesome!!!!

review/summary: Best Tasting Coconut Oil I've Tried:  Quality is A+
review/text: Nutiva's Organic coconut oil is the best I've found.  I've tried several brands, but nothing tastes as clean and pure as this.  There is a definite undertone of coconut, but I like the flavor, even when frying eggs or eating it on cinnamon raisin toast. I recently had bloodwork done and my HDL (the good cholesterol) was an impressive 77---anything over 39 is considered in range; over 50 is heart protective).  I attribute this great HDL number to using only coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in my cooking & drinking green tea.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer is a great deal; I really like the 2 pack of these smaller (15 oz) jars.  We're a small household and I like keeping one jar sealed while using the other.  Keep in mind that coconut oil is different than other oils--it is solid at temperatures under 72, so it will look something like shortening in the wintertime.  Still tastes great and is wonderful to use in all kinds of cooking.<br /><br />One more important detail:  this is an organic, COLD PRESSED coconut oil.  Others may be organically grown, but I've found some brands are hydrogenated to make them solid at room temperature (I won't go into all the reasons this is not a "good thing").  Suffice it to say that any coconut oil you buy should be cold pressed (and that goes for your olive oil, as well).  Google to find out why...<br /><br />Happy eating!

review/summary: amazingly delicious fresh coconut scent, beautiful white color, versatile, AND ORGANIC!
review/text: This is a marvelous product with some interesting health benefits (google it up). You can use it in baking, frying, in sauces, for vegan raw pies, mix with chocolate for puddings, moisturize your hair or skin, soothe rough elbows, etc.<br /><br />This melts really fast in a pan, so you don't need a high heat. I fry eggs in it, and the coconut taste is subtle. Any ethnic dish that requires sauteeing or saucing and can benefit from a fresh coconut flavor, this is useful. I've cooked meats in it, as well. If you hate the smell/taste of coconut, obviously, this is not for you.<br /><br />This brand, Nutiva, is organic and virgin. It smells so good. And I have an old jar that I never finished (really big one), and nearly two years later, after sitting right by the stove, it still smells fresh, like Cuban coconut candy my mom used to make. Yes, solid and fresh and white and fragrant TWO YEARS LATER. This is a very stable product.<br /><br />Recommended.

The oil's antimicrobial acids will help ward off indigestion causing bacteria and parasites.<br />11) cooking!

review/summary: Excellent, Clean-Tasting Coconut Oil
review/text: First things first: the flavour of this coconut oil is wonderful. Very clean on the tongue with just a slight back hint of coconut flavour. YES, this WILL slightly flavour some of your dishes to taste faintly of coconut if the dish is not heavily spiced. When I use coconut oil in place of butter for many Ethiopian and Indian dishes, I don't really notice any coconut flavour--but these are heavily spiced cuisines and so the sheer level of spice involved will cover up the delicate coconut flavour of this oil. In baking, however, there is a wonderful little hint of it. When I've made cookies and cakes using this in place of shortening or butter, many people have commented that something felt different about the dessert, but they couldn't put their finger on it right away until I would suggest coconut. I say all of this, though, in case someone who absolutely HATES coconut is considering using coconut oil as a part of their diet. While it has many great health benefits, if you cannot stand the flavour of coconut in any shape or form, you probably will not enjoy this product. I personally enjoy the added depth and dimension is gives my food, as well as the fact it's cholesterol free.<br /><br />If you're thinking this wouldn't taste like anything, then you're thinking of what is called "RBD coconut oil", that is to say, coconut oil which has been refined, bleached, and deodorised. This is not that product, and in my opinion, is far superior to any RBD coconut oil you could find.<br /><br />Now, the health benefits. Coconut gets props for being cholesterol free. Many people want to downplay its wonderfulness by pointing out that it is loaded in saturated fats. However! The saturated fats found in coconut oil are mostly medium-chain fatty acids, which bind together to form medium-chain triglycerides. Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are much easier for the body to break down and process than long-chain triglycerides, which are the saturated fats that are usually predominant in our diets. Because MCTs are so easily broken down in the body, they don't put a great strain on your pancreas or digestive system. Coconut oil is not a cure-all, however. It's not some miracle food (IMO), but I do think it should be seen as a healthy, viable alternative to butter and some cooking oils. Should it replace these other oils and butter outright? No, I don't think so. But I think it deserves a place of respect alongside your butter and olive oil in the kitchen.

review/text: I've been using this brand for a couple of years now.  It has a light coconut hint at times.  I use it for popping corn and I can't taste any coconut, other items like meats or veggies sometimes have a hint of coconut...it's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />I thought I would save washing a spoon each time I used this and put in a clear, plastic spoon (Kirkland brand) into the jar so I could reuse it.  DON'T KEEP PLASTIC IN YOUR COCONUT OIL!!! About 1 week later I went to make popcorn and I pulled out the handle of the spoon with no bottom of the spoon to be found!!!  The acid in the coconut oil will eat away at certain plastics! Had to throw the 1/2 full jar away!  Lesson learned!  Just reordered and went on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Coconut Oil for Hair & Skin
review/text: Nice.<br /><br />I bought this to add into my hair routine. And so far so good! I combine it with pure organic cold pressed olive oil- my hair loves it.<br /><br />The quality and texture are great.<br />I like the containers- they're plastic jars which makes storing them a breeze.<br /><br />I also use this on my skin sometimes, and it works GREAT.  It really saturates into the skin- makes it very smooth and extremely soft. I actually use the olive oil/coconut oil combo on my skin, so I guess its both products at work... but either way it goes it'll leave you with softer skin.<br /><br />It's a little messy for me because I have to transfer it into a smaller bottle, but I just started using the top of a straw/sippy cup as a funnel and that helps. The smell is strong, if you like coconut you'll love this. I'm not that huge on it, so at times its a bit much for me.<br /><br />This is the best deal on on this product you'll find- 2 for $16 (and free shipping if you spend $25)... but I still wish it was more like 2 for $10.

review/summary: Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free
review/text: I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find "packed on" and "best before" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the "best before" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as "organic." Do a little research; "cold-pressed," "organic," AND "hexane-free" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar.

review/summary: One for Massage, One for Cooking
review/text: We order this fabulous oil on autodelivery, receiving two jars every few months.  We use one jar for full body massage and the other for cooking. Simply use a knife to carve out chunks of oil - if you want to heat the oil up for massage, simply float a small bowl of oil in a larger bowl of hot water, and in no time you'll have silky warm oil, ready to lavish on your lover's body. Equally delicious in the bedroom and the kitchen, this oil will come to be a favored tool of pleasure in your home. Enjoy!

review/summary: AMAZING!!
review/text: I love this stuff.  There is a light coconut scent.  I use it mostly for my scalp and hair because I have dry scalp and alopecia areata.  I dig out a very small amount...about a teaspoon.  I let it melt on my fingers, rub my fingers together, and then I just massage it into my scalp.  I do this at night, and wash it off in the morning.  It makes my hair feel soft.  I like to add a drop of lemon oil, lavender, primrose and/or rosemary and massage it in with the coconut oil.  It's a great all-natural stress reliever.  I have yet to use the coconut oil in cooking, but my mom says that when she was younger she used to use it for cooking (as well as her hair).  I sometimes use it for moisturizing my skin (everything but face), but it's important to rub it in very well since this is pretty greasy.  I will continue to buy this product!

review/text: I use this oil for my son as a moisturising oil after bath. This product is far better than other coconut oils I have used.It is a lot fresher than most sold in the market.<br />This also works as an excellent hair oil. I am very happy with this product.

review/summary: Miracle Oil
review/text: Hands down that this is by far one of the top oils to use for cooking, baking, skin, hair, and overall health. LOVE this stuff and by far this is the best tasting coconut oil out there. Stay away from refined coconut oils as it is not as healthy. I take 3.5 tablespoons almost daily for over all health and for feeling good! I will continue to use this.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: This product is a money saver!!!  Not only can you cook and bake with it, it is an excellent face and body cream, lip balm, and is a really good spread for toast and bible bread. So you can see that with the purchase of this one product, you get at least four different products in one tub!!!

review/summary: MMMM, coconutty!
review/text: Came across this randomly while searching for new health foods to try and was immediately drawn in by all the amazing claims and great reviews that coconut oil gets. I'm always open to trying healthier alternatives to things, especially when they taste better too, and this stuff fits the bill! So far I've made fried eggs, pan fried french fries, stir fry, and cupcakes and they've all tasted amazing!! I can smell and taste a very subtle coconut smell/taste in the foods that I use it in and I thought the french fries would taste totally weird but they actually turned out super yummy. The fiance, however, says he doesn't notice any difference (I'm a super taster though, so I'm not sure which one of us is more accurate). I've replaced my vegetable oil completely with this stuff and now I can't get rid of my half bottle of useless vegetable oil..I think you can use this to replace butter in recipes as well but I haven't tried it like that yet. I plan on buying a book on the subject of coconut oil and its health benefits so I can find out more about it. I'm going to buy the next size bigger of this next time since my first tub is already almost gone, I'm definitely hooked for life!

review/summary: Awesome stuff!
review/text: Bought it primarily to use for diaper rash ointment. It does a fantastic job of keeping nasty rashes away, and it cleared up the one my son already had (and it's cloth diaper friendly! triple win!). I've also used it as a leave-in conditioner and my hair was soft and shiny. It also makes for a good cooking oil (not from the diaper rash tub!), and the scent and taste isn't too heavy. Wish I knew about it before!

review/text: I bought this as a moisturizer for my Chinese Crested; she loves it! She usually hates it when I try to put lotion on her, but she loves this! Granted, she likes to lick it off, but if I really need to I can just put a sweater on her so she can't lick it ALL off.<br /><br />This stuff also tastes good, smells amazing, and I've used it as a moisturizer as well. I designated one tub for "cosmetic purposes" and the other tub for the kitchen! =0)

review/summary: The only one for me
review/text: This is the only type of coconut oil I've ever bought, and I see no reason to change brands because this one is so great.  I make chocolate bark with it, stir fries, and baked goods.  I love my coconut oil!  Subtle coconut undertones when eaten with sweet things, yet no coconut taste after stir frying (at least for me.)

review/text: This coconut oil is wonderful for baking, popcorn and even using as a lotion. I had not used it for making popcorn until recently and I must say it makes a healthy nutritious snack even more delicious than ever!  It is great for baked goods as well. Obviously, I find it extremely versatile.  The 2 pack is such a nice option. It saves me time and money.  Can you tell ,...?  I Love It !!!

review/summary: Healthy AND Delicious
review/text: LOVE this stuff! Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face.<br />I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too.

review/summary: Multi-Use!
review/text: Coconut oil is not widely known for its health benefits (at least in the US) so I am trying to spread the word.  It is great for cooking as a vegetable oil substitute and butter substitute in many recipes.  Of course it contains no salt, so if a recipe is counting on the salt from butter as flavor (easy example is toast), then you may want to add some salt separately.  But of course, most of us can use less salt in our diet.<br /><br />Also, this is great for dry skin.  It might take a few (5-10) minutes to absorb completely, but it works wonders.
