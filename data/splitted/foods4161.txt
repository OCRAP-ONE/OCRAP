review/summary: Good Mac & Cheese
review/text: This is good macaroni and cheese.  Some other reviews called it gritty but I didn't see this happening (maybe they're not putting in quite enough milk for the powdered cheese to cover the mac).  Probably number 3 out of my top 3.  The #1 is Trader Joes Mac & Cheese, #2 is Annies, and #3 is Back to Nature.

review/summary: Best one so far
review/text: We've tried other brands of organic mac and cheese, but they were grainy and clumpy.  This one was really good.  It didn't clump like the other organic brands of mac and cheese.<br /><br />It tasted like regular Kraft mac and cheese, but without all of the added artificial colors and additives.  Later we found out that it is made by Kraft, that's why it tasted good.  (Like what we ate previous to our transition to organic.)

review/summary: Exactly like fresh scrambled eggs
review/text: I just received the 5 bags of OvaEasy today and immediately opened one and made some scrambled eggs.<br /><br />The crystals are a darkish golden color, mix very easily with water. The directions are very simple, mix 3 parts cold water to 1 part OvaEasy and whisk. I was a little worried about the color and that the finished eggs would still be dark gold, but they weren't. This mix cooks up to the closest thing you will ever get to fresh eggs. I made them exactly as I would have fresh eggs. Fried in butter with salt and pepper. You cannot tell the difference.

review/text: The captain and crew on our AK fishing vessel love these eggs. They taste great and are super easy to use. Sometimes on a fishing vessel you don't have time or proper conditions for lengthy meal prep, so the OvaEasy whole eggs are perfect for our boat. Love eggs and the nutrition they provide, so the OvaEasy eggs are a great find for us. Glad we bought them. We are planning on ordering more for our next fishing season. Thanks so much for your wonderful product! (P.S. They are also a very tasty item to bring tent camping.)

review/summary: Pretty Close
review/text: While not exactly like eggs it is pretty darn close. The main difference between these and eggs I would say is the consistency. If all you are doing is scrambled eggs or baking then it probably won't be noticeable. However, if you were to make an Omelet for example you would likely notice the texture difference. OvaEasy is very consistent both in color and texture, real eggs however are not.<br /><br />Flavor wise they are pretty darn close to real eggs. If you couldn't tell the difference between the texture then you probably wouldn't know the difference. A nice easy measuring spoon of sorts would be nice for cooking purposes so you could easily calculate how many eggs you were making, but I also wonder how accurate their measurement per egg is as well as it does seem a little on the small side.<br /><br />I have not attempted any baking with this yet, but imagine it will work just like regular eggs given how they cook up directly in a pan. The real trick here is going to be in measuring out the correct amount of egg. On a side note, I have found that the shaker bottles work well for mixing up the egg.

review/summary: Best Breakfast Rice - EVER!!
review/text: Over the past 5-6-years, I have truly enjoyed this seasonal rice for a simple, tasty breakfast. We just moved to Omaha, where I was unable to find the rice locally. After some searching on the web, I located a small supply at Amazon. Thank you, Amazon.<br /><br />The rice will also work in soups, stir frys, and casseroles, but I try to save it for my breakfasts. Just prepare the rice as instructed and keep it in the fridge. Take about 1.5 cups of cold, cooked rice. Put it in a breakfast dish and add some raisins and brown sugar. Stir it up and microwave it for 1 minute. Add some milk to cool it off and enjoy a nice breakfast.

review/text: Good everyday olive oil. Good color, good yup-this-is-EVOO flavor.  Nothing remarkable, but an excellent value for the price.  Also, apparently they seem to have improved the packaging since previous reviews were left - it was packed in it's own fitted cardboard box with inserts to keep it still and suspended, inside a larger box with air-padding.  Had a very minor dent.  Pouring was a bit awkward with the spout, but it only dribbled a trivial amount.  Would recommend.

review/summary: These banana snack pieces are attractive, tasty and are 100% natural and certified USDA organic
review/text: This is a great tasting snack that's good for you!<br /><br />The banana snack pieces are attractive.  They look like naturally glazed rounded slices of the fruit.  I find Crunchy N Yummy banana to be the most visually appealing of their 'tropical fruit' snacks.<br /><br />Banana is a rich source of magnesium which is used for muscle tone of the heart and assists in controlling blood pressure.  In general, magnesium is used to relax the muscles.  I call Crunchy N Yummy banana my 'relax snack' :))<br /><br />At only 110 calories per 1 ounce serving, you get the great taste and nutrition of a full serving of banana in packs that I can have on the go! I also use Crunchy N Yummy bananas in my cold cereals, yogurt and ice cream toppings.  The kids love them too! ... that's a plus!<br /><br />These banana snacks are 100% natural and certified USDA organic - just sun ripened and freeze dried banana with no additives.<br /><br />Crunchy N Yummy snacks contain no sulfur dioxide (E220), a food preservative commonly used in dried fruit.  (Some individuals may be sensitive to sulfur dioxide especially in large amounts).<br /><br />Check around ... the price varies on Amazon.<br /><br />Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)

review/text: These didn't taste at all like the freeze dried bananas I get at the grocery store. I am a little confused, because both brands list bananas as the only ingredient (no sweeteners, salt or flavorings added).  These taste terrible.  They do not have any banana flavor and there is no natural sweetness to them at all.  I cannot eat them straight from the bag, so I have tried mixing them in with granola and into muffins, but they just taste like a bland, tasteless chip.  I tried giving them to my puppies as treats, and they wouldn't touch them.  What a disappointment. I don't know how you can mess up a product with only one ingredient.

review/text: Lapsang Souchong is my all-time favorite tea, yet it is very difficult to find.  I was unfamiliar with Tao of Tea, but desperate enough to give this a try.  I am extremely pleased with the flavor and the value per price.<br /><br />Normal brewing proportions creates a pleasant, smokey, dark gold result, excellent as either hot or iced tea.  A little more tea to water is my preference, as I like my teas strong.  I've over-brewed twice, yet the results were not bitter, just richer.  Also, you can brew the leaves at least twice and still get the same satisfying result.<br /><br />I'm very, very happy with this tea, and will most definitely order it again.

review/text: The Tao of Tea Lapsang Souchong page recommends 1 teaspoon of tea for each 8 ounces of water.  I've been experimenting, and now prefer it a bit stronger, so have been using 6 teaspoons for each 24 ounces of water.  This works especially well when I add a bit of milk afterward.  In some ways, I feel the addition of milk brings out the smokiness even more.<br /><br />At first I was concerned these were packaged in paper bags, compared to the plastic packaged<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5TKM">Stash Premium Lapsang Souchong Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.  But since the Tao of Tea packs were cheaper per ounce than the Stash Lapsang, I decided to go with the Tao of Tea.  It turns out the Tao of Tea paper bags are lined with plastic anyway.<br /><br />It's my first time buying tea from amazon, and I'm tempted to try some other varieties now.  Also, it's my first time making lapsang souchong at home, rather than having it at a hotel tea.  As someone without a lot of tea knowledge, this was a satisfying product.<br /><br />UPDATE: This tea makes a very pleasant room-temperature or iced drink.  Also, it is very difficult to oversteep, and has never once tasted bitter.  I thought 24 ounces was quite a bit of tea to buy at once, but I'm already almost finished with the first bag!

review/summary: You either really like it or you don't, but either way you WILL smell like a camping trip
review/text: I do really like this tea.  Not my favorite, but it's a really nice addition to the collection as it is so unique tasting.  I don't think I'd drink it exclusively, but very glad I bought it.  Three bags of 8 oz is a LOT of LS tea.  Going to give two packs away with tea infusers as presents.  Will make very nice housewarming / xmas stocking stuffer gifts.

review/summary: A very pleasant smoke taste
review/text: It's one of the mellower Lapsang Souchong teas but it allows for a long steep without turning bitter or acrid. It also holds the smoke smell well. I'd rate it as being a bit bolder than the Adagio LS tea and I am definitely glad I took the risk and got the 3-pack.

review/summary: Weak smoke
review/text: I'm a big fan of smoked tea and this brand lacks a strong smoke fragrance and presence. I've brewed it really strong and still found it lacking. On the plus size, it doesn't get bitter when it's brewed so strong. The price is good, also. If you enjoy a very lightly smoked tea than you may enjoy this one. If you like a really strong smoky taste, look elsewhere.

review/summary: The ultimate Australian treat!
review/text: I bought some Vegemite to send to friends in Chicago as part of an 'Aussie' gift package to send with my daughter who was staying with them when she came to the US.  For Australians, Vegemite on toast is regarded as one of life's staples.  We eat it for breakfast, after-school snacks and late night suppers.  It's a cure-all when we're sick and great when we're hungover and can't face anything else. One note of caution - Vegemite is not designed to be spread thickly on toast - it has to be spread in a very thin, even layer, otherwise, it's unpalatable. Enjoy!

review/text: The Kraft Vegemite definitely tastes better -- it has "depth" of flavor, compared to the other faux Vegemites like Marmite. I spread it on whole wheat matzoh (believe it or not) and love it on roasted unsalted almonds for a really good snack.  I must be the only non-Aussie within 200 miles who has gone through several 220 gram jars of the stuff already! Love it!

review/summary: Way too expensive, too similar to Marmite
review/text: I purchased this product through Amazomn after having used Marmite (from the UK) for some time.  Marmite can be purchased in food stores locally (at least in the MD/DC area) at a fraction of the very high price of this product.  Both are yeast extracts, and their tastes are similar.  The taste of Vegemite is OK, but in no way do you get value for money ordering Vegemite as opposed to buying Marmite locally or through Amazon.<br /><br />And caveat emptor.  You might get the impression that you are getting two bottles when looking at the Vegemite Amazon page.  You're not.

review/text: As a child, every year my German godmother would give me an advent calendar filled with wonderful chocolates. Now that I have godchildren of my own, I have continued the tradition. Until recently, I have always been disappointed with cheesy, uninteresting artwork and sub-par chocolates from Cadbury's and the like. I was skeptical when buying this from Amazon because it was so much cheaper than other calendars on this site, but boy was i wrong - this could be the same calendar I got as a kid! This is a real German calendar with real German chocolate and an old-timey hand-drawn Christmas scene (it's just printed of course, I don't mean someone drew each box!). I ordered 6 and got 2 different designs. Great stuff altogether - I'll definitely be ordering more next year.

review/summary: more salt than mushroom flavor
review/text: Minor's has changed their soup bases for the worse increasing the salt and starch filler at the expense of flavor.  I bought some soup bases a few years ago and especially liked the clam and mushroom bases.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer sent me a promo postcard years later offering free shipping and cheaper prices if I ordered directly so I ordered a bunch and the only tolerable one was the low sodium chicken.  This mushroom base is useless and you will taste acrid saltiness before you ever taste mushroom.  I use it in lieu of salt (with the bonus of an msg quality) in oatmeal, teff flour, ground beef and ginger pieces for a not quite Cream of Mushroom Soup stand-in.

review/summary: An explosion of salt
review/text: Thought it would be more inclined toward the mushroom concentrate than any other thing. So when I started the water and put an average amount, the kind I would use on other base products, I was startled by the amount of salt I found myself tasting. Yes, if you use a much smaller quantity it does have its redeeming quality but, really, if I wanted so much salt on a base I would have ordered Salt Base. It works in small amounts and do not get me wrong: I am a dedicated fan of Minor's products but while plenty of others are above average on taste this one exceeds the allotted salt limits. I remember having to amplify my creation by a ratio of ten more cups of water to lessen the salty taste. Somewhere in there, lurking in the broth it made, a mushroom flavor was present. Yes, I agree with the first review (2006) on way too much salt. Therefore, 2 Stars at the most.

I've only ever seen this flavor at airports and never in the regular supermarket so I'm glad that it is available here. I like that these are the "grab bag" design because it makes sealing them up after snacking much easier.  My only complaint about these crackers is simply that they exist and that I like to eat them. The ordering process was easy, and they arrived in a timely fashion.

Yes some out there might say that the price may be a little high, but if you factor in the cost of gas to go to the store and back then it hurts a little less in the price. It arrived quickly in the mail and was well packaged. The crackers came wonderfully intact in the bags. I liked the way they were packaged;they come in a resealable bags that makes it a good snack that you can save for future ''urges'' for a salty treat. I wish that the company has a low salt variation of this flavor. I also love the Chedder Cheese flavor too. I would recommend this to a friend to give it a taste.

It gives a nice uplift of energy and I've not noticed any crash. It doesn't wire you like other drinks, meaning that you can use it for a boost and help focusing on the task at hand, but it won't keep you from sleeping if you're tired and need to rest. Regarding the taste, it's got a citrus taste to it, so if you dislike citrus, it may not be for you. Still, I highly recommend the drink.

review/text: I love these almonds, and for quite a while when I purchased them, they came straight from Amazon.  The price was reasonable and with a Prime membership, they arrived quickly.<br /><br />For some reason, the almonds no longer come straight from Amazon; rather, they come from a vendor I wasn't familiar with.  The price went up and I now had to pay shipping, but I went for it anyway.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />I was immediately suspicious when the product arrived.  When the almonds shipped directly from Amazon, they came in a sealed box from Emerald Nuts.<br /><br />This vendor threw individual boxes of almonds into another shipping box.<br /><br />Why does that matter?  The sealed case product was of very high quality.  These individual boxes were absolutely terrible and tasted old.<br /><br />This is an educated guess, but my gut feeling is that these were purchased at a discount by the vendor and then sent to customers at full price. At least I hope that's what happened, because these almonds were just awful. Chewy and stale.<br /><br />I miss buying these, but as long as they come from the current reseller at an inflated price, inflated shipping, and inferior product, I will not purchase them again.  If we're ever lucky enough that Amazon starts carrying them straight from Emerald, I'm in.<br /><br />Check the source of the product;  I personally recommend you not buy if they're not shipping directly from Amazon.

When they ask me why mine tastes so much better than others, I tell them it's because they NEED to start with Cains Mayonnaise. The flavor is perfect and is not overpowered by the taste of lemon or vinegar, like many other mayonnaise products I had previously tried. The texture is creamy and smooth. And I find the opened jar keeps exceptionally well, despite having no preservatives. Even in the winter, when I make less potato salads and cole slaw than I would in the summer, I have NEVER had a jar go bad. It's simply a great product.

review/summary: Amazing Olives
review/text: If you love green olives like I do then these are a must. The garlic & jalapeno bring out the best in the green olive. I was concerned when I first tried them because of the jalapeno in them but it was only a hint and actually made the whole experience better. I was given one jar by my wife at first and after trying them I bought a case as these are amazing.

review/summary: Taste the Love!
review/text: This granola is awesome! I love that it is made with Gluten Free oats, that was hard to find in other brands.<br /><br />The clusters are nice and large. This granola is crunchy and tastes really great. The best thing about this granola for me is that it is not too sweet, it has just the right amount of sweetness to make it delicious but not overpowering and still fairly low on calories.<br /><br />The texture is excellent, the raisins are chewy, the oat clusters are crunchy, and the almonds are crispy. I eat it with milk usually, but it's also delicious as a dry snack straight out of the bag.<br /><br />I ordered a 3-pack of each flavor that Love Grown makes, and they are all delicious.<br /><br />The only con I can think of is that it's so good you may end up eating it too fast and have to order more. Luckily it comes in a 3-pack :)

review/summary: Best granola EVER!
review/text: You have to try this wonderful granola.  It is the best granola I have ever had! Trust me, we have a lot of "granola" to choose from in the Boulder, CO area and this one is perfect! The cinnamon is just the perfect amount and it is not too sweet. And it won't break your jaw when you chew it.  My kids loved it in yogurt and right out of the bag as a snack. We loved how  healthy it is for all of us.  We couldn't wait for more!

review/summary: Great gluten free alternative
review/text: This pasta is the only one I have found so far that is a good replacement for the wheat variety. I live abroad where I can only purchase the white rice inferior kind but it doesn't hold its shape very well after cooking and always seems to be either uncooked or starchy and mushy. Tinkyada provides the right texture and the variety in shapes we need. I have been using it for five years now and am very satisfied.

review/text: I'm definitely a hearts of palm snob. I look for (in this order) consistency of texture, taste, and price. The best palm i n the world is SunPix, from Costa Rica, but Costco has stopped carrying it, so life is a quest for the next best. This product, also from Costa Rica, is entirely satisfactory, and I will buy it again . . . at least until Amazon (or someone) makes SunPix available to me.

review/summary: FTO Green coffee beans
review/text: Although there is no regulatory body monitoring the claims of fair-trade and organic for coffee beans - these are quality beans that the vendor is providing. With the beans coming from the worlds' origin of coffee, they have a rustic, almost ancient characteristic about them that sets them FAR apart from newer world beans. Even in the roasting, you will detect a vast difference between these and most other beans (especially Central American or Hawaiian varieties). If you blend varieties, these will bring up the qualities of almost any other bean to give that roundness which defines the pleasure of coffee. [Hope that wasn't overly pretentious, although I truly am a fan of really good coffees.]

review/summary: I love Pistachio!
review/text: So this does not beat my love for macadamia nut matcha and I probably even like the almond matcha more HOWEVER this is a very good matcha!<br />Its funny because pistachios are my favorite nut although macadamia does run a close second the things are just too darn expensive! Not that pistachios are cheap or anything but for the price - heck I will just buy matcha instead!<br />This pistachio matcha really does smell like pistachio.<br />There is a slight very slight chemical like smell but it does not come out in the blend when you make your matcha regardless of if you use just water or make a latte with it.<br />I really do like this matcha and the base comes through very nicely and with pistachio for some reason seems to make even more sense because pistachios have green on them. Yeah I know its a mental thing and I am after all somewhat mental however this may also be quite nice in a white base as well!<br />Try as many of these Red Leaf Matcha as you can you won't be unhappy with your matcha flavors!

review/summary: Delicious Pistachio
review/text: This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely. When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha, I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy, like nutmeg and cloves. It wasn't unpleasant, just totally unexpected. The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste, where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty, rich pistachio flavor. The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor, and I can't help but wonder if the spiciness isn't at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground. Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink!

review/summary: Deliciously nutty, naturally sweet and smokey!
review/text: The matcha straight out of the bag smells very strongly like sweet pistachio, reminding me of pistachio halva. Very intoxicating smell!<br /><br />The matcha frothed up well during whisking and is a lovely green colour, matching a perfect colour to pistachios too!<br /><br />As a traditional cup of hot matcha, great strong earthy green tea base holding hands next to the  pistachio flavor. The matcha isn't astringent. Slight bitterness, but it fits the bill almost with a smokeyness of the pistachio. There is a sweet nutty taste at the end of my sip. The best part of this cup is that sweet nutty taste, very well done! I'm thinking I could drink this one as a traditional cup all the time.<br /><br />As a iced latte (prepared with matcha, ice, soy milk and a bit of sweetner), this pretty much tastes like pistachio ice cream! Creamy, sweet, and nutty with strong green tea base. This one came out sweeter than normal because of the sweetness of the flavoring. With that said, if adding sweetener, be gentle.<br /><br />So my tea peeps, totally give this one a shot. I guess it sounds kinda weird since I think others might associate pistachios as just a salty snack, but this one is sweet, nutty and tasty!

review/summary: My Favorite Healthy Cereal!
review/text: I am VERY picky about cereals. I don't like anything too sweet, too spicy, or too bland in the morning. Plus it must be reasonably healthy. This cereal has only 170 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein (not counting the milk), NINE grams of fiber, and the 12g of sugaars isn't too bad for a cereal. I imagine the high fiber helps keep the blood from spiking too much. Love it!

review/text: My partner and I enjoy many varieties of teas.  We go to tea bars and are familiar with all types of teas.  We live in Berkeley and there are many tea houses.  Tea to this area is like coffee is to a New Orleanian.  I am a New Orleanian also and know excellence when I taste it.  The aroma is fruity and sweet.  The tea itself is pleasant on the tip of the tongue and leaves a fruity flavor when it reaches the back of the tongue.  We will continue to buy this fine tea.  I recommend anyone to buy it.  But, I also recommend that since it is a delicate tea, that each cup be brewed separately and not in a large pot.  Same for coffee.  To get the best results, brew one cup at a time and ENJOY!

review/summary: Taste good? No. Edible? Barely.
review/text: I took a chance on these because of all the positive reviews you find on this product on multiple websites. I ordered a 5lb bag of the Haribo Happy Cola's and I have to say I'm very disappointed. They are extremely chewy.. it's literally like chewing on a dry piece of caulk. No matter how long you chew, it doesn't break down.. it may as well be a piece of rubber. If you suck on them they last for quite some time, obviously, but that cola taste is not there. You get a slight hint of cola when you first pop one in, but after that time passes (5-10 seconds in) you're left with a wet noodle made out of caulk that tastes like corn syrup.<br /><br />There must be a huge group of people who like generic candy out there or a heck of a lot of Haribo workers boosting these reviews. I certainly do not see anything positive what-so-ever to write about this product and I absolutely do not recommend anyone buy these.
