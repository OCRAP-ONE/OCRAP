review/text: Fondarific tastes great! I have been one who labeled fondant as "Disgusting", and I would NEVER eat it again.  Sfter trying this product, I have had a change of heart.  Second plus is that it is also wonderful to work with, it was not too hard or too soft, easy to roll out and shape.  The third plus is that they have great vibrant colors!!  Love this product!

review/summary: Great for beginners!
review/text: I am not a baker, I normally cook food and don't care for sweets too much. So when I tried doing my first cake using fondant for my 12 yr old, I ordered the first brand I saw and I'm really happy with my choice! It was hard to work with at first but only because I didn't know what I was doing. I later use a different brand of fondant that I bought at the store because I had ran out and I will NEVER use that brand again. Fondarific rolls out easier, I was able to pick it up easy and even create pretty little flowers too in addition to using gum paste. I'm no pro so until I can make my own, I'd certainly keep buying this brand. Only con is, I found that the darker the color the more greasy it is. In that case it worked best for me to make sure the temp in my kitchen was very cool when using the darker colors. The warmer and greasy it is, the quicker it is to fall apart when trying to pick it up or cut shapes, etc. Even still, I'd continue to buy this brand vs another :-)

review/summary: Best Packaged Fondant
review/text: The smell is of buttercream, sweet and without that horrible plastic smell (if you buy fondant in a box at any craft store, you know what I mean).  Easy to use for beginners and fantastic if you are are working with silicon molds and will stay pliable.  If it is rock hard when you open it, 7-10 seconds in the microwave and you can start working it.  This is really nice when decorating a cupcake with fondant because it stays soft and allows a person to either bite into it and take it off, which ever they prefer.  Mix with a little gum paste if you need it to stiffen in order to hold a shape.  Also, if you are using scraps and you have bits of buttercream on the fondant it will easily mix into the fondant without making a mess.  While I prefer to make my own fondant, I always keep this on hand for last minute needs.

review/text: I have never worked with fondant before, I reluctantly paid the extra money based on the positive reviews. All I can say is, wow! All fondant I have previously tasted is pretty gross. But Fondarific has changed my mind!<br /><br />I made a cake for my child's birthday yesterday using Fondarific fondant. I let him draw on the fondant with food grade markers. I also had the kids sign their own names with the food grade markers. It was such a huge hit! The cake turned out sooo cute, and every child ate the fondant!  Which surprised the heck out of me!

review/summary: who says fondant has no taste
review/text: Made a Lightning McQueen 3D cake for grandson's birthday.  Ordered the antique white, red, and black fondant.  This was my first attempt to use fondant since I had heard horror stories about using fondant and that it has no taste.  Fondarific said theirs has a great taste, doesn't get hard and is easy to use.  They were correct on all counts.  I loved working with it and will use it again.  My family liked the taste, too; however, it is very sweet and you will only actually eat a small amount so be sure to use a buttercream frosting on the cake before applying the fondant.  Best to buy the already colored fondant since it takes an awful lot of color paste to get the frosting color you might want.  I did have leftovers so I will see how long thye actually last.  Would like to also be able to get 1 pound packages.

review/summary: Deceptive Packaging..NOT Whole Wheat
review/text: Ingredients are listed in the descending order, the highest % of a product is listed first. Therefore, if a manufacturer is claiming Whole Grain and Whole Wheat all over their packaging, they have no business making white flour the primary ingredient. Since they don't tell you the ratio, they can add as little as 1% whole wheat and still be able to put it on the outside that way.<br /><br />This is an extremely prevalent practice & needs to be regulated. Food companies are deliberately deceiving the public into thinking that they're getting something more nutritous than they are.<br /><br />Unless a package says 100% whole grain or 100% whole wheat (Wheat Thins & Triscuits have them), then they're likely not.<br /><br />I can't have white flour and it takes me forever to shop because all these companies have jumped on the whole grain bandwagon & are attempting to fool consumers and they succeed most of the time.<br /><br />Shame on Nabisco. And Old London. And every other company pulling this malarkey.

review/summary: Outstanding chocolate !!
review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised by the flavor of these truffles.  They are among THE best chocolates I've had (and I don't like grocery store chocolate much at all...).  The milk chocolate has a wonderful light center with crispies in it; the hazelnut flavor in the one in gold foil is very mild- but good; the dark chocolate with the dark chocolate nibs was the biggest surprise. I usually don't like chocolate that is any darker than chocolate chips- but this had a really good deep chocolate flavor, with the nibs being a pleasant addition.  I will order these again- for gifts now that I've road-tested them :)<br /><br />Update: reordered these, and one of the containers was badly damaged/broken.  Not enough protective packing materials- the cardboard holder at the bottom was placed on top of the package, so damage happened during packing process- not during shipment.

review/summary: So you want to make Turkish coffee at home?
review/text: I had been interested in acquiring an ibrik ever since my first cup of Turkish coffee at Dilettante in Seattle. For some reason I never got around to making the purchase. Well, this was the year I treated myself, and I'm pretty happy with my purchase. This set includes everything that you need to start developing your skill with the ibrik. (And it does take a few tries to get it right.)<br /><br />The ibrik that comes with the set is a nice size for making coffee for one or two, and has a nice brass finish. The coffee samples are fun to play with and a nice introduction to the different ways in which this style of coffee is prepared (and here I mean the different spices or flavors which might be ground with the coffee beans). Finally, the cups are a nice way to serve it and match the size of the ibrik very well.<br /><br />Tip: I found that I needed to scrub the inside of the ibrik to get it clean before its first use, which would have been very difficult if I hadn't had an old baby bottle brush laying around.

review/text: I bought this set as a present for my husband. Natasha sent the set in a great box filled with straw so nothing was damaged. She also included a wonderful explanation on the history of coffee and how to make Turkish coffee. Her writing was interesting and humorous. A nice surprise. The ibrik may not be as fancy as it could be, but for novices like us, it is a perfect starting point. The variety of three coffees was great because we didn't really know what we would like. I am not much of a coffee drinker, but this sweet, rich coffee is an absolute treat. I would recommend this gift heartily.

review/summary: Great Way to Get Started in a New Coffee Drinking Tradition
review/text: I bought this set a few years ago since I was interested in arabic/turkish coffee, but had no clue about how to make it. The ibrik that came with this set is a very nice brass with a detachable handle (great for the constant moving students have to do...). It is my favorite of the six I have as it usually produces the best foam and is easier to pour and use. The set also includes two very nice solid demitasse cups and saucers. They're not anything fancy, but since they're very thick they give an air of robust simplicity. The coffees that the set came with are also very good, though perhaps not as good as say Mehmet Effendi (which is what I've subsequently taken to drinking). The included instructions are also pretty clear about what measurements you should use and how you should prepare the coffee.  All in all, for the price this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to break out of the coffee drinking box. Give it a try.<br /><br />NOTE: As I mentioned earlier, the ibrik is brass and, as a result, will tarnish over time. A quick polish will get it looking new again, but it's just something to be aware of.

review/summary: healthy without sacrificing taste or texture
review/text: This is the BEST whole wheat pasta we've had, and trust me- we've tried most of them. My daughter, who is four years old and a SUPER picky eater, prefer this over her regular semolina pasta. Not only does it taste really great, it stands up to just about anything you subject it to- overcooking, baking with sauces, being sauteed in oil, refrigeration, etc.<br /><br />The bionaturae pastas all cook up lovely. And unlike other whole wheat pastas, there's no weird aftertaste or bitterness no matter how long you cook it for. No matter how al dente (or how tender) you like your pasta cooked, this pasta holds up to whatever you subject it to. We tend to like pasta more on the tender side, and the pasta retains its shape, doesn't disintegrate or get glue-y even after 12 minutes in boiling water. Holds on to sauces very nicely. Also refrigerates well after being mixed with sauces.<br /><br />The Penne Gigate is a nice pasta for everything from baked macaroni dishes to just a quick bowl of pasta with some chopped tomatoes and herbs tossed with it. Also great for pasta salads.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Organic Pasta for even us picky Italians.
review/text: I love pasta, generally fresh and homemade like mom does it.  Is this as good as fresh pasta? No.  But it's close.  By just opening up a bag and then just tossing it with your favorite sauce, preferably homemade as well! you get a great tasting pasta that you can be confident is good for you.  If I don't have time to make fresh pasta for the kids, I always turn to this.  Great product!

review/summary: Great WW Pasta
review/text: Great whole wheat pasta for when you need a pasta fix and are trying to be healthy.  I rarely eat pasta anymore, but when I do this is the pasta I eat.  I've tried other whole wheat pastas and either they taste like regular semolina pasta and have no nutritional value or have some nutritional value but taste like cardboard.  This pasta both has nutritional value AND does NOT taste (or feel) like cardboard.  Yes it's al dente but it's got a great nutty taste.  Highly recommended!

review/text: Bionaturae is the best whole wheat pasta I've ever eaten. When Whole Foods stopped carrying it, I started buying it on the internet. It doesn't taste grainy or like cardboard like many whole wheat pastas. It's delicious with a slightly nutty taste.<br />I highly recommend Bionaturae.

But do keep in mind that this is cold pressed oil made from UNROASTED sunflower seeds, so it has some sunflower taste but it is pretty mild and its color is light. If you are looking for more rich taste for salad oil like in sunflower oil made from roasted seeds you would be disappointed.

review/summary: Finally!  the REAL TEXTURE & TASTE of Black Licorice
review/text: Wow, I'm eating this new amazing licorice as I write this review.  The package arrived not 5 minutes ago and I admit I was  skeptical.  I opened the bag and inhaled an olfactory bliss of licorice, molasses and aniseed oil  that brought back childhood memories of when I could eat black licorice pipes from the country candy store on summer days.<br /><br />It's been soooo long since I had real licorice I nearly forgot how tasty it was.  Other companies have licorice gummy bears or circular things that get glued to your teeth and require 14 toothpicks to remove.  This Orgran Licorice is close to matching those good old black licorice pipes....not as tender or as sweet but so so very close.  It's the first gluten-free licorice to come this close.  HIGHLY recommend to anyone in search of black licorice that is gluten-free.<br /><br />GMO FREE.  The only ingredient I wasn't thrilled about was the corn glucose (which I believe is corn syrup) but at least it's GMO free.<br /><br />Orgran also makes the tastiest Cinnamon Apple gluten free Pancake mix.  We bought it while on vacation in England recently and made it when we returned home to the US.  WOW.  It's just as good as Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pancake/Waffle Mix.<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: Me recently: "Waaah, why does everybody have to make black licorice using wheat flour??"<br />Me last night holding my 2nd empty Orgran bag in that many days: "Waaah! Why did someone have to go and make such a good GF black licorice??" :)<br /><br />I'm a licorice-lover whose favorite self-pampering before the Celiac was to binge on a box of chewy Panda brand black licorice. Orgran has almost (not quite) hit the mark. I will admit that I was disappointed when I first tasted it, because the flavor is more molasses than licorice to me. However, it grew on me at black-light speed, and I'm way past "liking" to serious "craving" now. It gives the old jaw a bit of a workout, with its relative toughness, and of course I wish it were less expensive since it is (for me) habit-forming, but it still gets 5 stars because I am so happy to have found a replacement for my long-pined-after Panda (even if I am eating so much I'm bound to "expanda")!

review/summary: Fantastic real licorice flavor without the gluten...
review/text: Licorice was one of the things I especially missed after going gluten free nearly 12 years ago but, OrgraN Gluten Free Molasses Licorice has changed all that. A few gluten free licorice products are available but I found them to be too hard or lacked that yummy black licorice experience...not so for this product. These soft and chewy little nuggets are packed with the black licorice flavor explosion that is reminiscent of a treat I had as a child in the 60's. A shopping mall high end candy store carried a black licorice product that was shaped like a 2' smooth rope, it was heaven for a little kid who loved soft black licorice, and the taste of OrgraN's licorice reminds me of that prized mall treat so long ago. I can sink my teeth into the OrgraN Gluten Free Molasses Licorice yet not feel like I'm eating taffy. To me, the mothwatering licorice taste is also similar to the gluten laden Panada licorice product that I used to enjoy. Furthermore, I like that I can avail of Amazons Subscribe & Save program as it saves me piles of money over my local gourmet store price. My non restricted husband says this is his favorite licorice and we frequently swipe at each other due to my refusal to share...

review/text: So glad I decided to try this licorice! I love it! Simply the BEST gluten free licorice there is! The BEST taste and texture I have found! I have stopped looking as this is it!!<br /><br />UPDATE: 5 Star Product but No Stars for Amazon. Went to order more of this licorice as I love it and so does the rest of my family. I had been also sending some to my Mother who loves it. So I put in my order, go to check out and I get a message that I have ordered too much of it in the past and that I am not allowed to order it any more!! I felt like a criminal being reprimanded for doing something wrong. OMG.... I have never had a store tell me I had ordered too much of anything before LOL. I think this is unbeleivable! Amazon told me they wanted to allow other customers to have a chance to buy some. If Amazon feels they are selling out of something too fast then they should increase their stock and not take it out on their loyal customers. Amazon needs to order more not tell their customers they can't order anymore. So I found another online retailer that sells it for the same price with free fast shipping.

review/summary: great licorice
review/text: Like most gluten free products, this item is pricey, but it tastes great. Fifty or so years ago, I used to buy a kind of licorice candy bar. I don't remember what the brand name was, but it was a bar of soft , chewy licorice maybe 2"x6"x1/2". This product reminds me of that in taste and texture. I love it. As another reviewer said, it is difficult to not eat a whole bag in one sitting. I have to remember how much it costs so I can ration it. If anyone knows of a cheaper gluten free licorice, I hope they mention it here in a review. For now, this one is great, except for the price (which is maybe 4 times what regular licorice would cost you). Did I mention it tastes great? I will definitely check out other products by this company.

Caught an Italian acquaintance (from Milan, no less) buying this stuff at the local Stop and Shop and he did not blush or break into hives when I saw him, simply said that it had an authentic taste and was dead easy to make.  He's spot on and when you want an easy, tasty, unusual side, it's the ticket.  Our boys who are meat and spud types, love it.  Not so keen on the preservatives, et al., but doubt that it will be the cause of anyone's death.

review/summary: This is a really outstanding risotto mix
review/text: This risotto mix produces an excellent risotto with a wonderful, rich saffron flavor. It is easy to make because you don't have to stand over the pot stirring constantly like homemade, and it still comes out with a creamy texture and properly al dente rice. I have purchased this risotto mix at least four different times. My family likes it so well we go through the box pretty fast. This mix is a definite winner.

review/summary: Great Product, but Amazon is charging too much at $39
review/text: I found this product and the Alessi mushroom risotto while living on the east coast.  They're both good, and make for quick easy meals.  When I moved back to Arizona, I couldn't find these risotto's anywhere locally.  Fortunately, I was able to find them on Amazon.  I've ordered them several times, getting the packages of 6, of both types, for around an average of $13.  But Amazon has lost it's mind charging $39 for the Milanese risotto.  You can still get the mushroom risotto for a reasonable price. Why did they triple the price??????  It's got to be a mistake.  I'll be special ordering from my local grocery store until the price goes back to normal.<br /><br />Don't pay $39 for a six pack.  $39 should get you 3 boxes, which would be 18 packages, not 6.  It should cost the same as Alessi's other risotto's like it always has.  You can go to the Alessi/Vigo webpage, they have a store.  You can order it there for the regular price, which is exactly the same price as the other flavors.<br /><br />Someone at Amazon messed up.

review/summary: Real deal
review/text: I make risotto from scratch and have perfected my technique over the years.  Its a point of pride.  And I don't mind the time, attention and ingredients it takes...normally.  But when this product is basically what I'm trying to achieve, sometimes I just want the easy way!  I add some chopped sauteed onions and shaved (real, from a wedge not a can) parmesan, but its fantastic without that.  And when I'm making suppli al telefono (rice balls, amazing) this is REALLY what I want.  You need cooled leftover risotto for that dish, so when there are 5 steps to THAT recipe its so nice to cut out the 5 initial steps that homemade risotto requires!<br /><br />This is not a microwave dish by the way, it is the packet of rice and seasonings.  Also when I can't get to Trader Joes for saffron this is a necessity, its an arm and a leg at the grocery store.  And the grocery stopped carrying this product so I'm glad Amazon came through!  Same price as manufacturer's website ($18.75).

review/summary: Best way to make risotto IMO.. very rich flavor!
review/text: I love mushroom risotto.  I've had it a few times at restaurants, made pre-packaged risottos from a variety of sources, and made it from scratch many many dozens of times.<br /><br />The porcini mushrooms give it the extra kick in flavor that makes it unique from a lot of the other mushroom risotto's I've had.<br /><br />A porcini mushroom risotto from a restaurant might cost something like $15-30 per person..<br />If you make it from scratch, you'll end up buying ingredients for at least a couple dozen servings.. and it'll still end up costing quite a bit.<br />This package serves 2 people for $1.50 per person, in under 20 minutes<br /><br />Heres a tip..<br />While the risotto is cooking, throw half a onion(chopped), and a couple mushrooms (i used baby bellas, thinly sliced) with a bit of olive oil or butter in a separate pan, cook for a few minutes and stir it in with the risotto as it finishes.<br />It only adds about $1 to the price, but takes the dish to another level.<br />You can also top it off with some black pepper, some chopped chives or parsley, and maybe some parmesan cheese and you'll have nothing short of a restaurant-quality meal with minimal effort, time, and money.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great flavor and texture from a packaged product
review/text: I usually rail against processed foods, but every once in a while, I need a little break in the kitchen. That's where this mix comes in. It's got intense saffrony flavor, and good, al dente texture. You can even make it taste a bit more authentic by ladling in hot water or broth in small amounts (true risotto technique), instead of putting the 2  1/2 cups in at once and closing the lid. It will yield a creamier consistency.

review/text: I used to buy this product in one of the two supermarkets nearby, but they stopped stocking it... What to do?  Buy online of course!  This Risotto is so easy to prepare (If you can boil water and stir for 1 minute, you can't mess this up) and so delicious it is worth every penny.  And, maybe best of all, even with shipping costs, the price is about the same as I paid in the supermarket.  Each package makes about 6 servings - try it, you'll like it!

review/summary: Wonderful treat gone bad
review/text: My two dogs USED TO LOVE these treats. Just the right size - not giant (and therefore affordable) but they still took a while for them to chew through. These WERE their favorite treats. And they were healthy and good for their teeth and gums.<br />But having received a recent re-order, I am now editing my own review and downgrading from five stars to one. THEY HAVE CHANGED THESE TREATS. They are NOT WRAPPED IN CHICKEN anymore. They have some kind of PAINT on them instead of chicken. It doesn't even smell like chicken. This is so disappointing. If you are re-ordering these thinking you'll get the old wonderful Chewritos - you won't. Change is significant enough that I recommend NOT ORDERING. It's misleading labeling. It's NOT a chicken wrap. It is a rawhide wrap that has been dipped in some kind of chemical/yeast/smoke flavor coating.

review/text: Product says "duck wraps rawhide treats", sounds great, right? well this is the sorriest dog treat I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot of them.  First, there is no duck, the item is coated with some brown crusty dyed-on stuff, looks like it is painted on.  Then the so-called rawhide is more like a 3 by 4 inch piece of cardboard, folded into thirds.  I know cardboard when I see it!  My dog likes to lick the brown stuff off, but then nothing.  And he even likes cardboard!! don't waste your money.

When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being "basted" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product

review/summary: Will No Longer Buy These!
review/text: Retracted my ringing endorsement of the product from 6 months ago.  Like other reviewers, I just now experienced Beefeaters (the manufacturers) switch from an excellent product to one that is subpar at best. Even more insulting is the dramatic increase in price $5.99 to $8.99-$10.99 per pack) for this terrible product. My pug will no longer touch these "duck wraps", the product name is false advertising at best. Previously these rawhides were wrapped with dried duck.  Now they are spray painted orange and smell funny.  I have nothing against the online sellers of this product.  However these sellers should contact Beefeaters and voice concern about losing so many loyal buyers.  And the buyers?  Well all of us should contact Beefeaters customer service and voice your disappointment regarding the duck wrap product change. Fingers crossed we can get back to the excellent duck wraps of the past for our beloved dogs!

This is my 2nd attempt to get the old product without success. Evidently, these have replaced the quality product we used to receive. When I opened them I discovered these flimsy strips of rawhide that are now painted with this mystery substance. The rawhide is like very thin cardboard. There is absolutely NO chicken on these. I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product. My dogs would not touch these!! I will not be purchasing anything made by this company again. They raised the prices on these too, while replacing quality with crap. So disappointing!

review/summary: A Perfectly Decent Tea
review/text: A bit of background:  I had a mind-blowing, amazing, world-changing earl grey green by "The Teaman" on Etsy.  SO. GOOD.  The Bigelow Earl Grey Green was good, but The Teaman's stuff was a portal to another world.*<br /><br />I more or less vibrated because I couldn't stop drinking all the caffeinated deliciousness, so the hunt to find a decaf version began.<br /><br />This tea isn't bad, but I think you get the idea that I'm stacking it against a rather compelling competitor.  I didn't mind the mint, as another reviewer did, and felt it blended well with the other flavors present.  The trouble for me was that this tastes like run-of-the-mill black tea, albeit with some additional flavors and complexity.  Big kudos for harmony:  all the flavors work well together.  They just really, really aren't my thing.<br /><br />The main flavor seems to be the Breakfast Tea flavor.  Yeah, they took Earl Grey Green and flavored it with black tea extract.  I have no idea why.  Black tea is a dime a dozen if you're into that kind of thing, and I'm not.  I think my mother would adore this tea:  she eschews most flavored tea and sticks to your basic blacks, though she does like Earl Grey.<br /><br />I will continue my hunt for an excellent decaf earl grey green.  I suspect this one is for black tea lovers who want the health benefits of a green tea.<br /><br />*lest you think I'm a shill, I didn't care for the majority of his teas, but the earl grey green!  Oh, heaven!!
