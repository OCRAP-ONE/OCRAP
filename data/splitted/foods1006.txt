review/summary: Ships very, very poorly
review/text: I just received my shipment of this product in the mail, and the packaging was horrible. Out of the 12 cans, four had huge dents in them, which, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, renders them unsafe for consumption: [...]. So basically, I bought this, and 1/3 of my order was unusable.

review/summary: Really, really chocolate!
review/text: I ordered these along with the chocolate covered dates.  They're pretty good, but no where close to as delicious as the dates.  Lang's does a superb job of packaging.  This is a significant consideration given our location in south Florida.  Lang ships the chocolates quickly in styrofoam with a cooler bag.  You are assured of receiving the product in good shape.  I highly recommend this seller.

review/summary: Very poor Quality
review/text: I was very excited to get some more Silver Needle Tea.  Their price was competitive but no cheap by any means.<br /><br />First complaint was the packaging the tea was packed in plastic bag and shipped with the second outer plastic bag.  Silver needle tea have beautiful fuzzy little delicate buds that should be handled with care, this was not the case.  However their handling was just a preview to the lack of quality, this tea company sells.<br />Review of the Tea.<br />Aroma: The aroma was weak when compared to other Silver needle tea I've had.<br />Appearance: there was lots of impurities. I will post a picture if I can figure out how. There were pieces of stems beyond the bud.  Piece of leaves of the were clearly not baby buds but of mature leaves.  Lots of brown colors there were pieces of leaves that were clearly not beautiful fuzzy little friends.  The buds that were there were more yellow than the delicate green.<br /><br />brew:  there was lots of debris/particulate in the first few brews.  the brew lacked delicate aroma and its color was off darker than I'm used to.  the flavor was more earthy than delicate reminding me of a strong cheap green tea. this tea also lacked exquisite sweat flavors/aromas that I so love about silver needle teas.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this tea and 1.5 or 2.  For comparison I would rate my last batch of Rishi Organic Silver needle tea an 8.5.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 8 ounces of this very disappointing.  If you are a connoisseur of this absolutely wonderful type of tea save yourself disappointment and look elsewhere.

review/summary: This is a big container.
review/text: October 25th, 2012<br /><br />This is my 4th wine kit in 60 days and my second which I sourced from Amazon. As wine & beer making have several steps over time I will update this review as I proceed through all the steps. This is a very heavy container.  Getting that bag empty will be the trickiest part of the wine kit I think. I was simply not strong enough to pick up the bag of 'must' from the bucket shipping container. What I did was to dump the contents of the shipping bucket into my plastic food grade fermentation vessel.<br /><br />Because I couldn't lift the bag out of the primary I had to cut a hole in the bag as near to the bottom as possible and lift the bag out of the primary as the bag drained.  This was still a tricky procedure as the 'must' initially just pooled on top of the 23 liter bag of must.  I think next time I try one of these 55 lbs kits I am going to borrow my step-son who works unloading UPS trucks everyday and is strong as a horse to hold the bag of must clear of the 'primary' while I open the bag the proper way and let it drain into the primary.<br /><br />I have at the time of this writing transferred the juice/must to my plastic primary fermentation vessel, added the bentonite, stirred, added the yeast, and stirred again.  I don't take the specific gravity as I like my wines very dry and so I just let them ferment out completely.  I do like that the kit includes corks (one less thing to purchase).

review/summary: Tastes Like White Cheddar Popcorn
review/text: I would be extremely pleased with this popcorn if I had just ordered gourmet white cheddar popcorn.  Because the bag promised black truffles and white cheddar, however, I was ultimately disappointed with the product.  I'm a huge truffle fan, and I routinely order another brand of truffled popcorn that has a very strong truffle flavor and aroma.  This popcorn came in at around half the price, though, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was very difficult to detect either the taste or the scent of the black truffles used in this popcorn.  It was overwhelmingly cheesy, and I would have been very happy with it if I weren't looking for something with a bit of truffle flavor, too.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to save your money.  Good white cheddar popcorn can be had for much less money, and if you want truffled popcorn, you're just going to have to go elsewhere.

review/summary: Not Heinz mayonnaise. Not the item pictured.
review/text: I got a box full of mayonnaise packets, and there likely are about 200 in there (I'm not going to count them) but they are NOT the Heinz mayonnaise packets pictured. They are a generic 'Mayonnaise' packet (blue lettering on white background) - the same kind I used to have in my office's break room in the early 1990s. I don't doubt they'll taste fine as far as mayonnaise goes, but it's not what is advertised.<br /><br />Another issue is that there are no expiration dates, either on the box or the packets themselves. This would be helpful information to have as we are storing these for use with canned chicken and tuna for emergency food storage. There is only a production date, so I will have to use my own judgement on how long mayo is likely good after being produced!

review/text: I absolutely love this mayonnaise and I'm hoping to be able to find it in bottle form for cost savings. I get several packs of these from Wholefoods whenever I shop there. The viscosity is lower than other mayo and the tang is much more pronounced. It tastes very similar to my favorite Japanese mayonnaise, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WKU8K">Japanese Kewpie Mayonnaise - 17.64 oz.</a>.<br /><br />It is simply delicious and I use it as a salad dressing. It's also great as a dip for vegetables and fried finger foods.

I find myself looking forward to eating vegetables because I have this salad dressing.  I don't particularly like vegetables, so though this dressing is rather expensive, it is worth it to me.  I will definitely purchase this again :)<br /><br />UPDATE: I found cheaper versions of this dressing at a Japan town market, but they looked runny and not as good.  This dressing is really dense and a little goes a long way.  I use a dash of salt, a dash of rice wine vinegar, and about a half teaspoon of this for each cucumber salad I make.  It really is quite dense :)

review/summary: GREAT dog food but HORRIBLE pacsevere from Amazon!
review/text: This dog food is fantastic! A premium quality at an affordable price.  I have 4 special needs Min Pins, and I've finally found one food that I can feed to them all.  The two boys are diabetic and blind, but they HATED the Sciend Diet W/D food.  And frankly, I did too.  It was so expensive for, in my opinion, a much inferior product.  So now I feed my two boys a combination of this plus the Diamond Senior dry food, and they are doing great!  One of my girls has both a heart condition and allergies, as well as only a couple of teeth, and after a few weeks of feeding her this, the allergies have all but disappeared.  My other little girl was a former puppy mill mommy that we rescued, and clearly she had been neglected and abused.  She was in such bad shape that we had to remove all her teeth, one eye, and shave her whole body. For the last year and a half, we could count how many strands of fur she grew back. She also had food allergies.  But after being on this for a few months, her allergies are cleared up, and she's getting a soft, silky coat of fur - at long last.  I'm not saying this food is responsible for that or that it's a cure-all miracle, but to me it has been!  I've got a happy and healty (well, as healthy as they can be) pack, and I hope that Amazon continues to carry this food.<br /><br />HOWEVER, be advised:  they do not provide enough protection in the way they package the product when they ship it, so I end up with a few dented cans.  In my last order that I just opened today, 13 of the 24 cans were moderately or severely damaged, and I'm contacting Amazon about this because that is just unacceptable.  They need to use the air bags instead of paper filling, and that would solve the problem.  But the food, in my opinion, can't be beat!

review/summary: What My Dog Said To Tell You
review/text: What follows is a statement of personal opinion, an opinion formed based on published reports from the FDA and other credible sources, and widely available on the Internet.  I am a (recent) former user of Evanger's pet food products, and have no affiliation with them, or with anyone else in the pet food industry.  I deeply regret having ever fed any animal Evanger's products, especially animals I love and care for.  Of course, you must do your own research and draw your own conclusions about these matters.  Evanger's has made an explanation of their side of things in some of these matters, although I personally found their "reasons"  entirely unconvincing.<br /><br />I would strongly urge you to research this company for yourself.  In particular, read about the FDA's revocation of their permit for failing to process the food properly, and read about the arrest of the owners on charges that they committed millions of dollars worth of utilities fraud by operating their plant for years with the gas and electric meters bypassed.  If, as alleged, they were operating with stolen utility service, what shortcuts would they be willing to take with your pet's health and safety to reduce manufacturing costs?  And in the vein of cutting costs, read about the successful lawsuit by employees for just under half of a million dollars in unpaid overtime wages.<br /><br />I can't post web links here, but my sources include a Chicago Tribune Article dated March 25, 2010, titled "Lincolnwood couple charged in utility theft scheme" and two articles on the FDA web site entitled "FDA Orders Pet Food Maker to Obtain Emergency Operating Permit" and "FDA Suspends Temporary Emergency Permit of Pet Food Maker".  I would also mention the lawsuit against Evanger's by their employees, which Evanger's appears to have lost.  (Source: web site "Truth About Pet Food") The Northern District of Illinois Distric Court, Case: 1:09-cv-00227, filed 9/15/2010, Final Approval Order Francisco Barragan and Liberto DeLaRosa, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons (Plantiffs) versus Evanger's Dog and Cat Food Co., Inc., Holly N. Sher and Joel Sher (Defendants).  Don't take my word on this, find out for yourself.<br /><br />The picture these events and reports formed in my mind was one of owners who were willing to do anything to make a buck, without regard to the legalities, consequences to their employees, or to their customers.

review/summary: Tried many, this is the best
review/text: I have two adult male beagles and have tried quite a few "boutique" level dog foods from Innova and Orijen over the past couple of years since they seem to be perennial favorites.  I monitored my dogs closely from their stools to their coat and immediate response after eating.  I found the Innova lines to make them lick their chops for about 10 minutes after each meal (likely due to the very high protein levels).  They also gained a little bit of weight so I had to cut down their intake (to what seemed like almost nothing).  This food, as I understand, is better suited for high-energy/activity dogs.<br /><br />The original Orijen was better, but the fish-based proteins and Omega 3s ranked high for me, so I ended up switching to the 6 Fish.  They've been enjoying it for a little over a year and the popularity has grown so much that at one point this year, it was almost impossible to find.  It has also received a few awards this past year.  The 29.7 lb bag lasts the two about 2 months.<br /><br />In short, Orijen 6 Fish has drastically improved the coat, stool, energy level, and overall health of my two beagles compared to any store bought brands.

review/text: Our almost 6 year old golden retriever has been plagued with itchy dry skin and loose stools all his life and we have tried many high quality dog foods to no avail. Finally we found Orijen fish formula and he is doing great!!!! Looks beautiful, not licking and biting his paws and skin any more and his stools are perfect. And he loves the food!!! Just wish it were easier to find in the larger size bags.

review/summary: Great Supplement For Raw Food Diet
review/text: I use a scoop of this to supplement my growing labradoodle puppies raw food diet. They absolutely love it. They eat it first then they go to their ground patties and meaty bones. I go with the 6-Fish because it is a 70/30 protein ratio and I don't feed my pups veggies except for the daily apple they have. Or pears in the summer from our pear tree. So it's great to have that 30% of fruits and veggies. There are other combinations that are 80/20 for people looking for more protein. I also choose the fish because it eliminates me having to supplement their food with fish oil everyday which for some reason they don't like that much.

review/summary: Pregnant wife loves them
review/text: So last week my lovely and pregnant wife was eating a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal and made some comment in passing about how she wished she could have a bowl of just the marshmallows. I quickly did a search and somebody suggested I check Amazon.com for "Dehydrated Marshmallows". A few minutes later I found and ordered these. Three days later a box arrived via USPS. I told my wife it was a gift for her. She absolutely LOVES them. I have scored "a months worth of brownie points". They are exactly what she was hoping for. I will be reordering as soon as she uses up this supply. Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Fun and delicious!
review/text: These are great!  When we were kids, my parents used to buy us a box of our favorite cereal (cereal was a 'treat' in our house) as one of our Christmas gifts.  In contrast to the rest of the year, we didn't have to share 'our' box with any of the other kids.  The oldest of my younger sisters favorite cereal was Lucky Charms.  After getting her box, she would sit down with two bowls and sort the cereal from the marshmallows.  She'd dump the cereal back in the box and eat it as you normally would cereal.  But the marshmallows, she'd keep those aside, eating them like candy.<br /><br />Now, all grown up, she still loves Lucky Charms, and her two boys, 6 and 7 love them as well.  For Christmas this year, she decided to give them a special surprise from 'Santa'.  She saved an empty Lucky Charms box and the bag.  I had a gold burnishing cream that we used to burnish the box a gold color, but allowed the picture to show through underneath.  Then we filled the bag with these marshmallows and sealed it with my Seal-A-Meal.  Her boys were so surprised when they got up on Christmas morning and found a 'magic' box of cereal from Santa - with only marshmallows (the most important part) inside!<br /><br />My sister was happy, too, because it only took two of the three bags of these marshmallows to fill the box, which meant she had an extra bag to enjoy herself.  Win-win!

I found the website to purchase just marshmallows and thought what a great idea and bought a bunch for my husband and son's christmas present.  They came in individual packages and there were soo many, I was able to split them up for all of us to enjoy.  Much to my surprise, they were exactly the same as the marshmallows in the cereal.  Thanks for such a cleaver and fun idea.

Now you don't have to!  Now, you can have a whole bowl of just marshmallows!  How awesome is that!<br /><br />Enough of that and onto the real review.<br />These are not Lucky Charms(tm) marshmallows.  Don't be confused.<br /><br />That said; they may look a little different, but they taste the same, they crunch the same and best of all they are the same sugary goodness you remember from childhood.  What's not to like?<br /><br />They come packaged in individual resealable bags, so no worries about them getting stale after you open them.<br /><br />They ship securely packaged so no worries about damage, either.<br /><br />Will I be buying them again?

The marshmallows all stick together and remoisturize, and while they have the same flavor, they lose that delightful, dehydrated marshmallow texture.

I put them in salads, eat them with oysters and crackers, tuna, sardines, etc.  Actually, I eat them with everything.  They have a unique salty tang to them.  Sometimes nothing but capers will do. These capers are especially appreciated because they're organic.

review/summary: Fine product and cheap
review/text: I think this comes to 89 cents a can which is sale price, so I'm happy to get it by the case.  I actually use it as an additive to my dogs' kibble.  They love tuna and when I add water, I can spread the flavor out over ten dog dishes when I have eight guest canines boarding in our home.  Oh and it's tasty for humans too!  It's not CHUNK tuna, but fine and dark.  Good for tuna salad.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: This product is actually made with soybean oil and vegetable broth.  Unfortunately, you get plenty of both and it makes the tuna quite mushy and tasteless.  The one that's made in vegetable oil is superior in both taste and texture.

review/summary: Amazon Does It Again
review/text: 10 years ago, whoever thought we would be buying Chicken Of The Sea Tuna on Amazon? The tuna wasn't even on sale and I think it came out to about 67 cents a can. I live in a rural area and that beats all the grocery stores in the area. There were a few slight dents and dings in a few cants, but otherwise the transaction, and shipping went very well.

review/text: I've just found the best thing! Buying groceries/household supplies on Amazon. I am disabled and it is hard to go and load stuff in a buggy at the store, unload into your car, then unload at the house again. You handle stuff 5 times before you even put it away!<br />  1-into the buggy,2-out of the buggy and onto the cashier's station, 3-  into  the buggy again, 4-then into the car and 5-last out of the car at home.<br />I just ordered online, FedEx delivered at my door! and all I had to do was put it away in the cupboard. 2 day shipping<br />  I did not even count the putting away as a step in either.<br />Thank you Amazon & Amazon Prime. This is one happy lady.

review/summary: Tastes okay. Loaded with soybean oil.
review/text: Almost every can I received was dented but I guess it's to be expected at this great price.<br /><br />The taste was okay but I have to say I'll never buy this again for the simple fact that the soybean oil spilled all over my can opener and counter top EVERY SINGLE TIME I opened a new can. Probably didn't help that they were all dented but still it was a mess no matter how careful I was.

review/summary: Take The Cinnamon Matcha Challenge!
review/text: This is the easy way to swallow a teaspoon of cinnamon in 30 seconds or less!  Just use this Cinnamon Matcha instead, and whisk it in hot water.  You'll be gulping it up at record speed!  It is so yummy!<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I know, that's not the idea behind the cinnamon challenge.  But, I assure you - this is much easier to swallow in 30 seconds, and better for you too.  (Yes, cinnamon is good for you, but it is very questionable, indeed, whether or not its healthy for you to swallow a teaspoon of dry, ground cinnamon.)<br /><br />This is really delicious.  The cinnamon is a spicy-sweet kind of cinnamon, reminiscent of Saigon cinnamon.  Very zesty - it enlivens the palate with its warm, exotic spice.  It makes a really nice combination with the sweet, buttery, vegetal notes of the Matcha.

review/summary: Great for blending!
review/text: I'm a sucker for cinnamon, so of course I had to try the Cinnamon Matcha. It smells so good. Sooooo good. Not like fake cinnamon hearts (which I adore too), but like real cinnamon. I want to slather this matcha on toast...but that would be weird. This is another matcha that inspires me to bake. Matcha snickerdoodles? Don't mind if I do! I need to start actually trying some of these recipe ideas. Like cinnamon matcha cinnamon toast! Or a cinnamon matcha apple pie! Nom nom nom.<br /><br />At first sip, it was delicious. At second sip, it was delicious. At third sip...well, you get the idea. There is something I don't care for about it, a bit of a tangy aftertaste, but that's not enough to keep me from drinking it! I'm excited to see how it will taste when blended with the vanilla. Ooooh, I should see if they have an apple matcha, that would be yummy mixed with this. Or pear! Oh dear, my list of desired matchas is growing longer and longer...<br /><br />But really, I just want to dump a whole mess of sugar into this and make some cinnamon raisin toast. And bake my little heart out! I think this is a matcha I will end up mixing more than making straight, but that's okay. I am seeing a wide world of possibilities coming from this little beauty. Cinnamon and I were good friends before, but I think is safe to say that this tea has pushed us over the edge into best friend territory. Plays well with others, makes me feel better, and encourages me to eat tasty, tasty sweets! I can see this becoming a staple in my cupboard, sitting right next to my beloved vanilla.
