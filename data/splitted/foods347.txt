review/summary: Vanilla Flavor Too Strong
review/text: I bought this coffee thinking that it would have a hint of vanilla but it ended up being a very powerful flavor in the coffee. The scent of vanilla was so strong that I had to keep the pods in an air tight container or else the whole kitchen would smell like vanilla. Besides that it was a very good quality of coffee and tasted great despite the heavy flavor of vanilla.

review/summary: Not very special
review/text: I love French Vanilla creamer in my coffee, but if you are expecting the same taste with this coffee, like I was, you will be disappointed.  It tastes like weak regular coffee with only a faint hint of vanilla flavoring.  I still had to add my creamer.  I really like the Senseo coffee (I use it with my Hamilton Beach single cup maker) but I don't think I will buy the flavored anymore.  I will stick with the regular and add my creamer.

review/summary: Nice Change Of Pace and Super Antioxidants
review/text: To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie

review/summary: Delicious flavor and aroma - this is a winner; but by what margin?
review/text: I've been enjoying black, green, and herbal teas for years. Normally I keep a good supply of both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BN4">Bigelow English Teatime Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRM6">Bigelow Decaffeinated Organic Green Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> in the pantry. Recently my wife was given a "Variety Pack" of Good Earth teas and this particular tea was included. I'm a morning coffee drinker but after my two cups of French pressed Colombian Joe to get the motor running I switch to tea; normally a cup or two of the aforementioned Bigelow English Breakfast tea and as the day progresses I like to decrease the caffeine intake so I switch over to the Bigelow Green which is a decaffeinated tea. However, as teas go, green tea is relatively low in caffeine so the idea of switching to a regular, caffeinated green tea, really didn't bother me. Anyway, as soon as I enjoyed my first cup of this particular tea I new I had to make room in the cupboard; at least until I finished my supply of the Bigelow green.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed and enjoyed about this tea was the wonderful bouquet like aroma. Just like with a fine red wine the initial aroma/bouquet is part of the experience of enjoying good wine and flavored hot beverages. After the delicious aroma test passed with flying colors it was not surprising that the taste test would be at least equally if not more satisfying. Indeed it tasted delicious.<br /><br />As with any good quality green tea the flavor was fresh, light, and a bit grassy or "green". I was previously not familiar with "Matcha" or "Sencha", two of the three flavor additions to this tea but thanks to the internet, information about darned near anything is always nearby. I'm not going to Wikipedia you about Matcha and Sencha but suffice it to say they are both other forms of Japanese green teas that do in fact pack a powerful additional punch of antioxidants genuinely verifying the company's advertisment of "...more antioxidants".<br /><br />Allegedly this tea has 70% more antioxidants than their "Standard Green Tea". This claim though, stretches the truth. Comparing the two products nutritional information: Good Earth's Super Green Tea has 162mg avg. antioxidants per serving whereas their Standard Green Tea has 108mg avg. per serving. According to my calculator that's 50% more (162/108 = 1.5) It annoys me when companies make misleading claims. In cases such as this though I find it simply hard to understand why they would stretch the truth. Based upon the product as it stands, they really don't need to inflate this percentage. The tea is delicious, it's got more antioxidants, why don't they print that or print that "our Standard Green Tea has 67% fewer antioxidants than our Super Green Tea! LOL. Okay so that whole thing I wrote about the percentage of antioxidants is really pretty irrelevant, I know, but I had fun doing it. Sorry if I lost you, it's just all in good fun.<br /><br />The real FLAVOR FLASH in this Super Green Tea is the ORANGE. I think it's great. It tastes like they've added just the right amount of fresh orange zest to set this green tea apart from unflavored ones and it's a combination that works. And why shouldn't it? Citrus flavoring with tea is certainly nothing new.<br /><br />Now the claim that follows is my own and it is supported by the following facts and data: At the time of this writing there were eleven customer reviews on Amazon's Web site for this product. Ten of those reviews were positive (i.e. 4 or 5 stars) and one was neutral (3 stars). By my calculator that means that 91.7& (rounded) of the population really like this tea and NOBODY dislikes it. Based upon the facts and data I think it's safe to buy some for yourself. But, you may well be an outlier and not like it at all so, to be really safe and smart, if you haven't already tried it, buy a box at your local grocery store. If you like it come back to Amazon and get in on their Subscribe and Save Program.<br /><br />I like buying Bigelow brand teas primarily because I like their flavor and believe they use fresh high quality teas, but also, and nearly equally as important, is because of how they are packaged; that is each tea bag is individually packaged in a fully sealed foil-like pouch. While this certainly adds to the cost it also helps assure freshness is maintained; an absolutely essential element in ensuring a good cup of tea. This variety of Good Earth tea is packaged in the same, high quality, freshness maintaining manner.<br /><br />Just a final general note on brewing green tea: Just as you would brew any other kind of tea, whether you have bagged tea or loose green tea, one thing to watch out for: Don't use fully boiling water. Green tea is more delicate than black, so it's best to keep the water a little cooler. Brewing when your water is just about to hit the boil is ideal.<br /><br />Bon appetit!

review/summary: Tasty green tea
review/text: I originally bought this at a grocery store as part of a project to find a green tea that my husband would drink.  He's got a health condition that demands he give up coffee, and the only tea "allowed" is Green Tea (due to the reported health benefits).<br /><br />We tried many brands and many varieties and this one has a good flavor...kinda citrus-y and not watery or bitter.  The pleasant aroma hits you when you open the package. That's another benefit, the tea bags come individually packaged so they stay fresh and also travel well, if need be.  The tea bags come with nice little sayings printed on them, too.<br /><br />I ordered these through Amazon because the product has become hard to find in local stores, and the bulk price is fair.  It is cheaper still if you subscribe.

review/text: I've always bought the Good Earth Lemongrass Green Tea, but I wanted to try something new so I bought this Super Green Tea. The Lemongrass tea is probably the best green tea I've ever had, so naturally I didn't have high expectations going into this tea. After opening the teabag of this Super Green Tea, I knew immediately that I was going to love this tea. You can smell all the aromas of the tea and none of them are overwhelming on the nose. Once brewed, I couldn't stop drinking this tea. Like the Lemongrass tea, each of this tea's flavors are brought out and none of them are overbearing. The orange oil is perfect; not too much nor too little is in the tea. After drinking two cups of this tea, I'm ready to say that this tea has replaced the Good Earth Lemongrass tea as my go to green tea.

I put one of these Super Green tea bags in with another tea bag flavor in a 3/12 quart Tea Pot, namely Good Earth's Original, Constant Comment Original or any Oolong Tea from China's Fujian province . Leave it on the warmer for about 30min before serving. I even water it down another 50 percent after taking the tea bags out. It is also very good with a shot of Citron\Mandarin\Peach Vodka if you ever go that route."

review/text: When we picked out our new Weber Grill at a local bbq store, I asked the salesman what his best steak rub was.  He answered quickly that it was "John Henry's Pecan Rub".  I bought a container of it and it set on the shelf for several months.  Having been a long time bbq smoker and griller, I have several favorite steak seasoning, but I am always looking for new tastes.  My Weber grill has a "seer" feature that allows for 700 degree heat.  The first time I tried the "John Henry's Pecan Rub", it was on a porterhouse steak.  I brushed a little olive oil on it and covered the steak liberaly with the rub.  The grill was at 675 degrees and I "seered" both sides for about 3 minutes.  Took it off and let it set for 5 minutes.  It had a mild chared look on the outside and was a perfect midium rare on the inside.  After my wife tried it she said "this is the best steak I have ever eaten".  Each time I use it I get the same remarks.  It is a great seasoning and I have ordered more.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Fantastic Loose Leaf Tea
review/text: I am very passionate about my cup of tea as I am a lifelong tea drinker and can make out the subtle differences in a tea.. Needless to say I like to go for the best.  I had heard a lot about the Dilmah brand during my global travels and started searching for it in the US. I am very glad to find it on Amazon and now at many stores in the Boston area. I went ahead and bought one and now there is no looking back. You will just fall in love.  It's a magnificent product and I would recommend everyone to give it a try....  The packaging is superb with lots of information on the company and its ethical trade practices.  I also went on their website to read about Dilmah and found that the Company runs various programs to help their own workers.  A very noble cause!!!  I mean I applaud Dilmah for doing this human service when it's most needed in today's world.  We need Company like Dilmah who puts humanity and their workers first.  Thank you Dilmah for the lovely product and keep up the good work.

review/summary: It's another medium strength tea
review/text: and not worth the premium price. I had seen this tea before and when Amazon offer the $10 off I decided to try the Yata Watte & the Breakfast teas.<br /><br />Twinings Ceylon has a distinctive - as they call it - "bright" flavor, but I can't detect any taste that comes close here. On the can Yata is described as "It tastes round, full almost muscular and juicy, with elements of ....spices and bay leaf"......? Our friend B.P. describes it as "very light" which comes closer to the truth as far as I can taste. This tea isn't that different than from PG tips, Yorkshire gold or any decent quality black tea.<br /><br />Second issue is the packaging, If you go to the Dilmah site you see the owner patting himself on the back about what a good guy he is for the way he runs his plantations. He should try producing a little less waste for us consumers to throw away, first a shrink wrap holding the 3 cans together, then each can is shrink wrapped, an outer lid, an inner lid, and then last a foil & plastic bag. Not only does it gripe the conscientious consumer in me to see so much waste, but it is adding 2-3 dollars for something that may get second use or second best goes to recycling.

review/text: I like A&W root beer. Years ago our household had a blind taste test of the major root beers and we concluded A&W is the best tasting brand, by far, with a great creamy texture. So, if these frozen pops tasted like the beverage, I'd have rated them highly. Unfortunately, they do not. Somewhere in the translation from frothy, fizzy cold soda to flat, frozen stick, the essence of A&W was lost leaving an oddly flavored unenjoyable confection.<br /><br />Also these pops are much smaller than I think they should be or at least how I remember similar sleeve enclosed treats being.<br /><br />Having said all this, my children ran through these like ravenous monkeys, so maybe children's taste buds can find something to like.

It is also made in China, land of the melamine-laced human and pet food. I won't be buying again because of those reasons.

review/summary: Good but two problems - update
review/text: I just opened the tiny pack and made a bowl of their miso soup.  The good things is that the tofu, green onion and seaweed arent small.  The taste is good with not a lot of salt content ---- 510 g.  However the little plastic box that houses the block of miso tends to crush up so you have to make sure when you take it out you get all the stuff that has fallen out. The other problem I had was that they say put block in bowl and add 160 ml of hot water.  Well I dont know how much that is so I just put in 8 ounces.  It is very mild and does have a good taste with nice bits of stuff. I gave it four stars because of the packaging (the block should have a cover) and it would be nice to know how much 160 ml is?<br /><br />UPDATE: It has been some time now and I still love this little package of miso soup.  I have learned to deal with the packaging.  I have this practically everyday.  My only other complaint is that the seaweed is huge, so I take some scissors and cut it up.<br /><br /> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ANYONE THAT CAN HELP ME -------------------?  In looking at the nutritional value, I noticing that vit A and C, calcium and Iron has no value at all. I know Miso soup is good for you and I do enjoy it.  Does anyone know if this packaged soup gives one any healthy benefits?  Thanks ----

Beyond tasting great, the ingredients look wholesome and definitely *not* processed.<br /><br />Each individual serving package contains the ingredients pressed into a rectangular block.  The block is held together on five sides by a plastic box.  I guess that is what allows the soup to be reconstituted with large pieces of tofu, sea weed, and other good things.

review/summary: Has room for changes if the taste isn't for you
review/text: All you have to add are eggs and water to make this quick mix, so it's very hard to get this wrong. Each box is enough to bake a cupcake/muffin tin or a 8x8x2 pan.<br /><br />Tastewise, this is definitely much more "traditional" than I am used to. Most cornbreads I've had are very sweet and slightly moist--even other spicy blue cornbreads I've had. This was not something I achieved the first time trying this at even the lowest bake time. My brother described it akin to a tortilla chip. Ouch.<br /><br />Additional sugar and butter and lowering the baking temperature has alleviated this quite a bit, but I will probably continue to make some changes to the mix.<br /><br />Lastly, this mix is indeed quite spicy, and I normally handle spicy foods very well. As a product itself it is not overwhelmingly spicy, but this definitely has a little bit more kick than I was expecting. I will be experimenting whether this can be changed as well and will update my review accordingly.<br /><br />My rating of 4 stars goes mostly for ease of using the mix. Rating would probably be lower if my taste preferences were of higher weight, but this is what happens when everything is already in the mix!

review/text: I was disappointed in the limited amount of mushroom pieces found in this large, 26 ounce can of mushroom soup.  I'll go back to the small cans that at least have enough mushrooms in them to impart the mushroom flavor and have a bit of mushroom in every spoonful.  Had I known that this was really just cream of chicken soup with the mislabeled name of mushroom attached, I would not have bought this product.  It's still way too high in salt too.  I don't recommend this size can of Campbell's mushroom soup even if it does feed a larger group of people at the dinner table.

These cans do not have the pop-off lids, you will need a can opener.  4 recipes are on every label- one on the front, 3 on the back of the label.  Each label is worth 1 point in the 'Labels for Education' program.  Using Amazon's Subscribe and Save for this is a no-brainer and a fantastic deal.

review/text: After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other "sweet" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand.

review/summary: Good French Roast
review/text: Tully's French Roast is a solid choice and one of my staples.  This is my favorite French Roast currently available in a K-cup.  Maybe someday Peets will come in a K-cup, sigh.  One trick if you find it isn't as rich as you normally get in your favorite bistro, is to make a smaller size portion.

review/text: I'm a big time coffee drinker and I tend to like my coffee strong and Tully's French Roast blend delivers! I'm not going to go into all the details about how it taste like "this or that" because everybody's taste are different. But if you like a strong, not bitter, cup of coffee that will get you going in the morning, then this is for you.

review/text: We normally get Deidrich's French Roast but it is no longer carried in "Subscribe and Save" so I thought a good alternative would be Tully's French Roast.

review/text: I need to say I absolutely love my Kuerig brewing system. French Roast is one my favorite types of roast. I don't want to sound biased, but anyone who loves a strong aromatic coffee would love this kind. I would recommend it to the coffee enthusiast, but that's just me. This won't be so good for those who don't like a very strong, extra bold coffee. If you are one of those who doesn't like a coffee this strong...this isn't for you unfortunately.

review/summary: Great Tasting and affordable
review/text: Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count. But the count was right on & for the savings I'm not complaining so will order again. This coffee being bold but with no aftertaste is one I never tire of it. Everyone who tries this loves it. I find if I brew a small cup makes excellent iced coffee or warm latte. My coffee maker does have size options so considering cost of lattes my homemade version using liquid stevia/almond milk is money saving plus healthy. I have used both plain/flavored stevia and my coffee flavor stays true. All in all addicted and loving every cup.<br /><br />I am adding to review ordered a few days ago and a super charged delivery this was in original package this time and I am a very satisfied customer. Fresh cup in hand while I write this!

review/text: My husband thought the Keurig coffee maker was just another gadget, only to be used when guests wanted to make their own choice for flavored coffees.  When I purchased a small box of this  extra bold coffee, he said it was the best coffee he has ever had...home or in a restaurant!  I purchased this larger box, and he said, "Why don't we put the Keurig in the kitchen, and put our 12 cup coffee maker away"!  He is now having less cups of coffee...enjoying it much more...and absolutely no waste!

If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
