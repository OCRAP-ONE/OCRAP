review/summary: Very strong unpleasant aftertaste
review/text: Some of the reviews warn about the strong smokey aroma. They could not describe how pungeant this is and it leaves a strong lasting after taste. I threw all the tea away since it is not eligible for return. FYI the other Twinings products are excellent.

review/text: I love this stuff not only because it's the best (non-homemade) I've found<br />, but because it brings back memories.  I was born and raised overseas<br />where there were no Pizza Joints.  Chef Boyardee in the box was it; and as<br />kids we loved it.<br />The sauce in the original box didn't have the cheese included but this seems<br />just as good as the original and better than any of the commercial sauces<br />I've tried.  Maybe my taste buds are failing but I love this stuff.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories.

review/summary: Forty kinds of "goodie" in a single can
review/text: I absolutely ADORE this sauce.  I like to buy these size cans without the kit for more than one reason.  First off, when I make the kit pizza, there NEVER seems to be ENOUGH sauce.  :)  When I was growing up, I loved "pizza night" even tho I was "stuck" with all the labor.  This practice of taking this pizza and adding my own toppings matured over the years.  I began to cook pizzas to order.  My son once commented that I made the "best pizza on the planet"... and this was when he was at an age that parents do NOTHING right.  :)  Trying to find these cans in a grocery store got to be impossible, everyone quit carrying it.<br /><br />I was gifted with a case of this stuff from Amazon.com and and almost at the end of it.  My new husband (who can be difficult to cook for) has fallen in love with my pizzas.  As soon as I scrape up the money, I shall re-order a case for the next round.  I have taken this sauce, and, over the years, made custom pizzas, pizza-burgers and even cooked up a lasagna recipe that I made a few times.  Due to the general unavailability of this at my local grocer, imagine my joy to find out that this can be ordered online by the case.  Now, if only I could just remember how I made the lasagna, I'll be completely back in business.  lol

review/summary: Hoorey for Chefboyardee
review/text: This is the best pizza sauce I have ever tasted. However, it's hard to find in my area.  I've been buying a few cans and packing them in my suitcase when I visit my parents.  I'm thrilled to be able to buy it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />The sauce is somewhat similar to the "Italian" version of Contadina tomato sauce, but it has more of an oregano flavor.  It includes chees, but doesn't have a strong cheese flavor; there's just enough to give it a smooth flavor.<br /><br />I use it as a sauce for frozen ravioli, in pizza soup, or just on plain pasta.  Also, use it as a dipping sauce.

review/text: When opening the bag, the smell was very strong of cherry cough syrup. Once brewed the smell it much lighter and not unpleasant. The flavor was ok, pleasant roobios flavor, however the cherry blossom part left something to be desired. Overall I am pretty ambivalent about this flavor and probably won't order it again. I have ordered other flavor teas from this company and enjoyed them very much. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNRJQ">Tea's Etc 1000 Cranes White Tea, 8-Ounce</a>, for example, is spectacular.

It is so well balanced that as as a piece melts in the mouth only a short lived fragrant smell of something like heavy rose water is senced, which is probably the halawa extract with no sugary or oily aftertaste. It is suprisingly Very Good.

review/summary: Tasty & addictive!
review/text: I bought 3 kinds of Al Wadi halva (this one, pistachio; plain; and with chocolate) and the pistachio was my favorite.  I wanted to find out whether the halawa extract in this product really increases breast milk production and to my delight, I pumped about double my normal amount while I was snacking on the halva a few times a day!  The pistachio flavor goes very well with ground sesame seeds (tahini).  This product is a somewhat dry paste, a little bit oily, and quite sweet.  There is a crunch to it from the nuts and also from the sugar.  The halawa extract has a bit of a bitter flavor that I find pleasant with the sweetness of the sugar and the earthiness of the nuts.  I found myself craving halva rather than Little Debbies or other sweets.  I would buy this product again and definitely recommend it to other breastfeeding mothers!  One note though: this product will give you GAS!  Lots of it!  Buy a bottle of Bean-O at the pharmacy to help combat the gas - the increase in quality & quantity of milk is well worth the extra trouble.

review/summary: King of the green
review/text: I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/text: We busted out our pantry one cold day and settled on what we thought was going to be a good choice for lunch; Healthy Choice Traditional Lentil soup. We regretted every bite.<br /><br />Really? Why?<br /><br />Well, the claims that this microwaveable bowl (14 oz) has 1/2 cup of vegetables with only 150 calories and 440mg. of sodium per serving was misleading.  In reality, this soup was for 2 servings which doubles those claims.  Who is sharing this?  The green package makes us feel like it is a single serving size that would be healthy for us to eat.<br /><br />Well, what about the taste?<br /><br />First you eat with your eyes.  This soup was ugly.  It was brown with wimpy, soggy, ex-green items swimming in it.  What were those green things? We literally had to look at the ingredient list to figure it out.  They claimed it was spinach.  Seriously?  We choose to differ.<br /><br />The flavors were off.  Salt and burnt carrot maybe.  It was gross.  It smelled gross.<br /><br />Continue reading on Examiner.com Healthy Choice Traditional Lentil soup: choose something else - Long Island grocery | Examiner.com [...]

review/text: Traditional lentil is a perfect choice for anyone wanting a healthy quick meal.  It has everything I need, like protein and vegetables, and nothing I don't, like excessive amounts of sodium (found in most soups), fat, and sugar.  For those complaining about the taste, I disagree and hope nothing changes about this soup.  This product knows what it is, it's lentil soup, and thankfully the manufacturers didn't mess too much with the natural flavoring of lentils, which taste great to me.  For a vegetarian, this is a great source of protein coming in at 14 grams of protein per a bowl (7g per serving).

I love this soup and will continue to get it as long it is being carried by Amazon. My brother and sister both get the soup also.

review/summary: Fruity Tea
review/text: I have been drinking tea for about 50 years or so, and Stash makes a great-tasting full-bodied tea.  This tea has a smooth fruity taste (peach).  It is not overbearing, but a nice subtle peachiness.<br /><br />Individually sealed in a paper/foil pouch for added freshness, this tea is listed as having 100 % natural ingredients.  They are, in the order listed, wuyi oolong tea<br />orange peel, lemongrass, and white peach flavor.<br /><br />It has been said that oolong tea was named after the part of Wuyi mountain, in China, where it was originally produced. It is among the most popular types of teas served in typical Chinese restaurants. (I have also found Jasmine tea and varieties of green tea in typical Chinese restaurants&iexcl;Xand plum wine.  Yum.)<br /><br />It is also suggested that oolong tea is useful for weight loss.  In my (non-medical) opinion (I am not a doctor), like anything else, it can HELP but won&iexcl;�t carry the load.  Oolong appears to be a diuretic, helping you to loose excess water.  If you lose too much water, you might dehydrate or lose valuable potassium.  So, I suggest that you limit yourself to 24 oz a day.  As with anything else, seek guidance from your health care practitioner.<br /><br />I suggest adding agave cactus juice, unbleached natural brown sugar, or honey, if you want a sweetener.  I like fruity teas often in the evening, and instead of dessert.<br /><br />Darn it!  Now I&iexcl;�m craving Chinese food and am snowed in--in a blizzard&iexcl;Xwith over 40 inches of snow on the ground.  I wonder if they will deliver? �

review/summary: Best chocolate tea I've had
review/text: Generally, I don't like flavored tea. And the experiences I've had with chocolate flavored tea left me convinced it really couldn't be done in any palatable way. I was wrong. I don't know what led me to try Stash's Chocolate Mint Oolong but this tea is outstanding! It does NOT taste like Palmer's chocolate coins dissolved and diluted in too much water, which is what most chocolate tea tastes like to me -- not even a Hershey's kiss, but Palmer's -- yuck! This tea has a very light yet distinct chocolaty flavor followed by sweet mint. It's refreshing in the evening after dinner when I want something sweet but don't want to load up on sugar right before bedtime. And, truth be told, it's a delight any time of day.

review/text: This Stash flavor is so deliciously tropical I love it hot or cold.  Made with 100% natural ingredients of :wuyi oolong tea,  orange peel, and flavors of coconut, pineapple, and mango.  It's caffeine free and I like this espeically as a cold drink in the mornings vs coffee in the summer time;  very refreshing and tropical.  Takes 3-5 minutes to steep and if making iced tea Stash recommends using double strength...2 bags per cup.  As with many of the unique Stash brand varieties ; licorice and pure peppermint,  this is difficult sometimes to get at the local stores so I buy either direct from the company or here on Amazon. Delicious. 5 stars to a great brand of Stash.

review/text: Love this tea.  Unlike a lot of (supposedly) flavored teas, this one actually has a strong flavor; more coconut "tropical" than mango but really tasty, with a strong smell too.  I think it tastes best with a touch of sweetener (honey, agave, etc.) to further enhance the flavor.  After finding it once, I haven't been able to find this flavor at any of my local grocery stores, so I ordered the box of 6.  Everyone I have shared this tea with has loved it too!.

When it arrived, I cut it up into 3-4 manageable pieces and kept one in my refrigerator's cheese/meat tray and put the others in small plastic bags in my extra storage refrigerator.  When I need some, I just grate it (either fine or regular on my grater).  It is dry enough that it keeps very well - always with a freshly grated taste on wherever I need it.  This product is reasonably priced, and I would definitely buy it again.  Already grated Parmesan from the grocery store cannot compare to this freshly grated parmesan.

review/summary: Fatal packaging issue
review/text: From the other reviews, sounds like the cheese is really really good. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to find out. When I accepted the package from the FedEx driver, I immediately ran to the kitchen with excitement. That quickly turned to dismay when I opened the box, unsealed the thermal pouch, and discovered a *very* warm brick of cheese.<br /><br />The principles of foil insulation are to ward off conduction, convection and radiation. Used properly, they work quite well. But Amazon killed the entire thermal benefits of the pouch by wrapping both the cheese and the cold packs in heavy bubble wrap before placing into the thermal pouch. Additionally, due to the lack of moisture in the bubble trap they created, I don't think the ice packs were properly frozen to begin with.<br /><br />Hugely disappointing. Amazon, please teach your shipping personnel the proper use of insulated foil pouches. If this practice isn't corrected, I don't think this cheese can ever be successfully (i.e. safely) shipped.

review/text: I have loved this cheese for many years. I now live in a location where it is not readily available. I was a bit reluctant about ordering online, worried about he quality, worried about shipping times. I just received the cheese, my worries were without foundation. I paid $3.99 extra to get one day delivery, well worth it, considering the value of the cheese. The cheese was well-packed and in good condition. The taste is sublime - rich, nutty, creamy and yummy. This is a young Reggiano Parmesan, it is a pale creamy color and milder than the well-aged version. I happen to prefer this milder version as I eat it as a snack. However, if you wish to have a strong, dark gold, well-aged version, this is not your cheese.<br /><br />I am well-satisfied with this purchase, the cheese is great and the price is reasonable.

review/text: I ordered the Boysenberry Shortbread cookies from here.  And I've tried to raspberry from my local grocery store, but they stopped carrying them.  Both were awesome.  They are small, so they make for a great light snack.  The shortbread is perfect to me; it isn't overly sweet or overly buttery.  The only thing I wish Knott's would change, would be the amount of the fruit center.  I know the cookie is small, but I think if the fruit center were larger, it would balance out the cookie nicer.  Plus, without each cookie being individually wrapped, the shortbread crumbles & sticks right to the fruit center, so it covers up the taste even more.  To me that would make it perfect, but as is I'd still highly recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: igourmet.com needs to update with amazon
review/text: I purchased a smaller version of this gift basket just in time for a family member's birthday and was notified two days after the purchase that the order was canceled.  Apparently, and I checked this later on igourmet.com, the gift basket was out of stock.  So, I decided to purchase this basket.  But, just in case, I checked igourmet.com first.  Well, after checking I saw that this basket is sold out too, but it's not noted here.  My relative's gift will be late now.  So, beware of ordering gifts from igourmet.com here.  The item may be sold out at igourmet and it might not be noted here at Amazon.  So, check igourmet's inventory first at their website, or just order from someone else.

I use this as a treat since it's fairly healthy and mildly sweet. If you don't want to order online, you can usually find it at Whole Foods and Kroger.

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/summary: Possibly the best...
review/text: I have always preferred tea for my morning beverage and I like it quite strong, with milk, no sugar--it's a family thing; my grandmother's family was Canadian.  Welsh Brew is the first tea I have found (since Red Rose was bought out by Lipton) that tastes even better than Red Rose used to.  The tea bags are a decent size and the tea, even when strong, is nicely mellow  without any bitterness. When it is brewed strong there is a nice tannic base but again, without the bitterness of a (all) black tea.  It has to be the combination of black and orange pekoe teas in Welsh Brew that makes it so.  RR has gone-in the American market, at least--to an all black tea formulation.  I first bought Welsh Brew at a gourmet shop while on vacation and I liked it so much that I had to locate a more convenient source: the four-pack from Amazon is perfect...enough tea to keep me going for quite a while; I probably drink at least two, if not more, cups of tea a day.

review/summary: Easily the best preserves I have ever had.  In a class by itself.
review/text: I found Tiptree's Little Scarlet Strawberry Preserves at a fancy hotel at least 20 years ago.  I have kept at least 5 jars of it in my home at all times since then. Some years I had to have it shipped from stores in England because I couldn't find it anywhere in the USA.  I don't care how much it cost, I would buy it.  It is that extraordinary, and nothing comes close.  You name the brand, I have tried it.  Do a google to find the best prices.  I have found it as low at $10.25 recently.<br /><br />Before you die, at least try one jar of this preserve.  Don't get their regular strawberry....it has to be the "Little Scarlet" type.  You can read more about it at their website Tiptree.com, and I have no affiliation with them.  If you have to justify the higher price, pretend to get it as a birthday or Christmas present for a loved one, then make sure you taste it too.  ;-)

review/summary: "Little" Strawberries With A BIG Flavor!

The mini whole strawberries are really darling, and DELICIOUS!  I would say this is the BEST strawberry jam/jelly/preserve/conserve I've tried to date!<br /><br />  (FYI: Their 72, 1 ounce jars contain their regular strawberry, NOT "Scarlet" preserves.)<br /><br />In conclusion, I can't wait to order another product from this company!<br />______<br /><br />EDIT:  I have since tried the "Damson" (plum) conserve/preserve, and "Tiptree Strawberry" conserve/preserve-- both with great success!

I purchased a case in March and by June, it was all gone (and I live alone!).  There is nothing even close to the deep, sweet strawberry taste of Little Scarlet, with whole, little strawberries bursting with flavor.  Very difficult to find.  Limited supplies. And expensive, well worth the price.  What a wonderful treat on toast, buttermilk biscuits, and in scones, etc., etc.  Made with 60 Gm./100 Gm. of fruit, the highest fruit content available.  Nothing else is even close.  And pure cane sugar.

I also do a lot of Bavarian cooking, including homemade Bavarian potato pancakes. When I have time, my favorite is still the way Oma (my mom) made them. The Panni (Pfanni in Germany) Potato Pancakes are an acceptable alternative that take a fraction of the time.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in the recipe for the real deal, just leave a comment here, and I'm happy to post it. As I said though, these here are a lot faster and an acceptable alternative. You'll also dirty up fewer dishes in making these than with the original recipe.<br /><br />Either way, "Moizeit!"

review/summary: My favorite potato pancake mix, great texture and flavor
review/text: I'm glad I can find this on Amazon, since only a few stores in my area carry it and only occasionally.  I have a feeling it is not a popular item and it goes out of stock quite often.  If you like Bavarian potato pancakes this is the best brand I've found.  You can make pancakes crispy or chewy, with gradiations in between with a little bit of practice.  Follow the instructions carefully, including allowing the batter to sit for a while to get the texture correct or you will get poorly shaped "lumpy" pancakes.  The flavor has delicious undertones of herbs and just enough salt to make them a great savory snack.  I use olive oil to fry them and it does not significantly change the taste (in case you wanted a healthier oil).  My personal preference is a slightly crispy, more chewy pancake.  They are great with fried eggs and bacon for breakfast, or just plain with sour cream and applesauce.  Curiously, I found they go well with Indian curries.  I serve them as a side with chicken curry if I can't get nan or parathas. It works very well for texture and flavor in combination with the curry.  To save time you can make them in batches and refrigerate them in sealed sandwich bags.  You can re-heat them on a frying pan to make them crisp again.  Not exactly as good as fresh, but they taste just fine.<br /><br />The price is fairly reasonable considering I usually have to go to stores that carry luxury import brands to find this, so the mark-up and taxes is about the same as shipping.  I just wish they shipped less than 12 boxes which is a bit much.  FYI, there are two sealed pouches per box, so you can use half a box at a time if you like.  I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.

review/summary: potato pancakes
review/text: If you like potato pancakes, you'll love these. They can be made as thick or thin and crispy as you like. I first found them at a local supermarket about 10 years ago. I was happy as could be because I love these things. Soon, though the store dropped them, but two other local stores started carrying them. Happy again! But soon the other stores dropped them and none were to be found. Even though I asked the store managers, they would'nt carry them. I must have been the only person in southwest Va. buying them. Begins the long drought. I thought I'd never taste them again until my son suggested Amazon because "they sell everything". I don't know about everything but they sell Panni potato pancake mix and I'm now a happy guy. I've tried other mixes and tried from scratch but Panni is the best.<br /><br />'

It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.
