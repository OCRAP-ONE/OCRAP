review/summary: blade broken, then fixed, now works quite well
review/text: Received this as a Christmas present. Just like other reviewers noted, the item was never functional. The food was steamed, but the blade doesn't turn because the motor isn't engaging the turning knob. Not worth my time to fix a machine that never worked. Will get the Baby Cook instead.<br /><br />OK, update on this product. I found a blog by searching for the product name in Google and something like "blade doesn't turn" and found a fix-it explanation that worked great. Another review on Amazon also has the way to fix this. So after taking 15 minutes to find a good fix, and 10 minutes of taking apart, fixing the band that connects the motor to the blade axis, and putting it back together, the Brezza works great. We have made all kinds of foods in the Brezza including carrots, apples, broccoli, pears, peas. All these items streamed well and pureed well too. However, we still do yams and squash in our immersion blender because the brezza seems to have a little trouble with those items.<br /><br />I'd give it four stars but I took off one for the fact that I had to fix it upon arrival. I hope the company has indeed altered it's design to stop the bands from slipping off during shipping.

review/summary: blender does not work
review/text: After reading reviews for multiple baby food makers, we settled on this one because it was the most trusted and highest reviewed. After receiving it, carefully cleaning, and reading the instructions word for word, we were disappointed to find out that it does not work. Going back on Amazon and the Baby Brezza site for help, We realized that there are many recent reviews with the same problem. These reviews were posted AFTER we had ordered the item.<br /><br />I'm personally upset because even if the customer service for this product may be as wonderful as they say, receiving a defective product in the mail and getting help on it is both a waste of mine and the company's time. I feel like the last 2 hours of my day has been wasted preparing the food, waiting for it to steam, trouble shooting the blender, reading up about fixes online, and lastly calling customer service to only get a voicemail. I hope that this goes better for other parents. Good luck.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed baby brezza on Nov 7th and called them Nov 4th. They finally returned my call today (Nov 11), but I already returned the item because they took way to long to get back to me.

However,  the third time I received was also a defective item, this time the blender works well but it is unable for me to take it out!  What happen????? I tried much of my effort to take the blender out but in vain!  I have to return it again!  I  was just wondering why this item is in so cheap quality!  It is really waste my time!

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  Even after all of my friends told me I didn't need a separate appliance to make babyfood (just use your food processor!), I went ahead and bought it.  I had read the reviews and I knew that it wouldn't cook a lot at a time, so I wasn't expecting to make mass quantities of babyfood, just to make it easier to give my daughter whatever veggies we might be eating that night.  Well I'm pretty dissapointed -- almost everything I've tried in isn't as cooked as it needs to be.  I find the machine to puree the food when it's half raw, resulting in a lumpy mess.  I've tried mixing the food with breastmilk and pureeing it further, and then it just tastes like raws veggies pureed with breast milk.  Gross.  I have also tried cooking the food for longer than the recommended times, but I guess the steam isn't strong enough, because it's never cooked enough.  I've tried sweet potatoes, green beans and carrots, all with disastrous results.  Lesson learned - next time I'm just going to cook the food in the oven or in a steamer and then throw it in the food processor.

review/summary: Food NOT smooth at all!!!
review/text: I was super excited to get this since I was putting my veggies in a steamer basket in a pan on the stove top. Steaming the veggies and then putting them into the blender to make them into baby food. I though GREAT!! I can save time, dishes and frustration all with this machine. Not so much. This machine does not make smooth baby food no matter how much you let the steamer go. So, I was steaming in this and transfering to a blender to puree. I will be sending this back. Keep your money and take the extra minute to transfer the food from your steamer to your blender!

review/summary: Replacement Blender
review/text: I ordered the Baby Brezza and was so excited to use it to make fresh and wholesome food for my 6 month old. I set it up, and it steamed just fine. Then when it came time to blend it just beeped and shut off. I checked to see about replacing it and the company that supplied it through Amazon, Jolity, provided the number to call Baby Brezza for return/replacement and said they should return my call promptly. I did read in the BB manual that you have to send $10 shipping for them to return ship your item to replace any appliance. I was really disappointed to have to run around to try and get this replaced. My fault for not reading the return policy of Jolity on this product before I bought it. BUY IT FROM A STORE so you can return it if need be!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I worked through Baby Brezza and they did replace the item at no cost to me and the new one works perfectly! In no time I have healthy and homemade baby food for my little one.

review/summary: Time saver!
review/text: While I was waiting for my order to arrive, I used a steamer and a handmixer to make food for my baby. This was a pretty easy, hard to mess up process and I started having doubts whether or not I really needed a Baby Food Maker. Boy, was I wrong! The Baby Brezza saves me so much time!<br />1. it steams faster than a regular steamer (I think it's because the space is so compact, the steam gets right to the veggies/fruits)<br />2. I don't have to be around the kitchen after I fill up the container. Just set the time and walk away! And wait for the beeping sound. With the regular steamer, you'll have to set a timer or keep coming back regularly to the kitchen to check if the food is ready.<br />3. The machine itself can automatically blend the food for you. Once again, you don't have to be around the kitchen after the food is steamed. Just stay away and wait for the beeping sound. With a regular steamer, the food has to be moved to the measuring cup before you can blend it with the handmixer (and wait for it to cool down).<br /><br />The accessories work perfectly along with the product. The machine is very easy to operate. I couldn't have asked for more...I'm happy!<br /><br />Yes, a regular steamer and handmixer can do the job too, but if you appreciate the freedom of not having to monitor the food being steamed or blend, buy the Baby Brezza!

review/summary: New out of box and blender does not work.  Solved with a DIY fix.
review/text: As many other one star reviewers have posted my unit's blender function did not work.  It is a brand new unit right out of the box.  Steam function works great, but the motor would never turn the blender blade so my food just sat there.  Luckily there's an easy fix.  I took the entire unit apart and found that the belt from the motor was not engaging the turnshaft that would in turn enable the blade to spin.  After properly aligning the belt I put it all back together and the unit now blends like it is supposed to.  My guess is that this is the same problem that caused others' blender function to not work.  I would futher venture that the Brezza knows about this issue and has done nothing to correct it.  It's hard to believe that after multiple complaints about the same problem that Brezza does not put its units through some sort of inspection process to prevent this from happening.  It is very frustrating to have to fix a brand new product that has just been taken out of the box.

review/summary: Great baby food maker!
review/text: The Baby Brezza is a super easy to use baby food maker.  You can literally throw in the ingredients and within 15-25 minutes, you have homemade baby food.  My only complaint is that being a mother of twins, the baby food maker does not have the capacity that I would like since I have two babies who eat a ton.  (My workaround is making multiple batches of the same thing and/or similar mixtures which seems to work.)  My suggestion for Baby Brezza is to add a "Blend time" button.  (So I can set to blend for 30 seconds after I have drained excess water or added non-steam ingredients like bananas.)  Overall, worth the money.  Easy to use, easy to clean!

review/summary: Great item for making baby food
review/text: I bought this item for a new mom friend because I knew how picky she was about what she eats, and now about what her new baby is going to be eating. I like the fact that you just have to press a couple of buttons, put some chopped veggies [or meat] into the blender and then walk away. When you come back, it's all done! I think there are always some questions about store bought baby food, and this makes it so easy to make your own - not a lot of pots, steamers and processors. Just this one food maker. Wish I'd had something like it when I had my kids! She loves it and tells me every week about the new recipes she's coming up with. And the baby likes it, too!

review/summary: Baby Brezza makes it a breeze
review/text: I am not the main chef in our household. My husband enjoys cooking whereas my comfort zone is being the clean-up crew(washing dishes, storing leftovers away). Don't get me wrong, there are a few occasions where I will prepare a decent meal but for the most part, I'm normally in the background when it comes to the kitchen.<br /><br />With our first child, I made a feeble attempt at making my own baby food. I roasted a butternut squash in the oven, steamed a couple of vegetables then used a food processor for blending. I was excited about making my own baby food for about two weeks tops. For me, it took so much time and a lot of clean-up afterwards that I ended up purchasing ready-made baby food.<br /><br />With our second child, I decided I wanted another go at making baby food. Since I already (unsuccessfully)tried making food by steaming/baking and blending separately, I realized it made sense for me to purchase a baby food maker.  I narrowed it down to Beaba and Baby Brezza. I chose the Baby Brezza after reading the reviews for both on Amazon.<br /><br />I love the Baby Brezza. Since my daughter turned 6 months, I've prepared: green beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, chicken breast, sweet peas, pears, apples, peaches and prunes. And she is 7.5 months. Yes, I know that I've only been using it for a month and a half but the point is, I have used it every four days (the recommended time for babies to be introduced to new food) and I see myself using it until she can eat food that actually looks the way it should. It's super easy to use. You chop up the food in small 1/4 cuts, pour water into the reservoir, transfer the food into the container, decide whether you want to steam only or steam + blend, select the length of steam time and press START.<br /><br />The clean-up is pretty easy. I let the blade soak in warm, soapy water while I clean the container. I also drain the water out of the reservoir and leave the cap on the reservoir open so as to let the inside of the reservoir air dry. It takes about a day out on our kitchen counter to be completely bone dry inside the reservoir. For people concerned about mold, if you dry your reservoir completely, you have no worries. Food occasionally sticks on the blades but I use a short small bottle brush to thoroughly get in between the blades.<br /><br />My only (minor) complaint would be the blending noise. My husband and I don't mind it, my 3.5 year old son doesn't mind it, but my 7.5 month daughter gets a bit spooked. But, seriously, the instrument is blending. It's doing its job. It's a strong motor that purees fruits/vegetables/meat to a homogenous consistency. I don't blame the maker but I just want to throw that out there for people that have noise-sensitive babies.<br /><br />*FYI, the optional items really aren't necessary. The cutting board? Really, just use your hands and scoop the vegetable/fruit/meat into the collection carafe. The spatula? I'm sure you can find a baking spatula in your utensil drawer.<br /><br />**FYI again, I use little BPA-free storage cubes to store the blended foods in the freezer. For me, it's a lot easier to use than ice cube trays.

review/summary: Makes Life Easy and Bellies Happy!
review/text: I started using this when my son was 6 months old and have loved it from the first day. I truly wish this was around when I had my first! It is so easy and I didn't feel like I was making separate food for my baby, but rather making him a part of what we were eating. The all-in-one is so perfect. Before I had to steam everything separately then transport into a blender or mixer (which are not designed to puree effectively) and then move again to jars/bowls/storage. Ugh..I felt like a short order cook. With the Baby Brezza, it was simple steps to great food. I also found that I used it for the rest of the family to make berry sauce for oatmeal, yogurt, pancakes, chicken and pork, homemade applesauce in a snap, great guacamole for the whole family and so much more. So if your fear is that "this will just be another gadget in your cupboard" after the baby becomes a toddler, don't worry. This is a product that will become a permanent part of your kitchen for many years. And...easy clean up! I highly recommend.

review/summary: Best Baby Food Maker
review/text: I got the Brezza as a gift right before my son transitioned to solid food.  I didn't think I was going to be the type to make my own food, but it was so easy with the Brezza.  I would throw a bunch of raw veggies in the cooker and in 10 or 15 minutes everything would be cooked and pureed. Seriously, the easiest thing ever.  Plus, after having bought some jarred baby food from the market, I can truly appreciate the difference in food that is homemade.<br />The clean-up is really easy too since all of the steaming and the pureeing happens in the same canister.  It is definitely a great purchase if you are considering making your own baby food.  It spans beyond purees too, because you can use the steam function to make veggies for the kids as they get older.  From one mom to another, I would highly recommend the Brezza.

review/summary: Health Concern! Reservoir Coating Flakes Off.
review/text: I loved this product for about 4.5 months!  I used it to make batches of organic baby food several times each month and loved how easy it was to make healthy food for my daughter.  Occasionally I would notice dark particles in the lighter colored foods that I would make and just thought I was seeing bits of the skin from potatoes or carrots that I didn't peel with the greatest of care.  Two weeks ago, I noted a larger speck in the potatoes I was feeding my daughter and pulled it out.  It looked like a metallic flake.  I began to examine the machine and discovered that the interior coating of the water reservoir had begun to bubble up and was flaking off along the bottom of the tank!  I contacted the company asking for the chemical composition of the coating so that I may have my daughter tested, as I had no idea how much of this coating she had ingested over how long a period.  The company representative first said that there was no coating and that the tank was ceramic, so what I noted MUST be limescale build-up.  I am not unfamiliar with limescale, and absolutely know that THIS is not mineral deposits, but the actual darkish grey, metallic coating (underneath where the grey has flaked off, the reservoir is black).  I took pictures to send the company and spoke with other company representatives who finally admitted that yes, there WAS a coating and said they thought it was silicon-based over aluminum.  I asked again for the name of the compound and/ or the chemical make-up so that I could have my daughter appropriately examined.  They agreed to contact the company in China and get that information.  They called back days later and said that the Chinese company sent a letter saying that the "silver coating"  was tested and FDA approved.  That's it.  I asked AGAIN for the chemical composition, and was told that it would take an additional 3 days to get it.  In three days, they called me back and said that the coating was a silicone material approved for food contact.  In other words, they reiterated EXACTLY THE SAME THING that they told me previously.  This company is STILL refusing to disclose what the interior reservoir is coated with and it has been two weeks since my initial request with them.<br /><br />The company claims that they have never received a complaint like this, so if anyone else out there has had this issue, I suggest that you contact Baby Brezza (1-888-396-6552) and let them know so that they can possibly recall this unsafe product.  The lot number on the bottom of my machine is WSI-030.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Though this is a great idea and saves you some time and hassle in the kitchen, I recommend skipping it and making your child's food the old fashioned way - steam it on the stove!

review/summary: Quick Fix for the Broken Blender Problem
review/text: I just got my Baby Brezza.  I was a little worried about the recent negative comments about the blades not dropping down into the 'blend' position after steaming.  Guess what?  Mine had the same problem. When I pressed 'Blend' I just got a high whining motor noise and no blender action.  Not willing to give up so easily and play the Returns game I removed the five or six screws from the bottom, popped the top off, and immediately saw the problem.  The problem is that the drive belt had slipped off the blender gear during transit, probably due to the way the Brezza is positioned in the box.  I pushed the drive belt back onto the gear, closed it up, and now the blender works fine.<br /><br />My only complaint now is that it doesn't really puree very well.  We ran a batch of carrots through it and it came out chunky.  There were even several dime-sized pieces that I guess had gotten between the blades and were not chopped up at all.  So like all food processors there is no escape from the 'open the top, scrape down the sides, and blend again' method if you want a true puree.  I did pop the chunky carrots into my mini Cuisinart and (after several scrape/blend cycles) got a fine puree.  One thing my Cuisinart has that the Baby Brezza doesn't is a 'Grind' option that basically runs the blades backwards so that they smash rather than slice.  I think this really helped break up the tiny chunks.  I wish the Brezza had the same.

review/summary: I love it!
review/text: I really debated whether or not I needed a baby food maker.  This is baby #4 and don't know that we'll have another & it seemed like a lot of money if I only use it for one baby for a few months.  BUT the manual grinders suck!  And a blender is too big for a small job & my electric mini chopper just doesn't do the job (and it's also a little big).  AND the Baby Brezza had a great product video vs. the much cheaper KidCo one.  I couldn't even find a YouTube for that one!  And I'm a total sucker for advertising.  Marketers dream of people like me.  Anyway-<br /><br />I'm so glad that I spent the money on the Baby Brezza!  My primary reason for buying a baby food maker was so that I could process our own dinner (when it's healthy enough) & feed it to my baby.  The Baby Brezza definitely delivers!  The first time I used it I was processing some soup with chicken in it.  There were a few small chicken chunks left in the rest of the puree.  So the next time I processed a meal with chicken, I cut the chicken into smaller dices & I added a little more water to the Baby Brezza & also blended it longer.  That did the trick.  It was so easy to use that I decided to try a banana.  Fork mashing the banana kept it too thick for my picky baby, but in the Brezza she was happy with the texture.  Then I got an avocado.  And then a mango.  And zucchini.  Things that I'd never even considered feeding my babies at this age because you can't buy baby food avocado (although I realize you can get mango blends).<br /><br />My picky baby would have nothing to do with store bought baby food vegetables, unless I bought the expensive organic (and more creative) blends in the pouches.  But with the Baby Brezza she's happy to have freshly pureed veggies!  And this is how easy it is to use: I dice up a few carrots (as I am chopping some up for our own dinner prep), put them in the Brezza cup, look at their little included cookbook for the amt of time to steam carrots, hit the Steam + Blend button, and leave it alone while I work more on the rest of the family's dinner.  After the carrots are finished steaming the Brezza purees them without me having to do a thing & it beeps when it's finished.  How cool is that?!  Sometimes there are still a couple/few tiny chunks of whatever I've pureed.  Big deal - I'd be surprised if anything made for a home kitchen would be any different.  Oh, as a side note the included "cook book" was a let down.  The Baeba one seemed better, but not $50 better!<br /><br />So I was a little worried that my husband would give me a hard time when I told him how much the Baby Brezza cost, but as I made my first blend he joked about how it was already saving us one dollar.  He'll ask me at the end of the day if I've made any baby food & when I tell him what I've blended he'll say "that's --more dollars saved!"  The Baby Brezza will eventually pay for itself.<br /><br />One more thing to note is that I am not in any way a person who has been concerned about making my own baby food in the past.  I see nothing wrong with store bought baby food.  BUT it's awesome to know that my baby is getting fresh, nutrient-rich food when I make it myself.  Also as I was feeding my baby some baby food from a jar I noticed it had that gross metallic smell (like when you open a can of Spaghetti-O's!), and guess what?- it tasted like that too!  Yuck!  So of course you won't get that when you make it yourself.  I find myself thinking of what I can blend up next for my baby.  I even ordered a baby food book just so I could have good combo ideas.  I seriously haven't had this much fun with an appliance since I got my KitchenAid at the beginning of my marriage 10 years ago!<br /><br />Buy the Baby Brezza - you'll love it!

review/summary: Makes being a granola mom so much easier!
review/text: I love to cook wholesome, homemade foods for my family so it made perfect sense when I decided to make my son's first foods rather than purchasing them ready-made. This task wasn't the easiest; having to steam in a pot, then swapping the (hot, mind you) fruits or veggies into the blender or food processor creating way too many dishes. An endeavor with the best intentions turned into several all-day affairs - not that it wasn't worth it.<br /><br />When it was my daughter's turn a few years later to start her first foods, I did my research into other options. I still wanted to make her foods from scratch as much as possible, but needed a better system than the multiple appliances I used the last time. Enter the Baby Brezza. i was remarkably impressed by the 5-star reviews as well as the introduction videos. I compared it to the Beaba Babycook machine and the Baby Brezza came out on top every time. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and I am in LOVE with this machine. Easy prep, hearty steaming, smooth purees and easy clean up. Best of all, it allows me a lot more free time while still feeding my baby the best foods possible. Best part of all, it's under $100!<br /><br />Between this and any other system, I would choose this a million times over.

review/summary: I REALLY wanted this to work. I REALLY wanted to give them ANOTHER try.
review/text: First thing I must say is the cutover service is great. Lillianna and Nancy are very nice (the fact that I know there names is redic). However, as much as I wanted this product to work! After my 2nd machine and my 3rd bowl I'm giving up. Nancy asked for another shot (this is not the first time she's asked) but this time I declined. I wanted to give them a shot I really did but there have been way to many errors, so I thought you all should know. I am a big review person so I had to put this out there.<br /><br />We bought our machine directly from their site. First machine out of the box tiny plastic piece on bowl lid BROKEN. Get a new bowl. Finally get to use the machine, water leaks EVERYWHERE and after steaming no blending happening. A new machine arrived. 1st use - steam but no blend again, but no water yay lol. I gave it another shot, worked good. Yesterday, couldn't get my blade off and drive shaft was stuck. Now, at this point i have 3 bowls sitting around - but I was just TIRED of this machine.<br /><br />READ THIS PART @ LEAST:<br />This machine has a great concept, steam and blend all in one without going back to hit another button - perfect, I thought, until I got the manual. There is actually only about 5 foods that you can actually do this with!!! (i wish i would have known this) All the others have water issues. So for instance, I think it was apples, they have too much water after steaming so you have to go and strain the water before blending...so whats the point? Along with this when you blend manually you have to stand there and hold the button in! I've decided I'm not that lazy and I can go back and hit a steam button - but I am a multitasked so standing over the machine to hold the button in, well, sucks!<br /><br />Taking it apart and getting the blade out is rather difficult (and as u can see from above sometimes the darn thing doesn't even come out). My mind always slipped and i wanted to get my food out of the bowl - but to take the blade out it needs to be attached to the base, so I would have to put it back on and get the blade out.<br /><br />Also, difficult to put the bowl back on the base @ times. The gaskets have to be lined up or there is no luck.<br /><br /> I am using filtered water and I am still getting mineral deposits in the water tank after first use, hmmm?<br /><br />Overall, too many flaws, too many manufacturing errors, time to buy a beaba. Sorry Breeza, I wanted to love you.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I research everything I buy!  One thing I wanted was to make homemade babyfood.  I spent weeks watching videos online and reading all I could.  I made a list of everything I would need and marked videos to remember how to make each food.  Then I found the Baby Brezza!  I heard about the Babycook and thought about buying that one.  However, the Baby Brezza has one button that not only steams the food, but then purees it automatically after it steams (Babycook does not)!  As I write this review the steamer just stopped and started to puree..I am in the living room playing with  my baby as the babyfood makes itself in the kitchen!  All I had to do was buy the veggies and fruits (I bought organic) and then peeled, followed the steamer time in the recipe book it came with and that's it!  This is a busy working moms dream!  I just poured the puree into ice cube trays to freeze and I can't wait to feed them to my little one.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product if you are at a loss of where to start and want something super easy.  I bought organic carrots in a jar last week for 79 cents for 2.5 ounces.  I did the math tonight and I was able to make organice sweet potatos for 14 cents for 2.5 ounces!  Carrots would have probably been even cheaper!  I know using kitchen gadgets I already owned would make it even cheaper, but since I bought it for convience and not for the cost, saving money is a bonus and it will pretty much pay for itself!  And it was $50 cheaper than the Baby Cook.  So happy!  And my little one loves the baby food I have made so far!

review/summary: So easy to use!
review/text: I love my Baby Brezza and how easy it makes it to cook healthy baby food for my daughter! The machine is very easy to use, and the parts that touch food go in the dishwasher, which makes it very convenient to clean. When my daughter was just starting on "solid" food, I could just chop vegetables or fruit up and put them in the machine and then it would cook and puree them while I did other things. Now that she's a little older and doesn't need things as liquified, I just run the steam function and then pour out some water before hitting the blend button. It's so easy to use! I totally recommend it.

review/summary: Concerned about black stuff leaking into food
review/text: I bought this product in December and was excited to use it.  I began using it last month and have used it maybe 7 times.  Today, I noticed that there is black stuff leaking in the bottom.  I am very concerned that it has been getting into the food.  I just sent customer service an email and hoping to get a response soon.  Before noticing that major problem, I would have given it a 4-star rating but now I'm leaning towards returning it or just getting rid of it.

review/summary: Broken and poor customer service
review/text: Like many of the other one-star reviews, our food maker doesn't puree the food because the blade doesn't move. I plan to send it back to the company for a repair, per the instructions on the Baby Brezza website- it's annoying to have to send $10 for return shipping for a $100 product.  In addition, I haven't been able to actually reach a person to talk to since the customer service number is not in service anymore.  I tried calling their main line and was transferred to someone's voicemail. No returned call from them yet...<br /><br />In the mean time, I've been successfully pureeing the baby food with my Cuisinart stick blender.  I should have tried that out first before buying this one step food maker.  I was lured by the 'one-step' process, but hopefully you won't be.

review/summary: Coating in water reservoir flaking off
review/text: I guess it's true that ignorance is bliss. I loved using my new Brezza these past couple of weeks.  So easy to operate with very little clean up.  Recently I came across some reviews about the coating in the water reservoir flaking off.  As a result I LOOKED for it during my last meal prep and sure enough, I saw tiny little silver flakes.  It almost looks like oily water but under good lighting you can see the silver bits.  I rinsed it out 5 times and still see the flakes.  I'm very concerned as I just spent $100 on this machine.  Unlike the other parent who wants to know what the coating is chemically made up of, I don't really care. I don't think it's acceptable to have ANY coating come off whether it's 'safe' or not. I have no intention of using this anymore.

review/text: This product works so well and it is incredibly easy to use.  All I have to do is add water to the steamer reservoir, cut up all the ingredients to the right size (per the included recipe guide), add them into the container, close the lid, set time and press "start".  I can then walk away and 20 minutes later I get steamed and perfectly pureed baby food!  Now I have no excuse not to make my own baby food at home!

review/summary: Good Blender does it's job. Few Tips provided
review/text: Update:<br /><br />Right after I posted my review. The blender stopped working!!!!!!!!!! No matter how I do it just does not blend or steam.<br />I am contacting customer service now.<br /><br />I have been using it everyday since my twins turn 8 months (They are 11 months now). Overall it does great job steaming & blending.<br />I know the bowl was really small and it was hard to remove the blades apart from driveshaft, it was also hard to cleanup. However quickly I figured some ways to solve these problems:<br />(1) Cleaning: I figured a quick&easy way to clean the blades& bowl: I first soak the bowl, the lid and the blade in hot soapy water, then used an old Dr. Brown bottle brush to gently scrub them.<br />(2) Removing blades: Unlock driveshaft first, then hold tight of driveshaft in one hand, then use the other hand to gently pull&shake&turn the the blade until it's loose. Most of the time there was still puree on the blade, I just used the spatula to scrape it off first before I completely remove the blade out of the bowl.<br />(3) Bowl was too small: Well, I like the idea of it being so small that makes it easy to store away especially having a small kitchen. Sometimes I steamed vege using my rice cooker since vege shrunk so it would fit more in the blender. I ended up buying second set of bowl & blade so I don't have to keep washing the bowl&blade.<br />(4) I do notice the plastic part of the blade started to turn brown/black, but I assumed it was stained from darker color fruit&vege like blueberry.<br />(5) Noise: All food processors make some level of noise, but one of my twin always got freaked out everytime when it started to blend. I figured a ghetto way to reduce the noise, put a folded thick towel under the blender and another folded thick towel on top of the lid when I press blend. It can't cancel the noise, but it did help reduce the noise.

review/summary: Good once I fixed it.
review/text: I gave this four stars because once I got it to work it was wonderful.  Does everything it says it does and is very handy to have.  BUT the problem was the same thing as everyone else, no drive shaft turning.  I also took it apart (easy) and just attached the belt to the gear and it works like a charm.  It's just too bad that they are losing customers because of some tiny malfunction because it is a BIG timesaver..  You would think they would try to fix the problem instead of letting their customers do it for them.  If I hadn't read the review on how to fix it I would have been VERY dissatisfied with this.  So I guess if you don't feel like taking a fifty fifty chance of it not working and don't want to have to fix something that is brand new, don't buy the baby Brezza.<br /><br />OK, now for an update.  I've had this thing for about three months now and I use it about twice a week, maybe for four or five different things a day.  Amonth ago I noticed a black liquid coming out of the drive shaft part when I took off the bowl.  I have always washed that part by hand and never put it in the dishwasher.  I guess this thing just isn't made to do what it's supposed to.  Now the drive shaft is completely stuck, it won't turn at all.  I also called Baby Brezza and no response.  I am majorly P.O.'d.  I also overlooked the blade sticking isuue because I just wanted to love this machine so much.  But now I know it is truly a piece of junk and I never should have bothered.  I fell in love with it because it worked so nicely and made everything so much simpler.  I will truly miss you.....tear ;)

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I have been using this device for the last three months. I feed my baby almost exclusively homemade foods (besides those my doctor recommends to buy in a jar), so I do use this quite a bit.<br /><br />It is easy to use and it is convenient. My only complaint is the construction. Some of the materials seem a little cheap (for example, the button panel is starting to come off...it is just a sticker). I'm already having to buy another container because the plastic broke on my first one. I called the company to talk to them about it (because it seemed fishy to me that it would break so quickly under normal use, and there is supposedly a warranty) and I got a machine (during normal business hours). No one returned my call. I truly think that any company who makes things for people with babies need to have excellent customer service because their customers are sleep deprived and short on time. This company doesn't even come close to meeting a high standard. I'd rather pay the $25 for the replacement part than deal with the hassle.<br /><br />So, basically, I like the device but I'm not crazy about the quality or customer service (the latter is basically non-existent at this point).<br /><br />All this being said, I researched several other machines before buying this one. I'm not sure I would go back and buy a different device. At least I can buy replacement parts easily!<br /><br />UPDATE: The replacement part didn't fit as it was a newer model than my machine. However, the customer service department did call me back and shipped me an entire new machine (newer model). Unfortunately, it still seems plauged with some problems. The drive shafts sometimes sticks and the buttons don't work very well. Ulimately, for me, not a worry-free machine.

review/summary: Super easy baby food maker!!!
review/text: I went in to this with a strong intent to make my own baby food.  I did the research and decided on the Baby Brezza.  I love it!  It makes the homemade baby food process so easy.  It is pricey and if you already have a food processor and want to steam your own food you could save $100 but I do not own a food processor.  The Baby Brezza is so easy to use and clean up is a breeze.  You can steam and puree your food in the same container.  You don't have to babysit the Brezza while it is making the food. You can add ingredients and walk away.  I make my food in bulk and freeze.  My baby loves the fresh food I make for her.  The only small issue I have had it that I tried washing the parts in the dishwasher and they didn't come completely clean.  I just hand wash mine which is no big deal... I hand wash all the other baby stuff, anyway.  If you are looking for an easy, convenient way to make your own baby food... look no further.  I have only used this for a couple of weeks so I don't know how well it holds up overtime...

review/text: I like the Baby Brezza a lot - it has successfully steamed and pureed everything I've thrown in it so far.  It does not require constant attention - just drop the ingredients in, set the steam time and let it go! I was a little concerned about ordering a baby food maker -- I knew that if it was a pain or difficult to operate, I would probably give-up and go to the pre-made stuff at the store pretty quickly.  However, I have not been tempted to buy the pre-made stuff at all - the Brezza is so easy! Definitely worth the investment.<br /><br />My  only complaint is that I have had a little difficulty detaching the blade from the bowl for cleaning purposes.<br /><br />All in all, if you want to make your baby food, I highly recommend the Brezza!

review/text: I am on my third child and making baby food for the first time.  For some reason it is the thing to do these days.  :)  If someone had suggested it to me the first two times around I would have thought them to be crazy--who has time for that?!  But honestly, the Brezza takes no time at all.  I am astonished by how simple and fast it is.<br /><br />I choose the Brezza over the Baeba one because you don't need to change the containers in between steps and have two bowls to wash.<br /><br />My only tiny complaint is that I have trouble coaxing the blade out. The first day I sliced my hand twice trying to get it out.  The first time was my fault (I stupidly grabbed the blade) but the second time it jolted out after  I had been pulling on it with great effort.  I have been using it for over a month now and make my husband remove it out of fear of cutting my hands again.  Still can't figure out the "trick" as I am sure there is one.

review/text: The Baby Breeza is unbelievably simple to use. Peel and crudely chop whatever you want to turn into mush, toss it in the Breeza, add some water to the tank, and go do all the other baby things you have to do for the next 10-15 minutes. When you come back, you'll have perfectly mushed vegetables or fruits. I even made jam with the thing once for myself. I love it, and it makes me wonder why more typical adult-focused blenders don't have the same balance of functionality and ease of use. The Baby Breeza is a great product if you want healthy food for your kid but don't have much time to spare.

review/summary: Great machine for a short amount of time - leaks oil!!!
review/text: We ordered the Baby Brezza and I was excited to try it out.  We took it out of the box and it wouldn't even turn on.  I was very frustrated and we called the company which was gracious enough to send us out a replacement.  The new one worked very well and I have been using it for about 4 months.  I love the machine it steams very well and I can put a fair amount of food in the container.  I do wish the container was larger because I make large batches of food and then freeze them.  I really like this machine, but now it has started leaking oil at the bottom when it makes the food and drips it into the food when I pour it out.  This I am not happy about at all and cannot feed to my baby with oil in it!  I am going to have replace this product and I don't think I would purchase another one just based off of all the problems we have had now with two machines.  It is a great machine when it works though.

review/text: I bought the Baby Brezza after alot of research and I'm happy to say I love it!  It steams and purees and is SO easy.  One thing to note is that after the food is steamed there is alot of water in the processor which is fine if your baby likes really runny purees.  My baby likes texture so I always drain the water before I puree and it comes out perfect.  Love it!  I dinged it one star because it is very small so I have to make several batches, but it's not a deal-breaker.  I would recommend this to anyone.

It's wonderful!  I have to say, the customer service provided by the company is exceptional, also.  I used mine (the older model) regularly for 4 months before it stopped blending.  I contacted the company, and with absolutely no hassle whatsoever they shipped out a replacement unit.  Better yet, it was the newer model!  I'm thrilled with this appliance and would recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Just received this on Friday, have already made multiple batches of baby food with it and overall I love it. The only work required is to chop the veggies and add water, and this machine really does the rest. My only very minor complaints are 1) that the instructions are a big confusing (directions say to use 160ml of water, but the container is marked to measure 180ml, but after a few batches it was easy to eyeball how much you really needed) and 2) the blade is a bit hard to get out after it's finished to really get all of the food out (trial and error showed that you need to take the blade out while the cup is still attached to the base and then it's easy to get all of the puree out). Overall, however, the instructions are very easy to understand and the machine is easy to use and very efficient! I was able to make carrots, sweet potatoes and butternut squash purees over the course of a couple of hours while still getting other things done around the house. This will even be ideal for some single servings of adult foods like mashed potatoes. One butternut squash made multiple servings, so I think the savings do offset the cost of this machine over time.

review/text: This baby food processor is the BEST baby item I own!  It is really important to me to make my own baby food, but the thought of chopping, boiling/steaming, processing the veggies/fruits and then washing all these items is just another annoying item to add to the list of To Do's during the day. The Baby Brezza makes all that so simple and easy that I don't mind taking this extra step to give my baby the best nutrients AND save money! All you need to do is chop the food, stick it in the machine, and wait for it to be cooked and pureed. The clean up is simple and the machine is nice and compact for storage in my tiny kitchen. The food consistency is perfect and the recipe book gives some great suggestions for food varieties and quantities. Love this item and would highly suggest for you to buy one of your own.

review/summary: We love our Baby Brezza!
review/text: I've just started making baby food for our baby--the Baby Brezza works like a charm!  It makes the whole process very easy.  You can literally chop up a vegetable, put it in the Baby Brezza, and hit the button.  It will steam and puree the food for you!  The instruction manual tells you how long to steam each vegetable.  It purees the food much better than my food processor.  If I used the food processor, I'd have to add an extra step of straining the food after it was pureed.  The only negative to the Baby Brezza is that it only makes limited quantities at a time.  But since the process is so easy, that doesn't bother me.  It's quick and easy to make multiple batches.  Not much to clean up when you're done either.  I pour the puree into ice cube trays to freeze.  In a couple of days, I quickly dip the bottom of the trays in warm water and then pop the cubes out into a zip lock bag to store in our deep freezer.  It's great!

review/text: I knew I wanted to feed my baby homemade nutritious meals and have a couple of great baby food cookbooks that I purchased. I know I could have used the items already in my kitchen to make baby food but I wanted one, easy, one-step machine that could do it all so I wasn't washing multiple pots/pans/steamers everytime I made baby food.<br /><br />The Brezza has made my life SOOOO easy!  I can cook squash, peaches, pears, apples, sweet potatoes etc. and blend and reheat with this fantastic appliance. And it's small and convenient!  I haven't had any mechanical issues with it (I've only had it for about a month) and it can get hot due to the steaming BUT this is like any pot or pan you'd use to steam.  It just takes some common sense when you're using it.<br /><br />I can spend one day making big batches and freeze them in individual ice cube trays (with lids) and then be done with cooking baby food for a couple of weeks!  This is an invaluable appliance to me, I highly recommend the Brezza.  It makes cooking your own baby food a breeze (and super cheap!) and easy to do so you're not feeding your baby processed baby foods.

I decided to start her off with carrots and I was a little apprehensive that the machine would not be able to puree them to the consistency I needed. Well let me just say I was wrong this machine is awesome I put the carrots on and they were steamed and blended in a matter of 25 minutes without me having to watch the machine. I was able to wash dishes and start a load of clothes while the Brezza did it's thing. Thank You Brezza for making my life a little easier! Oh by the way my daugther loved the carrots.

review/summary: Just get it, you won't regret it!
review/text: So I've had this for a couple of weeks but tried it yesterday evening.  Wow!  It was soo easy!  Literally, I just rough chopped the apples, set the steamer and timer, decided to take a shower, came back, and VOILA!  I had fresh, delicious home-made apple sauce in 20 minutes!  I didn't have to stand over it and dump the water and transer the basket yadda yadda (who has time for that?!).  And it was so cheap.  I bought just 1 organic carrot and I ended up making 4 4 oz jars of carrot purees.  You can also add meats for when they get older.  I have also heard of moms using these to make purees to stick them in brownies or cakes.  This is the best purchase I have made in a LONG time.

review/summary: Quick, Easy and Healthy Baby Food
review/text: A reluctant cook with no extra time, I never thought I'd be able to make homemade food. This machine changed my mind. I tried the basic recipes first and it was so easy to use - and clean up (yay!) - we're now trying all kinds of food combinations. I love that I can also make healthy purees that I "hide" in my older childrens' foods. After about 2 months, I've already recovered the cost of this appliance with all the homemade food I've made in my Baby Brezza.

review/text: I wanted a baby food maker and based on the reviews this was the best choice. My parents were the ones who purchased it and gave it to me as a gift. I am glad I chose this baby food maker. All you have to do is chop the fruits or vegetables, and about 20 minutes late: TA-DA! Baby food! I love the recipes and the specifications regarding time for each fruit or vegetable that the book has. My favorite thing: it makes everything in ONE container so it's easy to clean. Buy it, you won't regret it. It'll make your life easier.

review/summary: Stopped working after just 3 months.
review/text: Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.

review/summary: AWESOME!!!
review/text: I got this baby food maker after reading some of the reviews and comparing it to a couple of others. This is by far the best baby food maker out there and though I initially thought it to be a bit pricey it has been a total help in preparing babies foods. I love that you can just sit it and forget it. I also use it as a food warmer i just set it to steam for a couple of minutes.  I love that I can make wholesome food for my baby, and that I know exactly what is in the foods I am feeding her.  Very happy with this product.

review/summary: Makes homemade baby food do-able for a working mom
review/text: I have seen so many bad reviews for the various baby food makers, I was skeptical about the Baby Brezza.  It had the best reviews so I registered for it and figured if I received it I'd give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.  It is easily one of the best/most useful baby items we own.  Making sure I know exactly what is going into my little man's tummy is as easy as chopping up whatever meat/veggie/fruit I choose (usually what I am cooking for the rest of the family so it doesn't require extra prep), tossing it in, and pushing the "steam and blend" button.  I can continue with whatever I was doing and in 30 minutes or less, I have four servings that just need to be scooped into containers to store.  Much less expensive and much more nutritious than the pre-packaged store bought stuff.  As a mama who works 10 hours a day, the Baby Brezza is priceless!

review/summary: Poor Quality
review/text: I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.  Mistake.  I remember that a few people had written about the poor quality and bad customer service (of the company itself, not amazon).  When I opened it, the tape used to secure it within the plastic bag was melted so there was sticky stuff all over the bottom of the thing.  I had to scrub it as soon as I took it out of the box, after it had gotten sticky melted tape all over my kitchen counter.  That was annoying. The plastic covering over the buttons looked like it was lifting (as if it had been used or something...even though it was brand new).  I tried the motor and it worked, it wasn't terribly loud, I'd probably rate the noise a 4 on a 1-10 scale.  When I went to wash it (prior to first use of course), the directions said to remove the driveshaft prior to washing.  It said all you had to do was to turn the canister over, find the knob, and turn counter clock-wise.  That driveshaft must've been welded in there bc it took me and my husband over an hour to loosen it enough to get it out of there.  I was honestly scared to put it back in for fear that I'd never get it back out again!  I got over it and prepared to make my first meal (carrots).  I followed the directions and cut up the carrots to the appropriate size but when I went to put the water in, there was a discrepancy.  The directions said to put in "160ml of water" and that the canister had a premeasured line that could be used so the amount of water would be correct.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem...except that the measured line read 180ml.  Seriously?!?  So, I'm left trying to figure out which one is correct.  I ended up going with the premeasured canister...and I think that it was too much water bc the carrots came out ridiculously watery.  There were also still chunks of carrot in the mix.  It wasn't easy to get the food out around the blades, either.  I can see how people would say that it might be a time saver.  If it worked and was of decent quality then it WOULD save time.  You just set it and walk away.  But the end result leaves much to be desired.  And for the price, you'd expect to at least get your money's worth.  You're honestly better off just getting a really nice food processor and going the old fashioned way.

review/summary: Don't waste your money!
review/text: Bought this item to make baby food for my twins.  Within a month we started to notice a black liquid coming from the bottom.  We also found that it was not so easy to take out the blade out from the cup.  After 2 months of using the product the motor went out and it did not blend.  We ended up buying a kitchen aide chopper/puree machine for MUCH less and it workes sooo much better and has a bigger blender cup too! After using the Kitchen Aide product you can tell how cheaply made the baby breeza is.  Don't waste your money, you will end up having to get something else in the end!

review/summary: Good concept that doesnt work
review/text: I ordered this product in December 2011. I must have used it maybe 5-6 times with the steam-blend option. Following is what I observed<br />1. Doesnt blend peas very well.<br />2. The food does have a smell from the plastic of the tank.<br />3. The water tank is extremely difficult to clean due to its narrow curved shape. Even after I ordered Brezza cleaning brush, it doesnt clean properly and now I have build up in the tank. So I cannot steam anymore as I dont want contaminated water in my babies food.<br />4. So, I used just the blender option for maybe 5-6 more times. And now the blender doesnt work. Just broke.<br />I will get in touch with the seller to see if I can get a full refund. I dont think I want to exchange.

review/text: This product makes it possible for ME (a working mom) to make my baby fresh food every morning before WORK!  Please remember this is a fine piece of equipment.  You must follow directions.  DO NOT STEAM with-OUT DRIVEshaft and DO NOT STEAM with blade in down position.  I think most of the poor reviews came from people who did not follow instructions.  THis product save me time which equates to saving me money.  It pays for itself.<br /><br />PS You can make fresh quinoa (or rice) with the additional grain basket.

review/summary: If you're going to make the baby food, use this....
review/text: I knew I wanted to make the baby food, but I wasn't so sure about buying one of these machines since I already had a steamer and a food processor, then I received the Brezza as a gift.  Now I'm hooked. It's easy to use, clean, and store (tiny).<br />The down side is that a piece broke on it and made it unusable, the upside was that we called the company and they immediately sent a replacement part without any hassle.  While it was out of commission, I used the steamer and food processor and was so annoyed with that process - double cleaning and transferring... ugh.<br /><br />My husband and I both work full time so every weekend we do a whole bunch of batches and freeze them to use during the week.  Even my husband finds it fun to find new foods and combinations and helps out.  Plus it comes with this little tiny guide of what foods to feed when and recipes, which is a great starter kit.<br /><br />If you're going to make the baby food it's worth the investment.

review/summary: Love and Hate relationship
review/text: It didn't work properly out from the box...it didn't blend but it wasn't about the belt issue.  It seems like the lock system of the blade wasn't work properly.  It is a easy fix and then work beautiful for almost 2 months.  Then, it stop blending...again, based on other review, I check the belt but it is still not the case.  The driveshaft was stuck....I fixed it somehow and worked for a few times and goy stucked again.  I called the company...I agree with others that it is rather annoying to leave a message but I got a call back next day.  I didn't call them and they follow up with another call 2 days later.  I called back to the extension and left a message, same day the person call me back...and sending me the blade and bowl accessories for free to fix my issue!  I think customer service is quite good... I love the machine because it works beautifully when it works (steam and blend) but rather a pain when it is not....given I pay $100 for it...I wish it can work more consistently.

review/summary: Overall it's pretty good
review/text: I have been using the brezza to make all of my daughter's baby food for about 2 months. I purchased mine several months ago from another site. Since day 1 I have been getting a "4 beep" alarm every time I start the steamer. It usually works after pressing the start button several times. It always blends the first time I press the button. Last night I got frustrated and steamed my veggies on the stove then used a food processor to blend...what a pain in the neck... I finally called customer service today and they said that I should have called 2 months ago, and they are sending me a new unit at no cost to me. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the new unit isn't as quirky as the last one because when it works it is very easy. Both the steam and blend functions work well and it is so nice to not have to transfer the food. Clean up is a breeze. It does have a small bowl but a batch still makes several portions. Babies don't eat that much ;-). After using the food processor, I would definetly recommend this or another appliance that steam and blend. In my experience this company stands behind their product.

review/text: If you watch demonstrations of each of the two best selling machines on u tube, you will see for yourself that this is the one to get.  One less step (no transfer) makes this the choice for me.  I have had no problems at all with this machine but do watch out for the super sharp blades. The only drawback I would comment on is that it is hard to separate the blade from the drive shaft for placing the blade into the dishwasher but I still manage to do it, just wish the separation were easier.

review/summary: Amazing Product!
review/text: I bought the Baby Brezza based on a recommendation from a friend.  This is the easiest baby food maker, I'm so glad I bought it.  Making food for my daughter is so easy.  I peel, cut and put it in the Brezza where it steams and blends all in a matter of minutes.  When it's finished I have enough food for her meals for the next 3-4 days.  My daughter is 5 months old so we are starting new foods every few days so it makes the perfect amount.  I would recommend this product to any mom or dad who wants to make their own baby food.  Clean-up is also a breeze.  The only thing I would tell people is that the belt for the motor can get displaced during shipping.  My husband fixed it within a matter of minutes but I think I should mention this so that you don't think your product is broken.  From what we read online, this happens frequently.  Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend it to any parent!

We did that and now it works like a champ. Whatever the cause of the issue they need better quality control.

review/text: The Brezza works great, very convenient to have the steamer and processor in one.  I'm able to make fresh organic baby food quickly and easily.  I've only done fruits so far, however, I have not tried meats or multi ingredient recipes.  My only complaints would be that it can be hard to pull out the drive shaft when you go to clean it and if I don't do Steam + blend I have to hold down the blend for the whole time.  It should have a timed setting for the blend too.  With that said, I have still recommended to others.

Overall very happy with this product.  There are a few small things that bother me, like it being a bit difficult to get the blade out when you're trying to scoop out the food, without losing any of the food.  But overall it works great and produces food at a smooth consistency.  Very happy with my purchase!  And seriously when you compare the color of the food you make to the color of the stuff they sell in jars, it just looks more appetizing.

review/summary: EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH MY DECISION TO BUY BREEZA OVER THE BABYCOOK
review/text: I read review after review trying to decide which to buy...my son's nanny has used both now and she liked both but loves the baby breeza.  It is quite a bit cheaper and she says there's really no difference except for the plastic insert that comes with the other babycook device.  I have been extremely pleased with my purchase.  I use the Breeza pretty much daily.  It's fast & easy to make my son's organic baby food.  The fact that you can select steam & blend is great because it does all the work once you chop up your veggies or fruit or whatever... you walk off and 15-20-25 mins later you come back to the kitchen and the food is steamed & blended already.  And the instruction manual gives a great guide for how long to cook each fruit/veg and it also gives a guide on what foods baby can eat at 6 mos, 8 mos, 10mos, etc...i have it tacked on my frig and it's a quick & easy reference.  This machine has been easy to clean for the most part.. My sweet potatoes stain the clear container a bit but that's nothing i couldn't scrub off.  All in all a great purchase.

review/text: This is an awsome machine!<br />Our first one was damaged but we replaced it the next day and I am so happy we did! Crazy simple. I love giving my son new veggies and fruits! We've been to the farmers market and Whole Foods to get all the fresh produce we can! It's so simple. Chop it up, set the machine and store it!<br />No worries about any preservatives/what could be in his food! I've even tried a few new produce items I'd never wanted to eat before.(I have to taste what it is I'm giving him) And I just can't bring myself to try some of the foods that sit in the store on the unrefrigerated shelf for months/years...

review/summary: Awesome machine!
review/text: I'm not a mother, just a person who enjoys steamed and pureed single portions of food. I just got this today and I immediately tried it with broccoli and carrots, steam + blend for 25 minutes. Turned out perfectly! Once it was done, I added some seasonings and blended some more for a delicious side dish! I love that the steaming and blending occurs in the same place! Hand cleaning was very easy afterwards. The water chamber for steaming is a little annoying to dump out after each use, but doesn't take away from the overall awesomeness. I hope this product lasts a long time!

review/summary: Easy way to make healthy food for baby
review/text: I recently purchased this item and have made 4 different recipes in it. I have three pointers for you.<br />1. Use distilled water if you can, it will save you the hassle of having scale build up later on.<br />2. Add extra water, especially on longer cook times (25m+). It seems like mine runs out of water in the middle of some recipes and then messes me up on cook time because it shuts off, and if I wasn't watching it, I don't know how much time is left!<br />3. If you want a smooth puree for a younger baby, add 5 minutes to the suggested steam time. My first batch of carrots came out textured, and my 6 month old was not crazy about them. Next time, I did longer, and they were much smoother.<br /><br />All in all, I am very satisfied. It doesn't take up too much counter space. I love that I can make something all natural and homemade. One batch is enough for 3 to 4 feedings, especially if you are feeding different items (cereal, veggies, fruit). I do buy some organic baby foods in pouches, but if I am out of something, I can whip it up in a jiff from fresh produce or frozen. I plan on not buying any more store baby food in the future, except maybe to keep in the diaper bag for trips. You can make things you will never find in the grocery store. My daughter ate broccoli and spinach last night, with a touch of parsley. Today, I made carrots and parsnips. Before that, peas one day, sweet potatoes another, and carrots mixed with zucchini.<br /><br />Lastly, it's pretty easy to clean. Soak it when you are done, so the food doesn't get stuck on, and wash it as soon as you can. There are 3 or 4 parts to clean.

review/summary: Compact machine for easy, healthy baby food
review/text: I could use a steamer on the stove and a blender to make baby food but why go thru all the hassle when there is already plenty of work to do especially since I have twins.  This machine is really simple.  You cut up the fruits or veggies, choose how long you want to steam them based upon the included cookbook and then set it to steam/blend.  15-25 minutes later you have fresh, healthy baby food.  I will definitely recommend this to friends and give it as a gift.  I've only used it for a week but I think it is great and there is no reason to ever buy baby food when it is so easy to make yourself.

review/text: I bought this for my daughter last night.  She was so excited, she opened the box, washed it and cut up a pear.  Within 10mins, we had fresh pear for her little one.  My grandson loved it.  It was so easy.  One push of a button and it did all the work, and made one weeks worth of fresh pear for my grandson.  Our first try, and we love it!  We can't wait to make more.

review/summary: Feel like a "real" chef
review/text: I have been buying the plum baby organics food pouches (which I still love) and thought I could try making homemade baby food to give my baby different combos of food that the pouches and other store brands didn't offer. I have had every machine (Baby Beaba, Baby Bullet and Baby Chef) and they were all returned. Finally I found the Brezza! Super easy to use, has a great steam option (which was what I missed in the baby bullet) and easy to clean. Couldn't be happier with this product and now I can make fun food combos. Also, I usually buy products from Amazon however this time I bought from Babies R Us.  They were running a special where if you bought the food maker you got the spatula and cutting board attachment for free.

review/text: I love this baby food maker.  It's easy to use and easy to clean.  Love the one step aspect of the machine.  Warning - you do need to make your baby's food well in advance because the food is piping hot when finished and you can't serve boing hot food to a baby.  But this machine works really well for my little one and she loves all the things I make versus the jarred stuff.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: 5.5 Month Update-DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!
review/text: NO MATTER HOW GREAT AN IDEA THIS ITEM SOUNDS LIKE, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!  After all the buttpain this product has already caused me (see below), a mere 6 days after receiving the replacement for the FIRST defective driveshaft, turns out THIS "NEW" driveshaft has the same problem!!!! It seized up, and will not allow the blade to turn. At least the first driveshaft had the decency to work for 3 months. Unbelievable that this product is still being sold on Amazon, I am positive I am not the only one this is happening to. Short of getting my money back, there's pretty much nothing Baby Brezza can do to make this right. Send me another driveshaft??? Yeah RIGHT!!!!<br /><br />>>ORIGINAL REVIEW>> Had no issues with the Baby Brezza until now (month 3). The mystery black stuff I read about in other reviews has started making regular appearances and the blade is starting to get stuck when blending for no apparent reason.  I really love what this product has allowed me to do (I make food in it to feed myself as well as my son!), but bummed that I'm encountering this problem which, from casual browsing of the other Amazon reviews, is not a rare manufacturing defect, but rather a design defect/quality control failure which causes a $100 piece of machinery to fail just a few months after purchase. Calling Baby Brezza customer service today to see how they can rectify this situation (thank god I saved the box).<br /><br />>>>UPDATE 25 April 2012>>> !!!!!IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR BREZZAS WITH LOT NUMBER MWI-001BRU!!!!!!!<br />After a few days of phone tag, the Baby Brezza rep contacted me and let me know that the particular lot number (look for that on the bottom of the base) of my Brezza was indeed having the issues I described, due to a faulty driveshaft.  The rep said they would "exchange"  my faulty drive shaft for a new one, but UNFORTUNATELY, the "new driveshafts" are STILL BEING MADE. And wouldn't be available to ship for approximately 5 weeks.  Their "consolation prize" was a free accessory (of course, I had already purchased most of the accessories back when I bought the Brezza!). Pretty damn inconvenient when you have a REALLY hungry 7 1/2 month old baby.<br /><br />So if you have this lot number, even if it's working now, I would definitely lean forward in the foxhole and get Baby Brezza to send you a replacement driveshaft. The fact that they didn't offer to send a whole new unit instead of making me wait 5 weeks, AND that they don't even have these new driveshafts yet, means to me that it may not only be this lot, but any other lot manufactured from July 2011 on that has the defective driveshaft.  SO BUYER BEWARE on this product if you haven't already bought one.  It's a fantastic concept, just bad, bad, bad quality control for the $$$cha-ching$$$$ it costs.<br /><br />>>UPDATE 15 MAY 2012>><br />Received a replacement driveshaft, blade and container (with lid) today, along with the "Sorry For the Inconvenience" gift of a food storage unit. It's been about 3 weeks since I spoke with the Brezza rep. Not bad, given the estimate she gave me was 5 weeks. Originally I was told only the driveshaft would be sent to me, so I'm pleased that I now have a backup container and blade!  I am satisfied, and have changed my rating, because I really do love what this product does!

review/summary: I Have Buyers Remorse!
review/text: I bought this from a brick and mortar baby supply chain, and I was so excited to use it! I peeled, I chopped, I steamed and pureed. I was so happy! Then I realized it took me all day to make one regular sized batch of baby food. Still, it was so easy to just throw it in and walk away, so I kept making my baby food, one tiny batch at a time. Then, the fourth time I tried to use it, it would not steam. The start, stop, and steam buttons do not work. I'd had the machine less than a month. Then I noticed (as I was dumping out my unused water) that there was a bunch of metallic looking crap floating around in the water chamber. Unfortunatly the box had been thrown away otherwise I would have just taken it back to the store. I emailed customer service and about a week later received an email that said "please provide us with a number to reach you". By looking at some more recent reviews I can see I'm not the only one having a problem with their customer service. The idea behind this product is amazing, the product itself is garbage. I don't understand for the life of me why they couldn't make the blender cup bigger than a coffee cup. Even if this product had worked beautifully I would have eventually gotten tired of making tiny batches. I've been using my food processor and steaming on the stove in a pot. It's more to clean up but I can make a large batch of baby food in much less time. I wanted to love this thing, I really did. It's just not worth the money.

Needless to say I was not happy and had to return it for a refund. Rather than buying another one and trying again, I'm going with another product altogether. Very disappointing but glad Amazon gave me a full refund!

review/summary: Great baby food maker and more
review/text: I really like using this product because it's very easy and convinient to use.  If you are serious about wanting to make your baby really good food this is the product for you. It may seem a little pricey but it's totally worth it. It's also great to make food for the rest of the family.  I've made veggie patties for the my family and they loved it. I would also reccomend that you purchase the flat spatula that is made for the Brezza so that you can easily get all the food out.  They cutting board would also make it easier to put the food in but it's not a must.  This would be a good product to put on your baby registry for sure.  You won't regret getting this product!

review/summary: Great product, great customer service
review/text: Although the machine I received initially did have a manufacturer's defect and would not blend, both Jolity (the seller of the product) and Baby Brezza responded with excellent customer service and a new one is being shipped to me as we speak. The little bit I played with the original one I received though, I can tell it's a great machine and I'm very excited to use it! I love the concept of one machine doing both the steaming and the blending without messing up a bunch of other machines. And I found that both my food processor and blender were too large to efficiently do a small batch of baby food. The size of the Baby Brezza is just right.

review/summary: What Happened?
review/text: I was elated to receive this as a gift, always wanting to prepare my own baby food. Looking at the reviews, it seemed like a fantastic buy. Upon first use, the plastic base holding the blades produced hairline fractures where food can now get lodged. The piece holding the blades is also supposed to be easily removed for food removal and cleaning; it's become harder to remove with each use and now is near impossible to separate from the shaft. The gray plastic, stains very easily; and now, after only a handful of uses, the plastic, hinged cap to the water reservoir snapped off. Approx 20% of the time, the device will steam and fail to blend.

review/summary: Good product, but what is that plastic/metallic smell and taste on food?!
review/text: I was really excited to buy this food maker and get started.  After steaming and pureeing just one thing I noticed a plastic/metallic smell.  I brushed it off to the product just having that new smell.  Washed it out again and pureed more food.  Then I happened to taste the food and it had a horrible plastic or metallic taste.  I tasted different batches of things I made with all having the same result.  So instead of the food having a natural taste as the product claims, it all tastes like plastic!  I have no idea what can be causing this problem.  Maybe it will go away with time, but I certainly don't want to waste a bunch of food to perform a trial and error test over and over again. Very disappointed in the end result.

review/summary: Don't leave home without it!
review/text: I love, LOVE, LOVE my Baby Breeza!  And, I spell it "Breez" because it truly is a "breeze" to use.  (Corny, I know.)  Honestly, it's the easiest machine to use, and what mom doesn't want "easy" in their routine?  Making homemade baby food can be a hassle because it's cumbersome, time consuming and tedious, but not with the Baby Brezza.  They don't exaggerate when they say, clean, peel, chop and then let the machine do the work.  It completely saves time by steaming and blending at the same time...genius!  The only time consuming part is cutting up the veggies/fruit.  But, I find it relaxing!<br /><br />I've used my machine a handful of times now, each time a success.  My 5-1/2 month old loves her food, and my 3-year-old likes being able to "help" by turning the machine on (with my supervision..of course).  I highly recommend this product to moms.  I just wish I had known about it with my oldest!  Stop debating and buy it...now!

review/summary: A Taste of New York
review/text: Joyva Chocolate covered Raspberry Jelly Rings<br /><br />If you grew up in NYC you took these things for granted.  At the cash register of every deli are sold small packs of candy made by the Joyva company of Brooklyn.  Although they may be more famous for their Halvah (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCY79G">Joyva Marble Halva Bars 12 Bars</a>) (an ancient Turkish confection, dating back 3000 years... according to the Joyva web site), I was always partial to their "Jell Rings".  Having long ago left New York I have found that these simple treats are scarcely found west of the Mississippi and certainly completely absent from my current home in the Pacific Northwest (this being attributed to the complete lack of any NY style delis in the Pacific Northwest).<br /><br />Having found these on Amazon was a pleasant surprise, but (as of the time of this writing) being only available from a 3rd party merchant with a somewhat steep shipping price put a damper on my enthusiasm.  The 5 pound quantity also gave me pause (that's a LOT of Jelly Rings!).  But my wife (possibly tired of my repeated search for and failure to find these anywhere) ordered this item anyway, and I am glad she did!  About 1 month now from the time they arrived, I am just finishing off the box (with some help from friends and co-workers with whom I have shared).<br /><br />These small (about 1-2" across) ring shaped candies consist of a firm purple "berry flavored" jelly covered in a dark chocolate shell.  The jelly is less tenacious than a gummy bear, but firmer than say jelly you would put on a PB&J.  I actually prefer to eat them on the cool side, which increases the firmness.  The dark chocolate pairs nicely with the jelly, giving a little bitter offset to the sweet jelly.  The chocolate itself is not the highest "quality" when simply considered against other chocolates.  The Kosher Parve rating means that these contain no dairy.... how does one make chocolate without any dairy :-).  But I put "quality" in quotes because ultimately it just tastes good, and that is what should matter.<br /><br />I've shared these with friends and co-workers and have received one of three responses:<br />1. These are good/OK...thanks<br />2. These are great!<br />3. Ugh...tastes sort of like cough syrup coated in chocolate<br /><br />I am obviously of the response 2 camp, but maybe you need a little NY DNA in you to have such a reaction.  Reaction 3 was not prevalent (but who knows how many response 1's were just being polite).  So in summary, I LOVE these things -- if you've never had them before you might want to try to find a smaller quantity before diving in to the 5lb box.<br /><br />Shipping and storage:<br />The box pictured on this page was packed inside a cardboard shipping box, with a single ice pack along side it.  When I received mine the ice pack had assumed ambient temperature, so I am not sure what good it did.  The rings in their original packaging box (pictured) are arranged in layers with cardboard between he layers... this is not a great travel arrangement and upon opening I found them somewhat jumbled and a bit damaged.  The damage was mostly flakes of chocolate that had been knocked off, but overall appearance was acceptable.  My take-away here is be wary of ordering these when the weather is hot as spending time in the warehouse/truck would not be good for them.<br /><br />So overall: 5 stars for the candy, -1 star for the shipping/price = 4 stars.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Warning: Dangerously Addictive
review/text: OK, I had actually heard about these things through the local supermarket that I currently work at, had seen them on display before, but never really paid much attention to them, except for when they were gone. Apparently they're only sold around holiday seasons around here for some odd reason.<br /><br />Anyway, I had read reviews that gave them high marks all around, and as soon as I saw these, I knew I had to try a box. So, after clocking out, I went and snagged a box, paid and immediately went to my car and opened that box. Needless to say, I was hit with a nice aroma, and had a feeling I was in for a treat. After I popped one into my mouth, and tasted it, I was hooked.<br /><br />The "jell" held within has a nice consistancy, it's comparable to those jelly orange slices that one usually finds in those Sathers 2 for 1 dollar packs, though flavor wise, it's way tastier than those suckers could ever hope to be. It's not too sweet, it has just the right amount of raspberry flavor to harmonize with the dark chocolate coating outside. Needless to say, that box that I bought? It did not make it home. Not even half way, that's how addictive these things are. You gotta give Joyva credit for staying kosher, and creating such a tasty treat.<br /><br />Without a doubt I'll be keeping my eye out for these badboys alot more now, and might even end up buying a big box for family get togethers. These are awesome, and definitely worth giving a shot.

When she lived in New York City I would go to the bodega and buy some to bring to her. I sent her these Chocolate covered jellies in the big box we see in the bodega. She was so happy she must have gone through the whole box within a week with the help of her room mate. I've been eating these jellies since I was a kid. It was so great to see the whole box for sale and to be able to send her the box for the holidays.

review/summary: Old Jelly
review/text: Product was old. The chocolate was brittle, stale and easily sheared off from the jelly. Not the Jelly Rings I remember from childhood.

review/text: As always Joyva is the BEST! My ONLY reason for not giving this a higher rating is the bottom layer was stale.  The rest was incredibly delicious!

review/summary: yuck
review/text: really awful! I got into my Passover candy early and am so glad, because if I bit into this during pessach, in eager anticipation of probably my only sugar/choclate fix for the week of Passover, I would cry upon tasting it. Manischevitz triple chocolate macaroons, on the other hand taste great.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I received the jelly rings upsidedown, so all of the rings were all over the place and alot of the chocolate was broken off!! I also thought that I would be getting 7 lbs. of rings, not 5 lbs. For that price, I could have paid a little more at my corner Ralph Rottens for fresh and unbroken rings!! What a disappointment!

review/summary: My cat won't eat anything else... that says it all! :)
review/text: I received TWO (2) 24-pack boxes of this product; not the 12-pack as pictured. The price is better than I get at the grocery store (Amazon Prime member).<br /><br />I've tried other brands of cat food, even the more expensive "healthier" brands; I even try the regular Whiskas. But, the Tender Bites is kitty's favorite! I can't get him to eat any other kind anymore. If I try, he refuses and turns to his dry cat food until I clean the dish and refresh with Tender Bites!

review/summary: makes the kitty's happy
review/text: I buy this products occasionally for my 5 cats, since they really like the taste.  I think it's a very good product, it's not filled with too many fillers, and it doesn't smell too strong. The biggest downfall with all of these Whiskas pouches is that they are messy to dispense, and it is very difficult to get all of the product out of the pouch.  I find I get the gravy all over my hands, not the biggest issue, but ewww.

review/summary: My cat loves Whiskas
review/text: We have six indoor cats, and they all have different likes.  Our siamese cat will only eat the Whiskas Tender Bites chicken.  That is the only flavor she likes, and it has to be the tenderbites.  She usually just likes the juice but will sometimes eat some of the food as well.  Why she only likes this one, I don't know.  Amazon is the only place I know to get the box of 24 in the chicken only.  I rated it five stars because she likes it!

review/summary: Messy and apparently undelicious
review/text: My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits.

review/text: To all you cats out there,<br />I love this food, my pet keepers feed it to me 4 times a day, I meow in protest if it's late. If asked I'll even sit on command so I can eat Whiskas morning, noon, and night!<br />Thank you for keeping them well supplied.<br />Stella<br />(typed by the Keeper)

review/summary: Not so Tender...and Very Dry
review/text: I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch. However, the pouch is quite stuff, so if you cat likes it, he will surely get enough to eat from this pouch. Also, the picture does not look like the product I was shipped.

review/summary: Cats are carnivores
review/text: Our older cat (14 years old) would only lick the juice from the bowl and let the chunks alone.  I've read since then that cats are carnivores and therefore should not be fed a grain-based diet.  So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled "grain free".  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better.

review/summary: Cats LOVE this flavor!
review/text: Even my most finicky cat LOVED this flavor.  The bowls are spotless after their meal!  I haven't been able to find this flavor by itself in the store, only in variety packs, and my cats don't like all the other flavors in the variety packs.  I'm willing to pay a little more to get a box of food I know they love!

review/summary: New formula - NO JUICES ???
review/text: This used to be my cat's favorite food.  But a couple of months ago, they changed the formula and now my cat won't touch it, and I know why.  Each of the four flavors says "in juices" after it.  But since the formula changed, there is absolutely no juice in this food.  The food comes out in one big dry clump.  The juice was my cat's favorite part.  I'll still by the other Whiska's flavors, but not this one.

review/text: If you subscribe, you save and you don't have to trek to the store to buy these bulky boxes. I thought purchased enough for a 2 months supply but no, my cats must not be felines because they have appetites like pigs. ;) I have to change my subscription so that they deliver more frequently.

review/summary: Instructions from Steve
review/text: I sometimes get notes from my cat Steve regarding his food, litter, toys etc. and I post them here. - - I know, its weird<br /><br />Dear Grocery Lady,<br /><br />Please don't think because I am of the feline persuasion that I did not see and understand the "buy 1 get 1 free" coupon I saw for this terrible food. In case you didn't get the hint that I don't like this and you should never bring it again, I threw up in your shoe as gentle reminder.<br /><br />You know I have a delicate digestive system and a discerning palate.  Stick to the cuisine I like....don't go rogue again!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Steve-the-cat  ,,,^. . ^,,,~
