review/summary: Barbara's Bakery Original Shredded Meat, 13-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)
review/text: I purchased the Barbara's Bakery Original Shredded Wheat for my pet goat to eat.  Lately, I've noticed that he's been putting on a lot of pounds due to eating high fat leather shoes and other junk he finds in the garbage.  Barbara's Bakery Original Shredded Wheat is pretty healthy and tastes good, at least that is what he tells me when he's not drunk.<br /><br />It is pretty basic Shredded Wheat, so it's cleaned up and nice.  Some people might be put off by the appearance of the Shredded Wheat, it looks like a 17th century buffoon wig or a haphazard pile of old textile fabric, a nest for blind moles, or even a coiled spider web.  I don't mind, I just put it in milk.  If you wear glasses, it'll just look like a white blur to you.<br /><br />If you suffer from dementia, or can't see that well, just a note to add, Barbara's Bakery Original is changing their logo and box covers.  Don't be alarmed if you get a new cleaned up Barbara's Bakery box that looks nothing like the old.  I did notice some Shredded Wheat all over the box, and I didn't even open it yet.  I hope it's still fresh.

review/summary: What more do you want?
review/text: I have a special place in my heart for foods that have exactly ONE ingredient, which is the case with Barbara's shredded wheat biscuits. I purchased a box recently as a result of finding a coupon in the monthly Whole Foods shopper, and couldn't be more excited. Excited about shredded wheat, you say? Yes! They taste amazing - I prefer mine with a little sugar, but I suppose you could leave it out. And the little rolled-up biscuits were super-fun to crush up in the milk. This food was perfect...I can't think of any way it could be improved. Thanks, Barbara!

review/summary: Great Start to the Day
review/text: This is a tasty, filling way to start the day.  I mix 1 biscuit with a cup of fruit and vanilla yogurt (whole milk yogurt - if you've only used low fat, try this and discover what REAL yogurt tastes like!) I prefer the original Post product - as do a number of the other reviewers -  but good luck finding it.  In the DC area, even the biggest grocery stores no longer carry it, presumably dedicating the shelf space to more sugar frosted breakfast candy.  Whole Foods carries this brand, but the price is comparable to Amazon's, I'm switching to subscribe and save on this item.

review/summary: Great Breakfast
review/text: I had never really had plain shredded wheat before and now that I am trying to maintain my weight and because of the fact that there is nothing like sugar or salt added to it, I felt like it'd make a good breakfast. I cut up one banana and some strawberries and put in two of the shredded wheat biscuits. I then poured cold fat free milk over it, soaking the biscuits to make them soft enough to pick at with a fork. The way the biscuits soaked up the milk is great, so delicious. And with a bite of banana and strawberries, how could you go wrong?

review/summary: Best Shredded Wheat biscuit on the market
review/text: I was drawn to this product because it contains zero amounts of sugar but the fiber count is just right too. The texture and taste are heartier than other shredded wheat products you may find down at your local Wally World.<br /><br />The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the packaging does not fully seal the food from air. Within the box, the biscuits are wrapped in thin paper packaging, 6 biscuits in each of three packages, that is glued in spots along the seam (not glued continuously) and in-between the spots of glue the paper is open and not fully sealed. The packaging really comes apart when you remove a couple of the biscuits for a serving. The glue is not strong, the packaging falls apart with handling and creates the need to store the remainder of biscuits from the opened package in your tupperware. Maybe these shredded wheat biscuits need to breathe but I do not think so. I have complained about this on Barbara's website and a company representative responded but as of yet, no action has been taken.

review/text: These biscuits(cereal) are about as true to natural as you can get.  No added sugars or sodium or anything else.  They aren't fortified with vitamins and minerals but you could always take a multi-vitamin if you wanted to.  They taste very good, and because of that, this is my second order.  I'll definitely buy again (as long as the price remains acceptable!).

review/summary: Not even close to real shredded wheat
review/text: Just did a side by side comparison to the original Post shredded wheat.  The post shredded wheat had a toasted wheat flavor while this tasted like raw uncooked flour.  The Post brand was also crispier and easier to chew.  If you look at each side by side, you can see why the products taste different.  The Post biscuits are made of thin, straight, parallel strands.  The strands in this product are thicker, crinkly, and are wrapped in a spiral.  The Post biscuits probably bake more efficiently.  I guess decades of experience does make a difference.

review/summary: The product is excellent but the packaging could be better
review/text: The product is excellent, but the biscuits are packaged in plain paper sleeves that are envelope-folded (not sealed) at each end. I'm sure it's environmentally friendly and would be fine if I had bought a single box. But I bought a carton of four.<br /><br />The paper packaging won't provide enough protection from the "critters" that invariably get into grain products that are stored for a while without the proper protection. I guess I'll store these away from my other grains and try to use them up quickly.

review/text: Good thing the folks at Cloud Star came up with a 4-pack bundle of Buddy Biscuits because your canine pals might not otherwise be willing to share!<br /><br />The Christmas holiday version of Buddy Biscuits is gingerbread-flavored and comes in beautiful shiny metallic silver and red packaging that makes each box ideal for gift-giving.  Humans will appreciate the all-natural healthy ingredients while our furry friends will just gobble them up with delight.  Free of corn, soy, sugar, salt, dairy, and egg.  Our three dogs enjoy the biscuits (in many flavors) all year 'round but the holiday version is especially fun.<br /><br />The holiday packs seem to sell out quickly on Amazon.  But don't despair.  Amazon always seems to bring in another delivery. In a hurry? You can simply go to the Cloud Star site and buy them there.  Only Amazon carries the 4-packs though.

review/summary: Not for Large dogs!
review/text: First let me begin by saying that this product is not an inferior one, my dog did seem to enjoy the bones. However, the bones are small and my dog had eaten 1 of them in about 30 minutes or less!<br /><br />I have a full grown male Boxer and these bones just aren't big enough. If you have a small dog, anywhere from a Pug to a Beagle you may be fine.<br /><br />I did see where the same company had 15' bones of the same type, I think I'll go that route. But like I said, my dog did seem to like them. Plus the delivery time was terrific and the price was very fair.<br /><br />The only reason I give this product 3 stars is because it is very misleading. When you see the word "Mammoth" you anticipate it being very large, it was not.

review/summary: Endurance Athletes Will Appreciate It.
review/text: I recently picked up a few bottles of Zico coconut water with pineapple at my nearby grocery store. I was curious. I used to be an endurance athlete and I've read about things like this. It's loaded with potassium and other electrolytes and is fairly low in sodium and sugars. It would make a good replentishment drink and some might suggest it for people who suffer from cramps. Well I find it very bland in taste. That's okay. It has pineapple flavor added, but it's so low as to be almost unnoticeable. I prefer to drink it ice cold and that seems to diminish the bland taste. It's an interesting product. Endurance athletes who sweat a lot will appreciate it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: The sauce is great, but the Juicer and process less so ....
review/text: The Back2Basics Manual Tomato Juicer is great conceptually but in execution less so.  Probably this is due to the price point ... it's "reasonable" but the manufactured pieces don't fit together well, and if you don't crank just right, the whole thing comes apart and all the juice currently in production will be all over the kitchen.  So, if you want just tomato juice, fine go for it -- it will be delicious but what with the aggrevation trying to put the contraption together, the horrific clean up process, and the time, you'd be better off spending big bucks and getting another product.<br /><br />Also, don't be fooled by the image.  The three strainers shown with the press are not included ... available at an extra charge.  That noted, I purchased the extras as I wanted a coarse salsa, which was fantastic, but given the investments noted above, still wish I'd spent the extra $$$.

review/text: A couple of years ago Barbara halted production of the Peanut Butter flavor Puffin.<br />I fell into a medium-deep depression (possibly withdrawal symptoms), sensing that my reason for rising was gone, impossible to replace.<br />To my relief, the company saw the error of its way, and it was back, albeit, sporting new packaging, and what seems to be a variable, Ounces per Box concept, (I have seen 11 and 15oz boxes.)<br /><br />The ONLY complaint I can register with this wonderful product is, of course, the intensity of the peanut butter flavor has dimminished quite noticeably.  This is NOT GOOD.  I would love to taste the taste, once again.<br /><br />Please bring back the peanut butter... go a little stronger.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is the finest breakfast cereal money can buy.  Thank you, Barbara!<br /><br />Richard Anderson  PS.  I fill a bowl half full with fresh-frozen blueberries, fill the rest of the<br />  bowl with B's PB P C, and moisturize with Organic Vanilla Soy Milk or<br />  Vanilla Rice Dream.

review/text: This is my all time favorite cereal, and I'm a cereal addict! I like to eat healthy and natural food and this fits both categories, a little more sugar than other things I choose but such a good treat and soooo much better than indulging in real peanut butter.

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: This is the worst cereal I have ever had. I hoped it would taste like Cap'n Crunch, but it was more on par with old cardboard. They taste like they could possibly be made of actual puffins. The texture is just as bad. The cereal stayed hard (not crunchy, hard) for quite awhile, then suddenly became very soggy and disgusting on the outside with a hard center. The ingredients are good, I'm not sure what went wrong with the final product but I would not recommend it.

review/text: I like this cereal.  I find it tasty and delicious.  I "Subscribe and save" this item.  I get 4 boxes every 2 months.  I eat the cereal and it nourishes me.  And it is less expensive on the internets via subscribe and save than I find it at my local stores.  This is the peanut butter variety. They have other flavors, but peanut butter is my favorite.  Why are you reading reviews on cereal?  Go spend a few bucks and buy a box in the brick and mortar store.  If you like it you can buy more here.  If you don't, maybe this cereal isn't for you.

review/summary: Gourmet Cereal AND Snack
review/text: I learned of this product from a Today Show Healthy Food segment. It's "all natural since 1971," "free of artificial flavors, preservatives and additives," and "whole grain oats and corn." Made with real peanuts. Per serving, the sugar content is low (6g), low fat, and serves as a good tasty snack.  No milk needed - I've even served these in a bowl as an appetizer snack.  I first bought them on Amazon, but I am now able to find them in the Healthy Food section at the grocery. I have purchased the Peanut Butter variety because that is the flavor that the Today Show recommended, so I have not tried the other flavors.  As a side note, they named their products after adopting a puffin and her name is Barbara. You too can adopt a puffin... [...]

review/summary: My 6yo LOVES these
review/text: My son is on a gluten (almost) free diet and he loves these things.  While they are not 100% GF due to the oat flour (which is controversial) and because they are processed in a plant where wheat products are produced as well, they will do for my son's diet purposes.  I have to put a limit on how many times a week he can eat these.  It is the ONLY cereal he eats with milk, so I thank Barbara's for that.  At least I can get some calcium in him now.

review/summary: A pretty good cereal with some room to improve.
review/text: So, I just picked up my first box of Peanut Butter Puffins. Overall, I'm satisfied. It has the not-to-sweet peanut butter flavor I was looking for. Two things surprised me. I guess just by looking at them had me expecting a texture similar to that of Cap'n Crunch... I have to quote an earlier reviewer's description of an "almost stale crouton." It wasn't enough to make the experience unpleasant, but it was noticeably strange. Second, the size of the pieces was much larger than I'd expected. Admittedly, I didn't look too hard at the box when I bought them, but I think a smaller sized piece would have made for a superior product. Still, pretty good, with the perfect amount of flavor.

review/summary: Such A Good Cereal.
review/text: I am always scouting out new and delicious vegan food. I have a weakness for cereal. I have seen this cereal and the other varities of it in many stores but was a little nervous to try it because usually a box would go for 3.50- 5.00 bucks a box and it would be a shame to hate it and waste the money.<br /> I figured by the ingredients that there kind of was no way i wouldn't like it. I like getting cereal with ingredients that i can read, a low amount of fat and sugar. I do not have the world's biggest sweet tooth so just a little sweetness for me goes a long way.<br /><br />This cereal is perfect. I feel the same way for the original and cinnamon verisons. They are large crunchy puffs that stand up well in soy or almond milk. They have a great peanut butter flavor while not being over the top sweet. I am glad to see this on amazon for much cheaper than what organic stores sell it for. I got it while it was on sale 4 boxes for 9.92, you seriously can not beat that for just about any cereal now a days. Try any of the Puffin cereals they all are great.

We can't begin to say how yummy this cereal is. My wife and I go through a few boxes a week, it is that good! Best of all, the ingredients are all natural! We try to eat as natural as possible, no high fructose corn syrup for example. This cereal is as natural as it gets, and the taste is awesome. I gave a bite to someone at my work and she said "Wow, this tastes like Reese's Pieces!". You get what you pay for, I'd recommend this to anyone!

review/text: Wow, I thought maybe I was the only one that was a freak about this cereal. :) Peanut Butter is by far the best flavor of Puffins in my opinion. The other flavors will stay on the shelf forever, but the Peanut Butter will be gone in a flash and then the stockers just slide the other flavors into it's old spot to cover the hole. Yeah, like I don't notice, oh I notice alright, I notice that I've been known to go to 3 or 4 stores looking for it. And now I've found it on Amazon. Oh happy days! :)

review/summary: Not Organic as advertised!
review/text: Amazon list this cereal as being certified organic. It is not organic! The company website only shows 4 of their many cereal products to be organic.  The use of the word "natural" means nothing as the ingredients in any "natural" product may be laced with pesticides,fungicides or hormones and made with genetically modified plants,fruits or vegetables. "Barbaras" the corporation is no more concerned about making the world a better place or protecting the environment than any of the other food conglomerates.It always comes down to profits. Make people think "Barbaras" is synonymous with organic products and then start selling "natural" products at inflated prices. Makes for a great profit margin by taking advantage of well intentioned, but ill informed, consumers.

review/summary: Wanted them to taste more peanut buttery (and another 1/2 star to make it 3 1/2)
review/text: Ok, I picked these up at my local Trader Joe's...they're not bad, but I have three issues that would cause me to pass these by next time:<br /><br />1. they just don't have enough of a peanut buttery taste. They're more like buttery corn muffins with a hint of peanut butter flavor. I do like that they are not overly sweetened, but it needs a bit more peanut butter flavor.<br /><br />2. The cereal isn't stale, but I like the way another reviewer stated the texture/crunch, sort of like a crouton that is just starting to go stale....<br /><br />3. The puffs are way too big. I can just about get only two or three in my mouth and milk is drooling out all over the place. But just putting one on a spoon isn't enough (I know, picky...).  Oh, and get ready for the scrappage of skin from the roof of your mouth. It's like sandpaper.  So I'm eating these now as a snack without the milk and spoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />So that sums it up.  I'm eating the cereal and enjoying it (albeit the last three comments), but next time, I'll pass. Might pick them up again if they go on sale, but I would be using it more as a healthy snack and not a cereal.

I don't know what percent cacao the chocolate is, but it is definitely not dark chocolate, as I had anticipated. It's very mute in flavor. I may order them for my wedding and put them at a candy bar though, because the price is great.

review/summary: Not that good...
review/text: I bought Sadaf Lime Juice Shiraz, pack of 6, because of the price and the convenience of getting six bottles delivered to my door.  We use a lot of lemon and lime juice, and I thought this would be a good deal with free SuperSaver shipping.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it just doesn't taste that great.  It's tart, but not distinctly lime flavored.  It almost tastes like artificial lime flavoring in water.  Maybe it's old, or just a cheap brand.<br /><br />I will probably use this when dehydrating or canning apples, potatoes or bananas, just to use it up.  These foods need to be coated with citric acid to keep them from turning brown.  I'm pretty sure we won't be using it in beverages or foods at the table.<br /><br />As a side note, Amazon shipped these bottles lying on their *sides* in a box with one small air pillow for packing material.  Two of the lids had come off in shipping, although the inner foil seal on the bottles kept them from leaking.  What a mess that could have been!

review/summary: Simply the best salsa you will ever get out of a jar.
review/text: Briefly: most canned tomato products (salsa, pasta sauce) have too much sugar and are nasty sweet. Sugar is for dessert, not tomato sauce. This salsa does not have that problem. This salsa has the perfect combination of spiciness, smokiness and thickness and tastes better than any other salsa I've had, canned or fresh. I've tried Jardine's other flavors and wasn't really keen on any of them. I buy four or five cans every time I'm at the grocery store--the Chipotle stack is almost always picked clean, while their flagship Texasalsa and Peach salsa are overflowing and sit there unbought for weeks on end. Clearly I am not the only person to know about this salsa. I have ended up driving miles away to a second grocery store when the first one is out of this. That's how addicted I am.<br /><br />This salsa on top of Garden Fresh Gourmet tortilla chips is perfection.

review/summary: Bonsai rock ... no garden!
review/text: Got the "garden" in the mail and discovered as soon as I opened it that there was a crack that ran from the top of the "rock" to the bottom. The rock was actually a lump of clay like any pre-school kid uses to make their hand print or an ashtray in class; not a "rock" at all. I followed all instructions to the letter. It has been a month since I planted the seed and still nothing. Total waste of money so far. I have planted another seed (leaving the first intact, just in case it is VERY slow to germinate) and will try for another month to 6 weeks. So basically, it didn't do as advertised; was nothing like what was advertised, and the only educational value to it was the lesson learned: Don't waste my money on stuff that I could build myself! Being a Bonsai hobbiest, I was sadly disappointed in this product. I expect better from Amazon.com!

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: This organic Haddock Chowder is delicious when made with whole milk or cream and butter plus lots of black pepper.  It is 90% (??) diced potatoes though.  I thought about adding more haddock but I really like this expensive fresh fish pan fried so I vetoed that idea.  It is a hearty soup that is very flavorful though a bit salty.  Being diabetic, I probably should not eat it since potatoes immediately turn into sugar when they hit the stomach acids.  I had hoped for more fish like the non-organic Snow's Fish Chowder has (a large block of fish usually).  But if you like chowders, this one is loaded and hearty........ and very flavorful.  I'll try it again but not too often since it is basically potatoes and therefore 'sugar'!<br /><br />Addendum:  Once I started eating from the second case of this soup that I bought in one purchase, I definitely noticed that there was a LOT more Haddock.  Maybe the first case of 12 was the 'end run' or made by error because comparing the two cases is like night and day.  If the second case is the norm then I really find this soup to be fantastic.  It's actually loaded with Haddock......taste wise and visually!  When I buy more I'll have to see what actually is the norm.....high potato with little Haddock or a good quantity of Haddock.  Wolfgang Puck's soup have the same problem.....one case will be loaded with veges and/or proteins while the next case is nothing but flavored cream.  I will be buying these again though!

I have ordered other products that were "Fish Chowder" only to find they used fish, other than Haddock in their chowder.  When I found this, I was thrilled to find it.  If you want Fish Chowder that has Haddock in it, don't order this item.  When you receive it, it is Look's Atlantic brand Premium FISH CHOWDER, not HADDOCK CHOWDER.<br /><br />I bought this based on the label saying Haddock, and the other reviewer talking about how much Haddock it had in it.  I was disappointed to find it has Alaskan Pollack in it instead of Haddock.  Believe me it doesn't taste the same.<br /><br />If you do buy this product...be warned, you cannot return it.  For some reason, Amazon.com will not allow this to be returned, even though it is shipped from and sold by Amazon.com.

review/text: My son, my husband and I can not eat anything with gluten in them. My husband and I felt so sad constantly telling my son that he couldn't eat his favorite foods anymore. When we tried other gluten free products, the flavor and texture were just not acceptable. Nuffins saved the day! These products are even better then gluten containing products! The texture and flavor are amazing and they come with very clear directions. Thank you Nuffins for bringing joy back to our grocery list!

review/summary: Non-returnable product
review/text: I held off on purchasing this item for a long time because the dimensions of the product were not mentioned in the description.  I tried asking but never got a response.  Recently after seeing the price had gone down I decided to risk it and just purchase it thinking that if it's not the size I needed I could just return it.  I was wrong!  I recieved it- found out all the info that was lacking in the description and then when I tried returning it I was told that this product is not returnable!  Last time I ever purchase something that doesn't have dimensions listed.  I also find it really weird that every person that has reviewed this item has ONLY reviewed dilmah products and nothing else.  The product seems fine and the box is good quality as far as I can tell, but I'm dissapointed that I had to buy it to find out basics about it and then find I can't return it.<br /><br />The box is about 9&1/4" x 6&3/4" x 2&3/4" the tins inside each carry anywhere between 1/2 an ounce to an ounce of tea each and each tin is about 2.5 inches high and less than 2" in width.<br /><br />20 grams of earl grey<br />10 grams of chamomile<br />10 grams of silver tips (white)<br />20 grams of rose with french vanilla (black)<br />20 grams of italian almond  (black)<br />20 grams of keemun special (black)<br />20 grams of nuwara eliya pekoe (black)<br />15 grams of moroccan mint (green)<br />20 grams of ceylon young hyson (green)

review/summary: Learning About Tea
review/text: I'm a coffee drinker and over the years I've leaned a lot about what I like and what I don't like when it comes to coffee.  Tea was something Mom gave us when we were sick and it was alway's Lipton's.  But age has its disadvantages and one of them is that drinking coffee all day is no longer a good idea.  A couple of years ago, I decided to limit my coffee consumption to early morning and try tea for the rest of the day.  This decision was prompted, in part,  by the discovery that green tea is a wonderful beverage and reputedly good for me.  However, after drinking a lot of green tea, I wanted to expand my knowledge of other varieties.  It's an adventure.  A real high point in my road to discovering very good tea was my purchase of the Dilmah presentation.  These little tins don't have a lot of quantity but the quality and variety are suburb.  Once I tasted their white tea, I knew I'd never go back to the supermarket variety.  I've already ordered the white in quantity.  I fell in love with Jasmine teas, in general, for the aroma but this challenged by the intoxicating scent of Dilmah's Italian Almond.  I tasted each of the teas and none of them have been a disappointment.  I'm trying all the varieties again to decide which ones to buy in bulk (although I only needed one taste of their white tea to make that decision.)  This little box is a treasure.  Hope you like it as much as I did.

review/text: Great for bread dipping and also for seasoning. I love to use the Rosa Maria flavor on potatoes for a wonderfully delicate rosemary taste. Also the Parmesan Blend to flavor noodles and/or pasta. Sometimes I just open 2 or more sections at the same time and shake away - gives an interesting flavor combination. I gave one of these to my daughter and her family with a nice bottle of olive oil and a set of the dipping dishes. Makes a nice gift and they're also hooked now. Wonderful product. I bought my original container in a gourmet kitchen store. So glad to find that it's now available on Amazon.

review/summary: Disappointment about size portrayed
review/text: I am familiar with Dean Jacobs bread dipping seasonings and normally pay $6.00 for a bottle that is 5 inches in height.  The picture displayed on Amazon appears to be this size, and the shipping weight was 1.8, which seemed to be about right, so I ordered 2 bottles.  When they arrived I was very disappointed to find that there were about half the height and appeared to be mini bottles.  In other words 2 bottles equal one of the bottles I usually buy for $6.00.  Therefore I paid $20.00 for half the amount.  Next time I will shop more carefully and question the picture display as to accuracy.  Very unhappy about the price, but the product is good.

review/text: This is my third Leonard Mountain soup product and all of them have been delicious. This is perhaps my favorite. Very simple to make, seasoned well, and the pasta ends up tasting great. Just add your favorite chicken (we pre-cooked ours a little), bring to a boil, then add the pasta. We did as suggested add more water near the very end and this helped. Even adding the additional water this makes 4 servings at most.<br /><br />As to the trans fat. I went directly to the website and the soup is listed as having zero trans fat. But the box is outdated. This makes a great tasting chicken soup, quickly and easily. Recommended.

That is the only flavor she likes, and it has to be the tenderbites.  She usually just likes the juice but will sometimes eat some of the food as well.  Why she only likes this one, I don't know.  Amazon is the only place I know to get the box of 24 in the chicken only.  I rated it five stars because she likes it!

review/text: My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits.

review/text: Our older cat (14 years old) would only lick the juice from the bowl and let the chunks alone.  I've read since then that cats are carnivores and therefore should not be fed a grain-based diet.  So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled "grain free".  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better.

review/summary: too expensive
review/text: Although I like the convenience of the food and my cats like the taste the 24/$15 is more than 50% over what I pay even at Petsmart. I was going for the convenience of monthly shipments, but the premium price is too high.

review/summary: Love the product - question the price
review/text: I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.  I get the 24 count variety pack for $9.49 at my local Food Lion grocery store.  I would expect a 48 count pack to be no more than double that price (18.98) so $28.11 would seem a bit high.  Unless of course  48 means 48 - 12 pack boxes.  Then the description needs  a little work.

review/summary: wow
review/text: This product is excellent. I have ahd an overactive bladder for years- since I was a teen. but this tea really works. I went from not being able to hold my bladder for only a little over an hour- bot being able to hold myself for up to 3 hours. This means I can watch an entire movie without losing out on bits and peices of it-- or stay for the whole chruch service. I highly recommend it. I intend to comtinue using this porduct as long as it is available.

review/summary: Bell Lifestyles Bladder Control Tea
review/text: I purchased this product from Amazon and was very satisfied with delivery of the product but very disappointed with the product as it did not live up to its promise of helping in bladder control.  After two weeks of use my wife found no improvement in her bladder control, so I gave the product one star for prompt delivery but the product was<br />a complete disappointment.<br /><br />migem
