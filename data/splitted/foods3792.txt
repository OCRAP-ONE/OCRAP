review/summary: Not that great
review/text: You're much better off scooping the loose leaf stuff at your local Wegman's or something. This stuff is OK, but it's just not that great. A couple of the sweeter flavors that came in mine were just gross to me. Also, maybe they've changed the product design, but the ones I received look nothing like the picture.

review/summary: can't cook without it...
review/text: i don't know how people cook without white pepper. it's not popular enough to be stocked in large containers in most ordinary supermarkets, usually found in very small containers. at my local supermarket, it's about 55 dollars a pound, which makes this choice at amazon a great value.

review/summary: Tastes like Grandmothers Swedish Meatballs
review/text: Growing up New Years Day was at Grandmothers. The whole family was there and Grandmother did all the cooking. The main attraction was an extremely large pan of Swedish Meatballs (homemade of course..not mixes) and a large bowl of mashed potatoes. This mix is as close to her meatballs as you can get. Just add some creamy beef gravy and you have it all. It's excellent!!

review/text: I love this Sweedish Meatball mix and am so glad I found it on Amazon!! I used to live in a different state where it was sold in the grocery stores and ever since I moved to the Midwest, I haven't been able to find it anywhere. It's such a yummy, easy way to make a delicious homemade meal in under 30 minutes and they come out perfect EVERY time! As always, Amazon shipped it super-fast to my house and we've been enjoying them for dinner ever since. The package is the perfect size - 12 boxes. Enough to make the meal about once per month so 1 box of this product could last you an entire year!! Totally worth it. I thoroughly recommend it for the busy mom who still wants to put good food on the table.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVUQAW">Smokehouse 26015 Chicken Barz 16oz Resealabe</a><br />Be careful when selecting Chicken Barz from Smokehouse.  It is not the same as the product that I usually purchase from local pet stores.  These strips are full of tough sinewy pieces which my dog has problems digesting. There is another product from Smokehouse with the same name, but different item number.  It is also priced much higher and is probably the same product found in pet stores. The next time that I purchase Smokehouse products from Amazon, I'll make sure to order the more expensive item.

review/text: I have 2 dogs.  A Chow and a Berner.  These Smokehouse Chicken Barz make the Chow sick everytime she eats one. She throws up within 30 mins of eating a strip. I no longer give them to her. She has never had a problem with other chicken strip brands. My Berner has absolutely no problem with them at all.  She loves them and they never upset her stomach.  It probably depends on the dog.

There are 120 calories per cookie and only 5g of sugar, and filling enough so that 1 is enough for a great little treat.  They are individually wrapped, so you don't have to eat the whole box before they go stale, unless you want to ;)  And the best part is, they have chunks of roasted almonds scattered about that are a delight when you hit one.

Nope, none to be found!  Lots of saffron and yellow rices, some spicy rice with beans, but I couldn't find any spicy saffron rice on it's own.  This has a good texture, and a wonderful spicy taste - without being "overly" spicy.  Now I order enough to qualify for free shipping - and don't have to worry about it going bad.

review/summary: Not quite gluten-free
review/text: It's always exciting to find a new gluten-free product to try, but this one tanked. The label had been updated to indicate it was produced in a facility with wheat, versus the dedicated facility label the product indicates on the website. I wasn't too concerned because my daughter eats plenty of foods that are produced in facilities with ingredients she can't have and never has any problems. BIG mistake this time. Within an hour of eating these cookies, she had the telltale migraine and subsequent vomiting that is consistent with when she accidentally ingests gluten. Stay away from these cookies if you are following a strict gluten-free diet.

review/summary: Dry, not so interesting cookies
review/text: These are great in many ways. They are gluten free, egg free, and refined sugar free. They use sweeteners with a low GI. I usually make my own GF cookies, but we were travelling and wanted some snacks. The cookies are dry, with an effort to be soft and chewy, and lacking in flavor. I'd really expect more from a box of cookies that cost us $5.75 for 12 little cookies. I generally love the Mary's Gone Crackers products (namely their crackers) and think perhaps they should stick to crackers and not venture into cookie land. I did try them with a little Coconut Bliss ice cream and it was a little more tolerable, but still weird in the texture department. For some yummy gf cookies that can easily be made while travelling I'd suggest the vegan chocolate chip cookies from Elana's pantry. My 3-year-old daughter, who hasn't had much experience with cookies, thinks they're quite fine. Really, they're not *bad,* they're just not too exciting.

The taste is nothing special, a little too chewy and dry, but for me the huge down-side was an awful skin reaction; hive-like itchy outbreak within 30-45 minutes of eating these.  I do have some food allergies, but saw nothing on the label that concerned me.  I will be working with my allergist to try to determine the problem.  Meantime, I am not planning to touch these cookies again.

review/summary: Good concept, bad taste
review/text: Lots of negatives about these cookies, even though they look great and have some great potential.<br /><br />First thoughts: Price high, small package, and cookies look dry and are somewhat small in size.<br /><br />Taste: Bars have a dry mouthfeel, too fluffy and dried out versus moist and chewy. Very weird unpleasant, overpowering, nutty-flowery taste. Perhaps from the amaranth, quinoa, and/or old coconut oil? Could use some cinnamon or something to enhance the baked oatmeal flavor.<br /><br />Only compliments--uses natural ingredients, contains a lot of raisins, which are nice. I like how they use palm sugar and tapioca syrup for natural, more low-glycemic alternative sugar-sweeteners.<br /><br />Overall these are not worth getting again, unless the other cookies (Ginger, Choc Chip...) are an improvement. Similar concept to Enjoy Life gluten-free cookies, but Enjoy Life's so far taste better.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy
review/text: Since reading some horrid stories about how some pet foods are made (when meat by-products are listed among the ingredients, it is usually from questionable sources, gross at best, dangerous for the pet at worst), I have decided to look for a healthier option. I found Merrick cat food by chance and was impressed by the list of the ingredients they use (here are the ingredients for the flavor Grammy's Pot Pie, my cat's favorite):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Broth, Turkey Liver, Fresh Red Jacket New Potatoes, Fresh Carrots, Fresh Snow Peas, Fresh Whole Red Delicious Apples, Potato Starch-modified, Olive Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Tricalcium Phosphate, Cassia Gum, Carrageenan, Flax Seed Oil (For Omega -3), Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary) Choline Chloride, Salt, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols, Vitamin E Supplement, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Zinc Amino Acid Complex, Iron Amino Acid Complex, Manganese Amino Acid Complex, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Copper Amino Acid Complex,d-Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Acetate, Niacin, Lecithin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide, Cobalt Glucoheptanate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin,Thiamine Mononitrate, Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />If you pay attention to the first ingredients, you will see that there are no meat by-products or grains, a cheap filler used by many companies that produce dog and cat food.<br /><br />My cat really likes this food. It comes in many other flavors, and she seems to enjoy pretty much all the ones I have offered her.<br />What also makes me like this food is that it does smell a lot better that any 'supermarket' pet food. The meat flavors smell like meat and the fish ones smell like fish, but in a disturbing, pungent way. Also you can see small pieces of vegetables with the meat, which my cat also likes and that are good for her.<br /><br />Sure, this food is a little more expensive than other products, but all in all it's well worth it. A must have -your cat will thank you!

I would recommend this great cat food to all cat owners.  Take a look at the labels - it's all real food product you can identify and it's made by a family owned business with great quality control.

review/summary: Best cat food available
review/text: I did tons of research on what cat food would be the best option for my cat after losing 2 cats to liver and kidney failure. I think this happened due to tainted pet food, so I wanted to do better for my surviving cat. The main problem with most of the good brands out there is that they are canned at the same plants as the poor quality products. Not so with Merrick. They have their own facilities and use all human grade food ingredients. I highly recommend the variety pack to start your cat out on this food. Be patient in switching your cat over, it is similar to taking a child who has eaten nothing but fast food, and transition them to healthy meals. Be sure to break the solid food up thoroughly and mix it well with the broth. If they still are uninterested, try mixing a small amount with their regular food. It took a few days, but once he really got a taste for it, he now doesn't want to eat his old food! I still tapered it off gradually, but I have had to go to his most favorite flavors of the old food to do it. The most popular flavors of Merrick for him have been Cowboy Cuisine and New England Boil, I recommend starting with those 2 flavors. Be aware you may see a few cooked blood vessels here and there in the ones with beef (looks almost like pasta), but this is a good thing. This shows that the food has been made with whole cuts of beef, not meat sludge.

If the cats had been enthusiastic about this food, I would have felt good about feeding it to them, though.

review/summary: My Siberian kitten loves it
review/text: I have a Siberian kitten who is now 23 weeks old.  I brought her home when she was just 7 weeks old.  At first she resisted eating the Merrick foods - I think they were a little rich for her tummy, but now she loves them.  I had her on a combination of Blue Buffalo kitten kibble and assorted canned foods for the first few weeks that I had her.  She loved the dry from the get-go, but it was a challenge to find a wet food that she'd consistently eat.  Around 14 weeks old she suddenly started throwing up her kibble and at the same time she also had dander and was often itchy.<br /><br />Because of those problems, I made the decision to remove the dry kibble from her diet and try transitioning her to a raw diet.  That worked out so-so.  She will occasionally eat raw lamb medallions but overall, she's not that big on raw food, at least not yet. She's still quite young, so I'm willing to keep trying. I also eliminated all foods/treats with wheat gluten and corn.  She's now a great little eater and the Merrick canned foods are her preferred choice.  If I asked her, I'm sure she'd say that New England Boil is her absolute favorite with Grammy's Pot Pie right behind it.  I try to avoid feeding her fish more than 3 times a week, so she gets more of the chicken/turkey/beef selections.  So far she likes them all.<br /><br />Her dander is long gone, as is the itching, and her fur is as soft as can be.  She eats every bit of food in her dish which is a huge improvement over the early weeks when I was tossing out more uneaten food than she was consuming.<br /><br />Merrick food is a bit pricier than the ones found in grocery stores, but the quality is far superior too.  I like knowing that I'm feeding my fur baby the best.

review/summary: Very nice sipping vodka
review/text: Many of us have experienced vodka from our youth, where it was popular for mixed drinks.  Having good taste was about paying a little more to minimize the impact in the morning.  We wouldn't notice the taste differences when used for mixed drinks, or drunk as frozen shots, often drunk quickly.<br /><br />We went to a vodka tasting recently that featured 5 vodkas of varying prices and made from different ingredients.  We sampled them straight up / neat, one at a time.  The best of the lot was the Karlsson Gold.  Yes, it was a tasting sponsored by Karlsson, but it had a good selection of other vodkas, including one we had been buying, but I was impressed enough that we bought a bottle to enjoy at home.<br /><br />The flavor from the Swedish potatoes is quite good.  There is more flavor than just the vaguely sweet flavor I find in vodka.  It is difficult to describe, but I imagine that someone who appreciates dry brandies might enjoy it.<br /><br />Because this is about flavor, you would not use Karlsson Gold in mixed drinks.  You probably would not taste the difference, and it costs more than less flavorful but otherwise good brands.<br /><br />These are first impressions.  I'll update the review in a few months, or when the bottle goes dry, whichever comes first, and give my thinking then.

review/summary: Premium quality, premium taste.
review/text: In fact, in Japan these rice would cost about $50.  But before you think most California short grain is the same, you need to try this or koshihikari.  If you don't want to spend $30 (locally sell here for around $25) then some stores sell them in small container for under $10.<br /><br />What's different about tamanishiki, koshihikari and other popular Japanese premium rice?  The grain is even shorter than regular short grain rice people are used to in the USA.  The texture is more 'plump' while the rice glitters with a very natural sweetness you don't normally get with regular American short-grain.  It has a very subtle bite on the outer layer.<br /><br />WASH your rice.  I don't know why this isn't stressed in the bag anywhere.  It's a standard procedure to wash the rice with cold water 3-4 times then fill the bowl and let the rice sit for 20 minutes.  If you're using a rice cooker you'll know this 20-minute wait time makes a difference.  I'll usually dump the water again and fill to the appropriate level and turn on the rice cooker.<br /><br />Try it for yourself though; the price will seem much cheaper when you eat these premium rice and why it's used at home and almost all Japanese sushi restaurants that offer quality sushi and dinner.  You won't be able to go back eating the regular $12 bag of 20-lb rice sold at your local grocery store.

review/summary: Pretty tasty rice
review/text: I like this rice.  It's nice to have a big bag like this, it's more efficient this way, less trips to the store.  I bought this in combination with the zojirushi 3 cup rice cooker, and it's a fantastic combination.  Although you can cook any kind of rice in the zojirushi, this rice tastes really good.  Just make sure you rinse the rice.

review/summary: the perfect rice!!
review/text: I cooked this rice in my rice cooker with hesitation thinking that it wasn't going to come out well, but it was the other way around, just perfect and in no time, i used the measurements fron cook book "SUSHI TASTE AND TECHNIQUE" that I purchase here in amazon as well, fantastic book by the way, highly recommend it. Here you go just for fun: 1 1/3 cups Japanese shot grain rice, 1 1/2 cups of water and this is for the mixture that goes into the all done rice to make it sticky and glossy and tasty of course. I almost forgot, make shore you washed the rice before you cook it at list 4 to 5 times, very important!!.<br />Okay back to the review, the rice just comes out perfectly done all the time!!, i havent cook it in the stove yet because i dont need to but im shore the results are the same, nothing more to say. Good luck!!

review/text: This rice is great.  I used to live in Japan and have become a serious rice connoisseur.  This rice is as good as the stuff served in Japanese restaurants.  A good short grain that is sticky, fluffy and very filling.  It is great for sushi, but also just a bowl of rice, curry or any other way you could want to eat it.  This rice is a little more expensive than other rice in this category, but it worth the cost.  I make it in a rice cooker and it always turns out great, washed or just straight cooked.  &#36229;&#32654;&#21619;&#12356;&#12424;&#12290;

review/text: I love this product, My friend who is a associate of mine brought a Dish we all called sticky Rice.<br />We use the Short Grain Rice Product only to put in the Rice Cooker when making this, 2 Cups of Premium SHORT Grain Rice only ( Short Grain Rice is better for you and healthier ) 1/2 Cup of this Mizkan Base into the Rice Cooker along with your 1 and half cups to 2 cups water to cook depending on your taste, When Rice Cooker is finished you can Add a  Bag of Fresh Peas to Blanch Steam in with them and Stir. Its a lovely side dish and delicious. Enjoy<br /><br />This is awesome served with a piece of Grilled Chicken or Mesquite Chicken, Or just serve it by itself.

review/text: My love for the raspberry taste has been combined with a low glycemic sweetener. I use this product to sweeten and add taste to hot tea and iced tea. I always use it as syrup on my gluten-free pancakes -- some times alone and other times mixed the the Madhava maple agave nectar. I highly recommend this product. I love it so much that I added it to my subscribe and save list of products at Amazon. com. That way I know I'll always have a steady supply since I can't buy it locally in rural New Mexico.

review/text: I got this for my kids.  It looks like the mini versions of the bins you see in the store and the scooper gives the perfect amount for the little ones.  However, the container itself always falls apart.  It's built like a puzzle where all the pieces just pop together, nothing is sealed.  I might just get a glue gun to seal the places that don't need to open for a refill or to scoop out of.  Very disappointed!

After switching over to Merrick's Before Grain, wet and dry food, my cats are thinning out nicely!  Their energy level has also increased and they look like they are feeling really good.  So glad I made the switch!  It feels good to know that I am doing the best for my cats and their health....along with seeing the results.

review/summary: Probably Great - IF They'll Eat It!
review/text: I have five cats, and none of them would eat this, just as another poster said, even when it was the only thing in their bowls, and they were really hungry. In the past, maybe A & C would NOT eat a certain food, B & E would, for a couple days, then no, but D would, etc (in all possible permutations!)<br /><br />I had been feeding them Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Cats Indoor Hairball Control Chicken Formula, which all of them ate. But Diamond Naturals recently had a recall, I think it was salmonella, and now this is no longer available at Amazon. I do not want it anyway, if it is dangerous for the kitties!<br /><br />So now I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVLAKI">Purina Cat Chow Naturals, 13-Pound</a>, and all the little darlings are eating it, day after day.<br /><br />I have read up on cat food (including that vet who buys frozen rabbit and makes her own cat food, etc), and if I could, I would feed mine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A8R2UY">Wysong Dry Diets Epigen Pet Food 8 lb</a>, but right now, I just can't afford it.

review/summary: Cats love it
review/text: I have two female Siamese kittens who love this food. When they get into the closet where I keep it, they chew through the bag. They are mostly on a canned food diet, though they still get a little dry food each day in a food ball (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CG40O">PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball, Blue</a>), and they love it. They always come running when they hear the rattling of the food in the ball (if they're not already there watching me fill it up). I have the chicken and salmon dry foods, and though they love both, they seem to like the salmon slightly more. Unfortunately, the salmon is a bit more smelly. I definitely plan on purchasing this product again.

review/summary: Good Cat Food, Great Price
review/text: This cat food has good, natural ingredients and is obviously grain-free.  My cats don't absolutely love it, but they like it well enough, but my cats are moderately picky eaters.  The only reason I can't give this food 5 stars is because it contains 36% protein, some argue this is ideal, but most vets I have spoken to say the higher the better (cats are carnivores, after all).  There are other brands with higher protein, but they are more expensive.<br /><br />On a note from ordering on Amazon, it was through "PetFoodDirect," which sent me a 3.3 pound bag instead by mistake, but without any hassle they fixed the problem by sending me the correct order and letting me keep the mistake bag, so you know you are safe when ordering from them (well, you always know your safe when ordering from Amazon).<br /><br />Do the right thing! Buy better cat food like Merrick's!

review/text: These cookies look just like vanilla wafers only thicker and softer.  The Peanut butter flavor smells just like peanut butter and drives my dogs crazy.  As soon as I open up the jar, they come running.  And they are much softer than any dog biscuits I have ever fed them.  They are easy for any dog to eat, especially older dogs, little dogs or my Shar-peis that have a lot of extra skin, especially around the mouth.  It is their favorite breakfast treat, afternoon snack or after dinner desert.<br /><br />Made from all human quality ingredients, just like I would have baked if I had the time, I know I am giving my dog a healthy and satisfying treat.  Just like all Three Dog Bakery products!

They are not super hard, they have a bit of softness to them, so it's not all "crunchy crunchy." They are a nice size for my medium-sized dog. It's the only way she'll let me trim her nails--offer her a treat, and she'll lay there until I finish and give her a Woofer. Gotta love that!
