review/summary: Great chocolate flavor
review/text: This coffee smells great first thing in the morning, if you occasionally enjoy a flavored coffee.  The chocolate is a rich addition to the good, medium-bodied coffee, with plenty of morning caffeine.<br /><br />I enjoy my coffee with plenty of hot milk and a bit of raw sugar (like a latte), made with my Aeropress <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS">AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>.  This made a fantastic cup of coffee with just the right touch of chocolate, and no artificial flavor notes.  I brewed the coffee the way I normally do with two huge Aeropress scoops of coffe, and water at 175 degrees for 30 seconds; then I lowered the plunger. Mmmmmm.  A perfect cup of extra-good latte, and a shot of chocolate flavoring.

review/summary: Great flavored coffee!
review/text: Actually, I usually don't care for flavored coffees. I always *think* I'll like them and then am usually disappointed by the funny aftertaste or they all sort of have the same hazelnutty generic flavor. Not this one. We loved it. I will buy this again, especially for gifts. The chocolate flavor in this harmonizes with--not competes with--the excellent coffee flavor. I like it with cream. No funny aftertaste.

review/summary: Good coffee, good chocolate: what's not to like?
review/text: The fragrance of this dark chocolate truffle coffee is almost worth the purchase price all by itself. The coffee is flavorful without being bitter, and the chocolate is evident without overwhelming the coffee. Some chocolate tends to settle to the bottom of the cup, but that didn't bother me. Overall, it's a fine experience in flavored coffee.

review/summary: Disappointing flavor
review/text: Gevalia is known as a great coffee, but I was a little disappointed with this particular blend/flavor. With a name like "dark chocolate truffle" I would expect to taste chocolate, but I didn't. There is a smell of chocolate in the air when it is being made, but not enough actually in the coffee when drinking it. I guess I am a chocolate snob because I want something that says 'chocolate' to actally taste like chocolate, but this particulalr coffee just did not do it for me.

review/summary: A bit disappointing
review/text: I normally like Gevalia coffees and with this flavor, the coffee portion itself is good. The chocolate portion is in itself a little bitter and the bitterness seems to get a little worse as an aftertaste. Gevalia unflavored coffees have always received a positive response from me, but i will stay away from their flavored coffees if this is any indication.

review/text: I was looking forward to a rich chocolate taste in my coffee, but I was NOT impressed with this one.  The coffee came out sour, and no matter how much sugar I added to my cup of coffee, it still had a very sour chocolate taste.  I've since added a tablespoon or so to our full pot of coffee just to use it up, and it's okay that way, but I'd soon as rather not have it included, quite frankly!

review/summary: It's ok....
review/text: I opened the package, sniffed and noticed a definite artificial cocoa smell.  It wasn't offensive, just not mouth-watering.  I love coffee and chocolate so was disappointed. I have tried Gevalia coffee beans (whole) in the past and they have been pretty good.<br /><br />I brewed using the suggestions on the box:  1 rounded tablespoon for every 6 ounces of water.  I use the "pour over" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is really only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I used cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter and manual drip coffee filter.  I heated the water to boiling then used my instant read thermometer to make sure I had the correct water temp.  Then just pour the water over the ground beans.  There was some crema (the beautiful reddish brown foam) developing - not a lot but this is pre-ground and flavored coffee, so I didn't expect a lot.<br /><br />It smelled like good strong coffee but with a chemical background.  The artificial odors are not appetizing.  Tasted like strong coffee (which I like), only slightly bitter but again that artificial taste.  Then I tasted it with cream.  It was definitely better.  The cream seemed to cover up some of the fake chocolate flavor.<br /><br />It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  If you are a flavored coffee drinker, you might like this brew. Would I purchase it in the future? Probably not. But I will finish this package and I wouldn't say no to a cup at a friend's house.  When I want chocolate coffee, I will brew a pot of unflavored coffee and add my favorite chocolate syrup and cream.

review/summary: a chocolate lover's coffee...
review/text: I could smell the chocolate wafting through my house on Sunday morning as the coffee brewed and hoped that it would taste as good as it smelled.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised that it was just as delicious.  Now, caution to those that are not big flavored coffee drinkers....this one may not be for you.  I love coffee, flavored, not flavored, with sugar, black if I must, just caffeinate me, and make it a nice cup of good coffee.<br /><br />This coffee was delicious for Sunday, but would also be a lovely dessert coffee with a bit of cream and sugar.  I drank it black with sugar and it was a nice rich cup of coffee.  Very smooth, and as I sit writing this I am just enjoying the scent of the dark chocolate.  I do love a coffee that I gives me a full experience, good scent, good flavor and that leaves me satisfied.<br /><br />I would definitely like to try more of their coffee flavors in the future.

review/summary: Great coffee with plesantant choclate aroma
review/text: Gevalia coffee has been popular as coffee for subscription for years. Its quality has been quite good. I am glad to see it comes up with chocolate flavor. The chocolate flavor smells really good when brewing. You won't taste any chocolate though. That probably explains why it is "artificial flavor". I think it would go well with desserts. I still prefer my regular coffee in the morning. But I don't mind having this for special occasion to add a little bit of surprise.

review/summary: So-so
review/text: I enjoy flavored coffees.  I usually prefer a vanilla flavor or nut type, but occasionally have indulged in a chocolate or mocha flavored variety.  I've allowed myself to get used to corrupting (some think) my cup with sweetener and cream, so that takes the edge off a lot of the less appealing qualities.  I took this to a family dinner to share.  Some drank it black, some with their preferred additives.  No one raved about it.  No one complained, either.  I didn't see many take seconds but, to be honest, we were all pretty happily stuffed by then anyway. (smile).<br /><br />Personally, I thought it was a little bitter.  It had a nice flavor of chocolate and coffee, but it seemed a bit acidic and bitter, more so than smooth and satisfying as I had hoped.  Possibly a fresh-ground bean would have had more of these qualities, but that isn't this product, so is a moot point.  Would I buy this again? Possibly, for an occasional variety, but not for regular use.  I'd actually give it three and a half stars by my own tastes.  I'd say it's worth a try if it sounds like something you might enjoy, and then decide for yourself.

review/summary: More bitter chocolate then truffle flavor
review/text: I am a bit of a coffee snob and grind my own beans each day. I like a smooth full flavored coffee and  the fresher the better. I was hoping this would be a nice chg of pace especially over the holiday season. I brewed up a pot after our Thanksgiving dinner .<br /><br />The ranges of opinion were diverse.<br />1.One who likes lots of sugar and cream thougth it was dreamy.<br />2.one who likes it bare bones  called it bitter with an odd after taste.<br />#3, 4, 5  varied from people who used a little cream and minimal sugar. The people that gave it the best rating were the ones that doctored up the brew with  a lot of sugar and heavy cream..<br />6.Those like me who just uses a splash of cream felt it was way too bitter and not smooth at all.. In fact it had a rather harsh taste.<br /><br /> Sorry this won't be one of the flavors we will be using in the future. Though I do like a number the Gevalia blends this isn't one of them

Being a HUGE dark chocolate lover, I initially thought that I would really enjoy this product but it is a bit too chocolaty and sweet for my palette, so much that I cannot taste even a hint of coffee in it.

I did mix this coffee with equal parts of my regular brew and it was a bit more palatable.  Hot cocoa anyone?

review/summary: I am a big fan of Gevalia products...but NOT this one
review/text: I was excited to try this flavored coffee and I have drank Gevalia coffees for over 12 years and love their Traditional Roast and the limited edition Royal Vinter varieties. When I opened this one I noticed the overwhelming artificial smell of the product and read on the box that the flavors were indeed artificial!<br />I brewed a pot of coffee and tried it with my daughter and we both disliked the smell and the taste was disgusting and a strong aftertaste followed. I could not taste chocolate and even adding pumpkin spice creamer did not disguise the awful flavor.<br />A few nights later I made a pot of this coffee for my husband and I to drink because I wanted his opinion. He also hated it and said to NEVER brew it again.  This product was a good idea but the ingredients make it unpalatable and if you are going to add chocolate then make sure it is REAL so the flavor is right.

review/text: I'm a coffee fan and, heresy aside, a flavored coffee fan.  Although I can tolerate cloyingly sweet coffees, I don't like them, especially when they cover up crappy coffee.<br /><br />Here we have a nice, smooth, well-roasted coffee with a subtle chocolaty background that is really satisfying.  I'm sipping a cup now and finding its mildness refreshing compared to some of the more "acrid" or "burnt" potent coffees that have become more standard here in the U.S.<br /><br />The packaging was very nice, and the bag was vacuum sealed as expected.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased and would certainly drink this coffee again.  It's subtler and more mild than my favorite (Dunkin' Donuts), but high quality and delicious.  Recommended.

review/summary: Rich, dark coffee, far better than instant, but Starbucks can breathe easy
review/text: I am a moderate coffee snob -- I grind my dark roast beans with a burr grinder before every pot, and only brew a mug at a time, but I'm not over-the-top---I don't roast my own, and I don't have a special long-named drink order at Starbucks. This product makes a nice rich, dark cup of coffee, with hints of chocolate. I added some sugar and milk to see if it made it more truffle-y and it would pass for a dessert on a diet. It isn't a substitute for a shot of chocolate syrup in a latte or a Frappuccino...but then again realistically, that isn't what you'd expect from a package of ground coffee. It is light years better than the instant "international" coffees, though!

review/summary: Truly wonderful chocolate flavor
review/text: I'm not usually a big fan of flavored coffee. But given the reputation Gevalia has for making good coffee I'd figure I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />For the coffee I used my Capresso MT500 Plus Coffee Maker (available on Amazon) with gold permanent cone filter, and 10 cups fresh cold water.<br /><br />The coffee is pre-ground, and immediately after opening the vacuum sealed brick bag you are met with rich coffee sweetness and fresh ground coffee. The coffee is ground very fine so this would be best used with a drip coffee maker.<br /><br />The coffee brews up with rich coffee and chocolate aromatics. The flavor is wonderful, rich and chocolate flavored.  Unlike lesser flavored coffees that can taste bitter or have this strange chemical taste to it, the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee actually tastes like it is supposed to taste like.  It tastes like dark chocolate.  I am very impressed.  I'll have to change my mind about flavored coffees after tasting this.

review/summary: Just a Hint of Chocolate
review/text: I'm a daily coffee drinker but not a connoisseur and do like an occasional taste of flavored coffee. To me a blend of chocolate and coffee flavors is pleasing, so much so that I sometimes add a spoonful of Land O' Lakes instant chocolate to my coffee.<br />The Gevalia is very finely ground almost to the consistency of flour or powdered sugar. After cutting open the vacuum packed block of coffee I expected a heavenly armoma of coffee and chocolate to escape along with the hiss of air. The aroma of this coffee didn't give me that heady pleasure of even the cheaper coffees I usually drink.<br /><br />My first cup of Gevalia was unimpressive with only a hint of chocolate flavor. On subsequent days I've grown to appreciate its subtle flavor, but I prefer a more pronounced chocolate flavor, not one that's lurking in the shadows or the grounds.<br />Taking the coffee with or without milk made little difference to me. I thought drinking the Gevalia black would reveal more of the chocolate nuance, but I was mistaken.<br /><br />In short, this is a good tasting coffee, but unremarkable with a just a little acidity and bitterness. The stylish packaging and the glowing description on the box impress more than the coffee itself. For this coffee drinker, Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle with artificial flavoring falls short of being the "ultimate indulgence."

review/summary: Mild cocoa flavor- astringent- plenty of caffeine.
review/text: I think the character of the "Dark Chocolate Truffle" flavor in this coffee reminds me more of cocoa powder rather than the rounded fatty flavor of chocolate. It is a medium-dark roast, medium body that I found to be too winey, astringent and bitter for my taste. The dry mouth feel and bitterness lingered in the mouth and back of my throat. I found that adding a bit of whole milk helped to bring out the chocolate flavor and take the edge off the bitterness and astringency. I made the coffee as recommend on the package, one slightly rounded tablespoon per 6 oz cup in my drip coffee maker. The coffee is ground very fine, almost a powder. Ingredients: Arabica coffee, artificial and natural flavor.<br />Plenty of caffeine, I am used to drinking a dark roasted Sumatra and 6 cups of that does not give me the buzz that two cups of this Gevalia coffee did!

review/summary: Adding Cream is a Necessity
review/text: I brewed the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee both in a Cuisinart automatic brew coffee maker and a french press. I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.<br /><br />As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.<br /><br />The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.<br /><br />On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

review/summary: Smells great, tastes...
review/text: Bitter, bland and essentially bad.  That's what this coffee tastes like.<br /><br />It smells nice when you open it up, a chocolaty mix of coffee and cocoa, and it fills the room with a pleasant smell while you're brewing it.  It almost smells like a chocolate shop where someone is running a nice pot of coffee in the back, giving the whole place the aroma of a winter's morning in Geneva or something.  Gevalia is supposed to sound Swiss, right?<br /><br />Too bad it's Swedish.  Not Swiss.  And a good thing too, since this doesn't taste so much like a chocolate coffee as it tastes like someone stuffed your coffee maker full of truffles and ran some stagnant water through the pot.<br /><br />The best quality of the coffee is that the flavor is weak.  You have to really overfill your pot to get a strong sense of the flavor, but I would advise only doing this if you want your mouth, coffee cup and everything you drink for the next few days to taste like an old sock that someone might have once dropped into a puddle of spilled coffee and then sprinkled with stale chocolate chips.<br /><br />A normally brewed cup of this coffee has almost no flavor aside from the bitter sting of really bad generic coffee.  Once you amp it up a few notches you can really feel the caffeine, so I guess that's a perk at least.  If your hands are steady enough to drink a whole cup you'll enjoy the burnt flavor of the beans along with the sickly sweet chocolate flavor that is thrown in almost like an insult.<br /><br />Stay away from this coffee.  Even worse than the mail-order stuff Gevalia will try to scam on you for a free POS coffee maker, this stuff you have to pay extra for and you really pay the price of your stupidity if you drink it.<br /><br />It isn't that bad as a room scent though, so if you have an extra coffee maker laying around you could set this up to brew while you microwave almost any instant coffee that will taste better than this.  The smell will fool people into thinking that you're a real coffee expert, and it might even enhance the flavor of the instant through a synesthesia effect.<br /><br />Afterwards, you can take the brewed coffee and use it for cleaning old paint brushes or degreasing an engine.

review/summary: Just say "no" to this cup of joe
review/text: After opening the fancy box and unsealing the gold bag, I was excited to brew a few cups of succulent, chocolate richness.  Instead, I got a pot of synthetic-tasting sweetness that was completely unbefitting of the Gevalia name.  This tastes like a cup of store-brand coffee seasoned with those artificial flavoring tablets or Coffee-Mate flavored creamer.  What's more, there was none of the characteristic freshness that "bag" coffee typically has.  For a much better cup of chocolaty coffee, try Millstone's Chocolate Velvet, which has an immeasurably smoother, more natural chocolate taste (and carries a much smaller price tag).  One part Gevalia Kaffe Dark Chocolate mixed with three parts unflavored coffee makes a more palatable cup, but the saccharine sweetness and totally artificial taste are just way too intense when brewed "straight." Truly not a good cup of joe.

review/text: I'm a full fledged chocolate lover and this coffee is luscious. I don't buy this coffee regularly because it's not in my budget anymore, but I have always recognised their product as superior. I found this coffee to be smooth and indulgent. It is wonderful in the morning if you have time to lounge while you're sipping, or as a nice afternoon present to yourself.<br /><br />I plan on serving it with dessert for the holiday with a rum cake and ice cream. I'd certainly recommend this to those who love coffee and love chocolate. It's truly sinful.

review/summary: keep on hand for company.... (and me too)
review/text: Having been a barista at a coffee house I tend to be a little persnickety in my coffee tastes. I prefer to use locally roasted beans but I always have a few "mainstream" choices in the house for company. I bought this flavor as a quick means to satisfy my friends that are fans of mocha coffees and was surprised to find that even I really like this particular Chocolate Truffle flavor from Gevalia.<br /><br />The coffee "base" is much like their other coffees - what I'd call "restaurant coffee" - the roast a little on the light to medium side, and in this case with a bolder aroma than usual for the brand. The truffle flavor is very well balanced with the beans and hits the right note of smooth chocolate flavor.<br /><br />This flavor for me stands out from Gevalia's sometimes ho-hum basics and blends. Recommended for those decaf fans who prefer lighter roasts and chocolate flavor.

review/summary: Is Flavored Coffee Your Cup of Tea?
review/text: I must confess that I ordered this product thinking that it was simply a box of chocolates without realizing that it was chocolate flavored coffee, but don't depart this review just on account of this confession. I gave this item to my daughter who enjoys flavored coffee (it's just not my cup of tea!) and she has reported to me that the taste is really quite wonderful. It has both a full-bodied coffee flavor, which we would associate with Gevalia and the chocolate - truffle tastes were 'merged' beautifully creating one special and unique coffee experience. So if I may pound this comic metaphor into this review one more time, if flavored coffee is your cup of tea and you like mocha-like flavors, then this just might be the perfect gift to yourself or to someone who also craves mocha any time of day.<br />So why the four stars instead of five? Only because this review comes more from my daughter than myself and also that coffee might, at the end of the day, stand better for itself straight and undiluted by add-ons.

Once in awhile I will have a cup of coffee with about 1/4th hot chocolate in it and that's the taste I was expecting. Wrong.  Please note that I am not a fan of flavored coffee so perhaps my expectations were just too high.  I thought that coffee + chocolate = delicious.

review/text: Gevalia usually produces good coffee with flavors that are not mellow but robust! This coffee was not like that all, it just has a hint of chocolate taste, and that was before adding creamer to my coffee, once adding that I did not even taste the chocolate, it tasted like regular black coffee with creamer; how disappointing!

But, people are virtually always Normally Distributed--you might not like the flavor or sweetness.  I don't like things "too" sweet, but I didn't think this product was--it seemed well-flavored as is though I did try mixing it with unflavored coffee to see what it would be like--the taste was too weak for me that way.  However, the cost is rather high, and I wonder about the artificial flavoring too--its nature is not explained on the box.

review/text: I will admit that I am not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a cup or two now and then. I generally prefer flavored coffees and/or use a bit of milk or flavoring in my coffee, because I like the "extras" at least as much as I like coffee.<br /><br />The Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee has a wonderful aroma. I love the smell of coffee, and the chocolate made this even better. This coffee does not actually contain any chocolate, though. It has "artificial flavors." And there is more of a chocolate aroma than chocolate flavor.<br /><br />The coffee was fine without any additions (e.g., milk, sugar, etc.) but it makes an excellent after dinner coffee, with a splash of liqueur and a dollop of whipped cream added.

review/text: With a name like Dark Chocolate Truffle, this coffee begs you to drink it. Whenever we entertain and I offer our usual array of coffee options, people always say "Ahh" when I get to Dark Chocolate Truffle.<br /><br />What I enjoy about this flavor is that it seems the right mix in terms of strength. Not too strong, but not weak, either. I had feared the Dark Chocolate part of it would make it much stronger. But its a great mix. And when you brew it, the smell wonderfully permeates the house.<br /><br />This coffee is a winner and you don't even need anything in it.

Actual results varied.<br /><br />Overall, it had a pleasant aroma, and was convenient, being pre-ground.  But, when I used Splenda like I usually do, the resulting beverage had a harsh chemical-like taste.  I don't think this is a problem with the Splenda, since I never normally notice it.  Just a bad synergy of flavors, I suppose.<br /><br />Using sugar the coffee tasted decent.  Still not my first pick for flavored coffee, but nice enough if you're looking for a pre-ground, pre-flavored chocolate coffee.

review/text: The Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee is a smooth, non-acidic brand of coffee with a hint of dark chocolate.  My wife, the coffee drinker, enjoyed it.  The chocolate taste is not overpowering, but is also not quite as prevalent as you would like for a more expensive brand.  However this coffee is nothing to write home about.  It's not spectacular - not 4- or 5-star - and it's not really something that I would pay extra for.  For the price of the coffee, we expected something absolutely divine.  The low acidity is nice though.  It's not your $5 store-brand, but I feel it's not worth the cost.

review/summary: It tastes sinful but it's not!
review/text: Although I love coffee, I've never been a flavored-coffee drinker. I am, however, a chocolate fan and figured that the combination of the two flavors was worth checking out. As it happens, this coffee arrived just in time to take to my mother-in-law's house where there were plenty of other coffee- and chocolate-lovers around to help try it out.<br /><br />My first reaction when opening the bag was, simply put, to drool. This is yummy-smelling stuff here! But, of course, the proof is in the taste. So, using my MIL's coffee maker -- an extremely slow-dripping thing that takes around 15 minutes to make an 8-cup pot -- I followed the package direction on measurement and waited. It wasn't long before everyone in the family was gathered around the coffee maker, cups in hand. This stuff smells THAT good.<br /><br />Before I get to the taste, let me point out that this is an extremely finely ground coffee. As a result the water went through it even more slowly than usual AND almost overflowed the filter. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about making a full pot with this stuff; it's probably best to do a half-pot at a time unless you're really fond of cleaning up coffee basket overflow.<br /><br />That said, once the coffee was ready it was well worth the wait. My sister-in-law, who likes hers with cream and sugar, said this tasted almost like a coffee-flavored candy bar. Personally, I like my coffee black, and yet I was really surprised at how smooth yet flavorful this coffee was. It didn't taste like a candy bar to me, but it did have a nice note of chocolate with each swallow; not overpowering but, if anything, very complimentary to the depth of the coffee flavor. We all agreed it was a winner, particularly those of us on a diet (that's me) who felt like they were actually getting a treat with their morning coffee when, in fact, there was no diet-busting involved.<br /><br />Good stuff.

Even though we usually grind our own at home for extra freshness, this package arrive fresh and, being pre-ground, was more convenient for a quick cup.

review/summary: Weak But Not Overly Sicky Sweet
review/text: I was not overly impressed with this coffee. It was ground finely which is nice if you want to use it for espresso. And it wasn't overly sicky sweet like some flavored coffees. In fact, there was very little taste of flavoring to it. However, no matter how much coffee I added to the pot, it seemed kind of weak and bleh. Perhaps I like a coffee that is roasted more strongly. So I suppose that if you like a lightly flavored, weakly roasted coffee, this would be the coffee for you. It's just not my cuppa joe.

review/text: Gevalia makes great coffee and this dark chocolate truffle blend is excellent.  Very smooth and flavorful.  The chocolate adds a nice zing to the coffee yet doesn't overwhelm.  Great as a desert type coffee rather than one served with a meal.

review/summary: Delicious coffee once again from Gevalia
review/text: I found this coffee from Gevalia to be both aromatic and delicious.  The aroma is that of chocolate and is slightly sweet.  I brewed a cup in my Keurig coffee machine (using the My K Cup) on a smaller cup setting so I could get the full flavor of the coffee.  It didn't disappoint me at all.  After adding a little cream and splenda, I tasted light chocolaty flavor in a very smooth coffee.  This is not a flavor for those of you who prefer the bolder coffees.  I sampled a cup made on a larger cup setting and it was a little too weak but this is the fault of the machine and not the coffee.  If making it in a drip coffee maker, go for stronger to taste the flavors.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: I usually find "flavored" coffee to be cheap, terrible-tasting coffee that's overly-perfumed so you don't suspect how bad it is until you taste it.  Gevalia's Dark Chocolate Truffle didn't fall into this trap--it's a decent, but not great coffee on its own.  It has a little bit too much of a mocha flavor for me, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing I've found that works great is that I use the Gevalia for 1/3 of my normal grounds allocation, and my normal coffee for the other 2/3.  This yields a cup of coffee that has a nice chocolate taste, but not overwhelmingly so. (To clarify--if I'm using 3 scoops of coffee, I'll use 1 of Gevalia and 2 of my normal coffee).  Of course, I'm also the kind of guy who puts three different types of cereal into the same bowl at once, which I realize isn't for everyone. This coffee certainly isn't one I'd drink every day (and I drink a number of cups of coffee each day), but it is nice on occasion.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a chocolate-flavored coffee, you could do worse than this one.

review/summary: Surprisingly OK
review/text: We never buy pre-ground coffee, let alone flavored varieties. We do like chocolate so I figured this might be interesting.<br /><br />We brewed it in a drip coffeemaker using the recommended quantities of water and coffee, and the result was pretty surprising. We liked the pairing of the two flavors and how smooth the brew was (was not very acid at all).<br /><br />The one negative thing that we noticed was there was a "flavored coffee aftertaste" that seems to be the same no matter what flavor coffee it is.<br /><br />This is artificially flavored coffee (no chocolate) and the chemicals that they use to concoct the different flavors probably share the same base component(s), and that's what you taste afterwards. However, overall we expected something much worse but it was pretty OK. I would rate it 3 and a half stars.

review/text: I am not a gourmet coffee drinker although I am a regular drinker.  I like higher quality coffees but I do take them with a bit of cream and sugar unlike most coffee connoisseurs.<br /><br />Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee is very tasty if you are looking for what I would describe as a cross between coffee and hot chocolate.  The coffee has more then just chocolate undertones but doesn't pour or taste like pure hot chocolate.  It does have a decent caffeine kick to it but less so then regular coffee. I also find myself putting in less sugar and creme with this product.  It requires a bit more grounds then most coffee to avoid a watery taste so be aware of that before you buy.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this and it makes an excellent after dinner desert coffee.

review/summary: good coffee but don't expect chocolatey flavor
review/text: the coffee itself is pretty decent and goes down smoothly. but my biggest problem with this product is how its described as 'chocolate truffle' because it's not chocolatey. if you want a combo of coffee and chocolate, this is NOT for you - make yourself a genuine mocha instead because you'll be disappointed. get this coffee if you want a decent brew, but don't get it if you expect a yummy chocolate flavor. labeling it as 'chocolate truffle' is grossly misleading because one expects amazing full-bodied chocolate flavor. you just can't get the creamy, sugary dimension of chocolate from ground coffee alone, so the product should be renamed.

review/summary: Good to a point
review/text: The Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee is fairly decent tasting coffee if you load it with sweetener, giving it a mild, smooth flavor. However, if you prefer drinking black coffee without sweeteners or creamers, this is one flavored coffee you'll want to avoid, as it takes on slightly bitter flavoring that otherwise spoils the pleasant aroma. I found this coffee to be much more pleasant overall when brewed in a percolator style cofee maker, instead of the more common drip style coffee machine. Overall a decent quality coffee, if somewhat overpriced.

review/summary: Good if you prefer a very mild, subtle flavor
review/text: Rating coffee is so subjective; one person's "perfect" is another person's "battery acid" or "cloudy water".  I used to work on a construction site so I got used to coffee you could start a car with, boiled in a hot pot and drunk straight-up.  So for me, this was a little too mild-flavored, more chocolate-scented than infused (much like the chocolate tea I reviewed).  It's improved with a little cream and sugar, but I don't normally add cream and sugar to coffee.

review/summary: best chocolate Gevalia yet
review/text: This stuff is delicious!  Easily the best flavored coffee I've had from Gevalia or anywhere.  The chocolate flavoring pairs so well with the coffee, it doesn't taste like coffee + artificial flavor, it tastes like coffee that has a natural cocoa flavor in it.  The flavor doesn't fade when you add cream and sugar.  It pairs wonderfully with some fruits and desserts that aren't too sweet.  If you drink alcohol, my husband recommends a half shot of butterscotch schnapps in the coffee.<br /><br />I'm a big Gevalia fan, having had their coffess for years, subscribing to their mailed versions off and on over the last 12 years or so.  While I adore a lot of their whole bean and ground darker roasts, I have tried a few of the Gevalia flavors but was just never that impressed with them.  Further, I've tried flavored coffees in several store and gourmet brands and just never cared for them.  So many coffees add flavor that doesn't blend well with the natural coffee flavor, making a weird, artificial taste.  When I saw this new Dark Chocolate Truffle flavor, though, I decided to try a box, and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I will buy this again, no question.  My only caveat: If you can't drink caffeine, you may want to avoid this specific kind.  I notice the caffeine hits me a lot harder with the Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee than with any other caffeinated I've had, which makes sense, but is kind of surprising if you're not expecting it.

review/text: This product is the usual Gevalia finely ground coffee.<br /><br />Full-strength it did not seem be all that great. I enjoyed it much better when I blended the product with 'regular' coffee. Maybe it is just the way I brew coffee that is wrong, or I have the wrong kind of brewer (basket instead of cone, like the Gevalia-brand brewers). I am not a big fan of flavored coffee, of any brand, because I think they processor can mask poor-grade product with fancy additives.<br /><br />It has very good dark-chocolate flavor. I am not sure how good a value it will as I do not have access to that info at this point.

review/text: While not a huge fan of flavored coffee, Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee isn't bad.

I don't use sugar, but I think that would improve the flavor. I am a coffee snob, but I do like my coffee ground, so that was a plus. If you like mocha coffee, that still tastes like coffee, you will probably like this. I probably will try a different Gevalia coffee next time.

review/text: Gevalia is a well known name among coffee lovers, but as a casual coffee drinker, I had never had it before.

The rich coffee and chocolate flavor was well balanced and blended, and I can honestly say that I really enjoyed it whenever I drank it. I'm not sure I like it enough to buy on a regular basis, but if you are a big-time flavored coffee drinker, I think this would fit well in your cupboard and provide a good change of pace on occasion.

review/summary: Not Really To My Taste, But You May Enjoy It
review/text: I generally like mocha lattes and thought that this coffee would be great to try. The coffee had a good smell and came in a well-sealed, airtight package. It is ground really fine though and this is where I found it to be a problem. At first I thought it was an instant coffee, so I had to read the box to make sure I knew how to brew it. From there, the grind is so fine that you have to let it sit and drip for a while to get all the water through the filter. It is also a little challenging to determine how strong you want the coffee.<br /><br />I noticed that if I use the same amount as a normal brew coffee, it is a stronger coffee. I cannot taste the chocolate. I taste a strong coffee with a strange after taste that might be considered the chocolate part. The first time I tried it I thought I tasted espresso with a dirt after taste.<br /><br />Some people might consider this a good coffee, but for my taste, I don't think I can finish the bag. This is definitely something that depends on the individuals taste.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.

It went well in my Ramos Gin fizz cocktails which, I made all week for Christmas and new years entertaining family and friends. Only had to use a few drops or else you would be smelling orange blossom all night. I havn't baked anything with it yet, athough I think it would work well in many different pastries. There are may European recipies that call for it. Store in a dark cupboard away from other food beacuse it will start to flavor everything. Overall a very good product and it is what it claims to be, orange blossom water.

review/summary: Turd Uk'n
review/text: Tried the Turducken this year. I was very disappointed. The bird doesn't stay together like the photos you see. After it's cooked, you don't know to slice or scoop out the bird. There was very little turkey meat on the outside and the inside had more rice than duck or sausage. Plus, it was dry. There were no juices when I cooked it. Luckily, we also cooked a traditional turkey which fed everyone. After all said and done, after $110, the Turducken was stuffing.  I will never buy again.

review/summary: Worst Tur-duc-ken ever
review/text: Last year I had another Tur-duc-ken and it was great.  This year our market brought these in and I will never buy one again. The instructions state to cook 3 hours and 40 minutes frozen.  It took over 2 hours more than that (which I could have lived with) and when we took it out it was so dry on the outside and still raw in the middle. Trust me my market has heard several complaints this year.<br />T from PA

review/summary: Not exactly as advertised.
review/text: The Tur-Duc-Hen I ordered was advertized having corn bread stuffing and sausage. The one I received was stuffed with only rice. The bird itself was good and delivery was fast. If it was not for the mix up between rice and corn bread stuffing I would have given this Item a 4 out of 5.

review/summary: Our Dog Loved It
review/text: I bought this for our Christmas dinner. BIG mistake. What we received was a very small, and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and/or chicken... and a lot of nasty-tasting stuffing. The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.<br /><br />Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.<br /><br />On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate what everyone scooped into her bowl.

review/summary: Tasty!  It's Different, at least!
review/text: what is it?  I'm so confused!<br /><br />My sweet, adventuremonger husband, Norman, thought this was a hoot, so he bought it and cooked it up for me, for our 15 and a half year anniversary candlelight dinner.<br /><br />MMMmm, yummy. After a few dee-lish bites, I, of course, asked him, "Sweetums, what IS this?"<br /><br />"Why, Snugglepuss, it's Turducken, of course!" he answered, with a wicked grin. I kept eating, trying the different colors, white and dark meat, that sliced in a lovely way.<br /><br />"Huh?" I managed, with a mouthful of white meat.<br /><br />"Tur - duck - hen," he pronounced patiently, slowly. as if speaking to a very slow thinker. Like, oh, now I get it! Not.<br /><br />Then, he kindly showed me the packaging, which he fished out of the trash. Ohh, but of course, a part Turkey, part Duck, and part Hen. why didn't I see it!? The hen, I assume is the part that's chicken.<br /><br />Well, I give the inventors a gold star for inventiveness! Who'd of thunk??<br /><br />Being as I love it when my man cooks for me (and shops) I didn't complain. It was lovely. tender, moist, and certainly unusual. Pricy, perhaps. But, how often do you see a turducken?<br /><br />my Norman is a hunter, and he's never brought home anything like this!<br /><br />Tasty, unusual, a conversation starter for your next party! buy a few! yummmmm.....

review/text: A friend from Mississippi introduced me to this steak sauce. Lost track of it for years, they don't sell it here in Illinois. I had a barbeque last weekend, and had a lot of inquiries on what I put on the steak to make it taste so good!

review/summary: Best off the shelf steak marinade available.
review/text: Make sure to start with a good cut of meat please.  I like to marinade my meat for a couple of hours on all sides.  Grill the meat to perfection and enjoy.  If you want more of the Dale's flavor mix a few tsp with a cup of sour cream to use as a dipping sauce.

review/summary: Won't buy again
review/text: Got this because of the amazing reviews on the net. It' just average, nothing spectacular. It doesn't make the steak taste bad or awesome. As some people have said it does really have a lot of salt/sodium. I'll return to seasoning with black pepper e.t.c.

review/summary: A refreshing and light raspberry flavored tea!
review/text: We love Crystal Light drinks and we drink them all the time.  In the summer we drink a lot of iced tea but we also watch our caffeine intake.  This Crystal Light flavor is ideal for us as it is almost caffeine free and the light raspberry flavor just makes the drink better without overwhelming the taste of the tea.  This is one of our favorite flavors of Crystal Light and we think that you will like it also! It is best when served cold for the ideal taste.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />* Low Sodium.<br />* 99% caffeine free with only 10 mg of caffeine per serving.<br />* Non-carbonated and easier on your stomach.<br />* One packet makes 8 servings and there are 5 packets per container so you get 40 servings per container and this item features a pack of four.<br />* Only 5 calories per serving with 5 mg of sodium and less than 1 g of carbohydrates.<br />* Each serving provides 10% of your daily requirements of vitamin E, vitamin A and vitamin C.<br />* Less expensive than carbonated beverages.

review/summary: Totally YUMMY!
review/text: I typically don't like ANY instant tea drinks but this stuff is YUMMY and not nearly as sweet as some of the crystal light flavors.  I'm not a fan of overly sweet drinks.  This has a subtle fruit flavor that doesn't over whelm the green tea.  But beware!  These are NOT individual servings.  Each packet makes a 2 Quart pitcher.  Like it so much, I have it as a subscribe & save item!  Just wish they had the individual packs on S&S.

review/text: Raspberry Green Tea Crystal Light and Ruby Red Crystal Light are my two favorite drinks. I have been drinking them since they were introduced. They are very hard to find and I was thrilled when I could get them at Amazon, only to be told that it was no longer going to be possible. My only hope is that they will change their mind.
