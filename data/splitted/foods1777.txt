review/summary: Delicious but for a steep price
review/text: So these are pretty good. They are really tasty and melt in your mouth. The only complaint I have is that each packet is pretty small (it seems like if you emptied out the contents, it would barely fill between 1 to 2 cups). I lowered my rating by 1 star because it's pretty pricey for the amount you receive. But I usually hate dried fruit (this was an exception), so I bought it anyways.

review/summary: Not "asian" pear, but regular pear
review/text: I love their fuji apple so gave their asian pear a try. But when it came in I was a first suspicious, as the picture on the bags showed a pear shaped pear and not a round asian pear. I should have looked more closely at the picture before ordering it. It definitely did not taste like a sweet asian pear. I and my child was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />I'm not sure what kind of asian pear they used, but it's not the sweet round asian pear that we know and love.

review/text: These snacks are perfect for infants-adults! No mess! Crisp-melt in your mouth, not chewy like most freeze dried snacks. Light and portable. Excellent flavor.

I found them cheapest at Costco for about 0.60/per bag.

review/summary: Why did Smuckers take out the berries?
review/text: I've bought this sugar-free topping since it became available, but no longer saw it local stores.  In the past, there were lots of strawberries and lots of authentic strawberry flavor.  Although it was always thinner than the sugar variety, now it is very thin with NO berries....well, maybe 1 small strawberry total.  This product is now about the same as the strawberry-flavored syrup on the shelf.  So disappointed.  Maybe Smuckers will decide to put the berries back in someday....

review/summary: DO  NOT BUY THESE!!!
review/text: See all the negative reviews for this product for the 12 oz. size. Amazon has kindly agreed to suspend sales of the product as the problems are too numerous. The items are arriving with disgusting green mold all over the treats. Despite repeated promises by the manufacturer that they have repaired the "manufacturing glitch" no positive action has been taken. Also people are reporting trouble getting reimbursement from the manufacturer for items they return (which the manufacturer will not pay for the return shipping). I wish I could attach photos as you would never believe how truly disgusting is the condition of these treats. These pose a health risk to your dog and I STRONGLY urge you not to buy.

review/summary: Not the greatest sauce out there.
review/text: First off I would like to say that I am a huge fan of hot sauce in all different heat ranges. This sauce claims to have a one million scolville unit heat range, which is completely false advertising. I tastes like a generic tobasco sauce that you might find at a 99 cent store. The heat is similar to tobasco sauce as whell. If you like vineger based sauces you might like it, but it's not worth the price, plus shiping if you ask me. I probably would have given it a better rating if they hadn't lied about the heat. It's just nothing special, the sauce actually started turning black in my fridge, and I've on had it for a couple weeks. The taste got worse too, I have no clue why. I'll close by saying if your looking for a good tasting hot sauce with some real heat look elsewhere.

review/summary: Organic, Kosher, Tasty Assortment of Premium Teas & Teasans
review/text: *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called "teasans"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Teas for Creative Moods
review/text: Numi's tea sampler has a lot to offer if you enjoy mild teas. If you prefer stronger teas, then you may want to creatively mix and match for a new experience.<br /><br />Delicate Tea for Calm Mornings<br /><br />The Numi "Morning Rise," organic breakfast blend has elements of smooth perfection when blended with milk powder or cream. This tea has a mild dreamy flavor when using one teabag. You may want two if you prefer a stronger morning blend. If you are looking for an elegant tea, this blend of Fair Trade Certified Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon and Assam black tea is sure to impress. Morning Rise is a delicate tea that awakens you slowly to the day and seems to bring a new clarity to the mind.<br /><br />Dreamy Vanilla<br /><br />Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi "Decaf Black Vanilla" is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme French Vanilla syrup or even a cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />Delicate Ginger with hints of Anise<br /><br />Numi "Golden Chai" is a delicately spiced Assam black tea that I like to blend with the Numi "Chinese Breakfast" tea made with Yunnan black tea. Together they seem perfect and I like using two teabags per experience. This creates a flowery tea scented with anise and cardamom and spiced with cinnamon and ginger. If you like making chai with milk, heat some milk in a saucepan and then add one or two teabags. It is much more convenient than having to look around for all the separate ingredients and the spices and tea are perfectly blended.<br /><br />Afternoons in Africa<br /><br />Bushmen's Brew "Honeybush," "Jasmine Green Tea" and "White Nectar Osmanthus Spring" make a good combination for a honey/floral tea. Adding in a little honey enhances the experience. With this blend you can enjoy white tea with Osmanthus flowers, green tea with jasmine flowers and honeybush tea with a mild flavor. You may enjoy this as an ice tea in the summer.<br /><br />Lemon Iced Mint Tea<br /><br />Numi's "Gen Mai Cha" Toasted Rice Green, Simply Mint "Mooccan Herbal Teasan" and Rainforest Green "Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea" can be steeped together to create a delicious tea to pour over ice. Add honey while the tea is hot and lemon juice just before serving.<br /><br />The Lemon Iced Tea was the best experience of all the teas<br />and I can see myself buying a box of each tea so I can make<br />this tea again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Cute, but Made in CHINA
review/text: I bought 2 dozen of these monkey lollipops as party favors for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  I was happy they arrived within 2 days of ordering.  They are as cute as the photos depicted and they arrived well packaged.  Each dozen is packed in a box that has the nutritional info on the box, but I was disappointed to see a label on the back of each lollipop to have in huge font "Made in China".  For nutritional info, call this #. This label took away from the cuteness of these lollipops.  I had intentions of giving one to my 2 year old, but after seeing this label, it makes me think twice whether I should.  Everything now is made in China, and when it comes to children's products, China = RECALL.  I wished the website posted where the lollipops were made because I assumed USA, had I known they were from China, I would not have bought these lollipops.  I will just use them as decorations.  Using something that's made in China is one thing, but eating something from China requires caution!

review/summary: Very good salt
review/text: Regular salt is (at best) very plain.  I think of it like distilled water.  If it has nothing else in it, it just tastes kind of "flat". That is why allot of filtered water in bottles have minerals added back in, so it has some flavor and "tastes right."<br /><br />That is part of why sea salts and finishing salts tend to taste so much better on the pallet.  They have trace minerals that are appealing to the tongue.  They also lack the iodide that most table salt has added which (to me) gives it an off-taste.<br /><br />The Himalayan pink salt has been my favorite for a while, and the salt provided by "The spice lab" or "Old Himalayan Salt Co." via this listing is a particularly good example of this salt.  A great blend with a really good flavor profile.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this product, and this seller.  It's particularly good on milder items like fresh cut avocado with a little lime or fresh tomatoes.

review/summary: Best salt ever.
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I have ever used. It has excellent flavor without the metallic taste of some refined salt.  There are no anti-caking agents, so I use my grandparents old trick of putting a few grains of rice in the shaker to absorb the excess moisture in the air that salt attracts.  I had been using sea salt instead of standard table salt for a few years, but the taste alone was enough to get me to switch to Himalayan Salt.  I can only describe the flavor as fuller and more nuanced, not just "salty".<br /><br />I also use the Himalayan Crystal Salt (the larger pink rocks) to make "sole"(pronounced so-lay) for drinking therapy (one teaspoon a day, first thing in the morning).  This process is described on various websites, and in the book "Water & Salt: The Essence of Life" by Peter Ferreira and Dr Barbara Hendel.  The sole is salt crystals added to water until the solution is saturated, and can dissolve no more salt.<br /><br />I have not been using the salt long enough to determine long term health effects.  I do feel that I have more energy from drinking the sole in the morning, so that is enough for now.  My friend is also drinking sole on my recommendation, and he is raving about the effects.  At first he said it caused his body to throw off large amounts of mucus from his respiratory system, then he said it made his skin look younger.  I did notice that he had age spots at his temples that seem to be disappearing, so he is thrilled with the results. Another effect the sole therapy is supposed to be reduction of double chin, so he is checking daily for evidence of this (haha)

review/text: It took me a while to find out that Amazon.com sold spices as well as other items. The pure Himalayan salt is difficult to find; and sometimes more expensive than you expect.  Amazon.com had it at a very reasonable price.  I will be purchasing my spices from here when I can't find items in local stores.

review/text: Received the pink pure Himalayan salt and was not surprised at all that it arrived extremely well packed.  I tried it and it has a much much more delicious taste than the kosher sea salt I've been buying and using.  I highly recommend this salt to anyone who has been sitting on the fence and wondering whether to try it or not.

review/summary: Great Daily Tea
review/text: I tend to get too hyped up on coffee, and most teas have a flavor of which I tire after a few consecutive days. Tazo's Om is a very unique tea which I immediately liked, and now drink every single morning. I find the taste to be very pleasant; not too fruity and not too bitter. The black tea definitely adds a tiny caffeine kick, but not much more than a regular green tea, and green remains the dominant flavor. As with all green teas, over-steeping can lead to bitterness, so limit to about 3 minutes. Since I drink this daily, the fact that Om is organic is a big plus.

review/summary: Tea Delicious and delivered on time and in great shape(NT)
review/text: This Tazo OM Tea is delicious. I use it in the morning instead of coffee. This is how I prepare my large morning mug of tea.  I heat water in my electric kettle, meanwhile I place a Tazo OM teabag, and a single serving bag of "regular" black tea in my mug, along with a pkt of Stevia, maybe with an additional teaspoon of Stevia because it is a big mug.  After the kettle clicks off because it has boiled, I pour the boiling water over the tea bags, etc, placing one finger over the Tazo teabag STRING draped over the edge of the mug, so the string is not so likely to end up in the mug.  Let steep for 3-5 minutes, squeeze out the teabags(I use a teabag squeezer I got at the English Tea Store online), then add my non-fat half-n-half.  I enjoy this more than coffee, no sour aftertaste, and MUCH gentler on my system than coffee! TMI!  Have a great day!

review/text: It seems to me that Tazo makes horrible tea concoctions that are for people who don't like the taste of tea. Be warned, if you like the taste of straight green tea this is not for you. Om is a mixture of black and green tea (bad enough) with peach and cucumber. And even if that sounds okay to you, the taste is crap. I bought it by mistake. Not one I will repeat.<br /><br />There are far better tea companies out there (Choice Organic, Stash, Yogi),  but if you insist on Tazo, their Chai is first rate and China Green Tips are good as well. But I'd stay away from any of their herbal blends.

review/text: Great Horny Toads! This is great stuff! I tried it on a whim while suffering dreadful sinusitis and nasal polyps. OK, it didn't cure anything, but it sure made me feel better, got the sinus passages to open up, and enabled me to sleep. I ended up needing sinus surgery (The whole caboodle: every sinus) and I used this every day up to the day of surgery to keep the drainage going while I was on prednisone.<br /><br />Best advice is to bring a bottle of water with you into the bathroom while you soak, and don't make the mix too strong. Keep it to two ounces per full tub.  And do sit for 20 minutes, even if you have to keep topping off the tub with more water. It will loosen up phlegm and get that blood circulating.<br /><br />Then, you MUST get into bed and stay warm. Don't get chilled afterward.<br /><br />I was able to do the brief cold shower ritual only once. The mustard bath makes me too sleepy and a little light headed. So normally I wrap up in a huge towel and exit the bathroom to dry off and change. Then under the blankets for at least an hour.<br /><br />Wonderful stuff!

review/summary: Dr.Singha's Mustard bath is a must for sore muscles!
review/text: I've used this product for years to remove lactic acids that build up after deep tissue massage therapy, or after a vigorous work-out. It's relaxing and if you want to, you can put in a drop or two lavender oil for the ultimate aromatherapy relaxation treatment. Bought one for me and one as a Christmas gift. This is one "must have product for me! I don't recommend products unless I see results, and this delivers! Great Value & find on Amazon!

review/summary: Who needs Epsom
review/text: I have used multiple bath soaks. I am a swimmer so my muscles get extremely sore. I have tried Epsom salt over the years but ran into this product at a local grocery store. I fell in love with it. I was scared the tub would only come with directions on how much to put in, but low and behold it has a scooper so you know. It dissolves easily into the tub and is easy to wash off. I highly recommend this product as an athlete and for anyone with arthritis and/or sore muscles from small injuries, standing all day, or just needing a soothing bath.

review/summary: Mustard Bath will make you sleepy
review/text: Normally I assume that any bath product, other than epsom salt, which claims to be soothing and relaxing is just going to smell good and not be useful. The mustard bath exceeded my expecations. I tried it the day after a night of drinking, and after 15 minutes I had the urge to get out of the tub immediately and lie down. Took a 2 hour nap, and felt totally refreshed afterward. Definitely good for detox!

review/text: I am a fan of this mustard bath, especially when I feel a cold coming on or need to relax muscles that are sore. It helps me sweat while in the bathtub and usually the next day my cold is gone.  I love the smell of the mustard and wintergreen but don't like that I need to scrub the tub right after as it makes an orange color ring around the tub.  It is easy to remove so don't worry.

review/summary: Fantastic Belgian chocolates!
review/text: My mom first tried Leonidas chocolates when a co-worker brought her a sample from Belgium years ago. Later, during a family trip to Amsterdam in 2001, we stopped at one of their shops and bought several pounds of this fantastic chocolate for ourselves and family members.  10 years later, I ordered these as a Christmas present to my mom, knowing how much she loves these chocolates, and Leonidas, still does not disappoint. These were a total hit for the holidays and my mother, who does not eat dark chocolate, even gobbled up all of the dark chocolate pralines included in the holiday ballotin, they're that good! They are totally worth the expense.

Not a huge amount and I have yet to find any actual dirt or stones, but enough so I end up cleaning them myself.<br /><br />Sometimes 'organic' means: 'we don't have to try harder.

review/summary: Excellent quality organic mustard seed
review/text: This mustard seed is great for rubs or for pickling and braising roasts.<br /><br />If you want to grind this for mustard and want to make a really 'smooth' mustard, grind it as fine as you can in your spice grinder and then sift the mustard bran out with a fine mesh colander. If you want that pretty 'bright' yellow color, just add a pinch or two of powdered turmeric.<br /><br />This spice was packaged nicely in well-sealed foil bags. This mustard seed was very uniform, clean and debris free.<br /><br />Edited to add [March 31, 2012]:<br /><br />This is NOT hot mustard. This is a very mild mustard much like your typical American 'hot dog' mustard. No 'bite' or 'kick' to it. Very nice flavor though despite not being hot.

If you can find it locally, this is the one to buy. And<br />whatever you do, don't resort to using Wyler's, that stuff tastes like shoe leather.

This is awesome - I add a bit to my soda water and it smells amazing and pretty, but doesn't alter the taste too much (you don't feel like you're drinking rose-flavored water, really; it just smells good). It's interesting and helps add some variety and interest to the soda water.<br /><br />No idea how this is in cocktails, but it's great for making drinking a little more interesting.

review/summary: Watch That Shelf Life!
review/text: As the description notes, balsamic does indeed "growth" more valuable as it ages. What the review fails to note is that unlike fine wine, it also grows ever more alcoholic. One nip of this stuff, and you'll be unfit to drive for hours. To put it simply? It will mess. you. up.<br /><br />If you know that going in, you may be able to withstand the effects of this heady brew.<br /><br />Do take note of the product's two year shelf life, however. After two years, enough oxygen will undoubtedly have penetrated to turn this vinegar into wine. Not a good wine, not a fine aged wine, but a blend in the vein of Two Buck Chuck.<br /><br />In short, use it sparingly but use it quickly, then buy some more. It's slightly cheaper than just burning your money!
