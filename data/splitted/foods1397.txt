review/summary: Very good, but not fudge
review/text: As a chocolate lover and sometime baker and pastry chef, I set out to find out exactly what these cookies are. The answers are not what you'd expect.<br /><br />First of all, they're very sweet, as in Hostess Cupcake sweet, and there is absolutely nothing subtle about them. Second, they're made with both dark chocolate and white chocolate chips, but not enough white chocolate to take the edge off the enormous amount of chocolate and sugar they contain.<br /><br />Now, as regards the name "fudge," this they ain't. If you're thinking of fudge as a candy, you won't find it here. Nabisco would have been better off calling them "chocolate cream cookies." While they have a regular cookie texture on the outside, what's inside is more like a ganache, which is what you get if you bring a pot of cream almost to the boiling point and then pour in a bunch of chilled, shaved chocolate, so that the chocolate melts slowly into the cream. The result is not as thick as frosting, nor as firm as, say, the filling in an Oreo. It is, literally, a chocolate cream. Using a ganache is a nice touch, but it's not fudge.<br /><br />I suspect the "chewy, gooey" texture is a new venture for the Chips Ahoy brand. Getting a cookie to be truly soft involves using more liquid in the batter, which is the contribution of the chocolate cream or ganache, and removing the batch from the oven when it's still slightly undercooked.<br /><br />All in all, I certainly wouldn't turn them down, but would probably prefer something with more flavor and texture, such as those delicious tubular European cookies filled with a chocolate-hazelnut cream. Too bad the hazelnuts give me migraines. On the other hand, I've been known to pour chocolate syrup on marble fudge (also not fudge) ice cream, so you may want to try these out for yourself.<br /><br />Bottom line, interesting, but certainly not a regular purchase.

review/summary: Really disappointed...
review/text: I normally like chips ahoy (and just about all things chocolate) and these sounded like they'd be good!  I was wrong.  I don't know what the "gooey" stuff is in the middle, but it tastes incredibly artificial.  Plus, at 75 calories per cookie, they're hardly worth it.<br /><br />Considering all the chocolate they pile into these, they don't have that great of a chocolate flavor.  The concept is good, but the execution is a far cry from decent.  Also, the white chocolate chips in them - really?  What's the point of that?  If you're wanting megafudge cookies, are you really looking for white chocolate?  (Which actually has no cocoa in it...)  And I don't know if they had to alter the dough recipe in order to keep the fudge inside, but that part isn't good either.  It also has a kind of fake, I-left-these-in-my-hot-car-for-six-weeks kind of taste to it.  Blech!<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have a regular chocolate chip cookie than these things.  If I'm gonna eat a cookie, I want it to taste like a real cookie, not like a bad recipe gone horribly wrong.  After eating two of these, I don't plan on eating anymore, ever.

review/summary: They're kind of like little Pop Tarts
review/text: These cookies aren't bad, but it's strange that "Chips Ahoy!" has very few chips, and "gooey" is really just frosting.<br /><br />The consistency is kind of like an undercooked brownie, with a few white chips that just taste like sugar. And as noted above, the "gooey" center is frosting, which is actually less gooey than the chocolate filling in a fudge Pop Tart before it's been toasted.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty much "sugar" with a touch of chocolate. Regular Chips Ahoy! have a more complex flavor than these. So, if you see some kind of in-store "buy one get one" sale, you might want to give these a shot. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

review/summary: HORRIBLE cookie!!!
review/text: How is it possible for Chips Ahoy to make a horrible cookie???  I have no idea, but they did.<br /><br />First, the cookies are WAY smaller than the picture on the bag.  But if the cookies are good, who cares.<br />The problem is, they're not good.  Not good at all.  They're very artificial tasting, and not very chocolatey at all.<br /><br />I wanted these cookies because the "Gooey" label made them look irresistible.  I was so disappointed though!!!  The gooey stuff doesn't taste terribly gooey, it tastes - and this is weird for a liquidy substance - dry.<br /><br />These are not worth the calories.  There are much better cookies out there.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I saw the name "Chips Ahoy!" and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.<br /><br />I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my two cents:<br /><br />1. The allegedly mega fudge filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. Minifudge filling would have been more accurate. The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.<br /><br />2. The cookie part tasted like fake chocolate, which was a turnoff for me. I love chocolate like nobody's business, but it has to be GOOD chocolate (which this was definitely NOT.) A chocolate candy bar of almost any kind would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips Ahoy.

review/summary: Good Cookies, But They Don't Beat The Original
review/text: The name Chips Ahoy! to most people means a basic, commercial chocolate chip cookie that's been around since 1963. And they've been around since then because they are a classic cookie with a great taste, the best selling commercially made chocolate chip cookie in the United States. I'm one of the many fans of the cookie, so I was interested in trying this new variety of Chips Ahoy.<br /><br />This new variety is indeed very chocolatey. The texture is soft, and even softer inside, the gooey fudge. There is a white ingredient in the cookie, I assume it is a white chocolate chip, that is a different texture than the rest of the cookie. The white chocolate chip really didn't offer much in the way of flavor, and the texture of it was rather off-putting.<br /><br />That's not to say this cookie isn't good. It is very good. If you like soft-baked,ultra-chocolatey cookies (and wouldn't mind the texture difference of the harder white chocolate chips) you'll like this cookie. As for me, I'll stick to the classic Chips Ahoy! I've known and enjoyed for so many years.

review/summary: ~~hardly edible IMO~~
review/text: My favorite cookie is a chocolate chocolate chip cookie from Otis Spunkmeyer.  So when these cookies came up for review I was EXCITED!!!  When I got them I opened them right away and took a bite.  I nearly spit it out in a napkin.  It was that bad.  The cookie itself was dry.  The chocolate flavor was off.  The chips in the cookie were crumbley and the middle of the cookie wasn't gooey at all.  It looked and tasted more like frosting that was a couple of days old.  The packaging states these cookies are crammed with real chocolate chips and creamy fudge.  To get the cookie I got after reading a description like that is nothing but a disappointment.  These will not a something that makes it on my shopping list.... ever.

review/summary: Sweet, Mildly Chocolatey, and Overhyped
review/text: Hopefully you're not imagining that these cookies might be as good as home made.  Of course they're not.  They're  mass-produced, very sweet cookies that are fall-apart-in-your-hand soft and only slightly chewy, with a creamy--not fudgey--center. It's not as though you can't find really tasty, quality cookies in a package at the supermarket, but these are not first-class cookies even on the scale of what the big companies crank out by the millions. For example, Pepperidge Farm's soft-baked Captiva and Chocolate Chunk cookies are very similar in concept, but superior.<br /><br />The word "fudge"--let alone "Megafudge"--may conjure up Willie Wonka-like fantasies, or have you thinking you'll be biting into a big block of deep, dark chocolate fudge.  No, no, no. They're chocolate alright, but they look and sound a lot more chocolatey than they taste--not the kind you get from a bar of dark chocolate or premium chocolate ice cream, let alone fudge, but a disappointing, how-can-something-so-dark-brown-have-so-little-chocolate-flavor kind of taste. I can picture these being formulated in a lab by men in white coats, using jars of brown and white powders and syrups in test tubes. That kind of "chocolate." Those reviewers who squeal that these have a rich chocolate flavor sadly don't know what they're missing.  They're also smaller than I expected; maybe two inches in diameter, not the sort of three- or four-inch disks you'd likely find in a bakery (or the Pepperidge Farm varieties), or would make at home; you'll need two or three just to feel like you've eaten something.<br /><br />If you put some in your child's lunch, will he or she like them?  Why not--he or she will likely be enjoying the sugar rush for an hour before falling asleep.  If you sit down in front of the TV with them can you eat ten of them before you know it?  Sure. But really, they're nothing special.

review/summary: not great
review/text: These cookies had an unusual texture- they were somehow dry on the outside and slightly tough in the middle (like undercooked pasta almost).  The chocolate chips were soft and melty, but the flavor wasn't exactly right- This is hard to explain, but it didn't taste like chocolate is supposed to- artificial maybe.  My husband didn't like them much either.  They weren't terrible, but you certainly couldn't pass them off as home-made- nor would you want to.  I didn't even realize that there was a chocolate center in the middle till I read the package- after I'd eaten 3 already.  Since I didn't notice, it didn't seem to contribute much to the flavor.  I'd eat them if I was hungry and they were the only thing in the pantry, but they won't be on my grocery list.

review/text: Great tasting chocolate cookies with a nice fudge center. These cookies are great for a chocolate lover and anyone who loves a super moist cookie because they are soft and moist. I love the consistency and the taste of these cookies. I will buy the cookies again.<br /><br />These cookies are similar to what a gourmet bakery will offer with out the overpricing of the bakery. I wish they were a little firmer so that when I microwave them they don't fall apart. The reseal able packaging is perfect to keep your cookies nice and fresh without worrying about them getting stale or attracting any insects. Great Job Chips Ahoy with this new Megafudge line of cookies my son and I loved them.

review/summary: Chocolaty and moist
review/text: These cookies are pretty good.  They are very chocolaty and extremely moist.  The fudge in the middle of the cookie is tasty, although there was less than I thought there would be.  I marked these down one star because there is a slight artificial taste to the cookies.  Its not a huge detraction but noticeable.  However, after eating one, I immediately craved another, and to me, that is the sign of a tasty cookie.

review/summary: Exactly what you would expect... maybe a bit better
review/text: You can't really compare these to fresh, bakery cookies, but for off-the-shelf store cookies, they're pretty good. Sweet, and just a bit doughy, as you might expect, but not as over-the-top as you might fear. They somehow survived delivery on a 103 degree day without falling to pieces, but who would complain about warm fudge cookies?<br />When it comes to store-bought cookies, I prefer crunchy, so I would not make these my regular go-to cookie, but I would recommend them for those times when you feel like a softer, fudgier, brownie-like treat. They taste a lot like another popular brand of cookie that is often found in vending machines.<br />Pass the milk!<br /><br />FOLLOW UP: I wrote this review before my wife and college-age daughter got home and discovered these cookies. I don't think a pack of store cookies ever disappeared so fast. Again, probably won't be a regular purchase, but as an occasional indulgence, these are a hit!

review/text: This was an okay cookie.  It's more of a cross between a dry brownie and a soft cookie.  It was chewy, but I wouldn't say it was all that gooey as the name implies.  The double dose of chocolate and nuts are great for chocolate lovers, though.  And I did like the re-sealable package, so the cookies will stay soft longer.  If you like double chocolate cookies with nuts and/or Chips Ahoy cookies, you may like this one.  I liked them, but I did not love them.

review/summary: Deliciously chewy chocolate cookies, but not for everyone
review/text: I have quite a sweet-tooth and often have a very difficult time avoiding sweets, especially when they're free.  So when these Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies showed up on Vine I had to give them a taste.  Needless to say I was not disappointed.  If you like rich chocolate packaged cookies then these bite sized snacks are for you.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Made with real chocolate.<br /><br />+ Bite sized cookie portions.<br /><br />+ Easy to open resealable package.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Still have a bit of that artificial preservative packaged cookie taste.<br /><br />- 150 calories and 13 grams of sugar per serving (2 cookies = 1 serving).<br /><br />- White chocolate chips can be a little crunchy.<br /><br />- Not really very gooey.<br /><br />Generally I'm not a fan of packaged cookies but these were actually pretty good.  Sure you could still taste the artificial side of these treats but that's sort of expected.  If you're a chocolate lover and don't mind prepackaged cookies then these are worth a try.  If you prefer a more homemade tasting cookie then you'll probably want to give these pass.

review/summary: Forget the cookie, read about the package
review/text: As of this writing, June 26, 2011, this product, Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies, has been reviewed 165 times, the first being six days ago.  If you want to know more about the taste and texture of the cookies, stop reading this review now and read the other ones, because I have almost nothing to say that hasn't been said about the cookies themselves, except that I can go long periods of time without these cookies or any others.  Oh, and also, that where the package says, "Fudge Filled Soft Cookies," which is missing a hyphen, and elsewhere where it says, "FUDGE-FULLS," or perhaps "FUDGE FULLS," the cookie IS somewhat harder and gooier (or is it "gooeyer"?) in the core than elsewhere.  I my own personal self prefer the non-core parts.<br /><br />No, all I want to review is the packaging, because if you read every single review to date and the ones that are sure to follow you will find all you need to know about the contents thereof, whereas the subject of the package is rarely addressed, at least not as thoroughly as you no doubt want if you really have read all the other reviews about the cookies themselves.<br /><br />There's both good and bad in the packaging.  The wrapper appears to be Mylar or some other silver-colored plastic with a second layer of plastic that holds the labelling image, and inside is a molded plastic tray with exactly five cookies in each of exactly three bins for a total of an average of exactly a dozen or or a dozen and a half cookies.  Please don't quote me on this, because last time I did math I goofed it up and got in trouble, but I think the answer, at least according to Sesame Street, is 15 cookies.<br /><br />The way you open the wrapper to expose the goodies inside is to pull rightward on a tab at the left side of the top.  It's kinda' difficult to get at the cookies in the leftmost bin compared to the other two, but if this problem so thoroughly stumps you that you find yourself hauling out a chain saw or 911ing the fire department, you probably won't be able to figure out how to open that flap anyway.<br /><br />The neato aspect of that top flap is that when you close it, sticky strips on the perimeter of the bottom surface of the flap adhere nicely to matching strips of Mylar on the wrapper proper.  I can't prove it, but I'm guessing this will reduce evaporation of water from the cookies, which will keep them both moister or more less drier, or both, compared to the more normal ways of closing such a package.  Of course, designing and testing this improvement and paying for the new machinery to apply the stickum, not to mention the cost of the stickum itself, all cost money, and that cost has surely been passed down the chain of commerce to us consumers.  You get to decide whether it's worth it to you.  If you snarf down these cookies like a chocaholic trencherman, it won't be.  If you wish not to add to your body's load of excess sugars and fats and carbohydrates but can't resist buying this product to begin with -- and if you have the self-disclipline to eat only one or two a day -- this feature of keeping them fresher than if they were in a plain wrapper that can't close as hermetically might be worth it.<br /><br />The top of the package shows an enlarged photograph of part of one representative cookie, and elsewhere it shows three distinct bits that have been added to and show up distinctly in the dough.  Stupid me, I assumed the lighter-colored ones were nuts of some kind, but they are not.  I'm not saying it says anywhere on the packaging or on the Amazon product page that there are nuts in these cookies, I'm just telling you the assumption I made.  And I'm telling you it's wrong.  I'm not sure what the light-colored bits are a picture of, and maybe I don't care, but I admit I'm curious.  The same goes with these other bits depicted in the photograph.  They're more dark than the first bits I mentioned, but they have a kind of swirl in them.  I don't know what they are either, and maybe all the other reviewers have figured it out, but I haven't, and I am curious yet again.  The third type of bit in the cookie dough is what I am almost 90% sure is a chocolate chip.<br /><br />COOKIE Volume<br /><br />The several cookies I measured average so close to 1-15/16 of an inch across that I'm going to pretend that's the average, even though I've measured with calipers only seven of them.  The height measured at half the radius along, which seems a reasonably representative spot to choose, varies from approximately 0.243 inches to approximately 0.425 inches, with an average I will round a tiny bit down (less than the length of a human hair) to 3/8ths of an inch.  Geometry tell us that a cylinder with diameter 1.9375 inch and height 3/8th inch has a volume of pi times the radius squared times the height, which in this case is pi times (0.96875 squared) times 0.375.  According to my pencil (yes, I know calculators exist, but I still don't trust 'em), the volume of one cookie is just a touch smaller than 1.105616653 cubic inches.<br /><br />The volume of 15 cookies is simply the aforecalculated 1.105616653 cubic inches times 15, which is 0.071793289 gallons.  Yes, I've used up a lot of pencil lead doing these calculations, but I want to get it right this time, and the last five hours have NOT been wasted.<br /><br />TRAY Volume<br /><br />The width of the tray inside is 221 millimeters, the length 95 millimeters, and the depth 56.5 millimeters.  The volume, of course, is simply those three numbers multiplied, which, as if you didn't know, is 0.03979426 firkins.<br /><br />The rest of the math is simple.  You convert gallons to firkins and then compare total cookie volume to tray volume.  The result, which I dare you to challenge, is the number 3.3648301288323, which means that the tray volume is a little more than three times larger than the cookie volume.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I am not an expert on the subject, but I think I am still allowed to wonder whether the outside dimensions of the package are meant to convey that there's a lot more cookie inside than it appears.  It seems obvious that if you can do that, you will sell more hogsheads of cookies per fortnight.<br /><br />If that is the intent of the people who decided on the exact packaging that I'm reviewing, and if it is not otherwise justifiable, then they are lying to us.  They are not lying by comission, because the package clearly states that the cookie contents weigh 10 ounces (283 grams), and I have verified that the contents of my exact package weigh not merely 10 ounces but rather 10.25 ounces, which is 2.5% heavier.<br /><br />No, they are lying only by omission, in that they do not state clearly or at all on the package that it is more than 3 times bigger than the cookies therein.<br /><br />I am thinking, by way of comparison, of plain old saltine crackers in four sleeves in a box.  When you look at that box you have a pretty good idea of how much volume in crackers you're gonna' get.  Even if the volume of that box is a full one third larger than the volume of the stacks of crackers therein, that's still 9 times more accurate than the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies' box.<br /><br />I rate this product with the "It's OK" rating, three stars, because it seems just that.

review/summary: Treats for Kids
review/text: The Chips Ahoy "Gooey" is a "brownie-like tasting cookie." I especially  liked the taste of the white chocolate contrasted to the surrounding rich dark chocolate. It invites dunking one in a cold glass of milk to make the chocolate experience linger even longer.<br /><br />I like the nutrition qualities, especially the 80 mg of Potassium.  A  serving (2 cookies) has only 21 grams of carbohydrate and 110 mg of sodium.  The 13 grams of sugar and 150 calories are a bit much for me but is acceptable if I eat only one serving.<br /><br />I did not like the package.  It was hard to open and then could not be resealed.  So in the dry climate where I live the cookies dry out unless you store them in another container.  However, in my house, the package did not last long.  My son and grandson emptied the package within a couple of days.<br /><br />I recommend Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge for people who can eat just one serving.  Grandchildren may need to be given limited servings, but they will love these cookies.<br />.

review/summary: Pleasant Cake Type Cookie With Strong Cocoa Taste
review/text: This is an interesting cookie that seems to have more the consistency of cake than cookie. While it is soft, it's not chewy, it's also a little short on the gooey part; the fudge filling was there but I had to look for it. The chocolate chips use semi-sweet chocolate and the overall impression is of a soft, very chocolate cookie that's not all that sweet.<br /><br />For those who prefer somewhat less sweetness this cookie may provide a perfect answer. The cookies are good and it's all too easy to surpass the published serving size of two cookies. The two cookie serving has 150 calories of which 60 come from fat. I noticed that the major oil was palm oil followed farther down the ingredients list by coconut oil and lastly soybean oil. The sodium content for two cookies was 110 mg. There appear to be around 18 cookies in the bag, 9 servings.<br /><br />I'm of the opinion that these cookies are better suited for an adult's taste buds; I think they might go well with tea or coffee and they do offer something of an unexpected taste experience.

So that stated.<br /><br />THESE COOKIES WERE FABULOUSLY DEEEEELICIOUS.  SMH.  OH SO SAD HOW DELICIOUS THESE THINGS ARE.  IF YOU LOVE CHOCOLATE THESE ARE FOR YOU!!!<br />Now mind you when I saw and thought to buy these I thought of my last endeavor with nabisco and a new product.  Those horribly nasty chocolate covered oreos.  they were a waste of my money and I was pissed that I still had a whole pack left.  smh.<br /><br />But these cookies right here...  smh.  ridiculously delicious.  smh.  Mines were gooey, chewy, and oozing chocolate on my fingers as I ate them.  I just now looked to get another cookie out of this too small 10 ounce package and was pissed that I just ate the last one.  smh.<br /><br />But then maybe it's best that the pack is only 10 ounces.  cause being this good if there were more I'd inhale the whole package of that size just as quickly.<br /><br />Don't get discouraged by the white chips on the package.  The taste of chocolate in these cookies is so delicious and so intense that the white chips, (whatever they are) become nonexistent.<br /><br />I say this.  cause I don't like white chocolate, and it's one of the main reasons I was skeptical about buying these cookies.  buy them, try them for yourself.  Totally delicious.  If Nabisco continues to knock it out the park like this, maybe they'll make a comeback in my household.  cause I had stopped buying cookies from disappointment in what I've received in the recent past.

review/summary: Yummy, not "gooey", but good.
review/text: I think Nabisco has a different definition of "gooey" than I do. These aren't what I'd call gooey. They're moist(ish) and they have some semi-solid filling with the consistency of marzipan, but they're not gooey.<br /><br />They are delicious, though. Quite so. Chocolate is one of my favorite things in the universe, and while these aren't gourmet chocolate, they are decent American chocolate. If you enjoy devil's food, you'll like these.<br /><br />My only complaint is that these cookies seem to have fewer in the package than the non-gooey variety. Whether or not the filling is worth giving up a few cookies is up to you.

review/text: These are honestly the strangest cookies, but really delicious.  I don't know how they figured it out but the "gooey" feature of these cookies make them feel like they just came out of the oven even though they are room temperature.  They are certainly very chocolately and will meet your craving for something sinful anytime you open the box.

review/summary: Based on my kid's opinion, these are some great cookies
review/text: Sigh, the problem with getting tasty-looking samples from the Amazon Vine program is that once the delivery package is opened and the product put on the shelf, it's fair game for younger family members who are always hungry and looking for a treat.  And that's what happened here. In this case, our son grabbed it up.  Here's how the conversation went:<br /><br />Me:  Where are those "Chips Ahoy!" cookies I put on the shelf?<br /><br />Son:  They were good!<br /><br />Me:  Yeah, but where's the package?  You ate ALL of them?<br /><br />Son:  Oops.  Sorry.<br /><br />Me:  I was supposed to review them for Amazon.  At least tell me something about them.<br /><br />Son:  Uh, they were REALLY GOOD!  Delicious!<br /><br />Well, there you have it.  If I had gotten a chance to try them, you would have gotten a more thoughtful and nuanced review (covering chewiness and sweetness and all sorts of other attributes), but you know what?  Maybe with a product like this, a simple enthusiastic declaration is the best endorsement.<br /><br />So, that's the opinion I'm filing here:  They were really good and delicious.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll agree with my kid's opinion when I eventually taste one myself.

review/summary: Unhealthy and below average taste
review/text: The Chewy, Gooey Megafudge cookies, while unhealthy (75 calories and 3.5 grams of fat in each cookie) also are lacking in taste.  The artificially flavored chips are dry and not appealing.  While I wasn't expecting healthy (it is Chips Ahoy! cookies after all), I was hoping for at least a tasty cookie to help with the sense of guilt for eating it in the first place.  However, with the dual combination of a poor taste and unhealthiness, I cannot recommend these cookies.<br /><br />The resealable package is a plus (hence the second star) and saves having to use a chip-clip to keep the bag sealed, but you'd be preserving a dry, unappealing cookie.

review/text: I tried these cookies and my first impression was rather positive: it's soft, super-chocolate tasting and a nice indulgent snack. Then after just eating two I felt it was a bit much. The cookie really tasted almost too sweet to the point of making me feel rather sick after eating just a few. There was also an odd aftertaste that gave me the feeling that (obviously) there are probably more chemicals packed into this cookie than there are natural, good ingredients. In all, these cookies are just okay but could be improved upon.

review/summary: Like the concept, but cookies are too crumbly and sweet.
review/text: I was excited to try these cookies, because I love Nabisco's oatmeal choco-chips softbaked cookies. The first bite and even the first cookie was okay, but I noticed that it was very sweet.  Also, it wasn't quite as melt-in-my-mouth as I had expected. Instead, these cookies are a little too crumbly (rather than soft like the softbaked ones). That means the cookies weren't very moist, despite the fudge center, which I don't think there was much of anyway. Though I love chocolate, the texture and ultra-sweetness kept me from wanting to return to the box again and again. After two weeks, even with six people in the house, the box was still unfinished.

review/summary: This is pretty darn good, if you like chocolate
review/text: I thought this Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge product was pretty darn good. I was afraid that it would be too "chocolaty" or too sweet, but it's actually a pretty good balance. A few minor complaints is that the dough on the cookie crumbles a bit easily... especially around the edges. I would've liked it more cohesive. Also, the "fudge" core wasn't quite creamy enough, as far as the texture is concerned. The fudge also would've been better if it tasted more like "dark chocolate", but instead it tastes more like hot cocoa. Despite these observations, I think these are pretty delicious cookies and definitely worth a try.

And through the years Nabisco tweaked the original chocolate chip delight.  I remember when Chewy Chips Ahoy hit the market.  They quickly replaced the hard cookie I knew and loved.  There have been many variations of the chewy version through the years, and this one takes the cake.  A soft chocolate cookie, with a fudge center, accented by white and chocolate fudge chips.  The perfect cookie for the price point.  What are you waiting for?

review/text: but "Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge" is TOO MUCH chocolate.  Seriously.  Milk doesn't even help.  In moments of weakness, I have been known to eat a whole package of chocolate chip cookies, with chocolate milk.  I was barely able to eat two of these goo-balls.  On one hand, maybe that's a good thing - it forced me to moderation.  But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.<br /><br />Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are fudge.  Basically, they are the Chips Ahoy chewy fudge cookies, slit open and filled with gooey fudge in the middle.<br /><br />Not bad - just WAY too far over the top for my taste.

Good glory, I could go into a happy coma just thinking about it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are not so good.  The fudgey middle is actually just a bigger chocolate chip, and the cookie is more crumbly and dry than chewy.  The taste is heavily dominated by all of that chocolate, and the chocolate, while not bad, is not good enough to stand on its own.<br /><br />Don't break your heart by buying these.  Just look at the picture and dream.  If you must, but the Chocofudge variety instead.  I have eaten both (nom nom *cry* nom nom) and the Megafudge surprisingly has less flavor.

review/text: I was expecting something that tasted more like the traditional CHIPS AHOY brand cookie.....This is something akin to a Frankensteinian mishmash of SOFT BATCH cookies and semi-hard fudge. The cookie itself isn't bad, but it's amazingly crumbly. The few packages I tried were practically all crumbs, with very few whole cookies in them. The fudge center was FAR from "Gooey", it was more like a melted piece of hard fudge. The concept is nice, but the execution is terrible......

review/summary: Best tasting cookie on the grocery store shelf
review/text: Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge Cookies. The name pretty much says it all. These fudge filled soft cookies are really chewy, gooey and full of fudgy morsels. They taste like a premium cookie that you'd buy at a bakery. Along with the great rich chocolate pieces you will also find small white chocolate chips also. The cookies are a smaller size, approximately two inches in diameter, which makes eating them neater than a larger cookie. Because of the softness, they do not break apart and crumble as other cookies often do either.<br /><br />The cookies are packaged in a convenient reclosable container which actually reseals itself very well (unlike some that I have tried to use). I opened and resealed the package at least six or seven times, and each time it completely closed and the cookies remained as fresh as the first time the package was opened.<br /><br />At 150 calories per two cookies, these are not a diet friendly product, but if you can possibly limit yourself to just two cookies (which is hard to do), you should be able to satisfy your sweet tooth and still keep your waistline in tact.<br /><br />I would certainly buy these cookies again and again. The taste is so good that they really could compete with cookies from a bakery.

review/summary: The taste was okay, but the texture was unpleasant.
review/text: When you eat a Chips Ahoy Chewy cookie, you anticipate a certain texture and flavor.  This cookie does not have either.<br /><br />The texture was the thing I noticed first.  Yes, the cookie is chewy.  Yes, there is a vague moistness to the middle, which has creamy chocolate.  However, the cookie, as chewy as it is, had an unpleasant, dry texture to me.  I know, how can a cookie be chewy and dry at the same time?  I have no good answers.<br /><br />What I do know is that I tried these cookies on several different occasions.  I also had one other person try these cookies, and that person's opinion was identical to mine.  I also noticed that these cookies broke easily, suggesting that the dryness was more than the perception of my tongue.<br /><br />Was there anything positive about these cookies?  Yes, these cookies had several positive aspects, though those aspects failed to overcome the texture.  The thing I liked the most was the chunks of white chocolate.  The chunks tasted like nuts to me, and they were the best thing about the cookie.  I also liked that the cookies were chewy, even though the level of moisture seemed insufficient to me.  Lastly, I thought there was a reasonable taste of chocolate in the cookie.<br /><br />With all these positive aspects, the thing that bothered me most is that this cookie did not taste like a Chips Ahoy Chewy cookie.  The taste was just okay.  I am a big fan of Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies and I love the way they taste.  These cookies fell short of what I expect from a Chips Ahoy Chewy cookie.  Rather, the cookie tasted like an imitation or perhaps a cheap generic brand to me.<br /><br />There is a lot of competition in the cookie aisle.  There has to be 100 or more varieties of cookies available.  A new cookie, such as this one, should be phenomenally good to be able to win customers away from competing brands.  However, this cookie is not phenomenally good.  I predict that either this cookie will disappear from store shelves or its formula will change.  In the meantime, you may avoid this cookie in favor of the other, better choices that exist.<br /><br />Good luck!

You take a bite and are immediately greeted with a dry-ish, crumbly texture, even though it is still kind of soft. As you chew it, the gooey chocolate inside changes it to a more pleasant texture that I thought tasted okay.  Not great.  But okay.  My wife actually had one of them and declared that she didn't need anymore, because "it wasn't worth the calories."  Fair enough.  So, I ate the rest.  However, I don't have plans to buy them any time soon.

review/summary: Surprisingly bland
review/text: How can something named "Chewy, Gooey Megafudge" be so bland and unexciting? I was expecting a decadent treat. I was all set for chewy, gooey, megafudge hedonism. Bring on the megafudge, Chips Ahoy!<br /><br />What I got was a slightly chocolatey-tasting, soft cookie that is actually pretty dry. The cookies are rather small, perhaps the diameter of a silver dollar. That's fine because I prefer to have something on the smallish side for the occasional treat and although small, these cookies are nice and plump.<br /><br />But the cookies aren't really MEGAfudge at all, more like KINDAfudge. We all know that the picture on the package rarely matches up to the actual contents, but this cookie does not ooze a fudge filling when pulled apart. There is a bit of a creamy chocolate in the center, but these cookies are too small for any substantial amount of actual fudge. And throwing in the white chocolate chips managed to actually take away from the potential chocolatey goodness. Honestly, this cookie rates a "meh" on a scale of 1-10. It's not even bad enough to hate. If this cookie were on the free cookie plate by the water cooler at work, I'd eat it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it for myself. Even my husband who is notorious for his sweet tooth said, "Eh, it's ok. I ate them because they were there."<br /><br />Another note - this cookie dried out quickly. Nabisco has a great idea with the self-sealing packaging, but neither that nor the fact that I also kept the package wrapped tightly in a Ziploc bag ('cause I'm paranoid like that) protected these cookies from drying out and going stale surprisingly quickly. If you're going to pump all those chemicals into my cookies, I should have fresh tasting cookies for quite a while. These cookies don't last long, and I wonder how they hold up in snack packs that some parents might buy for their kids' lunches?<br /><br />Ok, you don't try something called "chewy gooey megafudge" expecting any health benefits, but here are the nutritional facts:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts - 2 cookies - - 150 calories, 60 calories from fat, 7 grams of fat, 3.5 grams of saturated fat, 0 grams of trans fat, 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 2 grams of monounsaturated fat, 0 milligrams of cholesterol, 110 milligrams of sodium, 80 milligrams of potassium, 21 grams of carbohydrates, less than 1 gram of fiber, 13 grams of sugar, and 1 grams of protein)<br /><br />Considering how underwhelmed I was by the flavor, texture, and longevity of these cookies, they are just not worth the amount of fat and calories for a couple of small, rather bland cookies.<br /><br />I understand that there is a Chocofudge version of this cookie that is a more traditional chocolate chip cookie with a fudge filling. I'd try those but these KindaFudge cookies will not be in my grocery cart.

review/summary: Okay but not great.
review/text: Over the years, Chips Ahoy has gone from bad to worse.  Although these cookies don't taste bad, they are so small that it's not even worth the calories to eat them.  The package says a serving size is 31g.  How vague is that?  There are only 9 servings per package so that amounts to a few measly cookies.  At the price it's selling for, you'll be paying more for the packaging.<br /><br />But back to the cookie, if you love chocolate, then you are hit with a combination of chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips and a fudge center.  The cookie is not much to speak of but the fudge center tastes good.  Not as gooey as one would expect because the cookie is really small, hence not a lot of filling. I think kids with less discriminating tastes would like it.

review/summary: good cookies
review/text: Being prediabetic, I don't eat a lot of "store-boought" cookies, but I usually taste cookies that my husband buys.  I am quite fond of the regular Chips Ahoy cookies and think they are great to use to make ice cream sandwiches.  Being a former chocoholic, I was eager to try these new Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  They did not disappoint!  The reason that I gave them only 4 stars is that they don't come close to tasting like a homemade cookie, which is my "gold standard."  My husband, who likes regular Chips Ahoy cookies, was not a big fan of the Chewy Gooey Megafudge variety.  His veiw is "why mess with a good product?"  I believe that this flavor cookie is a nice addition to the Chips Ahoy family.  I wouldn't want to give up regular Chips Ahaoy cookies, but if you like chocolate,  you'll probably like the new flavor!

review/summary: Gooey and sweet
review/text: I'll have to hand it to the advertisers: the product is exactly as advertised--- chewy, gooey, and mega in the fudge department. If that's what you like, that's great, but I found these to be cloyingly sweet, and the super-sweetness destroyed what could have been a nice chocolate flavor.<br /><br />The packaging was also strange. The cookies came in rows; seven cookies in one row, three in another, and so on. Not really a problem but very odd.<br /><br />The cookies are very soft and indeed have a very chewy texture. They are packed with truly gooey fudge (have a napkin on hand for these) with lots of chocolate flavor. If only they weren't so terribly sweet, this would be a fine product. As it stands, it's a sugar high--- and a messy one at that--- but not a product that I'd rush out to buy.

review/summary: Gooey Fudge Goodness
review/text: I'm a little skeptical of anything from Chips Ahoy.  Let's face it, besides Famous Amos they are kind of the lowest common denominator of chocolate chip cookies.  That's what makes this new product such a surprising discovery.  This chocolate chocolate chip cookies with a creamy fudge center are really tasty and almost decadent.  My only complaints is that they tend to fall apart rather easily.<br /><br />Chocoholics take notice and give these a try!

review/text: Don't get me wrong, these cookies were good, but when you read 'Chewey Gooey Megafudge' you expect to be WOWed! These cookies were small and chocolaty, with a little creamy fudge filling, but didn't quite live up to the expectations we had from the packaging. Marketers need to be careful not to oversell their product with hype, because consumers have grown to expect more honesty in labeling. "small chocolate bites with creamy center" would have been more realistic.

review/text: I wouldn't order these if you live in a warm-weather region and if it's summertime, as the issue I had arose in transportation.  The cookies appeared to have potential, but some of them melted together by the time I opened the package.  Inherently, the flavor was adversely affected, tasting non-distinctive and partially stale.  Perhaps these are okay to buy in the store, but I don't have a precise idea of their potential because of what happened to the package delivered to me.

review/summary: Pretty good but not so Megafudge
review/text: I would have to say these chips ahoy cookies are pretty good. However, I am disappointed that they do not have more megafudge in them. They taste just like regular chips ahoy cookies with a little bit of gooey fudge in them. If they had more fudge in them then they would be considered megafudge in my opinion. If you like chips ahoy cookies then I think you will like these cookies as well but please don't expect a lot of gooey fudge in the middle. Overall I like the cookies but I deducted one star due to them being called megafudge instead of fudge.

review/summary: A great low-sodium alternative...
review/text: If your trying to watch your weight or sodium intake, this soup is a great alternative to the overly processed and heavily salted soups that you would normally find in the supermarket aisle.  There is no salt added to this soup, and the entire can (which is two servings) has a total of 100mg of sodium.  This is an extremely low number compared to 1000+ plus mgs of sodium in some of the name brands. With that being said, the soup itself is a little bland; I like to add Mrs. Dash seasonings to spice it up a bit.

review/text: The product description claims "It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors." This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether "diet" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.

review/summary: Why?
review/text: Even though I opted out of recieving "email reminders" to leave feedback/reviews I just received one from this company, so here's my review:<br /><br />I've already left a review for the SodaStream machine, and it is not complimentary due to the monopoly on the CO2.  Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax.

review/summary: The taste isn't quite right...
review/text: I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes "off". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the "sweet" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste "soapy."<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but this little gadget works as advertised. It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of "fizz."  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. The only caveat I would give at this point, is make sure you want more "gas" in your life.  My entire family is doing a lot more belching and burping than we ever have before, but we like this machine!

review/summary: Misleading discription-bad taste
review/text: They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle. How can they legally NOT call it DIET if it has artificial sweetners? Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.

review/text: Sodastream bills itself as an ecological alternative to disposable bottles.  However, if you look at the fine print on the bottles, the syrups are made in Israel.  An item that's mainly water is being shipped half way around the world.  I think that cancels out any eco benefit on this end.

The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal!<br /><br />For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this.  Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.

review/summary: What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical
review/text: The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental.

review/summary: Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.

review/text: I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.  The soda stream mix tastes very similar to rock star and costs a lot less money.  Just watch your serving size when you use the soda stream.  All canned energy drinks have a limit whereas you could drink the whole bottle of soda stream if you don't watch your serving size.

review/summary: Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible
review/text: Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Decent Set of Flavors But
review/text: You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.

(My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon "bags" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)

review/summary: Are they kidding with the price?
review/text: Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.99, $4.99, even as high as $5.99.  What are they thinking?

review/text: Over 70 years ago my Grampa took me to the beach almost every day., To me, highlight of the outing was when he bought us "Orange Crush" in the heavy dark brown bottle, from the vendor boy.  Back then the juice was unfiltered and there was even small bit of orange in it.  For many years I hve tried to find something to drink like the ORIGINAL OC.(to no avail)  I use my seltzer siphon and if I tinker with the amount of syrup I can get really close to perfect.  I am so glad I bought this, just great.,
