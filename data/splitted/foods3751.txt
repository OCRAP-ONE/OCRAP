review/text: It can be quite difficult trying to find these channa beans in my grocery stores and trying to find a nearby Indian grocer is difficult as well. Luckily, these beans were available at a reasonable price. The beans turned out wonderful with a true "earthy and nutty flavor". It made a delicious Kala Chana meal!

review/summary: Crazy Jerky
review/text: Ok, to preface this, I AM A VEGETARIAN. With that being said, I haven't had REAL beef or turkey jerky in quite some time and I have been missing it dearly. Having tried many vegetarian jerkies I can honestly say that this is by far the best! Most soy based jerkies are strangely on the oily side and the flavors are usually off. Being a "dry style" jerky fan I am pleased with the chewiness of Stonewall's and the WILD flavor. I have tried most of the other varieties of Stonewall's but none seemed to please me as much as the WILD. I'm also on Weight Watchers and have found that they are fairly low on points (4pts per bag) and are a great source of protein for vegetarians (14g). Be warned, the WILD is quite WILD, spicy spicy but in a good way!

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: The Hot Pastrami flavor is divine!  I like spicy things and just ordered another shipment of these because I went through them faster than I had anticipated.  They are moist and chewy, but not so chewy that you're still chewing to make it swallowable after all the flavor's gone.  I think they struck a nice balance.<br /><br />A caveat: If you're used to Tofurky Jurky or Primal Spirit, these will strike you as a little bit airy.  Also, these are a bit higher in fat than the other brands: 8 or 9 grams per 160-calorie package.  These ones don't really feel too oily in your mouth, though.

review/summary: Great fake jerkey
review/text: This is a great jerkey substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. If you don't like your jerkey hot, I suggest you try mild or teriyaki. Otherwise, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!

review/text: My local health food store started selling these 10 years ago and then stopped to focus more on vitamins instead of food!<br />So now I order these directly from Lumen and usually get the case of "over and unders" which contains packages that they can't sell to stores due to the weight being off. This is your best bet since I read reviews on here of receiving them stale off amazon.<br />The best flavors are the original mild, bbq beef and the teriyaki beef. I HATE the Cajun varieties, they are so dry and tough to chew.<br />They are high in fat so I usually have to make my husband hide them from me since these are a rare treat for us in the house, I could eat 4-5 bags in a row!<br />Caution if you eat too many bags over a period of a few days, you may experience gas!<br />Try ordering direct and you'll be enjoying the BEST veggie jerquee there is in the US!!!!<br />PS These are made in Louisiana, could you ask for anything more authentic besides the real thing (meaning meat)

review/text: If you're looing for a nice inexpensive jerky treat, you'd be hard pressed to find better. Stonewall's original and stonewall's original mild are some of the best tasting jerkey you'll find. What's best, is that this product is meat free. So for all you vegans out there this is especially a great treat idea. The package here is a store display container.  I keep them in the closet and when we remember we have them, it makes a perfect snack.  I think we'll be working on the box for about 2 month and that's with two jerkey freaks eating them.

review/summary: Airy and oily.
review/text: The texture on these things is all off.  For one, they're incredibly airy.  I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.

review/summary: Not perfect, but pretty good
review/text: I've tried two flavors - Pepperoni and Original Wild - and have enjoyed them both.  The texture's pretty good - nice and chewy.  The moisture level is okay, but it could be improved by being just a tiny bit more moist. There's also a little bit of an aftertaste (which I didn't find to be unpleasant, but some might).  The spice level on the Pepperoni and Original Wild flavors were perfect. The Original Wild was medium hot, so it might be a little too much for some.  I loved it though.  I recommend that people try to buy this locally before spending a lot of money on it.  I bought mine from a local vegan store online, then discovered that a large grocery chain carries it in their health food section.

review/summary: My Fave Veg Jerky
review/text: The "Original Wild" is a bit spicy for me, but "Original Mild" is spectacular, and Teriyaki Beef even better. Also like the spicy chicken one. I've tried all the veg jerky products and bewildered that none of the others come even close to this one for quality of flavor and texture. The others are loaded with sugar and taste more like candy than jerky; a couple of them are outright slimy; one was hard as a rock and flavorless. But the only time Stonewall's Jerquee ever displeased me was when the Poulsbo Market used a paper-punch to create holes along the top edge and hung them on a peg to dry out -- which I didn't realize until I got them home and they'd all been turned into hard lumps (which I ate any way). So now I have to buy them on amazon. I'll still get the fresh sushi at Poulsbo Market, that stuff's a dream, but what possessed them to poke holes in packaged foods???

review/text: I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.  I got the flavor "spicy 'chicken'" and LOVED it.  It is clear that this is a love or hate product.  I buy Primal Strips when in need of a snack I can eat in the car and they are just ok...oily and get stuck in my teeth.  Flavor is just OK.  Stonewall's are drier and puffier and chewier but somehow, don't get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I am on a low-carb diet and these are only 7 g of carbs for 13 g of protein.  I am getting a case of the original mild since it is Prime.  Would like to see more flavors available on Prime.<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a small pack first given the love/hate aspect.

review/summary: Terrible. Couldn't finish bag.
review/text: I just purchased this jerky from a local store because they recently quit carrying the kind I like in my town. I ate a piece and thought it was disgusting. I wanted to give it a chance, so I ate a couple more pieces. It has a grainy, nasty texture and a terrible burned BBQ sauce flavor. For some bizarre reason it's made out of soy flour instead of strips of soy.<br /><br />The best soy jerky I've ever had is Tasty Eats jerky, since it's chewy and had a wonderful flavor. Flavor is of course subjective, but personally I thought the taste of Stonewall's is terrible, and the consistency is nasty. It tries too hard to look like meat, which I feel is pretty irrelevant to the demographic of people that will be eating it in the first place. Luckily it's Gluten-Free, so hopefully I can pawn the leftovers on my boyfriend...

review/text: I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.  Personally, I LOVE this jerky and cannot get enough!!  My favorite flavors are the hot pastrami and teriyaki. You do have to chew quite a bit but its not the same weird chewy texture some other veg jerkys have, like primal strips.  I hate primal strips but I had them about 10 years ago and never ate once since, so if the formula has changes on those then disregard...  So maybe try a small bag of this before ordering in bulk.

review/text: I picked these up at Natural Grocers because I used to really love jerky, but am now vegetarian for four years, and I didn't like the Primal strips enough to re-purchase. I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them.

They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber. There are lower calorie veggie jerkies available, if that is a concern for you.

review/summary: Tasty veggie energy snack
review/text: I like all the Stonewall Jerquee products. The fat content is somewhat higher than I'd like for very frequent consumption, but if you have an active metabolism/don't diet, it's a great higher protein veggie snack. Very tasty and satisfying to chew. Easy to pack, toss in a purse, travel bag, etc. Helpful for vegan's/vegetarians on the go, looking for protein away from home.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.

review/text: I'm used to buying 12 poptarts for $2.89 in my area (Tennessee) so I thought 36 for $6.70 from Amazon was a slightly better deal with the prime free shipping. Well, it would have been if the poptarts tasted fresh and as good as they do when I buy them from the grocery store. They're not packaged in tinfoil like they are at my grocery store, they just don't taste the same. They'll do and I'll eat them, but I won't be buying them from amazon again, especially since the price has increased to $18 at this writing!

review/text: Kellogg's Pop Tarts hit the GMO home run! This product contains GMO Bt corn and GMO Bt Cottonseed, which are both EPA registered pesticides (when the insects bite into the crops, their stomachs explode - should kids be eating these chemicals? Not in my opinion) and RoundUp Ready GMO soy, corn and sugar which have been genetically engineered in a lab by inserting foreign genes, to withstand heavy doses of a chemical called glyphosate that is linked to birth defects and cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases and more. Yes, Kellogg's hit a HOME RUN with 4 GMOs in these Pop Tarts. The only thing missing for a grand slam is GMO Canola. JUST LABEL IT, Kellog! Stop the deceptive lack of labeling. Vote Yes on Prop. 37! I don't feed these toxins to my family. Wouldn't feed them to any living thing on the planet.

review/text: Nothing wrong with the poptarts themselves. Quality of the product is good. However, this particular product offering is for a total of 36 poptarts, not 36 packages. You'll get 3 boxes inside one big box. Each of the three small boxes contain 6 two-poptart packages. They are wrapped in heavy labeled foil type wrapping. These are the packages you'll see in a vending machine or used at a fund raiser type thing. Looks like you're better off buying these at wal-mart or a local grocery store because this isn't cheaper. If you have vending machines, probably a good deal.

review/text: Well, they tasted fine but they were a broken, crumbled mess.  I could live with it if it was just me, but my wife hated them.  (I cleaned my own mess up but the kids didn't.  And they made a lot bigger mess than the store-bought version.)  In retrospect, maybe it wasn't such a good idea buying mail-order food that's susceptible to breakage.  Imagine buying a bag of potato chips through the mail... :)

review/summary: slightly different than grocery store bought, but better, maybe?  read...
review/text: So this is basically like the display box you'd see at a 7-11 full of pop tarts.  Not that I've actually ever seen pop tarts on display like that.  But that's how it's designed.  The box is the display and the pop tarts (two to a package) aren't in blank foil like the grocery store version - rather, they're in bright colored branded pop tart wrapping. So each packet of two pop tarts looks like something you'd grab off the counter and buy individually.  So that's not a bad thing, just an observation.<br /><br />What's different about the pop tarts themselves is that they appear to be designed NOT to be toasted.  They're actually flakier than the grocery store version so they crumble quite easily when you pull them out of the bag.  Be careful when eating these in your wife's brand new car.  Ahem.  And that makes sense too - because if you were to buy these as an individual serving at a convenience store, odds are you wouldn't have access to a toaster in the first place.  And if you're like me, you don't toast them to begin with.<br /><br />So that being said, if you're not a pop tart toaster, then these are actually better made exactly for that purpose!  Now I haven't toasted one yet so I don't know if they toast just as well, so I can't review on that.  I'll post when I do!  But I can say that quality control of the frosting is MUCH better with these versions over the grocery store version as there's significantly more even distribution of frosting to pastry.  In the grocery store version I've actually had one of my kids throw a pop tarts back at me because of its poor frosting-to-pastry ratio.  Shame on you... whoever you are Mr. Pop Tart Maker!  But in this CostCo sized carton of pop tarts, perhaps because they're chancing that the one pop tart you pull from the box may be your last one, they do a much better job evening out and applying the white gold.<br /><br />So that's it - try it, you'll see what I mean.  It's not worse, it's different, and for grab-n-go non-toasters, you might actually prefer.  I accidentally bought two boxes as well, so I'll let you know how they taste (errr toast?) after the apocalypse being as I'm sure I'll still have plenty by then.

review/text: These Pop-Tarts have a delicious flavor with a crisp but not overbearing frosting top layer.  Each pair of pastries come wrapped in a more robust plastic wrapper than the typical light foil you might expect in traditional packagings.  Expiration date on my shipment is nearly six months down the road, so more than enough time to munch them down.  Of note: price seems to fluctuate a bit - it rose nearly $4 above my purchase price a day after order execution.

review/summary: Held the fruit paste for strange things.
review/text: Once you've discovered the creatures these fruitily filled breaded concoctions attract, you'll line the lower decks of your three story house on the hill with at least 30 popped tarts. I say popped because they punch, they rub hard against your hands and rise up when heated. So place them, around two meters apart, on the wooden slates, down the stairs, into the grass and up to the tree where the creatures live. They will ramblemancy up to you, attempting to use magic and coax the birds into accomplished co-attackers. The preface co is meaningless. Remember this before buying this. This review is true, it is a true recollection of pop tarts, the box and the colour red. Once they are done with the ramblemancy, they will eat nine of the 30 and then twelve more. The sleep they reach, from sugar filled blood, will make them vulnerable to moving, moving away to your most disliked disdainful neighbours.<br /><br />I hope this helps. I honestly hope it helps.

I put it in a nice little sprinkler container and have a sprinkle on every latte I make. I wish Starbucks used this chocolate because what ever they use is awful so I like the lattes I make at home with my own Saeco espresso machine better. I, also, make my grandkids hot chocolate and they love it. I have not had any ground sweet chocolate that tastes as wonderful as this.

When my local stores stopped carrying it, I had to start buying online.<br /><br />Presumably because of some sort of non-competitive clause, the other vendor doesn't sell this product in my area. So I needed to purchase directly from Ghirardelli, which charges over $9 for shipping. It arrived packed in those awful Styrofoam peanuts.

I just nuke a not-quite-full 10- or 12-ounce mug of 2% milk, stir in a heaping spoonful of this powder and yum!, what a great send-off into the Land of Nod for me, or treat for visitors coming in from the cold.  At least as satisfying and considerably less caloric than an equivalent dose of Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Daz or chocolate anything else that I can think of. Not sure why, but I  find it tastes even better with low fat milk than regular. The label says 140 calories for 1/4 cup, which is their recommended amount for adding to 8 oz. of milk--a somewhat higher ratio of powder to milk than I use.<br /><br />If you're  wary of investing in three pounds of this stuff before you know if it's for you, you can find 1-pound cans here on Amazon (but at a far less favorable price-per-pound) and at most supermarkets...although it can be something of a challenge to know where to look, as it's almost never in the same aisle as chocolate drink mixes, probably because the "Ground Chocolate" portion of its name is in prominent type and the "and Cocoa" is much smaller. On the other hand, if you opt for this 3-pounder and it doesn't turn out to be your be-all, end-all choice for hot chocolate, or  drinks mentioned by other reviewers here, you'll find some appetizing looking recipes for other uses on the label. (Haven't tried any of these myself.)

I've been able to make several different coffee drinks at home for less than the coffee shops thanks to this stuff! It can be used for hot chocolate, baking, or other things as well, but it's been so good in coffee that I haven't used it for anything else yet. Great stuff!

review/summary: Best food product since butter.
review/text: I love this stuff.  Unfortunately, many grocery stores quit carrying it, but I'm glad I could trust amazon to find it.  You can frequently use this garlic juice as a healthy replacement to oil, and to be honest, it usually tastes better than oil anyway.  I also use it as a flavorful non-stick spray on my grill and pans.  This stuff truly is the best and most versatile food product since butter.  I like to think of it as almost the duct tape of foods.

review/summary: I am an Americolor convert!
review/text: When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton.  I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton.  Until now.  I am officially an Americolor convert.  These colors are so amazingly vibrant!  And using them to make paint (with clear vanilla), to paint on fondant and gumpaste is a TREAT.  They are some much smoother and easier to use and the colors are so brilliant I doubt I will ever buy Wilton color again.  I still love many, many things Wilton - but for color I'm hooked on Americolor!

review/summary: Really, REALLY black!
review/text: I read the previous reviews of AmeriColor's Super Black icing coloring and decided to give it a try to make my daughter's zebra-striped birthday cake. I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!). It turned snow-white marshmallow fondant BLACK, with very little of the gel and no noticeable taste difference. I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on.

review/text: I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday.  The cake did indeed look black after mixing this coloring with the chocolate frosting, so I'd say it works.  It will also color your tongue bluish but that's just par for the course.  My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success.

review/summary: Be aware that the photo is NOT what you will get
review/text: I finally received the color that I ordered - there was a mixup on the seller's end, but they did<br />get right on it and send out the right color.  I have not used it yet - I bought it for special cupcakes<br />for an event in a few days. I'll add to the review when we have actually used the product.<br /><br />I did want to mention, though, for those who think this might be a really great deal - the bottle<br />you see in the photo is NOT the bottle you are purchasing. You are getting one of the very small (under 3" tall)<br />drop bottles, not one of the large ones shown in the photograph. I wanted to point that out, because for people who<br />are only looking at the photos, it is misleading. Not sure why some sellers feel the need to be sneaky, but<br />I guess they try for more sales that way.<br /><br />I'll be back to review the actual gel once we are done with the project.<br />Just don't expect the big bottle when you purchase from this listing.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I am now a HUGE fan of the gel coloring!<br />It worked like a dream, gave us a beautiful frosting that looked like black leather (but soft).<br />No purples or blues, no weird shades - just great color.<br />Now I will probably have to get more colors, because with these, I might start decorating cupcakes again!<br />I am adding a photo of our cookout cupcakes that we used the frosting for... it all looked great!

review/text: I used this to make rocky candy as meth for a costume prop. I dressed as Hiesenburg from Breaking Bad. It does work, I used two drops, but you have to be careful. Because boiling sugar, corn syrup and hot water makes a yellowish color, adding too little, too much or stirring too much can change to a green color. Took me three tries (first Americolor Sky Blue, second McKormick Neon Blue and third Americolor Sky Blue again), but I got it eventually.

review/text: I bought these to try - I love potatoes and garlic so I figured it'd be a good combination. I can't agree with the reviewers who say there is too much garlic.  It's barely a hit and they are certianly not salty.  I'm wondering if the reviewer who found them too salty didn't blend the product sufficiently.  As for garlic overload, I think only someone who doesn't like garlic much might find them unsavory.  I've discovered that there are people who claim to not like something so when they know there is even a hint of it they over-dramatize it.  Nevertheless, the potatoes are delicious and go wonderfully with salmon and salad.  If you find them a little over flavored I'd suggest getting a regular potato mix and blending the two together :)

review/text: These biscotti are wonderful!  Great to dunk in coffee and hot chocolate, or just by themselves for a late nite snack.  They have chunks of pistacios and a generous coating of chocolate on the flat side. Individually wrapped to ensure freshness - a very nice treat!
