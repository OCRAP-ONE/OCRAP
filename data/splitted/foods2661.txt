review/text: Both my 19 year old cats love this. I decided to use Amazon's subscribe and save plan so I'd always have a supply on hand.  With the 15% discount, the price is about $.24 less than the grocery store's.<br />They also like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NVJFQ">Whiskas Temptations Creamy Dairy Flavour Treats for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> flavor.

review/summary: Frankenstein's Little Monsters' Treats
review/text: Of course, my cats deserve only the best so I began giving them treats to elicit a desired behavior in them.  Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since "Treat Time" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?  YIKES!

review/summary: Does wonders for bad breath
review/text: We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love, I only like...
review/text: Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.

review/summary: RUIN YOUR LIFE
review/text: I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH.

review/summary: Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!
review/text: My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.  Until I found this one.  I was really happy to finally find something to reward her, or get her to come to me when called.  These treats have petroleum in them.  My cat loves Vaseline, so it makes sense that she likes these.  I have noticed a decrease in the frequency of her throwing up.  The great surprise that I found is that her fur has become softer!  I know it must be the petroleum in these that is coating her fur as well.  I have to feed her a special cat food because she has a tendancy towards the urinary tract infection, and since I have been doing that, her fur has been more coarse and dry.  These treats have brought back the softness to her fur.  I'm sold, and I will be buying these from now one.  My very picky cat loves them!

review/text: My four cats adore this.  They split one bag every night.  I mistakenly gave some  to a stray cat that I feed and he would not leave the deck until I gave him a whole bag.  My mother's cat is also addicted and requires a hand full every day.  She stares pointedly between my mother and her food bowl until she gets enough.<br /><br />Since one my cats has some dental problems this cat food is great as a treat that is good for them.

My female will stare at or attempt to get into the drawer where I store them. I can't feed them to my male with my fingers because he gets so excited he tries to eat my finger, too. These are definitely a favorite.

review/text: These are truly temptations for our cats and will have them running from any side of the house.  When you open the bag, they actually smell like "french fries" (two of us confirm this) so the smell from the human side is not bad.  We have tried so many other treats but the Whiskas Temptations Chicken flavor are definitely a favorite.<br /><br />They can put weight on your cat quickly and certainly are not meant to be a diet.  But for treats, they are great and our cats really love them.  If our 5 love them, the chances are high that your cats will love them too!

review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on "people food"... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!

review/text: cats - if you are owned by a cat you know how fussy they can be.  My adopted feral cat just loves these treats.  I love spoiling her but they are so expensive at the grocery store.  Now, thansk to Amazon.com I can buy them in multiples. The price is cheaper, and what can I say about the convenience of having them shipped to the door!

review/summary: Hairball formula doesn't seem to tasty
review/text: My wife's cats love all the temptation treats.  They will eat these becuase they are gluttons but it is obvious they are not that keen to the taste or the way it makes them feel.<br /><br />I noticed no difference with hairballs using these treats.  If you need something for the hairballs get the brown barley or malt paste.  That stuff works real good and some cats actually like the taste.

What am I going to do? His Royal Majesty (I mean the cat, of course) MUST have his Catnip Temptations! He's addicted. I can't drive down there in the winter when the roads are bad (like right now). He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab.

review/summary: My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.
review/text: Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.

Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/text: Although I love gourmet black licorice -- salty, chewy, sweet, hard, you name it -- I confess I also go for strawberry Twizzlers. You know you are basically eating plastic when you eat a Twizzler, but they have their appeal. I had tried other natural strawberry licorice in the past, but found the molasses taste too strong and too out of place for a fruit licorice product. Also, with many of the natural strawberry licorices the texture was too sort-of-crumbly. I LOVE this product. It has a great strawberry flavor (not generic berry but actual strawberry), and it has a great consistency. I found it the softest of the Newman's Own licorices, and maybe because of that it was the only one that seemed slightly sticky to the touch (tho not in a way that got your fingers sticky at all), but it was 100% appealing. And best of all, look at these stats: TWIZZLERS (SERVING SIZE -- 43g) 18g Sugar, 95mg Sodium, no fiber, and less than 1g of protein. Artificial color/flavor. NEWMAN'S OWN (SERVING SIZE 42G)10g Sugar, 5mg of sodium, 2g of Protein, 2g of fiber, some calcium and iron and actual licorice extract. These twists are GOOD FOR YOU BODY AND SOUL!!

review/summary: Great Taste and Texture
review/text: I'll agree with the 5 Star reviewer... these taste like real strawberry and have a good texture and flavor.  I love Twizzlers, esp the Black Licorice.  Nothing wrong with Twizzlers as a standard to judge from but these are a different product.  These are more expensive than Twizzlers and you can tell the product is a higher quality.  Give the Twizzlers to the kids at a lower price and eat these slowly as a more expensive adult treat.  Go to a organic grocery like Whole Foods and try them first.  Then buy these on Amazon to save money.

review/summary: Very nicely packaged but HUGE disappointment.
review/text: This is the first Paul Newman product that I have tried that didn't taste good.  The product is very nicely packaged but, after that, it goes downhill pretty quickly.  I have had "healthy licorice" before and it tasted much better than this product.  Really, really, really disapointed.

review/text: These are a hit with our 3 year old, who has a nut intolerance. He loves the crunchy snacks and I love the fact that these are organic, nut-free and low sugar. The box has 5 individual snack packs, which make an easy lunchbox snack. They have a spot on the individual snack pack packaging where you can write a note to your child, which is so cute! I'm just thrilled to find that someone is making a sunflower butter (not peanut butter) snack for kids who have nut allergies/sensitivities.

review/summary: Sunny Buddies best snacks
review/text: With back to school just around the corner I was looking for new snacks to put in my kids lunches.  Well, I've found a winner!! Sunny Buddies are a great snack for at home, on the go and for my kid's lunches. My 8, 6 and 3 year old all love them!  My 8 yr old said "they're great; crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  It tastes like peanut butter & jelly!"  But what's so great is Sunny Buddies is actually NUT FREE, which makes it a perfect snack for school.  Something I love is that the back of the package has a spot to write the kids messages to send in their lunch boxes.  Sunny Buddies are a great addition to our families lunches and snacktime.

review/text: My daughter's preschool has a separate table for the kiddos that have peanut allergies. . .some other schools don't allow peanuts on campus at all!!  I'm so thankful to have found these yummy snacks for my child's lunch box! They are organic (yay!), easy to open (she can tear it open herself without needing the teacher's help), yummy (who knew sunflower seed butter was so good), and they are peanut free!  These are a lunchbox must - also love that I can write her a note!!<br /><br />I also tried these with my almost 1yr old - he loves all kinds of foods - and this is a favorite! It is so easy to stash a pack in my diaper bag for when he needs a little something to get him through!

Sunny buddies taste like little mini crunchy PB & J with out the nuts and instead use sunflower butter! My kids were fighting over the last packet the other day (which says a lot since they are both pretty picky eaters) and were dividing them up. I am definitely going to be buying these again.

review/summary: They are Candy Bandits
review/text: I love Red Vines and all of their products and I give them 5*.  I am giving Candy Bandits a 1* because they literally are Bandits.  I'm serving over in Afghanistan right now and I wanted to get some red ropes.  I didn't notice the shipping total for this product until after I had already had it shipped.  The total for the box of red ropes was $39.99 and the total for shipping was $37.05.  I didn't realize this shipping price because I ordered other items at the same time.  But $37.05 for shipping is uncalled for and outright robbery on their part.  To make it worse, they used a USPS FLAT RATE BOX.  My family sends me packages all the time in the USPS Flat rate box and like it says, it's a FLAT RATE!  They added an extra $20 dollars to the price of shipping because it's to an APO.  Good product bad service, find a better vendor for this.

review/text: I have eaten these for years - even before Sunkist sold them to Jelly Belly. I don't mind paying the $10.00 per pound, but this shipment was definately on "the old and turning hard side"......The flavor of "sharp citrus" was still there so I chose to not send them back, but believe that someone could find a better way for them to keep their freshness. ---Maybe even at the factory level.  Please do not put them on the "back burner"<br /><br />These are a wonderful candies.  The fact that they are individually wrapped make them that much more attractive to serving in public places....Also good to put out for any holiday.  Please give them more "play for the public, also.<br /><br />Thank you........Connie Boltz

I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone.

review/text: I have to agree with the previous posters that this is by far the most delicious gluten free pasta I have tried! However do not purchase it if you have peanut allergies. Each package bears a warning label stating "This product is not recommended for individuals with peanut allergies. Contains Lupin flour and Lupin protein". This warning did not appear anywhere in the product description on Amazon, and still does not appear today. Just wanted to post this to warn people with peanut allergies who may not be familiar with Lupin Flour.

My friend (who does not eat a gluten-free diet) tasted it and said it tasted just like "regular" pasta!

I only had a 7" hanging planter and was hesitant about repotting this plant into a pot that large (it arrived growing in a 4" pot) thinking it might be too much of a skip in size.  However, when I saw the roots and tubers, I knew this pot was the right choice.  This plant is ready to take off and grow.  I'm going to hang it in by my kitchen window where it will get filtered sunlight.  So excited to see it grow.  Highly recommend this plant.

review/text: This is a small muffin mix.  The package says it will make 5 standard sized muffins; however, I use it to make 18 mini muffins for lunch boxes.  As other reviewers have noted, the blueberry chips are artificial, and not real; however, I don't find that this detracts from the taste.  Note that to make these more nutritious, I always use only 1/4 cup water and 1 egg instead of the 1/2 cup water the package calls for.  I also stir in 1 tsp of powdered milk with the dry ingredients before I add the liquid.  To make them a little fancier, you can sprinkle a little sugar atop each before baking; the kids love it!

review/text: If we have company for breakfast it is not uncommon to make a batch of muffins for breakfast with coffee.  Everybody seems to like muffins and Betty Crocker seems to do everything involved with baking very well.  With this mix you just add � cup of water and bake and in 16 to 21 minutes you have a fast and delicious muffin to enjoy.  Each pouch makes 6 servings and they are really good.  Eat them warm with a little melted butter and you will get a smile on your face.<br /><br />I have included a photo of the nutrition data for your review.  Making these muffins is fast and easy and it will make your breakfast something special to start the day with.  We love this product!
