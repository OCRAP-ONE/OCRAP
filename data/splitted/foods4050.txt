review/summary: only way my 20 month old will eat green veggies!
review/text: My daughter LOVES these.  She won't eat broccoli, peas, spinach, etc. unless they are pureed or in these pouches.  These make a great packable snack and I know she's getting some good nutrition in.  A note to parents of younger children - my daughter only recently figured out how to squeeze the pouch to eat one of these.  Have patience if your kiddo is younger!<br />Subscribe and save is a great way to keep a steady supply of these around!

review/text: If your child is anything like mine, he or she does not like vegetables and it's a constant struggle to get them to even try a bite. The Peter Rabbit Organics makes getting kids to eat their veggies a problem no more! With apple as the main ingredient and an applesauce consistency, my son will finally eat something I want him to. The pouches are convenient to pack and go. Great line of kid's food products.

review/text: My 2.5 year old will not eat any vegetables right now. He barely eats anything! But he loves all things fruit, and these are no exception. I have also bought Peter Rabbit Organics Sweet Potato/Corn/Apple and Carrot/Squash/Apple blend. He eats them all with no problem.

review/text: I am loving being a father... and despite my best culinary attempts, pasta with olive oil or mac'n'cheese; how do I get her to eat the veggies? I bought this as a snack, but after last nights overly cooked veggies, found that they can be good side dishes as well.<br /><br />My little one likes the the green A LOT vs the yellow, just bought the brown; we will let you know.  So far, HUGE success.  Great for lunch on the go or to make up for a single man's cooking.  Either way a must have in winning the war that is meal time with a toddler.

review/text: Peter Rabbit Organics has successfully created a product that has your baby in mind. I have 3 kids: 8, 7, 8 months. They will all eat all the flavors happily. If you had time to make your own baby food, wouldn't you make it pure? Would you have a huge problem putting a apple in it to mask some of the less flavorful veggies like spinach? I have bought plenty of baby food over the years and with so many options I have decided to actually look at the labels these days- Peter Rabbit Organics is the best on the market. Its a family centered company that is totally focused on your baby!

review/summary: On the verge of being good, but something's missing
review/text: I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa.

review/text: Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as "Delicious and Decadent"  and they are being extremely modest.

review/text: I love oatmeal, but I've struggled to find a kind that was easy to fix and not too sugary, but not your basic boring oats either.  For a while I used Quaker instant Low Sugar packets, but they just add artificial sweetener to it, which makes it still waaaay too sweet for my taste.  That's why I LOVE Holly's oatmeal... it has just a hint of sweetness, and you can always add more (a little syrup or brown sugar) if you need it.  Just add milk and it cooks up on the stove in less than 10 minutes.  The website has instructions for the microwave, though I haven't tried it yet.  The goji berries are an interesting addition, though they are extremely mild in flavor.  I catch a hint of green tea taste when I bite into them.  Really, all the flavors are great.  This is my go-to snack!

review/summary: Better than oatmeal in so many ways
review/text: Worth every penny. This is MORE than regular oatmeal. It's heartier and has more to offer, and it is DELICIOUS. I make my oatmeal with water, and don't need to add any sweetener. Sometimes, I add more dried fruit (like cranberries), but it's fine on its own as well. I'm also on WW, have lost 25 lbs, and love Holly's as part of a filling breakfast or snack. Here's from Holly's website about the nutrition:<br /><br />"Holly's has more protein (9 grams) and soluble fiber (4 grams) than any other oatmeal.  There's no salt, no saturated fat, no trans fat and no cholesterol.  Holly's is a hearty and unique blend of seven whole grains cooked in soy milk. Think of the creaminess of instant hot cereal with the chewiness of long cooked grains - that's the texture of Holly's."<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better myself and can't wait to run out so I can try the other flavors!

review/text: We stopped buying the Kraft mac n' cheese once we got started on Annie's products. The cheese sauce tastes more like real cheese than the sweet, overprocessed Kraft sauce. Once you acquire a taste for Annie's, there's no going back! On the other hand, the kids' friends who come over for lunch often turn up their noses at our Annie's mac and cheese, because they are so accustomed to Kraft or the like. I like that Annie's are all-natural, too, but it's mainly the taste that keeps me coming back for more. A note about the shell kind: you get more for your money than the bunny or Arthur shapes. The kids love the cute shapes, so we buy both, but the shells are a better deal.

It used to be 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk; now it calls for 1/4 cup of milk, which is why the outcome is so runny and yucky. My children have never eaten Kraft mac & cheese, so we were comparing the difference in taste with the original Annies. I honestly expect that my family will wean themselves of Annies mac & cheese because the flavor is that disappointing and bland.

review/summary: Annie's Delicious Mac and Cheese
review/text: This is my kids' favorite mac and cheese. They like this one better than Kraft! :)I have tried all of the other "healthier" or "organic" Mac and Cheeses--Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, the various Annie'e etc. This one is the best and the "cheesiest".<br />It is so nice to order it from Amazon--great price and I can order a case and it shows up at my house two days later with free shipping. Great!

review/summary: weird taste
review/text: I bought some because I love mac and cheese, and lived off the kraft ones in college. However, I became concerned about the laundry list of chemicals kraft uses,including Yellow # 5. This box uses annatto and beta carotene for coloring.<br /><br />Its difficult to put in words what this taste like. On one hand its utterly bland and flavorless, yet it also leaves a weird sharp chemical like aftertaste in your mouth. I've tried the white cheddar one as well and it had a similar taste. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I like the fact that it does not use yellow #5 for coloring, but I don't think I'll be giving Annie's pasta another chance.

review/text: Annie's is simply the best.  I don't know what some of these other reviewers are talking about.  It does take a while to get kids used to the taste of real food versus whatever is in Kraft.  But - it's simply a great product.  I cook it two boxes at a time so we'll have leftovers.  I recommend being sure to add butter.  And plain yogurt is a great substitute for the milk (as someone else suggested)  I'll never go back to Kraft!

review/summary: Way overrated
review/text: I had seen Annie`s advertised along side of kraft for years but never  took the leap until recently and now I wish I hadnt.  First off the overall portion size is small and they use a very small pasta shell (it has to be seen to be believed). You get more pasta not to mention much bigger pasta shells in the Kraft mac and cheese version and personally I think they taste better despite not being organic.  Perhaps if youre just buying this for children this might suffice but if youre looking to eat this as a meal or even as a side and there`s more than one person and/or you have even an average appetite I`d look elsewhere or just plan on cooking two boxes.  As far as flavor is concerned and the final product... I followed the directions and mixed the recommended amount of milk with the powder cheese mix and it came out more like soup than anything even closely resembling mac and cheese.  Not sure what they were going for here but I definitely dont get what all these 5-star reviews are about.  I even tried adding a few slices of kraft cheddar and it still was soupy.  Then I substituted margarin for milk as some other reviewers had suggested and although it was more palatable (only reason I didnt give it one star) I was still very disappointed.  There was hardly enough cheese for half the shells muchless the entire box.  Maybe if they used larger shells and gave you a lot more of the powder cheese Id consider reviewing it again but given the portion police state we live in I doubt either will happen.  In conclusion, if you like eating mac and cheese like u do your cereal in the morning then this version of annie`s is for u, if not, try Kraft (not the powdered version) and youll be much happier for having done so.

review/summary: TASTY
review/text: I'm not an expert on macaroni cheese from a box. I love the real thing, but it is time consuming. I've tried Kraft Macaroni Cheese, but I wasn't impressed. I read the good reviews for this Annie's product. I wanted to get the subscription to save money, but 12 packets was too many to buy, when I didn't even know if I would like it.<br /><br />I went to Walmarts and was lucky to get a packet, they didn't have many. I just compared the prices, in Walmart it costs $1.62 a box. On Amazon with the subscription, a box costs $1.23, that's a big saving.<br /><br />I made it yesterday, and mixed in a little grated mature cheddar, after it was cooked, then put it under the grill to melt the cheese. I was going to eat half and heat the rest up today, it was quite a lot for one person. It tasted so good, I ended eating all of it! If you like mature cheddar you'll probably like this. It is great with ketchup on or slices of tomatoes added with the cheddar before grilling it. It tastes almost as good as the reat thing.<br /><br />I ordered it on subscription yesterday, I can't wait to try it again.

review/text: Don't be swayed by what some reviewers are saying about Annie's Natural Shells and Aged Cheddar Mac and Cheese. I almost didn't purchase this product because of some of the reviews I read on here, but I'm glad I did. It's not only healthy and fast, but actually pretty tasty too. If you're expecting something all natural that tastes like Kraft, you're going to be disappointed. Kraft's sauce is thicker and sweeter, but Annie's sauce tastes less processed and has a better all-around flavor. I prefer the Aged Cheddar Mac and Cheese to the White Cheddar one (which was very bland). Try adding a little extra butter to enhance the flavor of the sauce.

review/summary: Annie's Mac & Aged Cheddar Cheese Shells
review/text: Growing up I thought I hated Mac&Cheese.  I was the weirdest kid on the planet.  But as I grew up, and experienced other Mac&Cheeses I came to the realization that it wasn't that I hated it; it was that all I had ever experienced was that gross neon orange stuff in the blue box.  Since then, I've moved on to liking more than the homemade stuff, but it still has to be a pretty good product if I'm going to eat it out of the box.  And this Annie's Mac&Cheese qualifies for that.<br /><br />I like Annie's because the brand represents natural and organic and everything that makes you feel good about the world and yourself.  They use quality, real ingredients, and the taste is usually good.  They also make an effort to be Green in their business practices, which is always a pleasant attribute for a company.  And even if their food is still technically junk food; at least its a healthier junk food that you can feel ok sneaking into your diet once in awhile.<br /><br />The ingredients are really what make this product a good one.  Organic pasta, real cheese, and annatto for the coloring, and a few other ingredients; the ingredient list is small and for a boxed product that's rare to find.  Even better is the fact that for mac and cheese, this product doesn't have a lot of fat or calories in comparison to other cheesy meals.  There's no artificial flavorings or colorings, and they even throw in some calcium so you can pretend you're getting your vitamins.  Not a super food, but one that's good enough to cheat with.<br /><br />The taste wasn't as good as a homemade mac and cheese, but for a boxed food it was pretty good.  Preparing it the way the directions state made it a little watery, but every once in awhile you'd break into a clump of seasoning that hadn't dissolved and get a rush of cheddar.  Which might sound disgusting, but I actually enjoyed it.  The noodles themselves didn't have an abundance of flavor, but the cheese sauce covered that aspect and it was a respectable enough cheesy taste for a boxed mac and cheese.<br /><br />The noodles cooked up to a little past al dente and were firm to the teeth.  Not too mushy but not undercooked either by the suggested stove top method of cooking.  And it really did only take about 10 minutes.  Cooking it is a simple enough process that is quick enough for someone needing a small meal or a side dish to go with the rest of dinner.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this product again.  Maybe try it as a meal with some chicken or other type of dish.  I like that I could have a quick mac and cheese that wasn't disgusting and was even a bit healthy too.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I've bought this a long time and there's one thing you have to do. Don't add all that milk. I only use about a teaspoonful (if that much) so the sauce isn't all drippy. I've read the complaints about the nasty watery sauce and this takes care of it for me. I've eaten the usual boxed  mac & cheese and even found rat hairs in one several times. (I won't tell you the brand but it was a major one). So, I won't eat anything but Annie's. It's costs more but it's worth it. I wouldn't eat anything else.

This is the only natural version I have found with orange cheese.<br /><br />I do make it with butter which the directions say is optional, but I think its better with a creamier sauce.  Its also really good with a bit of cream cheese melted in if I am low on butter.

I couldn't find the exact style we bought, but the lable on this box was almost identical to the other Annies.  I was WRONG, this was awful - the cheese was a powder instead of the pre-mixed packet that came in our original box.  It was watery and smelled like vomit.  It left a bad after-taste.

review/summary: If you like eating GLUE
review/text: I buy quality, more natural mac & cheese quite regularly and was a long time customer of Annie's products. Unfortunately I often found that glue and other contaminants (which spark when heated) made it into the finished products Annie's sells. I contacted the company about this and was ignored twice before receiving very brief a reply that there was no danger to the consumer. Call me skeptical but eating glue (it's probably from the sealant used on the box tops) caked to the pasta does not seem to me like a good idea, and I wasn't exactly thrilled with Annie's customer service, which was mostly dismissive (ignored my first two missives to them). There are plenty of great products and companies out there. I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese now, and actually prefer their spirals and elbows to Annie's shells as these also cook much faster than shells.  Furthermore, Back To Nature mac & cheese has the added benefit of employing vegetarian friendly enzymes in their cheese culture, as opposed to Annie's which does not uses animal enzymes. All in all there's no sense taking a chance on eating toxic substances when looking for a healthier alternative to the chemically heavy products from Kraft and the like.

(I don't care for Kraft either).<br /><br />The ingredients are better in Annies Homegrown Mac & Cheese, so if I could stand the taste, I'd eat it without question.  But the taste is, is my opinion, acidic and just bad.  Almost like another reviewer said : vomit-like.<br /><br />Now what will I do with the case that is left?

review/summary: Really Great Snack...Not sure what others are talking about???
review/text: My review is for the Triple Berry Crunch granola in the 12 oz bag.  I had not tried this particular flavor before but had tried the Fruit and Nut variety in a free sample.  I was looking online to purchase the Fruit and Nut and found the Triple Berry which had less fat and calories and so I bought that instead.  At Amazon's subscribe savings plus the current discount, the cost is less than $3 a bag which is great!  This product tastes great, has a great texture, and is great to take along in little zip loc bags for a snack.  My children ask for it and eat it by the handfull.  I've since gone back and ordered more of the other flavors of this granola.  The company has a website with all their nutrition information listed so you can check all that out and compare flavors in detail before you decide.  My only somewhat negative comment about this product is that I wish it had a few more berries in it (what couldn't use more berries??) and that it came in more of a cluster form so my toddlers could eat it a little easier.  We've not experienced any of the tasteless choke and gagging that others have mentioned, nor did I find the product to be overly priced as someone else had said.  In fact, we've found quite the opposite and will be stocking this product and other flavors of it on a regular basis.

review/summary: Excellent quality, flavor, and eat-ability...and Amazon's price can't be beat!
review/text: I first purchased Bear Naked Low-Sugar granola from a brick/mortar grocery store...for $4.59 for the 12-ounce bag.  I loved it, and keep it in my office at work to incorporate into any flavor of yogurt or to satisfy those late afternoon munchies.  It's nutritious, delicious, and wholesome.  The Amazon price is an absolute steal for this product -- over $1 less per bag than you might pay at a store down the street!<br /><br />Having tried Bear Naked's other products, I can also assure you that you are not sacrificing flavor or texture by choosing the low-sugar option.

review/summary: Granola I will absolutely purchase again!
review/text: I have been reading some of the other reviews and I'm not sure we're even eating the same product. I cannot attest to what their older version of this granola was like as I started eating it in fall of 2010.<br /><br />I had been searching, and nearly gave up, trying to find a granola that was not ridiculously high in sugar. I was pregnant at the time and was taking serious consideration as to what was going into my body. ((Brewer Pregnancy Diet)) I found these at the local grocery store and decided they were worth a try. I picked up the Triple Berry Crunch as well as the Bear Naked Peak Flax Oat's and Honey. They're GREAT! (Tony the Tiger voice)<br /><br />I purchase plain yogurt now and add this granola to it. Much better nutrition than 98% of the other granolas on the shelf in the health/natural food section.<br /><br />Low in fat and 4g of sugar in the Triple Berry Crunch and TASTY!! When not in my yogurt, I keep a mixed back of this, with the Oat's and Honey flax to snack on at work. Good stuff!

Now the product is lacking in flavor and lacking in some ingredients, but still nice aromatic bouquet.  It's NOT the same excitement my taste buds got  orginally from  the product.  I DON'T think it's a fluk and every bag is the same.  I've tried at least two bags of the new shipment already and every bit taste the same.  Portions "appear" to be slightly down too. I still have (4) bags from the (6) bag order.  This shipment, I bought both Very Berry and Vanilla Almond Crunch (12 bags total). What a disappointment ! !  Too bad, I won't buy this product again.

I poured myself a bowl of cereal the day I got it in the mail and couldn't finish the bowl.  It's like eating raw oats - which is not a pleasant experience, and it has a weird artificial aftertaste - even though it doesn't have artificial ingredients in it.  I couldn't figure out why it tasted so strange.  Sorry guys, but I may have to feed the remaining 5 and 4/5 bags of cereal to the local horses.  I couldn't even choke it down.

review/text: The above reviewer was disappointed because it's marketed with a runner on the front like it's a workout product. This is a mistake.<br /><br />  I find this stuff to be an absolutely AMAZING product to study, read or write with. Mental concentration goes WAY up. No more eyes bouncing off the page from fatigue. I have a slight attention deficit at times, and this stuff CURES it. I LOVE that. It only helps physical performance as much as your concentration is wandering. They should market it to students, but I suppose that would limit the amount of people who try it. I would think this is great for late night driving. No caffeine jitters, either.

review/text: This is a great product when it's time for midterms and finals. I use this energy drink to stay awake and concentrated while studying for an exam. It gives you the energy you need to stay awake all night and beyond. I am not sure that I would take it as a workout drink because the energy it gives you is more mental than physical. You don't feel a crash after either like I often do with Red Bull. Also, I researched the ingredients and found out that non of them go over the maximum daily intake recommended, so this drink shouldn't be of any health risk for normal, healthy people. Again this is for sure something I will continue to use and would recommend to anyone that needs a little bust while studying.

review/text: I've tried Red Bull, Monster, etc. but found this product suits me much better.  I'm a working mother of two, in my late 30's and the best description I have for 5-hour is that it makes me feel 10 years younger.  I don't feel like superwoman. I'm not hyped up. I just find that my concentration level and energy level stay at a consistently productive level so that I can continue getting things done all day. I like to drink 1/2 a bottle around 10 a.m.  No after-lunch drowsiness.  No crashing as soon as my children have gone to bed in the evening.  I just feel like I did in my 20's - like I have enough energy to do the things I need to and have a little fun too. I eat well, I exercise, I get enough sleep - but I can feel a difference in my body from 10 years ago.  I'm not over-the-hill, but I can feel myself slowing as I approach the peak.  I've done some minor research and talked to my spouse who is a nurse to find out what kind of health risks there may be in taking this regularly.  So far, none.  Everything in moderation, right?

review/text: I've used this product for the past 4 months, and am pretty pleased with it. This product is suppose to have Vitamin B's, caffeine, etc (noticed they have some enzymes as well...) which, although not wholly perfect in energizing you to the extreme you are probably looking for, does seem to be helping me a little with concentration, mood, and keeping me awake for studying, without the jittery nervousness and fatigue that comes with excessive coffee drinking. I can't speak for its usefulness in exercise, but everyone's body works differently to some degree, so if you don't know if it works for you (exercise or study-wise), it's probably best to try one or two out before buying a box of 12.

Also, they're sugar free and have only 4 calories.  How nice to come across a product so helpful but not harmful!

I bought the 12 pack to have a decent amount to try.<br /><br />I am a relatively well built six foot 215 lb guy and decided to drink one bottle before working out. I felt absolutely none of the energizing effects promised by the manufacturer. I tried this a couple of times, and each time I expreienced the same result. I then decided to drink 2 bottles to see whether the dosage might be to blame. After drinking two bottles I noticed that my heart beat increased and that I had difficulty in trying to catch my breath, but again none of the energy benefits promised.<br /><br />I still have a few more bottles which I will probably finish, but I do not think the results will be any better. I guess you need to try it for yourself in order to see whether this formula complements your bodies chemistry. It certainly didn't complement mine.

Simply enough, this is a fine blackstrap, so give it a try. I think we found that this was a little more natural than some of the other brands we looked into, but don't recall now. Just a note that one of our bottles smashed while shipping and made a huge mess with glass and molasses all through the package at the time of delivery. The seller made it right immediately, so I recommend the product and the vendor (Baker's Box).

I take two tablespoons a day for the iron and calcium because the label says that a single tablespoon contains 20% of our daily requirement of each.  It's my understanding that Plantation blackstrap molasses is prepared in iron kettles, thus providing the high level of iron -- which not every brand will have.

review/text: A good breakfast bread which isn't too sweet.  I sometimes have problems with the bread rising well because of the humid climate where I reside, but this made a good size loaf.  It had lots of almonds with the mix which was very good.

review/summary: Wonderful bread
review/text: I served this bread and my guests raved about it.  The crust is nice and crunchy, and it is soft and moist on the inside.  Very nice taste and consistancy for a bread machine type of bread.  Good with meal or as toast, with butter or jam.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: This is My FAVORITE!!
review/text: The Swedish Vanilla Almond Bread Machine Mix is the most wonderful tasting bread.  The almond is a crunch that goes with the vanilla flavorings.  I always take it out 5-6 min early.  Then it is so soft and delicious.

review/summary: Who said tasteless?
review/text: I like this soup.  One of the problems with low fat or healthy is it frequently means an inferior or different taste to the regular, not so healthy stuff.  This soup doesn't suffer that particular problem.  If you like classic to eat, this is a nice substitute.

review/summary: would not purchase again
review/text: I am a huge fan of the betty crocker fudge brownies which always turn out incredible, but these were a disaster.  I cooked them in an 8x8 glass pan just like it said, and they were still completely uncooked in the middle after 50 minutes.  I continued to cook them another 20+ with no luck.  I was able to salvage the ones around the outside but the middle brownie portion was completely raw to the point where when I stirred it up with fork, it became the normal liquid consistency of uncooked brownies, even though the cookie part seemed baked.  I ended up throwing the entire middle away.  What a waste.  Stick to normal brownies, these are a joke.
