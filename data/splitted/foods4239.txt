review/text: This is delicious jerky. It's high in protein, softer and chewier than other brands, and it's relatively low in sodium for a jerky. It's easy to pack for snacks or lunches.  It keeps well so I buy it by the case and munch for a while. Excellent product for the whole family.

review/summary: How good Amazon Shipment be more tender
review/text: I was amazed when I opened the first package of this Turkey Jerky.<br /><br />I used to buy the exact same item at Whole Foods but they were out before my last backcountry trip, so I got it from Amazon.com and wow! I could believe how tender the jerky was, nothing like when I got it from Whole Foods.<br /><br />It might just be a quirk and I can't test for a while since it will take a year to get through 6 packages.

review/summary: Negative reviews??? How? GREAT JERKY!
review/text: Ok I have to say I am baffled by the numerous negative reviews of this Jerky.<br /><br />It is wonderful, tastes great, lower sodium than other turkey jerkys, and perfect for snacking.<br /><br />I read almost all of the reviews before I decided to order it, usually I have purchased the Jacks brand in the past, in my opinion Golden Valley is far better.  I also read people saying they received very hard/chewy pieces of jerky?  I had a few tougher pieces here and there but for the most part all of it was soft and just the way turkey jerky should be.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to anyone -- don't let the negative reviews sway you.<br /><br />Great jerky.

review/summary: Great product, excellent flavor
review/text: I bought this jerky to satisfy a craving that has long been neglected. There used to be a local company in San Diego called Smitty's jerky, and he made the best peppered jerky ever. They disappeared for some reason and that left those of us that were his fans in the dark.<br /><br />Now on to the real review... I ordered this based on reviews here at Amazon, and figured I'd give it a try. The turkey jerky is literally exploding with flavor, and is so tender that it requires no more effort to chew than an oven-cooked turkey. I order 8 bags and they were gone in just a matter of a few days. I even shared a bag with co-workers, and everyone raved about how surprisingly good this product was.<br /><br />Without question or hesitation, I would highly recommend this to anyone who even remotely enjoys jerky.

review/summary: Sugar in the Jerky
review/text: Short and Sweet:  this jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky.  In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates.  For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.<br /><br />I notice that in the more "natural" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar.  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.<br /><br />It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.<br /><br />If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet.  But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware.

review/text: I ordered this because it was natural and nitrate free.  I just received my shipment - it is very tender as others have said but I found it much too sweet for my taste.  The sugar overpowers the pepper flavor and is not what I expected.  If you want something that is more sweet than peppery or spicy you will like this brand.

review/text: It's delicious, and while it is expensive, it's just not that expensive for what you get. They sell this at the local "green" grocery store here at much higher rates.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has tried this brand loves it. It's not dry and tough like some others; the texture is just tender and moist enough to overcome typical jerky flaws. The blend of spices are quite good, even though there's a slight sweet taste. Normally I would hate even the slightest hint of sweetness in a product like this, but somehow it works.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product highly enough.

review/summary: The Worst I've Ever Eaten
review/text: I started a low carb. diet and have been trying different brands of turkey jerky.  Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky "BLACK PEPPER" was by far the worst I have ever tasted.  I've never left a review about any product I've purchased, good or bad, but I had to say something about this. It literally tasted like candied meat. It has 6 grams of carbs per serving (all from sugar)....double that of any other I've found.  Why would any company put so much sugar in a turkey jerky labeled black pepper?  They should have just called it brown sugar turkey jerky.  I threw it in the trash and got a refund from Amazon.  Amazon truly is an incredible company and I will continue to make purchases via their venue, but this turkey jerky......?

review/text: Our household is addicted to this stuff.  It's a little pricey, but when you break it down to the delicious, fulfilling, low-calorie, high-protein nutrition you get, it's worth it.  At least to us.  We finally got on the regular shipment plan to save 15% per month.  Yay, Amazon.<br /><br />[Time passes]<br /><br />Hmmmm... I am starting to suspect there are two versions of this product.  One you buy in the health food store and pay top dollar for... and this one.  I have never had an issue with quality control with this product before.  However, with this multi-pack I am finding that in every pouch there are a couple/few pieces that should have not made it past inspection - cut too thick to eat without soaking and/or too grisely to consider worthy of this price.<br /><br />So, hopefully it was just a few bag bags and maybe that's been straightened out.  But I hope this is not the new version.  We really do love this stuff- the high quality product we are used to, not the thick, grisely version.

Because the price for this turkey jerky is pretty low, it makes it worth it, but it could be improved by being less sweet. It's not as bad as he beef, but still too sweet. Texture and meat quality were good, but not excellent.

review/summary: Probably the Best Turkey Jerky EVER!
review/text: I have had a love affair with Turkey Jerky for a long time, but as I have gotten wiser and started paying more attention to the foods I put into my body, I stopped buying it at the grocery store: it all has MSG and high fructose corn syrup and artificial color, et cetera, added.  Not this stuff!  And from free-range, hormone-free turkeys, too!  The whole family loves it. We've been giving my son beef jerky to help cut his teeth and thought this might be a bit too peppery for him ('cause it is a bit peppery), but he really seems to like it (granted, I ate nothing but Mexican food when I was pregnant with him & later when breast-feeding, so he's fairly accustomed to spicy foods).  And when you sign up for the automatic shipments, i think the price is quite reasonable for an organic and healthy snack food.

review/summary: ok but not great
review/text: I purchased this tea honestly because I was looking for one more item to get up to the $25 so I could get free shipping.  I am a tea lover and I drink both loose teas and bag teas.  This looked almost too good to be true for the price, but I thought, "What the heck?"  I found that 1 bag will only steep one cup of tea.  You cannot get 2 cups like you can out of many other brands.  I also found that some bags did not want to steep at all.  Also, the string tends to come off easily.  The strings appear to be sealed into the bag and when they get into a boiling cup of water, they tend to come off and the top of the bag opens and the tea leaves come out.  Ok, but I wouldn't give it as a gift or anything.  I suggest sticking with a better brand for bagged teas like Lipton, Bigelow, or Celestial Seasonings.  For loose tea I recommend TeaSmith, Teavana, Davidson's, or Republic of Tea.  Also, check to see if your tea is Fair Trade Certified and/or Organic.

At this point I am assuming that all of the differnt flavors are the same. The string came off of the tea bag and overall I can honestly say (right down to the packaging) that this tea is really cheap and no good. Don't waste your money. This company is a joke.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I ordered 3 boxes of these teas for gifts and also 1 box for me to try.  I thought they were a great idea because there was a variety, a good quantity and not expensive.  So many things wrong here ... where do I start. 1.) They all came in broken boxes 2.) There is no flavor to these teas.  Doesn't matter which one you drink they are all the same.  3.) I'm completely embarrassed that I had given these as gifts. Considering I threw mine away because they were just that tasteless.

review/summary: Potato Chips
review/text: I purchased this product directly from the Blair's Site, as Blair himself touted that this product was made with spices that hit a 600,000 scoville!<br /><br />Being a chilli head I naturally wanted to try this. At best, I would get 1 or 2 of the chips that had any zing to it, but for the most part it tasted like a BBQ flavored chip. No distinct flavor of habenero.<br /><br />Now I bought the combination box which had 5 bags of these habenero chips in it, and they all tasted the same. If your not a chilli head and want a spicier chip, this is the way to go or try Blair's Parmesean Habenero which I found had more kick to it then the Habenero chip.<br /><br />But most chilli heads will not find much fire here. If you want proper fire look for Snyder's of Hanover's Jalapeno Pretzel Pieces!

review/summary: Great chips, great shipping
review/text: I received my chips in a well-packed box. A pack of "Ring of Fire" beef jerky was thrown in.<br /><br />The chips were very, very hot. They don't seem it at first; the immediate impression is that of a very normal BBQ chip. It takes a short while, but then you get kicked in the throat by the spice. You are going to be "O" breathing for awhile, in a futile attempt to cool your incinerating taste buds. I wouldn't recommend trying to wolf the whole bag down on your first try!<br /><br />Very much worth the shipping to give them a try. If you can find them locally, I envy you. The "Ring of Fire" beef jerky that was included was also fantastic, but I'd advise the same caution when starting in on it.

review/text: I was introduced to the Blair chips by a friend. I mostly ignore potato chips because I really don't like them. However, these I DO like. I will eat these but only one at a time and I need a few minutes before having another. They are wicked. Worst thing you can say about them is the quantity a person is consume is limited because of the heat. Stay away from the Chipotle chips - they are savory and can be eaten rapidly.

review/text: I had some problems with packaging and unlike the picture this product comes in one large box inside a blue food grade plastic bag. Mine was not twist tied or sealed in any fashion and the nut oils had penetrated through to the outside of the box. Aside from that issue the nuts themselves were of a perfect size for baking.They are nice light nut meats and are of a very good quality. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that my case was not sealed properly and could have led to possible contamination as well as oxidation and rancidity issues.

review/text: I serve my four kitties various cans of wet food at supper time and make sure there is a beef, chicken, turkey and fish offering in the mix each night. That way everyone get his favorite, or at least something he likes. That way, I have NO finnicy eaters!!!<br />They ALL love this Beef Bourguignon canned food and on the nights I serve this dish, two of the bowls have to be Beef Bourguignon. (They get a total of six cans at night which is the only time they are served wet food.)<br />Right now, they only get it when I have some reason to make a run to PetsMart. This time they only had 10 cans available. It always seems to be sold out.<br />At the moment, I am not willing to pay what this vendor is asking PLUS pay shipping. But maybe Amazon will come around and offer this flavor at a lower price. When they do, I will hop on it. It is a great food.!!!!!!! If you can afford it, go ahead and buy it sight unseen. I am THAT SURE your kitties will like it!

review/summary: What Price Nostalgia
review/text: For those 'of a certain age' this kind of cut rock candy was once a standard holiday season treat.  One usually purchased at any old corner store by mom and put out in her special Christmas candy dish sometime around the first day of winter.  As I recall, at our house Santa always got a few of these nuggets with his milk and cookies and reindeer carrots on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />This year in a burst of nostalgia we ordered the two-pound bag, and they came just in time for the holidays.  And they were....all right. Ok. Pretty good. Not bad at all.  Not, however, as delicatable as we recalled them tasting.  I particularly remembered the flavors being somewhat different, and I'm very positive there was no watermelon flavor in the old days at all. On the other hand, we decided the main difference in the candy then and the candy now is that we're not 6 years old any more.<br /><br />But that's all right. The grandkids were enchanted by the designs on the end of each piece hinting at its flavor, the hard-rock chunks taste OK, and they still look great in mom's old candy dish. What more could you hope for?  As candy, I'd say these rate maybe 3 1/2 to 4 stars--like I said, they're not too bad; however,I gave them a full 5 stars on sentimental value alone. If you simply want to satisfy your sweet tooth, hit the candy aisle of any grocery store and don't waste your time or money on these things.  But if you want to summon up the friendly ghosts of Christmases Past, order up a couple pounds next December.

review/text: These cookies are very good.  I bought them as a gluten-free substitute for vanilla wafers in banana pudding.  My daughter, who does not need to eat gluten-free, commented that she likes these better than vanilla wafers for that recipe-they don't get all soggy when the pudding is refrigerated overnight. I had been looking for a gluten free cookie for this banana pudding recipe for awhile and was very pleased with the result.  My husband thought they were great too.  I would have rated these a 5 star, except Amazon did not package them well and every single cookie was broken in shipping.  They refunded my payment promptly when I reported the problem, though.

review/summary: Girl Scouts take note......
review/text: Oh, MY, these are delicious!  I adore Samoas, and those cute little Girl Scouts and Brownies lurking on sidewalks everywhere at this time of year make me want to cry with desire.  I miss eating those darned cookies, as much as I know they're not good for me in so many ways.  Well, now they can eat their adorable little hearts out, because I've got THESE!  Sunstart has performed a small miracle, and I'll be forever grateful.  One cookie bar is rich and filling enough to be a perfect dessert, and since there are 12 per box, there are enough to serve when company comes for tea.  These are also pretty enough (and tasty enough!) to serve as a part of an elegant dessert to a dinner table full of guests, too. A case of these will last for awhile, and storage in the freezer works really well - I know, because I tried it!  And the cookies are even good frozen, just like the ones those little angels on the sidewalk are selling!  Go for it, my gluten free friends.  And hey, you know what? Even if you AREN'T gluten free, you will love these, too!!!!

review/summary: A good food, just not for my little old dog.
review/text: I have a 15 year old jack russell/ chihuahua mix that has been with me since 2000. He was a rescue at an emergency animal clinic I worked for at that time. Because of my experience working with animals and learning about good nutrition for dogs and how to read a dog food label he has generally been an Iams guy. But when I had my baby and got Amazon Mom and then Amazon Prime I thought I'd take a look at the Subscribe and Save options to see if there were any high quality foods I could get a good deal on. There are several and this had other good reviews so we tried it. It is a good food with actual meat as its primary protein source and some possibly helpful (but not at all harmful) additions like the flax seed etc. It seemed to taste okay to Wizard, the main problem was that he is a little old dog with a little old mouth. The pieces are frankly too big for him and at his age even with regular cleanings his teeth are worn down and a few are gone. So he would swallow it whole it appears and then sometimes that would cause him to toss it back up shortly thereafter.<br />Now I have him on Iams Senior Plus (for dogs older than 11) I don't know if that is helping, but it is much smaller pieces for his small old mouth.<br />I have nothing bad to say about this product though. If I had a younger, larger dog I would still be ordering it. It is a great value for the quality of the ingredients.

review/summary: Carbo Trol Plus Sugar Free Lmonade Drink Mix Base is Delicious!
review/text: We received our Carbo Trol Plus Sugar Free Lemonade Drink Mix Base and gave it a try after allowing it to sit overnight in the fridge.  This sugar free lemonade mix is delicious.  A twelve pack box makes twenty-four gallons.  I only wanted to make one gallon at a time, so measure out half--six teaspoons plus one heaping teaspoon--and it made up fine.<br /><br />The value of this drink mix is in the volume of sugar free drink it makes, plus the flavor is fantastic.  I am diabetic and am on social security, so this powder mix is an outstanding value.  I have already re-ordered two boxes at the sale price, plus ordered the other flavor, fruit punch, as well.  It seems it is so popular, they cannot keep it in stock!<br /><br />If you like the sugar free powdered drink mixes, then you will love this brand of mix.  If you find the flavor a little strong, just dilute it with more water.  You can't go wrong with this product.  It is delicious and a good value.  Seven level teaspoons of this mix is half a packet and makes one gallon.

review/summary: Delicious crumb cake
review/text: Although I have been gluten-free for a long time, this is my first chestnut flour baked good.  I think it is tasty and a nice texture.  I like that this mix has the sugar separate so you can use a different sweetener if you like; I used maple syrup and it needed to be cooked longer than stated with the maple syrup substitute.  I purchased my mix through an Amazon external website seller iHerb who did a good job of packing it and getting it to me.  This mix is correctly described as DARK VANILLA; if you are craving angel food or white wedding cake or your typical white cake, I doubt this would satisfy.  But if you are craving applesauce cake or crumb cake, this cake is perfect!  Mix makes one 9x9 inch cake and you will need an electric mixer.  My electric mixer is one of my favorite kitchen appliances and it is this one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTIUSS">Cuisinart SM-55BC 5-1/2-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Brushed Chrome</a>.  I will buy this mix again and will try their other mixes and their flour.

review/summary: best so far
review/text: I have been eating and feeding my family gluten free for 1.5 years. I've yet to find a vanilla cake mix that I would buy regularly. (For chocolate cake mix, it's Pamela's all the way. My kids and hubby like chocolate, but I'm not a fan. Hence, the continued search.) This is the best I've found so far. No grainy texture, not dry and dense. It has a nice flavor, but it's a little bit more than vanilla alone, although words fail me at the minute to describe it accurately. If I could end my search for cake mix, I'd give it 5 stars. Still, this is the one I will stick with for now. Just so you know - I use mixes so (1) I can whip up birthday and Valentine's cakes and the like and (2) I can make cupcakes, so I have something to eat on the rush to work (can't just buy a muffin anywhere to go with my coffee!) or send in the kids' lunch boxes. (One of my two sons must also eat gluten free.) For me, this mix made 10 cupcakes in the oversize muffin tin using cupcake liners.<br /><br />Pros: good taste & texture; soft quality, good flavor<br /><br />Cons: must cream butter and sugar in this recipe - so you can't just open the box & start baking; you have to soften your butter first, and have eggs at room temp. (For the eggs, I just take them straight out of the refrigerator and sit them in warm water for a couple of minutes. But I've not figured out how to soften butter except the regular way.)

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I have been buying and brewing Lavazza coffee for about twenty years--beginning with the time that you could only get Lavazza by a) having someone shlep it from Italy for you, or b) driving down Canal street (if you ever had the displeasure of being stuck in NYC). For years I used the Pienaroma, which is a fantastic coffee, and typically billed by the coffee companies as being the same as the "gold" you get over in Italy. The Pienaroma is fantastic for cappuccino and lattes, but I think this gold is better for straight espresso.<br /><br />The Pienaroma is 100% Arabica.  Not sure exactly what's in the Gold, but the crema is amazing.  I suspect Lavazza must drop in a little Robusto to give the Gold the great crema and a slight bite that I feel is missing in the Pienaroma.  Some people mistake this taste, often referred to as "earthy" taste, for a burnt taste.  I suggest brewing some espresso from the Gold and the Pienaroma side-by-side and tasting them at the same time.  You'll appreciate this taste is missing in the Pienaroma, I suspect, and after that the Pienaroma will taste "flat" for straight espresso.  Summary:  if you don't drink espresso, stick with the Pienaroma as it is more economical and is a fantastic coffee.  If you like espresso, give the Gold a shot and see what you think.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I'm not a professional food taster, so all of the above is just one person's opinion.  Surely you know what they say about opinions...

review/text: I have been using this espresso for over a year in my commercial espresso machine, and have enjoyed the flavor. The Italians do not over roast there beans so you don't get the bitter Starbucks type flavor. The reason Starbucks over roasts their beans is, to hide a poor quality bean, they are about marketing not coffee. I really have to laugh when somebody compares Starbucks to Lavazza.

review/text: I have used the Lavazza Tierra and Illy whole beans in my espresso machine. I purchased the Gold Selection thinking gold would indicate a more flavorful brew. I did not find this to be the case. If anything, I think the Tierra has a bit more of an authentic Italian espresso flavor. I am always looking for a strong espresso flavor in my morning latte.<br /><br />If cost were not a limiting factor, I would go back to the Illy.  Unfortunately, the Illy costs quite a bit more than the Lavazza blends.  That said, as I finish up the Gold beans in the cupboard, I will either go back to the Lavazza Tierra or maybe try another Lavazza blend.

review/summary: Lavazza Gold Espresso beans
review/text: I got a new super-automatic machine after my old one died and decided to try some new coffees.  I have been using Starbucks espresso beans for years; primarily because of where I live in a rural area, it is about the only thing available locally.  I looked at a lot of reviews here, and almost everyone likes the Lavazza brand.  I figured I would try this one first as it is near the top of Lavazza's price range and it sounded good from the reviews.<br /><br />There were a lot of comments about Starbucks burned taste of their espresso, and how smooth this one is in comparison.  I would have to agree that it is a lot smoother.  I spent a month in Italy a few years ago (the reason I bought an espresso machine when I got back) and, I have to say, the coffee made with these beans is very very close to what I learned to love over there.  The taste is much more complex than the Starbucks.  Rather than just having a very strong, intense flavor and taste, you can taste more complexity in the flavors of the Lavazza Gold.<br /><br />While it is more expensive than the Starbucks, I feel that it is worth it.  I may try one or two of the other Lavazza beans just to see, but I am very happy with this one after about a month of using it for a couple of espressos or cappuccinos a day.

review/summary: Not bad but prefer the Supercrema better
review/text: I prefer the Lavazza Supercrema. This is a good coffee though. I recently found a local coffee made at the Wholefoods in my area and I find the in-store roasted espresso there unbelievable. So I stopped ordering these big bags at Amazon and buy locally instead. The Lavazza Rossa whole bean from Italy is the best Lavazza in my opinion but I can only find it in Italy. They have the ground Lavazza Rossa here but its not the same. The Rossa from Italy has great comlex flavors and I find it as good as the Illy in a red can. The Illy is terribly overpriced so I'll stick with the local stuff now.

review/text: Lavazza Gold has been a mainstay in my office for the past 5 or 6 years.  Occasionally, I get the urge to try a different bean in my Jura Capresso super automatic, but I immediately return to the "Gold".  Recently, I have been enjoying the "Crema y Aroma" from Lavazza as well.  Highly recommend both!  One of the advantages with Lavazza whole beans if you use a super automatic machine is that the beans are not oily so they don't gum up the hopper and grinder.

review/summary: Excelent everyday espresso.
review/text: I have a Rancilio Silvia v3 and I'm primarily writing this as an espresso review.<br />Excellent rich and yet balanced flavor.  Great liquorice and dark chocolate flavors and aftertaste.  Decent crema, although the production gets rapidly weaker if the beans are open for more than one week(but that's expected).<br /><br />The price is also relatively affordable and per pound and is slightly cheaper than many of the nicer American brands out there(ie Peets or your local roast).  I think I've found my daily brew.<br /><br />Who this coffee isn't for...<br />-Dark Coffee drinkers.  This isn't an ultra dark,oily, burnt(Starbucks drinkers I'm talking to you) roast.  It was never intended to be one.  If you make drip or French press coffee and you're used to dark roasts, this will underwhelm.<br />-Espresso snobs.  This isn't Intelligencia.  If you want Intelligencia, go buy Intelligencia.  Most of Lavazza's roasts are meant to consumed in every day situations and every day affordable coffee.  This also isn't Illy coffee and as much as I like their taste better, I do enjoy my fatter wallet.<br /><br />I'm not too big on milk based espresso drinks, so can't really give any review there.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a solid everyday Italian espresso for those looking for something reliable to drink every day.  It's forgiving enough that you don't have to make it to exacting standards with a mega dollar professional machine like some of the fancier roasts and it's not like having to slog through a can of Folgers.<br /><br />If you want Starbucks or Intelligencia, go buy Starbucks or Intelligencia.

review/text: An excellent product at an excellent price.<br />This product is pre-washed and ready to cook without the bitter saponin taste. I do recommended rinsing all quinoa once anyways.<br />In reply to a previous review,  if this product was not prewashed then it would have a bitter after taste.<br /><br />In it's natural state before quinoa is washed, the grains are coated with a bitter tasting natural pest repellent called saponin, which discourages insects and birds from eating the seeds.<br /><br />The 25 pound arrived fast and in perfect condition, the grains are of a mature size and there isn't any foreign "things" mixed in with the quinoa. I will be ordering again if the price stays competitive. My boyfriend is indigenous Quechua and we eat a lot of quinoa the 25lbs will last 3 months if we are lucky.

review/summary: Very clean, high quality quinoa
review/text: I did have a subscription for Roland white quinoa, but the price increased with every shipment. So I started looking for another source and found the Alter Eco Fair Trade Pearl Quinoa. I was a little hesitant to try it because I had been happy with the cleanliness of the Roland quinoa and I wasn't sure what pearl quinoa was. Upon receiving it, I was very pleasantly surprised. First of all, pearl quinoa is actually white quinoa. It is very clean so I don't really have to rinse it, and the individual grains are much larger than the Roland quinoa. Best of all, it isn't full of static electricity. We store our grains in 5 gallon plastic containers, and when we poured the bag of Roland quinoa into the bucket, it literally jumped out, stuck to the bag, and some flew out onto the floor. Once in the bucket, the grain that didn't jump out stuck to the sides of the bucket. It was truly a challenge to get it into the bucket without making a big mess. It was so nice when this quinoa just poured into the bucket like any other grain - no muss, no fuss. Hopefully, the price of this one doesn't start to skyrocket. I love this quinoa!!<br /><br />Update!! 6/16/2012<br />Well, the price of this quinoa went from a subscription price of a bit over $68 to $118. So I am off to find another source. The increased price is much more than I am willing to spend.

review/summary: A great aid to good nutritiom
review/text: I stumbled upon Optimum Rebound in the supermarket about 8 months ago. I was looking to change from typical granola because granola was so high in carbs. There was a sale on Nature's Path items, so after reading the box and being impressed with 10 grams of protein and six grams of fiber in a 3/4 of a cup serving I bought it. Boy, was I glad.<br /><br />The cereal tastes okay by itself, but mixed with 3/4 cup of yogurt it's terrific. (I used to eat the granola with yogurt too.) I top the whole thing off with fruit, a sliced banana and some other fresh or canned fruit. It's like starting off the day with an ice cream sundae that's good for you. I eat it for breakfast every other day. Even my doctor was skeptical, so I brought in a box to show him; 10 grams of soy protein, a complete protein, and 6 grams of fiber. I'm 72, not in such good health, and I live alone. The doctor and my family are worried about malnutrition. When I showed him the box and told him about my breakfast he gave me a pat on the back. Blood tests for protein in the blood are looking better too since I started on Maximum Rebound. By last fall they were normal.<br /><br />I buy Maximum Rebound on subscription. It comes out to about $3.15 a box. No freight! That's really competitive with the standard brand nutritional junk cereals out there. Even the health food store doesn't touch that price when they have it on sale. I heartily recommend it on subscription from Amazon.

review/summary: One of the better
review/text: Nature's Path cereals, perhaps 'cause I can actually taste the components, which are simultaneously pronounced AND balanced. A bit of a guilty pleasure, as it's sweeter than most 'healthy'(-ish) breakfasts.

review/summary: Really tasty healthy cereal
review/text: Since eating this cereal 1-2 hours before my workouts, I've noticed an increase in energy and stamina.  I also think that since its organic, its also helped regulate my digestive track.  And at this price, its much cheaper than most health stores and I don't have to waste the $4/gal of gas to go get it!

review/summary: Delicious AND healthy
review/text: This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.  Eating it you definitely do not feel like you are eating a 'health nut' cereal.  I am a huge fan of banana so I really enjoy the distinguishable sweet and fruity flavor they lend the cereal as well as the slight nuttiness from the flax.  The green tea is really subtle (almost undetectable) and doesn't really affect the flavor of the cereal.<br /><br />The only downside is that this cereal is a little more calorically dense than some of the other healthy cereals on the market.  It is 190 calories for 3/4 cup with 6 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein while<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> has only 14 calories, 10 grams of fiber, and 13 g of protein in a cup.  As a result, Optimum Rebound isn't as filling and I find myself feeling hungrier faster than I do if I've had Kashi GOLEAN for breakfast.  However, the flavor of Optimum Rebound is MUCH sweeter and more complex so understandably you have to sacrefice nutritionals a bit for something that is tastier.  However, it is still much healthier than many mainstream sugary cereals.  I find myself typically making up the difference by mixing some Optimum Rebound into my Kashi GOLEAN for flavor.  This gives me the best of both words.<br /><br />However, this is still a great cereal overall and will especially appeal to you if you find cereals like Kashi GOLEAN to be too bland.
