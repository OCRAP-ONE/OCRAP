review/summary: A good crema coffee
review/text: Doing research, I found that "crema" is the froth or foam that comes out of some espresso machines. Being thicker, espresso can create more foam or froth when it brews in commercial coffee shop machines, and this foam or froth (called "crema") is enjoyed for it's own qualities in Europe as it floats atop the espresso.<br /><br />The Signature Crema Coffee t-discs from Gevalia creates a slightly smaller sized cup of coffee with a "head" on it. The Tassimo machines are capable of pumping air through the water, creating froth or foam. Creamer discs usually take advantage of this to make cappucino with frothed cream. The crema coffees, like this one, froth the brew, giving a good amount of foam. The roast is relatively smooth and a little stronger than the Signature Blend, and the serving size a little smaller. Most likely, it brews a little less coffee so as not to dilute the froth, and that gives it a slightly stronger flavor.<br /><br />If you like coffee with a head or froth on it, these will yield good results. I keep a few on hand for novelty or a change of pace (or when I forget and run out of the regular coffee). Crema is a different type of coffee though as the air being pumped through the brew does alter it slightly. If you enjoy coffee with cream and sugar, you most likely will not enjoy this. If you enjoy black coffee, then chances are much better you'll appreciate this one.

review/summary: Doesn't "Top" Voluptuoso
review/text: I'm trying this flavor, and though it's pleasant-tasting, for me, it doesn't compare to the Cafe Noire Voluptuoso. It is too mild and the froth is quickly dissipated, though it does automatically brew a larger cup. Voluptuoso is bolder, yet doesn't sacrifice smoothness, and if you like a frothy topping, Cafe Noire lasts. I add more water manually to the strength I desire and it's never a nuisance for the pleasure of the taste.

review/summary: Exploding T-Discs
review/text: I've been buying the Gevalia Signature Blend T-Discs for a few years and have been getting them from Amazon for most of that time. I also buy other T-Discs and have used them all without incident for all that time. Until last week. We just opened our latest shipment of Gevalia Signature Blend (3-pack) from Amazon and have found the T-Discs to be defective. The foil around the center "port" is not secure all the way around and during brewing, the seal fails and the T-Discs "explode" for lack of a better word. Essentially, the pressure in the T-Disc builds up, the foil seal around the port fails (and rips further) and the pressurized coffee grounds are expelled out of the T-Disc. If the Tassimo is opened at this time, the grounds go EVERYWHERE.<br /><br />After trying a number of these discs and observing the result, trying other discs (Maxwell House) which don't have this issue, and finally dissecting some of the Gevalia Discs that hadn't been through the brewing process, I found the issue being the foil not being sealed sufficiently around the center port. The Lot Number on these discs is J5411054 and have a Best When Used By date of "2012 FEB/FE 18".<br /><br />I've called Tassimo (800 number is on the T-Disc packages) and they are sending replacements. They said this is a rare occurrence.<br /><br />If you have had this same issue, please post here with the Lot Number.<br /><br />I will still continue to order these T-Discs from Amazon, but am taking a break until I have tried the replacement discs from Tassimo. In the meantime, I'll just be using the Maxwell House T-Discs that I also purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars for now. Prior to this situation, I would have rated these T-Discs as 4 stars. They would get 5 stars, but I think they're a little overpriced, but my wife prefers these to the Maxwell House.

review/text: I am not a fan of Gevalia coffee in general and particularly their mild roast tassimo disc version. I prefer my coffee<br />bold or at least medium roast blends and have tried the Starbucks Latin American bold coffee t-discs which i like. The Maxwell House t-discs taste very true to form that is if you like Maxwell House. I have tried several of the Gevalia brand t-discs and frankly it doesn't even taste like real coffee. I do like the t-discs in general and have a Bosch brewbot, courtesy of tassimo and will try some of the higher rated tassimo coffees but avoid Gevalia unless you enjoy that watered down coffee taste.

The aroma this coffee makes when it's brewing is amazing, the taste is even better.

review/text: Yeah, so, I'm pretty much an elite gamer.  I play the more old-school games, though.  I have a max-level Bard/Thief on Icewind Dale, and most of my time these days is devoted to Civilization 3.<br /><br />I am diabetic and I've had my feet removed.  I live in a skilled nursing facility that I'm thankfully able to afford thanks to the lawsuit I won after my mom was killed during an armed robbery of the Red Robin she was working at.  The nurses' assistants have devised a rather clever system of weights and pulleys so they can flip me over when I start getting bed sores, and I've had one of those big funnel things they use to fill boxes with packing peanuts installed over my bed, which I fill with snacks so that I can just keep my mouth on the tube at all times when I'm tearing through bugbears or pwning the Babylonians on my Alienware laptop.<br /><br />I also have an IV of Mountain Dew Game Fuel.<br /><br />Anyway, I had sort of a 6-month "thing" with Cap'n Crunch, which the nurses' assistants appreciated because it came out nice and smooth into my butt catheter, but I got a little bit bored with that, and my mouth was cut up somethin' fierce after six months.  So I decided to try something new.  Something designed for hardcore gamers like me.<br /><br />Enter Gamer Grub Performance Snack Pizza.<br /><br />It seems simple enough.  It's a variety of snacks designed to taste like things they aren't.  Namely, pizza.  I like pizza.  And the small size of the cashews and cheese curls flows through my snack funnel really well.  The only problem is, my butt catheter gets mad clogged when this stuff tries to come out the other end.<br /><br />Still, it's tasty enough, and as long as I have the staff here to keep things moving in the plumbing department, who cares?  I give it three stars.<br /><br />Keep on gaming!!!

review/text: I read some great reviews from E3 Expo of Gamer Grub and I had to try it myself.  Finally, a snack where I do not get goop and gunk on my fingers when I am gaming or on the computer.  The PB&J tastes so good.... I still do not understand how they make it taste exactly like the real thing. Yummy and wow.

review/summary: A must have snack
review/text: I love these. They are taste delicious, and also prefect for a snack in the office, or just taking a break between gaming sessions. They're simple a must have snack. The only thing that sucks about them, is the price. A bit to high for shipping out into the bush of alaska.

review/text: I totally like this stuff.  The price per bag is on tad high, though that'd be OK if it had free shipping.<br /><br />I wish they sold it by the case, with maybe $5 shipping, then I'd give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Nice snack while getting your game on.
review/text: Well if you're like me and like to eat or just get hungry while playing your favorite video game, then this snack is for you! This flavor is pizza, and it is very tasty. I liked it because it wasn't greasy at all. I didn't however like the price; $[...] for 4.0 oz snack is very appealing. But I ate the heck out of it! Two thumbs up!

review/summary: Best foood ever!!!
review/text: Gamergrub is one of the best things that I have ever eaten in my life. It is packed with nutrients which makes it such a great item to buy for plus it really boosts the performance of any gamer. This may seem weird but I was playing Call of Duty and I am really bad at CoD but once I ate this, I started to get really good. I got really focused.<br /><br />Another good thing about Gamergrub is that it really tastes the flavor on the box.<br />Pizza tastes just like a combination of cheese and pepporoni pizza. I rather go with the PB&J one which tastes even better.<br /><br />If you are considering buying gamergrub, don't heistate because it is worth every cent you spend.

review/summary: Because it's so hard to get fresh pizza these days
review/text: Sure, we ALL like to enjoy a slice  of fresh "ZA" while playing "Wii Sports", but we also know just how hard it is to find a pizza shop which will deliver.  I tried buying several pizzas at a time, then freezing them for later use, but  they just wouldn't fit in my toaster when I tries to heat them up later.  Then I heard about a MIRACLE product that gives me that pizza experience, BUT IN A CAN!<br /><br />A can that can be held in only one hand, unlike those huge circular pizza pies, which need TWO hands to eat!<br /><br />So, until someone creates a timely pizza deliverator service that can bring fresh pizza to your door- Or some whay to freeze then subsequently reheat pizzas- Gaem Grub is the only sensible option for the discriminating Italian Food lover who also enjoys video games.

review/summary: Great Stuff - but formula has since changed
review/text: I first bought this lime extract to flavor "home-made" seltzer water without the use of sugar or real lime juice in July of 2009. This extract has been very easy to use - about 6cc per liter of seltzer. I've gotten lots of compliments on the taste of the lime-infused seltzer and I'm no longer throwing out perfectly good bottles after just one use.<br /><br />The shipment from JR Mushrooms was prompt... two bottles arrived in a well-padded box with lots of bubble-wrap and foam peanuts to keep them safe and sound. The bottles themselves are dark brown glass (presumably to shield the juice from the sun) and have well-fitting plastics caps. All in all, I was very happy with this purchase and the quality of the product, as of July 2009.<br /><br />Recently (August 2010 - that is how long the initial 32 oz order of the old extract lasted), I ordered another set of extract. Sadly, the supplier of extract to JRMushroom has changed and so has the formulation - the extract now arrives in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark brown glass bottle of 2009. I am not convinced that the present version if terpeneless, as there is a fairly bitter aftertaste. Amit at OliveNation/JRMushrooms was very nice to refund the unopened bottle (I had bought 2) and also informed me that he is negotiating a new supplier for the stuff.<br /><br />So here is what I suggest for any extract order over the internet: Order a small sample bottle ($6.5) and make sure it fits your flavor expectations before ordering a larger bottle. Plus, before you re-order, contact the seller and make sure that the flavor/supplier hasn't changed. I am a bit disappointed that Amit has not updated the Amazon web pages to reflect the new packaging, which would have been a good clue not to go ahead with a large-bottle purchase but to sample the present product first. Live and learn, I guess.

review/summary: Nice, but is it worth the cost?
review/text: I received one package as a Vine member and I just prepared and ate it.<br />The prep is very easy. I read the review that mentioned an 'almost' disaster peeling the cover back. I must say, I did not have that problem but I can understand what happened. Still I agree there is enough sauce. More than enough in my book, which is a little wasteful but better than too little.<br />And I love the pasta. It was al dente, not overcooked and the sauce was very nice.<br />So, it is easy, so convenient and tastes very good.<br />Why only three stars then?<br /><br />It is expensive.<br />A handful of pasta. A little container of sauce...and it costs $3.43 each!<br />I am sorry, but I thing that is just too much. I can buy a pound of pasta for $1 on sale and I love Hunt's sauces in the can, often on sale for about $1. Ever try it? If not, I think it is as good as the jarred sauces and a fraction of the price. So for $2 an a little effort I would have at least 6 of these servings.<br />$20...$2....I just can not justify it for the convenience.

review/summary: Presto Pasta
review/text: I must say, this ready-to-microwave pasta dish is one of the best products of its type I've ever tasted.<br /><br />It has natural ingredients, with no preservatives.  It tastes yummy -- the sauce is sweet and tangy, just right.<br /><br />And the dish cooks in the microwave in just one minute with no muss or fuss.  You simply pull back a corner of the cover to vent the sauce that's separated from the pasta in its own little sauce tray.  Then one minute later, you remove the cover, pour the sauce over the nice al dente pasta, and enjoy.<br /><br />To my amazement, one of these servings costs only about three bucks at Amazon's current price, which is quite reasonable for the taste and convenience.<br /><br />About the only thing I can carp about here is the description on the side of the package that this is a "microwaveable meal."  Maybe it's a meal for a small fashion model on a diet; for the rest of us, it's a nice snack or side dish.<br /><br />Still, this pasta dish, which stores in a room-temperature cupboard rather than your freezer, easily beats the stuffing out of Chef Boyardee in a can.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and I'm not easily impressed by packaged foods...<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Very tasty sauce and excellent al dente pasta.<br />* Fast and easy to heat up.<br />* Reasonably priced.<br />* Stores at room temperature.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not really a full meal -- more of a hearty snack or side dish.

review/summary: Good product, but with one notable design flaw
review/text: I just wrapped up my in-office lunch, featuring the Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce (I also brought a left-over mandarin orange spinach salad and french bread from home) .  It was good, really good, but the pasta sauce was almost a disaster.<br /><br />The product contains a larger plastic, microwavable bowl containing pre-cooked pasta, and a smaller bowl that contains the pasta sauce that rests in one end of the larger plastic bowl.  The smaller bowl is not attached to the larger bowl, it just sits in it.  Both the larger and smaller bowls are sealed shut with a thick plastic film cover.<br /><br />To prepare the pasta you pull back the plastic cover slightly to allow venting from the sauce.  It's true that it takes only one minute to heat this meal - handy!<br /><br />After only one minute in the microwave you pull it out, and then remove the top film entirely.  THIS IS WHERE I NEARLY HAD A MEGA-DISASTER!  I pulled the plastic cover back, starting at the end where I had already pulled the plastic back to allow venting, and I had to apply a fair amount of pressure because the plastic was attached quite firmly.  At this point I did not know that the sauce bowl and the pasta bowl were not connected, and as I pulled back the plastic it came free of one end of the sauce bowl before the opposite edge.  The pasta bowl pulled up and nearly spilled all over the counter, but luckily it didn't.  That was CLOSE!<br /><br />OK, with the plastic cover removed and disaster averted, I poured the sauce over the noodles and stirred it up.  The portion size of noodles was appropriate for lunch.  The amount of sauce was good for the amount of noodles included.  Don't you hate it when you have pasta, but you don't get enough sauce? That was NOT the case here.  There was plenty of sauce for the noodles.<br /><br />The consistency of the noodles was great.  They were neither too hard nor too soft for my tastes.<br /><br />All in all I would award this product the following rating:<br /><br />5 stars - Ease of preparation<br />5 stars - Portion size<br />5 stars - Food taste<br />5 stars - Food consistency<br />5 stars - Completely recyclable<br />1 star - Chance of spilling the sauce all over the place<br /><br />All in all 4 stars - and it would have been 5 stars if the instructions had warned me that the larger and smaller bowls were attached and to be extra careful while removing the thick plastic film cover.  Once you know about this issue you shouldn't have any problems.<br /><br />Good stuff, just a minor engineering glitch.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce is  new product that is convenient and easy to cook. This traditional sauce is created with the flavor of sweet basil, simmered with chunks of real tomatoes, olive oil, carrot and onion.<br /><br />This convenient meal is simple to prepare:<br /><br />1. Pull back film to dotted line to vent, exposing sauce tray.<br /> 2. Microwave for 60 seconds, carefully remove from microwave.<br /> 3. Holding sauce tray down with thumb, slowly remove film.<br /> 4. Pour sauce on pasta, stir and enjoy.<br /><br />The sauce was hearty, full of tomatoes and very good for a microwave meal. The pasta was okay but not to my taste. This would do for a quick lunch or snack. Overall, it's better than most microwave meals.

review/summary: One of the Better Microwave Pasta Meals, but Has One Big Potential Issue
review/text: Before writing this review I came across Alan Holyoak's excellent in-depth write-up, worth checking out. Bottom line: this thing does heat up in a minute and the pasta comes out SURPRISINGLY well-heated and moist, definitely more al dente and not mushy. The sauce is the same Barilla Tomato Basil I've eaten for years, and the fact that it heats up in separate chambers and then tossed together when you sit down to eat it makes for a really good meal. BUT, the peel-away plastic is a disaster waiting to happen. It's really stuck on there, so PLEASE, pull slowly, and as you get near the last inch before it separates from the tray, wiggle it back and forth sideways and coax it gently off the tray, or just use scissors. I've been know to try and jerk the plastic off of these things (Healthy Choice meals peel incredible easy and I'm used to that), and if I did that I'd definitely be wearing half the meal.<br /><br />I'll buy these again for work, they really a good quick way to have pasta for lunch (with a little grated parmesan of course), but it will teach me patience each time I peel it open, lol.

review/summary: Great Idea, Convenient, Worthwhile, Not the Best Taste
review/text: Barilla's new pantry Mezze Penne products are an exciting lineup.  You can enjoy a hot pasta meal in 60 seconds.  Furthermore, the product stores at room temperature, which allows you to take it to work to use in a work microwave, or to have it shipped from a store like Amazon.com without worry in most climates.<br /><br />The pasta sauce is stored in a bin above the pasta.  To prepare the meal, you peal back the top seal to expose the sauce and allow ventilation.  You heat it for 60 seconds.  Let it cool, remove the rest of the seal carefully, pour the sauce on the pasta, transfer it to a plate should you wish, and eat!  It's fast, and it is simple.  No refrigeration required.  It truly is a nifty idea.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are not the tastiest products.  I have tried the Tomato & Basic, Marina, and Spicy Marina.  It's extremely difficult for me to tell a difference between any of the sauces.  The sauces are not great.  Just ok.<br /><br />In terms of the pasta, it comes out slightly gooey and not as soft as it could be.  Just ok.<br /><br />Overall, a brilliant idea.  With the great storage ability, it's not bad to have one or two of these on hand for a long work day, when you want a simple lunch or dinner fast.  However, in general, I would not want to consume these on a daily basis.  Perhaps, over time, they will keep getting better, improve this product.  If they could include just a slightly higher quality sauce and pasta, it could be a real winner.  Right now, just ok.

review/text: At my work we have a half hour lunch time and just two microwaves with as many as eight people wanting to use them. I always try to find items that cook quickly but still tastes good.<br /><br />The Barilla Mezze Penne fits the bill. It cooks up in just one minute (yes, everything was cooked in just a minute!) and it tastes pretty good, too. Don't get me wrong, this is still a microwave meal, so this is not restaurant quality - but it is very quick and very easy and it's not bad, either.

review/summary: Not bad for pre-packaged pasta
review/text: I've eaten lots of pre-packaged pasta products over the years due to work schedules, etc. as it's often less expensive than eating out.  Generally I find most to have overcooked pasta and generally bland sauces.  Until now, I've not tried a Barilla product.<br /><br />This one was a bit different than others I've eaten in that the pasta is actually cooked al dente which was a pleasant surprise!  The sauce is bright and flavorful for a basic marinara type sauce and has a hint of basil.  In another surprise there were also a few chunks of tomato in the sauce.  The amount of sauce works perfectly for the amount of pasta with a portion size that is good for lunch.  Add a small side salad and and a piece or two of garlic bread and this could easily work as an evening meal.<br /><br />Preparation is quick and easy.  1 minute or so (may need longer in smaller microwave ovens) to a hot meal.  I appreciated the sauce being in a separate, removable, container in the package both for mixing with the pasta and the ability to heat it separately an additional few seconds if desired.  Frankly, this design is what keeps the pasta cooked properly as it's not sitting in the sauce on the shelf becoming softer with time.  Just be careful pulling that cover off as it's very well attached and if not removed with caution can easily create a lunch disaster with hot sauce covering everything.<br /><br />Yes, you could make your own for less money but it's comparable in price to competing, less flavorful, products and less expensive than similar dishes at corporate fast-food establishments.<br /><br />Overall a very tasty and convenient product for portable meal needs.

review/summary: Almost 5 stars
review/text: For flavor and ease it does get 5 stars from me. I served it tonight as a side dish for two and it was plenty for both of us. Ready in 60 seconds as it proclaims to be. I can see this being very handy for vegans, and for fast lunch-packing where a microwave is available.<br /><br />I am glad I pre-read the other reviews so I took extra care with opening the package, and even so, did spill a little bit. Thank heavens it wasn't hot yet, because most of it went on my hand, as the container the sauce is in is not  secured down, once you pull back the outer cover it is open, the sauce has no film over it, just the outer cover holding it in place. For this reason I hold back a star. I should think there might be a better way to package this. Knowing up front about the possibility of spilling, though, it was not a big problem for me.<br /><br />Both of us really liked the flavor. The tomato/basil sauce provided for the penne was a bit tangy, just like we like it. We do not like the sweeter-based pasta sauces. The penne was al dente, just right, not mushy. Another plus is that they give you enough sauce to cover all the pasta so it isn't dry. We grated fresh Parmesan on it and loved it.<br /><br />This is a good cupboard dish for a fast meal with a salad (you could add cooked meat if you are not a vegan), or seniors that eat smaller portions. You can't beat that it's ready in 60 seconds. Thumbs up on this one.

review/summary: Well-packaged, satisfying meal.
review/text: Barilla's 9-ounce Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce is a surprisingly satisfying meal in a clever package.  The sauce is included in its own tray, inserted in the larger pasta tray and the heating instructions (in both written and graphic form) are very easy to understand.<br /><br />The portion is large enough to be a main course and I found it satisfying if not exactly delicious.  Once heated (it only took one minute in my microwave), the pasta was slightly oily and the texture of the sauce was thick but certainly pourable.  The sauce is really the feature here and I found the taste slightly acidic, likely due to preservatives.  An herb such as basil doesn't really hold up well in a packaged product and so some consumers such as myself may want to add a sprinkling of fresh or dried basil to add to Barilla's rather weak basil flavor.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good if not great product.  Perhaps the recipe could be fine-tuned but I recommend this product, particularly in that it's filling and relatively tasty, is well-packaged, and would be perfect for a workplace lunch.  Well done, Barilla.

review/summary: good taste for non refrigerated, slighty iffy packaging
review/text: The sauce in this meal is in a cup that sits inside the bowl with the pasta, with a flat tab that fits into the edge of the bowl. BE CAREFUL WHEN OPENING THIS! As you peel back the lid after cooking, you will want to keep your thumb on that flat tab of the sauce cup. There is a circle there so it's easy enough to see. It is very, very easy for that cup of hot spaghetti sauce to pull up with the lid and spill all over you, and it is hot when it comes out of the microwave!<br /><br />As for the taste, I thought these were good. The sauce was delicious, the pasta so-so. It's somewhat grainy pasta -- it's durum whole wheat -- and there is a hint of preservative flavor in it that the sauce can't mask. For non-refrigerated, this was very good, better than expected. You can't beat that it only takes 60 seconds to cook, and you don't have to leave it in the microwave after it's done cooking like you do with frozen. The flavor in frozen dinners is better overall, though.

review/summary: ~~quite tasty and only a minute to cook~~
review/text: I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to the "heat in the microwave" pastas but I love Barilla pasta sause so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I have to say it was pretty tasty!  The sauce has the same great Barilla taste.  And even after just 60 seconds in the microwave the noodles were nice and soft.  The serving size was great for lunch.  After 3 hours I still felt satisfied and wasn't looking for something to munch on.  **WARNING**  You definitly need to read the directions carefully otherwise when you're done cooking it and you tear off the plastic top you could have a huge mess.  The pan the sauce is in is a separate container that is not attatched to the rest of the package and the plastic cover is attatched very well.  I can say with a good amount of certainty that I'll be buying these for lunches!!!

It's stored in the cabinet, which makes cooking time much faster than similiar meals that are frozen, and it tastes so fresh.  After just one minute in the microwave, the pasta is al dente and the sauce steaming warm.  The flavor is very nice, though there could be a little more basil flavor.<br /><br />These Barilla meals are such a great choice to have on hand for quick, healthy, and delicious lunches or dinners.

review/summary: Great flavor, but pasta's a little chewy
review/text: I am always interested in new options for my weekday lunches so I was happy to try out this penne pasta and sauce pack from the Vine program.<br /><br />I followed the main instructions, and then followed the "extra" instructions for getting the pasta to be less chewy.  (Add a touch of water and heat for 30 additional seconds).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*The flavor of the sauce is really, really good, especially for a single-serving package.  It's better than any sauce I've ever had in a product like this.<br />*It really does heat in 90 seconds (or even 60, but I would think the pasta would be super-chewy).<br />*The sauce-to-pasta ratio is perfect.<br />*The sauce compartment is removable, making it easy to combine the pasta and the sauce.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*The pasta is chewy, even with the extra 30 seconds.  It's not terrible but it was enough to knock off a star for me.<br />*As another reviewer mentioned, the plastic covering is attached pretty tightly, so when you pull to get it off the removable sauce compartment, it is not easy to stop the sauce from flying everywhere.<br /><br />All in all, a good little product, especially for less than four bucks per package.  Grab one of these and a little side salad and you're all set.

review/summary: Love Barilla pasta....but not this
review/text: Barilla pasta is one of my favorite non-specialty (low glycemic or other) pastas. It never disappoints.<br /><br />I was excited to try this Barilla shelf-stable meal! But it left me wanting.<br /><br />When it says to hold down the tab when you pull off the cover, DO IT. I almost had a sauce explosion at work all over my lap because I didn't hold it down well enough.<br /><br />But with all that aside: I just found this to be blah, bland, mostly tasteless, and certainly nothing to be excited about. Just some blah pasta and some blah sauce. Not impressive, not tasty, and not anything I would buy on purpose. The texture of the pasta was good, it's not that it was mushy or chewy. But it just seemed like a watery, low-taste kind of experience.<br />I hate to say such negative things about a brand whose pasta product I normally admire! But this dinner, meh. Just mehhhhhhhhhh.

review/text: Upon ordering the Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce I thought this would be a quick lunch to take to work.  Upon receiving this lunch in a box I took it to work and at lunch time popped it into the microwave and folks wanted to know what that delicious aroma was....The box lunch came from Amazon and is definately a great lunch...It is light and delicious and cooks in a minute in microwave.  (Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and BAsil Sauce)

review/summary: Tastes good and easy to fix, but you pay for that convenience.
review/text: This is a nice, quality product.  The pasta is good quality, very tasty, and the sauce tastes good and there is plenty of it.  It cooks up in 60 seconds and is pretty easy to prepare.  As the instructions note, you need to keep a thumb on the sauce "bowl" when you pull the plastic cover off to avoid spilling it, but it was easy to do and I had no problem at all.<br /><br />It is fairly nutritious, tasted very good and is very convenient, but you pay a high price for the convenience.  You could easily buy your own pasta and sauce and make a similar meal more cheaply.  Still, if you think the convenience is worth it, then this delivers what it promises.

review/summary: Wow! Suprisingly good and nutritious!
review/text: I'll be honest.  I got this because it was free and I figured why not.  My first surprise was when I compared the nutrition label to a frozen dinner that contained an enchilada, beans and rice. I figured the frozen dinner would have twice the protein that this Barilla dinner had.  WRONG! This dinner has 11 grams of protein, 2 more grams than the frozen dinner.  This really surprised me because this Barilla pasta dinner has no meat or cheese in it.<br /><br />The second surprise was heating it up.  60 seconds in the microwave. That's it.  It does have an additional step you can take to add 1 tsp of water to the pasta after the intial 60 seconds of heating, to make the pasta softer, but in my opinion, it did not require this step for the pasta to be perfect.<br /><br />The third surprise was the taste.  Very good, with the clear flavor of FRESH basil in a tomato sauce.  The packaging says that it has no preservatives and is 100% natural.  I found this to be a very satisfying dinner and just ordered a package of 6 more!<br /><br />The package does not require refrigeration or added water.  You just open the package slightly (there's even a dotted line for you), and pop it in the microwave. The sauce is in a separate little cup from the pasta, so the pasta doesn't get soggy.  My only complaint (minor) is that I have reduced grip strength in my left hand and it was a little hard to open after it was cooked.  But most healthy adults (and kids) will have no problem opening the package.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for a super easy meal and it will be great to take for school lunches (no refrigerator).  It's probably even better with a little parmesan added, but I wanted to try it as is for my review.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional info in detail for those interested:<br /><br />320 calories, 40 from fat<br />Total fat: 4.5 g<br />Saturated fat: 1 g<br />Trans fat: 0 g<br />Cholesterol: 0 mg<br />Sodium: 690 mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 59 g<br />Dietary Fiber: 6 g<br />Sugars: 8 g<br />Protein: 11 g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 25% RDA<br />Vitamin C: 6% RDA<br />Calcium: 6% RDA<br />Iron: 8% RDA

review/summary: Don't Like the Flavor
review/text: Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce, 9-Ounce (Pack of 6) did not taste very good to me. For $21.00 you get six servings, and I don't feel it's worth the money. For $3.50 a serving, I found this product overpriced due to the taste. Just because I didn't like the flavor, someone else may. I'd suggest tasting one 1st before committing to the six pack.

review/summary: decent consistency, easy to make, but mundane flavor
review/text: This product couldn't be much easier to make:  Peel back the lid to the dotted line, microwave for a minute, peel the lid back the rest of the way to remove it, and then pour the sauce over the pasta.  I did find removing the lid a bit tricky since it's stuck on much more intensely than similar films on frozen meals, so heed the instructions on the package to peel back the lid carefully.  I can easily see someone not only burning themselves but spilling the product all over if care isn't exercised when removing the lid.<br /><br />On to the product itself:  The pasta had a good consistency.  Not quite as al dente as I'd like, but not overcooked mush.  The sauce was disappointing, though, with a smooth consistency like Ragu, not chunky/thick like a better sauce.  And considering that this flavor has basil in its name, one would expect to see and taste more basil.  It really just tasted like tomato paste -- not bad tomato paste, mind you, but merely tomato paste in the end.  If you took this to your office for lunch and you didn't have the ability to add anything to it, you might be dissatisfied unless you like extremely simple cooking.  After tasting just the pasta and sauce as packaged, I decided to add some more basil, some grated parmesan, and some ground beef so I could actually enjoy the rest of the meal.<br /><br />I got a sample of this from the Vine program and, while I certainly found it edible, I doubt I would order it -- particularly given that it's more expensive than many other prepared lunch options available at my local supermarket.  I think that this product would probably be best suited for those who do not have ready access to a refrigerator or freezer but do have the ability to microwave something.  So, if you work in an office with a microwave but no fridge, then this product might be for you.  Just be aware that you might want to keep some dried herbs/spices at your desk to spruce this up a bit.

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: I think that the previous reviewer was talking about a different tea.  This tea does not have anise.<br /><br />This is my all-time favorite tea.  I have tried many, many teas and this is the only one that I really enjoy.  I love Numi Moonlight Spice.  It is the perfect blend of flavors and it very warming with cinnamon and ginger and has a nice balance mixed with orange, lemongrass and lime.  Also there are NO so called "natural flavors" used, only the real herbs and spices.

review/summary: Hard to Drink When Brewed Strong
review/text: Most tea can be brewed stronger or weaker, as desired.  But if you let the tea steep, or put too much in, the spices completely overwhelm the tea and it becomes undrinkable.  You are better off buying this in the tea bags, where the measure is made for you.  And be sure to take the bag out after no more than three minutes; even the bags create an unpleasant brew if you leave them in too long.<br /><br />(I bought both of these direct from Numi).<br /><br />Tiger

review/text: We have tried just about every salted "tortilla" chip out their, and these chips are at the top of my list for best tasting.  They are lightly salted with sea salt, and dusted with pepper, while the pepper is a little much at times they are still really enjoyable, and you don't have to feel guilty because they have 4gms of fiber and 4gms of complete protein in every 1oz serving!  My kids love them witch is a bonus.  I never thought eating something made from just beans rice, and oil could taste so good!

review/summary: Fantastic AND Healthy
review/text: I am gluten intolerant and also need to lose weight (for which I am using Weight Watchers online points plan). It's difficult to find carb or bread items (including crackers) that are not worth too many points. The Orgran crackers are only 1 point for 2 crackers and they are decent sized. They look funny ... kind of airy, but they are crunchy and have a nice flavor (not corn-y). I like them with some whipped (or light) cream cheese and some thinly sliced ham or turkey, like Oscar Mayer Delifresh. Really great for a snack, especially when I want something crunchy.

review/summary: Best tea I have ever had the pleasure of drinking!
review/text: As someone who's most awake between the hours of 7 at night and 3 in the morning, I've always used tea instead of coffee to wake up. I've tried a variety of european & asian teas, both black and green, but I must say that this is the best.<br /><br />  In terms of taste, this one can't be beaten. In addition to the cocoa flavoring,there are also hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, stevia, and clove. Above all, I am unable to taste any hint of bitterness, so this tea slides right down the hatch.<br /><br />  Psychopharmacologically, Yerba Mate is superior to regular teas. I'm a caffein sensitive person, so a single cup of tea can carry me for about six hours. There are tons of xanthines and other psychoactive chemicals in Yerba Mate, and the 'high' obtained is significantly different from any other caffeinated beverages I've had.<br /><br />  One cup of the stuff makes me feel really focused, but very clear and free of the extra thoughts that are usually bouncing around my mind. I've also noticed that it elevates my mood slightly, though that could just be a placebo effect.<br /><br />  Essentially, this tea tastes good & will make you feel great.

review/summary: Delicious blend of Yerba Mate with spices and sweets
review/text: I've been a fan of Yerba Mate tea for somewhere in the vicinity of 17 or 18 years and have always had to drink it with a lot of honey to get around the odd after-taste it tends to leave in one's mouth.  This Mate Chocolatte tea solves that problem with its blend of yummy spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and clove) and sweetening agents (cocoa and Stevia).  Stevia is one powerful sweetener, so there's no need to sweeten this tea at ALL!  All ingredients are fully organic, so you're doing your body good by drinking it.<br /><br />Yerba Mate is great for energy, also (one of the reasons I've been a fan for so long!) since it is naturally caffeinated, plus it helps to rid your body of accumulated toxins while providing you with vitamins, minerals, amino acids and antioxidants. Perfect!  If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your morning cuppa joe, this stuff is for you!

review/text: Really, I was expecting a matte slap in the face, so I was pleasantly surprised.  While mate still isn't my top flavor pick, it melded nicely in this blend. I took a sip straight to get a baseline flavor and was greeted with a mild sweetness, a relatively mellow tea, and the faintest hint of cocoa and spices.<br /><br />Following the instructions, I added a bit of almond milk (which I discovered can curdle a bit), but opted to skip the extra sweetener.  While still good, I actually liked it better without milk added.  Though I am not a latte drinker, and have had some less than stellar experiences with mate, this tea gets the thumbs up.<br /><br />I marked just one star down, as the price is quite exorbant for a relatively inexpensive tea.

Perhaps I drink way too much coffee and am somewhat "immune" to these kinds of effects, or perhaps I expected something more noticeable, or...possibly...the benefits others report are purely placebo.<br /><br />Regardless, I'll enjoy the tea and IF I order it again I will go to one of the other sellers for the cost savings.

review/text: Guayaki Mate Chocolatte is an absolutely wonderful blend! The tea is aromatic and has a mediumish body. The cocoa and spices are blended perfectly... neither overpowers one or another, yet both are prominent and easy to pick up on. The mate is more subtle, however, yet still present. Connoisseurs of mate tea, however, may find this to their disliking, due to how the mate itself is almost in the background.<br /><br />All-in-all, this mate blend is perfect for people new to mate teas, or for a connoisseur of mate who doesn't mind the subtle taste of the mate itself. In my opinion, this mate is best served the morning or as a dessert tea. I recommend serving the tea with no milk and with a teaspoon of sugar, as the sugar helps bring out the chocolate and adds a wonderful layer of complexity.

review/summary: Same yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate
review/text: I am already a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028QDMY">Organic Yerba Mate Tea 25 Bags</a> and a fan of chocolate.  This mix is the best of yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate.  If you are looking for a more milk-chocolate flavor, try it with a little sweetener and milk.  The hint of chocolate gives this yerba mate a more bitter flavor closer to coffee than the plain yerba matte but without the coffee acid and reduced caffeine.  Yerba mate is a good flavor in itself and not just as a coffee substitute.  The chocolate gives us yerba mate fans some variety in flavors.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious.
review/text: This drink had been recommended to me by a friend, who also warned me that it might taste a little earthy.  To my very pleasant surprise, this particular product of yerba mate is spiced in such a way that it requires nothing added to it to make it drinkable.  I down a couple mugs of it now every morning, and am slowly weaning myself off of coffee.  For people who want caffeine, but want to avoid coffee or sugar, I would recommend this drink.  Nothing is needed to add flavor--all the flavor is right there in the little tea bag.  There is an earthy undertone, but it is set off perfectly by the light chocolate and spice flavors.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new drink, especially something a little different from the norm.

review/summary: Guayaki tea is great
review/text: I love the Guayaki brand and had seen the chocolatte flavor online but never in stores until my last trip to Mother's Market (where it was on sale for 4.19, regularly 6.49.) I'm glad I picked it up, it's a great tea, great flavor, no sweetener needed but it tastes closer to chai to me than it does chocolate. I add a tablespoon of organic cacao powder and some organic vanilla almond milk to make it a "dessert tea."

review/summary: Hardly Chocolate
review/text: I hardly caught the chocolate hint in this tea.  It is more of a spicy tea with a teeny tiny hint of chocolate.  It's good if that's what you're looking for, but I was hoping for more chocolate.  I tried it with an almond/coconut milk and without anything added and preferred the tea with the milk.

review/summary: Great Taste & Nice Pick-Me-Up
review/text: This tea has a good mixture of chocolate, mate, and cinnamon with no unpleasant aftertaste.  I was a die-hard green tea drinker and used to add 2 Tablespoons of Agave or Honey per 20 oz. cup. Now, I've completely converted to this tea and I only add 1 tsp. of Agave per 20 oz. cup and it is delicious and energizing.  I'm glad I spend the money for one box to be sure that I really like it.<br /><br />It's nice to know that I'm getting a steady energy buzz without any crashing that I used to get from coffee.  Green tea never gave me a boost of energy though I did enjoy the taste as long as I added a lot of sweetener.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand, and I wish that Amazon sold it in bulk as they do other teas. I found a cheaper source online for six boxes under $39.00 and no shipping cost.  That's about a $17.00 saving from buying 6 boxes through Amazon.  I'd rather buy from Amazon as I'm a long-time customer and trust them.  Hopefully, they are reading this and will sell this particular brand in bulk, in the future.

review/summary: Fantastic Tea
review/text: This is a very delicious tea with the wonderful benefit of yerba mate.  Like other posters, I really don't enjoy the taste of the plain yerba mate and usually blend it with a spicy tea.  This is the only tea that can compete with my love of a great rich cup of coffee.

review/summary: The best tea I've ever discovered
review/text: Not only is this tea delicious, it also makes you feel like a million bucks! The blend of mate, coco, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and stevia is just right. You can taste a little of each without any of them overwhelming the others. It also has the smoky notes and invigorating properties of mate that I personally love.<br /><br />Try it double strength with cream!

review/summary: Tastes like pumpkin pie...
review/text: This takes nothing like chocolate at all.  It has a strong cinnamin/nutmeg flavor that reminds me of pumpkin pie.  I tried one and don't think I'll be drinking any more.  As far as energy goes, I do think it works  - but I can't enjoy the drink enough to continue.

review/summary: My dog LOVES LOVES LOVES these
review/text: I could have sworn I'd written a review on these before...but I guess not!  Now, my dog is far too refined to do anything so gauche as 'training'.  I mean really, a 'sit'???  What unrealistic expectations the primates in the household have!<br /><br />Seriously though, my dog is (perhaps obviously)a greyhound.  True to her breed, she is quiet, sweet, low energy and generally sleeps about 21 hours out of the day.<br /><br />HOWEVER, when THIS treat bag gets shuffled she is all about getting to the kitchen QUICKLY (did I mention she is a greyhound, quickly is pretty darn fast!).<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10, these are a good 11.<br /><br />In the realm of 'would my normally respectful dog climb on the dining room table to get these' the answer is 'only if I'm dumb enough to leave them there'.  Trust me, finding a full grown greyhound on a table is disturbing.  I was only that stupid once--come to think of it I suppose these are great for training--I got trained not to leave these anywhere the dog shouldn't go.<br /><br />In other words these are a nummy delicous treat and you just have to get over the squick-factor that these are actually dried bits of lamb lung.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY JACKIE THE GREYHOUND

review/summary: Great value treats for dogs
review/text: The 10 oz bag of this is HUGE. It is about a foot tall or taller and stuffed full of treats. They aren't really chewy, and they smell a little, but my dog loves them. Perfect size for stuffing his JW ball, I bought the medium size, I think this is it: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DJX44">JW Pet Company Hol-ee Roller Dog Toy, 5-Inches (Colors Vary)</a>.  A bag will last you a long time.

review/summary: Not very sweet, similar taste to stevia.
review/text: I am finding that the amount of this product needed to sweeten tea, for instance, is about the same as sugar.  Therefore this is not a very economical sweetener, compared to stevia products.<br /><br />There is a slight fruity fragrance to it, which is ok, but didn't seem to affect the taste of tea despite changing the fragrance of the tea a little.<br /><br />When we (my husband and I) did the taste test, after sweetening two glasses of the same tea to what I perceived as the same level of sweetness, we couldn't tell the difference between NuStevia and Slimsweet.<br /><br />We also tried mixing the two samples of tea together, as I had read that combining the two improves the flavor, but we couldn't tell any difference.<br /><br />-- Added the day after.  After doing the above taste tests, I took a gallon of freshly-made sun tea, sweetened it with this product, and put it in the refrigerator as we often do.  When I got up this morning I drank some, and I thought it tasted awful, but I didn't say anything to my husband.  Later this afternoon he told me he really didn't like the new sweetener and please don't use it again.  I don't know what changed from the tea samples we had yesterday.<br /><br />If I could change this to 2 stars, I would.

review/text: That about says it all....it's simply horrible. It's not sweeter than sugar. It's not even AS sweet as sugar, and if you use enough to get an equal in sweetness, you end up with a really bad tasting drink. I'm glad I got it on sale, because I tossed all 4 bottles after the first taste.

review/summary: Why did they change it?
review/text: I had heard rumors that Hot n'Spicy had been changed, but ordered anyway, based on the photo of the product that looked the same as I remembered. Boy, was I dissappointed! What I received is vastly different from the Original Hot n' Spicy. First of all, it was obvious when I opened the box and saw a bunch of orange and black bags, instead of the green and white bags I had expected. Second, the flavor and texture is different, too. It is significantly spicier, which means my kids can't eat it (they LOVED the old version, so I ordered a LOT). The new version also has a different texture-more of a glaze than a seasoning-that I really do not care for. Anyway, I am giving it three stars because as snack mixes go, I still prefer this one...but I sure wish they would bring back the old formula.

review/summary: Will clear out your sinuses - and air out the rest of you while it's at it
review/text: I have not had the previous version of these in the green package as cited by some reviewers, so I cannot comment regarding a change in formula. I happened upon these puppies by chance at the grocery store - had never seen them before. I'm a fan of the "Flamin' Hot" variety of Cheetos and other snacks, but I also love Chex, so I thought this would be the perfect combo.<br /><br />Note to self: this is not from the same company that brings you Flamin' Hot flavored snacks.<br /><br />This is hotter. SO hot, I'm coining a new name - hottier. It seared the top layer of my taste buds off and is cauterizing the lining of my pipes as I type this. This stuff is HHHHHHHOTTTTTTTT!<br /><br />I'm the type of person who usually buys 'medium' hot salsa, but can handle some hot varieties. Flamin' Hot flavored snacks pale in comparison in regards to Scoville units. I do not know what the Scoville units are for either variety - but I can tell you, the soft inner lining of my digestive tract was not prepared for the assault I unleashed upon it by masticating this snack mix.<br /><br />I can echo the sentiments of another reviewer - this is somewhat mislabeled. This is more of a Cajun blend than merely a hot blend. A review of the ingredients do not reveal any cayenne pepper, Tabasco or other famous Cajun flavorings, but that is the impression I get. I can almost taste crab oil on the back of my throat, but it is not listed in the ingredients. I guess it could be a psychosomatic reaction.<br /><br />I was hoping/expecting flavoring akin to Flamin' Hot - but I cannot tell you if I was exactly disappointed as I was surprised by the Scoville meter in my mouth that was screaming for the fire extinguisher. I can feel a rumbling in my bowels that will no doubt become a topic of discussion with my husband when I get home this evening.
