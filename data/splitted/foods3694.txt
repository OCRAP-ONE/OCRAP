review/summary: strawberry quik
review/text: Gatorade has created a protein recovery drink that is aimed at helping you muscles to recover after  rigorous workout. I love to work out and I am very  familiar with different types of protein drinks. The main thing I look for in a protein drink is the taste. If the drink taste good I have no problem drinking. Gatorade managed to make this protein to taste like Nestle Quik so it doesn't taste bad. Thee isn't much protein with only 20 grams per each can. Compared to other brands this is a minimal amount. There isn't anything that stands out about this product to make me a repeat buyer or to recommend it. My favorite protein drink is from muscle milk so I will be sticking with them.

review/summary: Tastes Great, But Too Much Sugar
review/text: This product does taste really good to me compared with something like muscle milk that is not as sweet.  But there is a good reason, this has 27 grams of sugar vs. the 5 grams in the same size muscle milk.  This amounts to more empty carbs and hardly any healthy fats.  So even though the protein content is nice with 20 grams, the relatively high calories, lack of healthy fat, and overuse of sugar make me only give this a 3 out of 5 for overall health and usefulness in accomplishing your goals.  I also take a soy based shake which has about 15 grams of sugar and 20 grams of protein that tastes nearly as good, so for me I am going to stick with muscle milk and my soy shakes for now despite the slightly better flavor.

review/summary: Tastes great if you can get past the slimy, chalky texture
review/text: When I first opened this can of Gatorade Protein Recovery Shake, I was unpleasantly surprised. The most noticeable part about this drink is the consistency of the liquid is incredibly thick. The drink feels oily, or possibly even slimy in my mouth. After swallowing, the drink left a kind of chalky aftertaste in my mouth. I could taste the strawberry flavor, but the flavor is not as strong as I expected. Of course, the reason the drink feels so thick is that it has 20g of protein in every can.<br /><br />I have not had a chance to try this drink out immediately after exercising, so I cannot give much comment to its effectiveness as a recovery method from strenuous athletic activity. However, the taste of the drink would be enough to keep me away.<br /><br />I recently tried the Gatorade Nutritional shake, and much preferred the taste of that product to this one. If you are looking for a way to quickly recover protein after a hard work out, then this drink might be a solution. However, the bad taste and consistency may be enough to keep you away.

review/summary: Good mix if you don't have time or ingredients for homemade
review/text: We like this mix when time is shorter or I don't have everything I need for chicken curry made from scratch.  As noted before, it is a hot mix.  With Shan spice mixes though, you can use what you like, so if you're leery of the heat, I would suggest just using 1/4-1/2 a packet first. If you want it hotter next time, increase the amount.  I'm surprised at the price for this - we get these mixes locally for 99 cents a box.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: One of my healthier decisions was to cut down on coffee. I'm a tea drinker, but sometimes I just want something more coffee like. I ordered a sampler pack of Teeccino tea bags awhile back and found my favorites, Hazelnut and Vanilla Nut. The tea bags make it super easy to take this anywhere or use at home with easy clean up. I steep mine for 5 minutes and sometimes add almond milk or just drink it black. There are dried dates in Teeccino so it does have a slightly sweet flavor and 12 calories per bag (according to my box). This is a really great value, you're getting 50 tea bags!

review/summary: Teeccino Hazelnut Caffeine-free Herbal Coffee
review/text: Teeccino is a wonderful, caffeine-free alternative to coffee. After giving up coffee (because it was keeping me up at night), I switched to decaf, but decaf was bitter and still contained a small amount of caffeine. I read about Teeccino and then ordered the "tee" bags. Although you can buy the ground variety and brew it like coffee, I chose the tee bags so that I could take them with me to restaurants.<br /><br />The taste is much bolder and richer than tea, and you can smell the dates, figs and herbs wafting up from your cup. I don't miss coffee in the morning anymore. I ordered the Teeccino sampler to taste all the different flavors available, and Hazelnut is one of my favorites.

review/summary: My rubber plants have never looked this good!
review/text: I didn't read a very important part of the instructions on this product: Shake Well! It's very true. I use a clean, dry washcloth and sprayed it on the cloth, not the plant (it got runny and drippy and went down the stalks on my rubber plant when I sprayed it directly on the leaves). Use the cloth in one hand and support the leaves with the other hand, pressing the leaf between your palms and working the spray into the leaf. Yes, you have to do these individually, and yes, it takes time. After I went through the first time, I used another clean cloth and did it one more time to make sure that all the dust and years worth of grime was gone from the leaves. I then polished them with just the dry cloth to make sure the residue (droplets) was gone.<br /><br />My rubber plants have never looked this good.

review/summary: Shines like no other!
review/text: Miracle-Gro Leaf Shine is the best product that I have found to make your "hard-surfaced" leaves sparkle! If you have extremely dusty leaves then I recommend spraying and rubbing the leaves gently with a soft cloth or soft paper towel like Viva. If your plants are just dull looking then all you will have to do is spray and walk away...Yep, it's that easy! The directions say to make sure plants are well watered first...not sure why but I have never needed to and my plants seem happy none-the-less. NOTE: This is NOT for all plants!!! Don't even think about trying it on African Violets (or other soft leaf plants)! They will Die! DIE! D I E !!! I wouldn't try it on tropical plants either if you are especially fond of them....once in awhile some of those types of plants are unhappy with the product and die. (You could test a few leaves a couple of times and see how they do).<br /><br />I second the reviewer that said, "they don't bother allergies". I am allergic to almost EVERYTHING scented and this product doesn't even make my nose tickle! The bottle does say odorless...not exactly true but the very weak smell probably is unnoticeable to most.<br /><br />In closing, I have been using this product for over twenty years and have been extremely pleased with the results. Try it you'll be happy you did.

I took off one star because eating this straight is pretty hard-core SOUR and your nostril hairs might curl back and slap your brain. =O<br /><br />I recently tried this sauerkraut in a German beef roast slow-cooker recipe and it was soooooo good and really tenderized the beef and the dipping juices were to die for in sandwiches and cooking this kraut with meat really mellows out the flavor and turns the zing into a singing sensation of tastebudgasmic proportions. YUM.<br /><br />For you hard-core krauts who like a little sour cabbage on your sandwiches each day, this stuff stays indefinitely in a well sealed container in the fridge. I kept 3/4 can's worth in the fridge for weeks without it going funky or moldy AT ALL. So, you could reasonably keep a can of this in a sealed container in your refrigerator for quite a while before it went bad (if EVER).<br /><br />Happy Krautin'! :)

review/text: I bought a couple of these for a party and did not end up using them.  So they sat in my cupboard for quite some time.  I decided to take them with me on a trip and share with girlfriends.  I did wonder if they would even still be good.  But I did not want to throw them away without at least trying to use them.  I don't think I have ever thrown away chocolate!  The directions were specific about heating this product and I followed them to a "T".  Heating 30 seconds at a time in the microwave at a lower power (4-5) and stir after each heat time.  It seems that it might take forever but be patient, it is heating within.  This was a wonderful treat and it tasted wonderful even after all that time of sitting in the cupboard.  We dipped strawberries, pineapple, marshmallows, graham cracker sticks and bananas.  It was delicious!  I am buying more just to have on hand and to send to those girlfriends.

review/summary: Makes Great Iced Coffee!
review/text: I had originally bought this product for hot coffee, but I heard that it dissolves in cold water and since I love iced coffee I thought I'd give it a try.  It works great for iced coffee and I no longer have to spend money on mediocre iced coffee from coffee shops.<br /><br />I just put about a tablespoon of the espresso powder in a cup and add about 12 ounces of cold water.  After stirring for a minute or two, the espresso dissolves perfectly.  I add a little liquid creamer (I like to use the flavored kind so I don't have to sweeten), stir, and I have the most delicious (and easiest!) iced coffee ever.  I keep a jar of this at work and make it at the water cooler.  You may want to adjust the amounts of espresso, water, and creamer for your taste.

review/summary: BEST INSTANT COFFEE!!!
review/text: Love this espresso!  I was camping and forgot our coffee and had to go into the local market and get some instant coffee(which I hate), and we stumbled on Megaglia D'Oro.  Everyone helped themselves to the Medaglia and they liked it.  The next day my brother came to the campsite with a coffee kettle and brewed some coffee for everyone, and after a cup of the brewed coffee, they said they preffered the Medaglia.  Good stuff!  My only complaint is that it comes in a tiny jar.

review/summary: HANDS DOWN FAVORITE INSTANT COFFEE I ALWAYS COME BACK TO
review/text: This great instant expresso is truly sensational & in a class by itself !! What makes this so special is not only the fabulous taste, but its powdered form, making it versatile for baking, making truffles, chocolates, and is easily blended in iced coffee beverages. I have tried many other instant expresso coffees and the others are mostly freeze dried, so the taste is not as good & it does not blend well in iced coffees or as versatile for baking or truffle making. It is reasonably priced on Amazon & I go into withdrawal without my Medaglia D'Oro !

review/text: I'm no fan of instant coffees. They're usually extremely bitter and off-tasting to me, even if they are made from Arabica beans. But, I absolutely love this product. This is the only thing I use to make iced Americanos at home. The results are very good and I don't miss the Starbucks stuff or my money! Haven't tried this hot though. Overall, highly recommended!

review/text: I needed this exact product for a specific recipe from Cook's Illustrated.  I had gone to at least 6 stores to located it and was unsuccessful.  When I googled it, sure enough, Amazon came through.  There was another review that said she was looking for it for a recipe also.  Anyway, it really enhanced the chocolate in the recipe I was making and I'm thrilled to have it.  Pretty great that Amazon has pretty much everything you ever need.  I highly recommend the Cook's Chocolate Desserts magazine.  Each dessert in there will make you look like a professional confectioner.  http://www.cooksillustrated.com/bookstore/detail.asp?PID=520

review/summary: I'm so glad I found you on Amazon, Medaglia D'Oro!
review/text: My local Von's supermarket just stopped carrying this instant coffee. Boo! But I just found Amazon sells it! Yay!<br /><br />First of all, the taste is great. You wouldn't know it was instant in a blind test. It actually forms a delicious crema like it came out of an espresso machine. I'm an ex-coffee snob that mostly cares about caffeine, but this is up to my old standards as a decent cup. If you're a coffee snob, go ahead and buy some. We won't tell your Peet's worshipping coffee snob friends.<br /><br />Second, it's convenient. YOU DON'T NEED TO BOIL WATER! I have a really hard time waking up some mornings. I need caffeine prior to even putting a kettle on. With Medaglia D'Oro, I can just use hot tap water to make that first (double) shot of the morning. And as other reviewers have mentioned, it dissolves perfectly in *any* temperature water, great for when you want an iced espresso or if you want to get fancy and make an ice blended drink. (If your tap water isn't hot enough, one minute in the microwave should get the water hot enough. It doesn't need to be boiling hot!)<br /><br />This stuff is great for camping, backpacking, road trips, and other travel. Also great for baking. I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to order a case.

review/text: I bought this at Central Market for $2.89 just to try it. I've been desperately looking for an organic instant coffee that is available to me locally. I just don't have the time or energy to mess with a coffee or espresso machine early in the morning. I picked up some Medaglia D'Oro and tried it. It was OK, but I can't say I was overwhelmed. I expected it to be a lot stronger. I guess I'm used to Nescafe. However, I do have to say that it wasn't as bitter as most coffee. I could definitely get used to this brand.

I came across Medaglia at my local Kroger and it was cheap, so I decided to try it. That was a few months ago and i'm totally hooked. It's a great pick me up. I mix mine with a cappucinno mix and half milk/ half water and top it off with whip cream. But I have a feeling the stores are trying to sell it off, so  going around all Krogers buying them and stocking up lol. Kroger currently sells them for $3.19

review/summary: The best you can buy
review/text: My son adores Medaglia D'Oro Espresso and he drank all 6 jars in less than one month.  I did use some in my pumpernickle bread (it turned out very tasty) and I tried this myself.  I must admit that sonny loves his espresso so thick and rich from hanging around real Italians when he was little.  He loves the "kick" he gets from waking up with a cup of steaming hot strong espresso.  He turns his nose up at everything else.  Much better than Starbucks he says.  He has turned into an espresso afficiando it seems. He likes his black with no sugar or cream.  Me, I doctor mine up with sugar and cream and love it on the weak side.<br /><br />I sure hope they bring this back at the lower price it was when I bought the 6 pack as I will definitely stock up!!!!

I'd definitely purchase it again.

However, when rushed there are days my usual routine has to be adjusted.  That is when I grab my Medaglia D'Oro jar.  A heaping teaspoon gives my an excellent cup of coffee that I've not been able to find with any of the popular instant coffees that my friends use.  Yes, I know this is a small jar but it lasts me for weeks when travels keep my from my home.

review/text: I love instant espresso powder and this brand is the best I've tried and reasonably priced.  It isn't quite as good as freshly brewed espresso but well worth it when one compares the cost of either the cost of a shot at a coffee place or the purchase price of an espresso machine.  It's great added to hot cocoa, as an ingredient when making any type of dessert with a chocolate or coffee flavor or by liguifying a rounded teaspoonful with a very small amount of boiling water and adding it to a large glass of ice cold milk; YUM!  My only complaint is that, so far, Amazon hasn't added this product to Subscribe-and-Save. (hint, hint)

review/summary: Husband loves it
review/text: Since I can no longer drink coffee I have been trying to come up with something for my husband. It doesn't make sense to make a pot of coffee for one person plus the regular coffee just hasn't been tasting the same no matter what brand it is. I originally bought some of this to use in making coffee ice cream and baking so it was sitting on shelf.  One morning my husband wanted a cup of coffee really bad, so I told him to give the Medaglia D'Oro a try.  The first cup he followed the directions on the jar. Thought it wasn't bad, but a little strong, so the next cup he used only a teaspoon and is happy as a clam. Now he can have a cup of coffee whenever he wants and I don't have to mess with the coffee pot again.  If you use to like instant coffee, but don't like what they have done to it, give this stuff a try.

review/summary: Makes Decent Espresso
review/text: This is a great work around from brewing Espresso at home. The bottle says to use 1 rounded teaspoon per 3oz of water. In my opinion, this makes a very weak tasting Espresso and tastes similar to an Americano.  I use 2 teaspoons per 3oz of water and that comes out to around the strength I am used to from coffee shops.  Compared to fresh brewed or coffee house Espresso, this tastes slightly thinner, less rich, and has a slightly dry after taste however it is pleasing and highly drinkable. I've even obtained a slight crema.  If you like Espresso, I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I have had all different kinds of coffee and like to think I can make a pretty decent cup of coffee.  This stuff was purchased more for cooking and also to make some shakes in the blender-- it works perfect for that and has great coffee flavor.  When using it as an instant powder for a hot beverage, it does not have the best flavor... I think the Sbucks powdered instants are better.  I would pack this in the emergency kit or camp kit as it is drinkable, just not my favorite to make and have as an after dinner beverage with a cookie or chunk of chocolate.

I'm not dozing off, I'm no longer sleepy in the middle of day, great for keeping me going at work. I can praise this coffee enough.  My other fave coffee is 1820, a Costa Rican coffee, I discovered while visiting Nicaragua, which is delicious and powerful (strong, meaning it wakes you up) but is not instant. You can only get that one for drip as far as I know. For instant coffee is this one. I bought it at my local grocery store but I will be buying from Amazon.com and stocking up on this great coffee.<br /><br />Update March 27th...I made coffee ice cream with my new ice cream maker I bought here at amazon.com.  I used 3 regular spoonfuls and wow, what flavor. Absolutely delicious and it was a hit with my family.  I love this coffee. Best kept secret.

review/text: I am a big fan of "Coffee House" coffee drinks.  But at $4-5 each, they can add up in a hurry.  Besides, being in the mood for one and being in the mood to go out and get one do not necessarily coinside.  Here is my solution.  I pour plain old regular coffee into my favorite mug.  Then I add a flovored creamer like the ones made by "International Delight".  Next I heat the mug of coffee in the microwave for a few seconds to make it a bit hotter since the refrigerated creamer cools it off a bit.  Finally, I add a teaspoon or so of this instant espresso and, BINGO instant "coffee house" drink.  The espresso powder adds that distinctive rich taste for much less than $4.

It does not have a bitter taste to it and adds just the right balance to the chocolate flavor in a mocha.  Lastly, I will mention that I have tried the same thing with the coffee brewed at work and the results were disappointing.  The espresso is far superior.

review/text: This little jar contains instant espresso coffee, and makes a potent and tasty brew.<br />  However,,.the well-known "secret" to instant espresso is this:  If you mix instant expresso cofdfee with regular instant, (3/4 regular instant to 1/4 parts instant espresso...or to your taste), you will have a cup of coffee that tastes just like regular ground coffee!<br />  Try it, it works!

review/text: I can buy Medaglia D'Oro locally for about $4.50 a jar -- and I live in Alaska where products usually cost more. Can this price be right on Amazon? It comes out to $15 per 2 oz. jar if the information listed is correct ($89.99 for pack of 6).<br /><br />I love this instant espresso, but I sure wouldn't pay that price for it. I work in a coffee shop where we roast our own beans and have an espresso bar. If you can't get the real thing, this is a great substitute. It's also great for baking.

review/text: I had this stuff a long time ago , and it was OK , but this batch is just plain nasty . I don't expect too much from instant , but I don't want to have a headache first thing in the morning . I'm sticking with Tasters Choice Gourmet Roast when available , it wasn't when I ordered this poison .<br /><br /> Update 9/10: I must have gotten a bad batch on the first jar , because it really did taste like Mr.Clean coffee , so I threw it out . In a pinch I tried another before I got rid of it all and found it to be pretty good like I remembered . Not great but OK . You have to use allot to get a full flavored brew on the quick so for the price I doubt I'll buy it again , but I thought I would add this to be fair .

review/text: This is the best coffee you will ever drink...one word of caution...and this caution makes the pocketbook smile..... this coffee is strong and should use less of it than the recipe calls for.... To get a perfect brew use 5-7 tablespoons for pot of coffee. The result is the most balanced flavor you can imagine.  I've gone to other coffees over the years looking for something different and always have gone back to this excellent brand.  It's rich without the harshness found in most coffees.

review/text: I love this coffee and drink it quite regularly myself. Being from N.O., I look forward to the taste. My word of caution is two fold. One - yes the coffee is strong, it is the chicory that gives it the strong taste. Use half of what you normally use. Second - 28.00 is WAY more than you should pay. Look at the CDM website and you can do better. Check ebay.<br />One last thing, you will either love this coffee or you will hate it, that is what I have found over the years of serving it to people. So, if you are new to it, buy one bag/can and see how it goes.<br />Good luck and hope you are one of the lovers. :^)

review/text: I'm impressed with this shake.  When looking for a protein shake to have at my parents so I didn't have to drag mine on the long flight, I found this as the best for quality and price.  I wanted something tasty, but more importantly had all the nutrition I needed.  At first I wasn't sure how I was going to do with the "marsh mellows."  I love how crunchy/soft they are and I love chewing them instead of swallowing them.  Thankfully it is vegetarian, yeast free, non-GMO and heart healthy.  Not really chocolaty, but I can't say it doesn't taste similar to chocolate.  It's hard to describe except I love it above all of my protein shakes I have EVER tried.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering this again when I visit my parents.

I tried to mix it by hand (suggested mixing method,) but it it too time consuming and difficult. So then I tried the shake blender. Here are my results:<br /><br />A disgustingly sweet mix with now crushed Marshmallow powder. This powder (resulting from blender), got stuck in my throat and made me choke. Still I am using it up cause at this price I can't afford to waste it.<br /><br />I may try another flavor although the sweetness thing is usually a deal breaker.

review/text: I love peach tea (and anything peach flavored), but this has has a cinnamon flavor that is too strong. I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't be honest if I did. I don't like the cinnamon flavor. To me, peach and cinnamon don't belong together. Peach is summer and cinnamon is winter. This tea might be better in the winter as hot tea, but then again, not, because peach is too summery. Cinnamon would go better with apple flavor. As soon as I finish this box, I will not buy it again.<br /><br />The cinnamon is way too strong.  It made me sick at my stomach, and the aftertaste is horrible.

review/summary: which peach tea is best?  not this one.
review/text: I've tried three peach teas, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O94">Bigelow Perfect Peach Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OK6">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Country Peach Passion, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DU2ROY">Celestial Seasonings Blossom Green Tea, Peach, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a>.  It saddens me to say that none of the three is worthy of a four or five star rating.  If you are just looking for a tea that has a nice fruit flavor, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OJM">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Black Cherry Berry, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>.  Here are my thoughts on three peach teas:<br /><br />Bigelow Perfect Peach:  Most Bigelow teas are very pleasant to drink, but this peach tea is the exception.  Unbrewed, the tea smells fruity and has a particularly heavy apple smell that is accented by cinnamon.  It does not smell like peach.  When brewed, the tea smells like fruit; the peach is still not evident.  This is probably not surprising given that the first two are ingredients rose hips and hibiscus. Usually, Bigelow aptly names its teas but I feel this is more of a fruit tea.  Unfortunately, this isn't even a good fruit tea.  The flavor is only memorable for its lack of good flavor.  The flavor is bitter, perhaps because of the lemon peel.  There is a strong aftertaste.  I just don't like this tea.  Bigelow's peach tea is made in the USA and is caffeine free.  1-1.5 stars.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings Country Peach Passion:  Celestial Seasonings misses the mark with this tea.  It is a fine tea but offers nothing exceptional to want to come back to each morning.  The flavor profile is dull and lacks a distinctly peachy flavor.  When unbrewed, the scent is sweet and very much accented by orange.  When brewed, the scent does not change much; it is still quite citrus infused. This is probably not surprising given that the first ingredient is orange peel.  All in all this is a lackluster tea. Flavor wise, all I could focus on was the orange.  I feel like the company should have just put more orange peel in this and made it an orange tea.  I think I would have liked that.  As the tea stands now, I am confused by it.  It is not quite an orange but it is definitely not a peach tea.  It is certainly a better peach attempt than Bigelow's Perfect Pea flavor. This tea is caffeine free.  3 stars<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings Green Tea -Peach Blossom:  This is definitely a green tea.  The green tea scent is quite prominent when unbrewed and easily eclipses any scent that other ingredients might individually offer.  It remains a strong tea once brewed.  You really have to like green tea to appreciate this offering.  I couldn't really identify much peach flavoring in this  I no longer drink this tea hot due to its intense flavoring.  Instead, I brew a bag, water it down, and add ice.  This creates a better version of the diet green tea you might purchase at a grocery.  Contains caffeine.  3 stars.

review/summary: The best peach favor in the US.
review/text: After trying so many so-called peach flavored tea, I still think Bigelow Peach tea is the best in the US. Why so? Because most peach tea sold in the US either taste like Hisbicus Flowers, or with a strong citrus presence which resembles orange or lemon flavor. My only complaint is that this tea is caffeine-free. To solve this problem, I often put this tea bag in the same cup of my favorite caffeine red/black/white tea, and it works very well.<br /><br />For those peach-tea lovers, I also strongly recommend the British brand, Fortnum and Mason: Peach Flavored Black Chinese Tea. It is the best caffine-peach tea I tasted on earth. Unfortuantely, you can purchase that only in their UK retail shops, or through their web site.

review/text: This is my favorite fruit/berry tea without caffeine. The flavor is great, and no other brand compares - well no other common brand in a grocery store. I have not tried any brands added lately or those available at Whole Foods. I'm happy with this and see no reason to switch. The price is excellent as a subsription. I drink maybe 3 cups of this tea at night during the winter. Very soothing and no after taste. Tastes very natural.<br /><br />I also carry these individually wrapped tea bags with me in case I visit with someone. I don't like coffee if it is offered - so bringing my own tea solves the problem what to serve for my host.

When they are not eating people food.<br /><br />  This product is a hit with them. We bought it originality at the price club.  When we saw how well they liked it we went back to get more.<br /> They informed us that what was left was it, and the PC was no longer going to carry it.<br /> My hubby bought the 11 bags.  At that point it was a search on<br />the net to find where we could buy it.<br /> I have not checked all the pet stores, which I will be doing.<br /><br />  This product must taste very good for my dogs to continue to eat<br />it and at this point, they know the bag!<br /><br />  *******  ******  ******<br />Here we are in july of '10.  This is still one of three things our yorkies will eat.  They eat baby food and my husband BBq's chicken or ground meat on weekends for them when we grill.<br /> I keep dry kibble down for them and give them a vitamin.  I try anyway.<br /> This bag is known by sight.  If it is up on the counter, they jump to get it.  I can't tell you have many things we have tried over the years.<br /> Yes. I do know they are spoiled.  But seem healthy now at 10.<br /><br />  There seems to be slight change in texture.  These feel dry, as tho you are at then end of the bag.  The dogs seemed to notice at first, but they still love them.<br /> If you have one really picky eater, this is a great choice.  This would also be a good training tool.

review/summary: Good Product!
review/text: Our Golden Retriever has had digestive issues since birth.  This product seems to sit well with him.  He really enjoys them!  We've also whistle trained him (and the other dogs in the neighborhood as well) by using pieces of these treats as rewards.

review/summary: My dogs favorite!
review/text: These are absolutely wonderful treats. I take them to the dog park, cut up and in my pocket, for my little boy and I feel like the pied piper as all of the dogs surround me ignoring other treats on offer.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I ordered four boxes of these for mothers day (don't ask) at the last minute.  I called to verify that the berries would ship even before they had my order from Amazon.  They called back promptly once they got the order (this must have been the busiest day of the year for them).  they shipped quicker than advertised to make sure they would arrive on time.  Excellent customer service.<br /><br />The berries were well packed, double boxed with foam with cold pack and gorgeous.  The inside box was giftable without wrapping. Someone else brought berries from godiva and the quality was about even. I snitched one just so I could write a review.<br />Excellent.

review/summary: Melts in Your Mouth
review/text: I just happened upon this cookie because a store was moving the product for sale at the checkout. This is the best, melt in your mouth delicate treat. Just a enough sweet, and the key lime presents just after you think where is the key lime. How wonderful and gentle. I can't wait to invite friends over for tea or coffee after a light lunch. I will be the hit of the town.<br />Get some, you will love them.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I found a recipe for chili that looked really good. The only difference in this recipe is that it required New Mexico chili powder. As always, I found what I was looking for on good ol' Amazon and ordered it. It's excellent!

review/summary: Simply the best, and beautiful on a relish tray
review/text: Pickled beets always add a bright and colorful spot on a relish tray, but when they taste as good as they look, they don't last long.
