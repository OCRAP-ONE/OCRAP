review/summary: Became an instant favorite!
review/text: It is indeed a "rich and creamy chocolaty delight" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa!

review/summary: Best Hot Chocolate I've Ever Tasted... Worst Price I've Ever Seen
review/text: I have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this. Not homemade, not from starbucks, not from Swissmiss... This is hands down the best I've ever had. I go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over, they go straight for it.<br /><br />But what happened to the price? Most k-cups run from about $0.45 - $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that. Bring the price back down to something reasonable and your 5-star review will return.

review/summary: A small cup of chocolate flavored water
review/text: For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down.<br />All you are getting with this is convenience of using K-cups, which is not much of one to begin with.<br />Avoid it.

review/summary: Good for a different drink option
review/text: I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker and was looking for k-cups when I discovered this.  My daughter is a hot chocolate lover and so I decided to give this a try.  If your coffee machine has different size drink settings use smallest size setting otherwise it is too watery but when done on the lowest size setting it makes a very good cup of hot cocoa.  My daughter loves it and has it nearly every morning.  It is very convenient and if you have a Keurig coffee maker and are looking for drink alternatives to coffee this is a good choice.

review/summary: "It's OK" describes this perfectly.
review/text: I originally tried this as a part of a variety pack. I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is - a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money.

review/text: I've been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isn't great.  It's not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom.

review/text: I recommend this instead for the same price: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HD0PEQ">Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Milk Chocolate, 16-Count Envelopes (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />This thing falls short, I found myself adding some milk or my non-dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy.  It more or less tastes horrible otherwise.  After I hated it, I decided to make it with a cup of hot milk, I just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk, and it tastes so much better.  In my opinion, they need to up the powdered milk in them, or the non-dairy creamer in them.  It would improve this product so greatly.<br /><br />They are thieves nonetheless, you usually get 10 envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks, buy two for less than ten, and still be spending less than what I spent with these.  I really thought I was buying quality, this is definitely not unless I use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money.  I've drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this.<br /><br />AVOID!

review/text: Definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before brewing.  The kids got a kick out of making their own "kid coffee" but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with 3 marshmallows on top. (The hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy :)<br /><br />The rest of us don't care to waste our daily calories on something that was, in our opinion, chocolatey water.  Still, it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and brew their own hot cocoa without much mess.

review/text: I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate on a cold day. This is okay. You can't expect much when when all you use is water. I would say it is a bit better than the instant hot chocolate packets, but not by much. What I like the best is the easy factor. I can let my 9YO make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets. So for that alone its a great deal. Price is not the best, but again the convienience is key.

Here are my observations:<br /><br />+ Good on "Small Cup" size, a little weak on the "Large Cup" setting<br />+ Shakeup the K-Cup before using (a good tip from another reviewer)<br />+ My wife and kids really enjoy it with peppermint Coffeemate flavoring added<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I LOVE Green Mountain coffee.  I use it all the time for my k cups.  I got a sample of the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa and thought it would be the best.  I actually threw it out.  I tried several times to drink it.  It tasted bitter and like chemicals.  I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very, very odd.  I still would recommend their coffees though!  Just to be fair I did add chocolate redi whip.  But I add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good.

review/summary: watered down hot chocolate
review/text: Received a Keurig brewer for Christmas and also received a pack of this hot "chocolate" with it.  We made some after sledding one day for myself, my husband and 2 kids (6 and 10) all thought it was terrible.  We almost returned the Keurig brewer because of it.  I have found that I am enjoying black coffee with my Keurig, but we will never buy any type of hot chocolate k cups again.

review/summary: Problem with making the cocoa
review/text: I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product.

review/summary: Just like from when I was a kid...
review/text: I remember going with my mother to Payless drug store, which has turned into CVS Pharmacy here on the West Coast.  Payless used to sell these in the 80s and while the packaging is different now, the candy is still the same.  Boy are these good.  My mom got me hooked on them, and on the Milk and Honey ones too, and I just love them now just as much as when I was 10!  I am so glad to find these, the honey inside is very good, and the outside tastes like lovely solid honey.  I love ordering this larger pack since I can just grab a bar and tuck it into my purse and and eat these as a light snack or to freshen my breath.  If you love putting honey on toast, or just eating it out of the jar, you will probably like these.  The honey inside is a light honey, not dark just in case that matters to you.

review/text: I had not seen these candies in my neighborhood for a long time.  I developed a cough and nothing was working.  I tried to find these because I just had a feeling they would work.  I could not find them anywhere, so I searched Amazon, and viola, here they are.  They are a great candy and the drop of honey inside really soothes the throat.  My whole family loves them and everyone I offer them to try like them a lot.  I think Amazon will get a lot of new orders for these.

Honey is an antibacterial agent and very soothing so these make an excellent lozenge in addition to being a wonderful candy.<br /><br />I bought a case so I can hand them out to people having a bad day. :)

review/summary: The Price-ARE YOU KIDDING
review/text: I just bought a 35 oz box of this at Sam's Club yesterday for $7.87.  AND the reason I looked it up on the internet today is because it is NOT GOOD.  I checked and the expiration date on the box says best if used by Feb 16, 2011.  I bought it Jan 20, 2011.  WTH  The raisins in it are so hard they could break your teeth.  The flavor is unimpressive.  The packaging was so hard to open I had to get scissors and then use a zip lock bag because my attempts at opening it, no matter how carefully I tried, caused me to rip the bag.  I doubt I will need to worry about keeping it fresh as I'll probably not eat it again AND I don't think it's very fresh to begin with. YEEEUUUKKKKK  and what's with this price?  Is it a joke?

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/text: It is hard to get just one falvor of this product. I was very happy to order 48 pouches. However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don't receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments.

review/summary: My cats go crazy!
review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.

review/text: I use this low-sodium seasoning blend all of the time. I just add it to a dish at the end of preparation for a punch of flavor. The roasted garlic is milder than fresh, so you don't have to worry about the usual raw garlic flavor, which makes it perfect to sprinkle over soups, salads, baked potatoes, dips, etc. It has it onion, red and green peppers, and additional ingredients in it.<br /><br />5/6/12 Still an excellent product, but not worth the new price. I will not be reordering.

review/summary: great cup of coffee
review/text: I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual Starbucks VIA decaf Italian Roast coffee drinker. Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our "local" Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I've placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf. It seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant.

review/text: I love this stuff.  There isn't an instant coffee out there that's anywhere near this good.  This isn't even in the same category as any other instant.  It actually tastes like real coffee!  Shocking, but true.  It's (no lie) almost as good as freshly brewed Starbucks.  It's also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick.  However, the stuff is so darned expensive that I feel foolish buying it.  Unfortunately, it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows.

review/text: I love Starbucks VIA!!  Nice to have around when you don't want to make a pot of coffee and you don't want to spend $100+ to get a K-cup machine.  There is a slight amount of grit to the coffee from the micro-ground beans mixed in with the instant crystals, however the taste is worth it and not really bothersome.  I wished Starbucks would make more Decaf varieties and more local grocery stores carried it.

review/text: LOVE this VIA product. After a pregnancy filled with morning sickness I wasn't sure I'd ever get my taste back for coffee, but my baby wasn't too old before that old craving came back. But I didn't want to drink high-octane stuff as a nursing mom so was mainly drinking decaf hot tea. When I found these on sale I decided to give it a try ... I'm glad I did. I've moved on to making pots of Dunkin Decaf at home for everyday drinking, but I love these VIA for travel or just an afternoon cuppa. I do wish there were more options in decaf flavors.

review/text: Despite the other review, this is the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  It's a mustard based sauce, so if that's not your thing, move on.  It's not really that spicy (used to be called Habanero sauce), in fact, that would be my only complaint.  As much I love shopping Amazon, buy this direct from their website if you're going to order 6 bottles or more, it's cheaper ($55/12).  It's great on pulled pork and burgers.  Try it!

Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking.

review/text: Like another reviewer here, I use this granulated honey for my tea and I use it for my coffee.  It is oh so much better than white sugar.  I had been in the habit of using the unprocessed sugar, which was good, but this is so much better.<br /><br />This product does indeed give backed goods a bit of a different, in a positive way, flavor and I use it with cookies.  I buy my granulate honey at a local health food shop and the price here, even if you consider the shipping, is quite competitive.  The other advantage is that this stuff is becoming more and more popular in my area and our local shops are forever running out of it.  It is nice to know I have a reliable source.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product.
