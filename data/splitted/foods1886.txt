review/summary: Delicious and filling
review/text: I really, really like this cereal.  There's not a ton of sugar, and it's nicely filling.  The squares stay crunch for quite a long time in the bowl.  The boxes shipped by Amazon were fresh and a long way from their expiration date.  If you haven't had it before, perhaps it is better to try a single box; if you've already had it, you know what it's like.

review/summary: Healthy Family Favorite!
review/text: This cereal quickly became one of our family's favorite! I'm pretty picky about ingredients, I want a cereal that has no sugar, no corn products, and has minimal ingredients. This fits the bill! And the taste is GREAT! My two-year old loves them, and I even love to have them as a dry snack! Very good!

review/summary: Best Cereal in the History of Ceral
review/text: My key cereal metrics:<br /><br />- Must not rot my teeth with high-fructose corn syrup<br />- Must be healthy without tasting like wood pulp<br />- Must stay crunchy in milk for more than a couple minutes<br />- Must be able to grab a handful and eat as a dry snack<br /><br />This one checks all the boxes.  It's got a great subtle vanilla/almond flavor -- not sugary and not bland.  The only problem I can find is that a 6-pack only lasts a week in our house.

review/summary: Beats Cinnamon Toast Crunch
review/text: Looking for a change, I decided to pick up a box of these. The taste is quite different from what I am used to. The texture is more like the oats style so there is a bit more of a crunch to it than other cereals. The taste feels to have a little less of the sugary aftertaste as Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It also appears to be slightly more healthy but I don't have a box handy to compare. With Subscribe and save, the prices are cheaper than Trader Joes so if you are already a fan, this is the place to get it.

review/summary: Barbara Oats
review/text: After eating these puffed little bite-size oats (original) for so long I fell completely in love with them.<br />In January of this year I found myself in the hospital. I ordered the well known oats in the little yellow box for breakfast. Although I was quite ill, I still wanted my oats. Well, I took one bite and tasted the chemicals that were in that cereal. Not to gross you out but they ALL came right back up.<br />The Barbara's Bakery bite-size oats are THE best and I will continue to eat them.<br />I sure hope they have them in Heaven.<br />Thanks so much for selling them.<br />EW

review/summary: Tasty syrups at a bargan price
review/text: If you like banana flavored coffees, such as Fosters Banana Nut, then this syrup is definitely the product for you to try.  By using the syrup you can regulate how much banana flavor to introduce to your coffee cup to your specific taste (just a hint, or alot).  The flavor is slightly sweet, leaning much more toward banana than "nutty."<br /><br />Buying banana flavored coffees can be hard to find in the store and at times, rather costly.  Last year I bought one 750m bottle of Big Train at a store and it cost me over $10 and when I saw on Amazon that I was getting three 750m bottles for a similar price with free shipping (spending $25 or more), I just had to buy it.  Three bottles will last me a long time and I can introduce this yummy flavor to my coffee any time I want.  For the bargain price, I would recommend that you try it if you like banana flavored coffees (if you don't like it you can always send it to me - LOL). I may try this with other foods such as ice cream to see how it tastes.

review/summary: Cat Loves Tender Slices
review/text: This is the only flavor my cat will eat.  She goes<br />crazy over this flavor.  I think because it is easy<br />to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little<br />square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever<br />I open a can of this, she comes running!  She's meowing<br />at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand, and I<br />imagine that she is saying "Hey, hurry up and open that<br />can! I know what you got there.  You can't fool me.<br />Gimme that yummy food!"  But of course, she's saying<br />that in cat language.  Because I love her, I can totally<br />understand what she's saying.  What cat lover doesn't?<br />We definitely have that connection with our cats, don't<br />we?  To her, Tender Slices is the ultimate gourmet meal.

Once again, in a nutshell, honey is inedible, gritty, like sand or glass. Touch of Europe will not take it back. Never had this problem before.  The consumer takes a huge risk and a leap of faith when ordering online.  This company via Amazon did not deliver.  What's worse, is that they will not make good on the purchase..$40 for honey!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will never order from Touch of Europe again. Amazon should drop them like a hot potato...takes away their credibility.  Let's see if this is published.

review/text: Making this at home is easy! Take some cardboard and soak till it's thoroughly squishy, then sprinkle with cheese dust.<br /> The mushy texture, and the almost flavorless cheese 'sauce' makes this a repulsive meal. And I just cant imagine why they would market this as two servings in an obviously one serving container. Are you supposed to share it with a friend?  So I hope you need some fat, cause you get a whopping 16 grams of it if you eat the whole thing. I'm sure you can find something better tasting for the same amount.

review/text: This is a very smooth, good-tasting chocolate with a thin caramel center.  If you are familiar with Cadbury's Caramello bar, this will seem similar to you, except that the center caramel pocket is much thicker on a Caramello bar.  Personally, I am just as happy with a Caramello bar, and it's much less expensive, generally speaking.  If you order this bulk item, you'll have a lot of packaging to throw away, as it is packaged exactly as you would find it in a grocery or drug store.  However, if you plan to give these bags away as gifts, this packaging is a good thing, as it will help keep it fresh.

review/text: I was completely surprised when one of my customers brought this cake mix to me to use for their wedding cake, I made it and it was wonderful.  They paid $5.25 per mix, so once I realized how easy it is to use and how wonderful it is I began my search and was so excited to find it at such a good price.  I tried mixing in different ways, according to package directions and also separating the eggs and beating the whites and folding them in as the final step in preparation.  It was an effort to see how much height I could get.  Beating the whites separately did give a little more height, but all in all I determined it was not worth the extra trouble.  It is wonderful as it.  I used one mix in a 10 inch square pan, baked three layers and stacked them.  It made a very tall, nice, rich brownie-like cake.  I don't need gluten-free but am so crazy about this mix I have a case now, for my personal use.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: The BEST chocolate cake mix!
review/text: This is a wonderful, rich cake mix.  My family and I are in love with this stuff.  It makes 14 cupcakes, big ones.  We freeze half for the kids to take to school for treats, the rest are consumed almost immediately!  My advice is to let the mix set for 15 minutes before baking, the liquid absorbs more and your cake will be even more moist!  I will be using Pamela's for a long time!

review/summary: A Dissenting Opinion
review/text: After reading the many positive reviews here on Amazon, I bought a bag of this chocolate cake mix at a local store, and baked cupcakes last night.<br /><br />Just for the record, this is the third brand of gluten-free chocolate cake mix I have tried, and I really liked the other two: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVHYC">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix, 26-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQP5IE">Betty Crocker Gluten Free Devil's Food Cake Mix, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />Also, I'm somewhat of a chocolate cake connoisseur.  The chocolate cake I used to bake before going gluten-free often received comments that it was the best chocolate cake people had ever eaten.<br /><br />I find it difficult to account for the many enthusiastic comments about this cake.  As soon as I began pouring the mix into a bowl, I noticed the odor of what I assume was the "natural flavor".  It smelled almost perfumey, out of place, and definitely not like any ingredient I would have ever used in my baking.  But I still hoped that, when baked, the cupcakes would taste good.<br /><br />While the finished cupcakes had an excellent appearance and texture (even the next day, and after having been frozen), the taste was awful.  There was an "off", unnatural taste about them, and they were too salty.<br /><br />I much prefer the Namaste and Betty Crocker mixes, and definitely will not be buying this one again.

review/summary: I agree with Butterfly's review
review/text: Like Butterfly said in that review, I purchased one package of this at the store to try it first, and enthusiastically made it with all the glowing reviews it had on it.  I did not follow the directions as directed, per se, but made it the way a typical cake is made (beating the egg whites separately and adding at the end).  I also added an extra egg, as directed on the package, for a lighter cake.  In addition, I added vanilla extract to add flavor.  I let the cake "rest" in the pan (uncooked) for about 10 or 15 minutes, as well, before putting it into the preheated oven.<br /><br />I agree with Butterfly that early on, it had a smell to it that seemed unnatural.  Then I tasted it and it still seemed...well, "off".<br /><br />We did not taste it until about 6-8 hours later.  Before trying it, I made a homemade chocolate fudge icing to put on top (which was too good for its own good!!) and had it for dessert after dinner.<br /><br />The cake itself turned out very moist and fluffy, like a cake should! :)  The taste, however, continued to taste "off".  I don't know how to describe it, but it just didn't taste like chocolate cake, to say the least.  The icing I made definitely saved it and everyone scrumptiously ate it up without complaint.  The next day, it did taste a little better and that unnatural taste began to fade.  It still wasn't delicious, but it wasn't bad either.  By then, the fudge icing began to melt slightly under the top layer of icing and that made our taste buds go back for more.  :)<br /><br />So overall, it was okay.  Would I purchase it again?  I plan to try a few other gluten free chocolate cake mixes, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVHYC">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix, 26-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00473U3BM">King Arthur Flour Chocolate Cake Mix, Gluten Free, 22-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a>, and then we'll see.  However, it wasn't so awful that I would never consider it again.  I would keep this on hand for a quick baking mix and just add a few extra ingredients next time, as well as make the fudge icing again.<br /><br />This was my first time trying any of Pamela's products, but it won't be my last.  I do plan to try other products Pamela's has to offer and I hope those taste as great as the reviews say!  :)

review/summary: Was not impressed...
review/text: The texture of this cake was very moist but that was about the only thing we liked about it. I made it exactly as instructed on the box. My husband and I both thought that it had an "off" taste to it, however, the odd flavor was hardly noticeable while the cake was still warm. I would liken the flavor to something that was artificially flavored.  The next day it was very evident. I didn't frost it so there was no icing to hide nor change the flavor.  The first thing I noticed was how heavy (almost bitter) the chocolate flavor was. I LOVE chocolate and am not usually opposed to very rich chocolate but this wasn't rich in a good way. It made me wonder if the overwhelming chocolate flavor wasn't meant to mask the odd taste, if so it doesn't work.  Though we didn't like the pamela's cake mix we LOVE the Pamela's Chocolate Frosting (see my review on it).

review/text: I purchased this cake so that everyone can eat it (for a birthday).  Instead of adding butter (which I use to love to cook with) I added coconut oil.<br /><br />In addition, I made chocolate frosting 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, water for consistency (start with 1 tablespoon) and coconut oil 1/4 cup.  Also, 6 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa.<br /><br />This was the most delicious chocolate cake.....ever!  Divine!  Enjoy!

review/summary: Wonderful gluten free cake!
review/text: I bought this cake mix for my son's birthday hoping for the best, based on prior experience with other Pamela's products.  Wow!  It was so delicious!  I added an extra egg per the directions in order to make it lighter, added some chocolate chips, and frosted it with chocolate icing.  It was a hit!  We all knew it was gluten free but I would bet that if we took it to a party and didn't tell people that it was gluten free - I bet they wouldn't know.  Gluten free cakes I've had in the past were on the dry side and the texture was off so you knew you were eating something different.  The taste and texture of this cake were great!

review/summary: Best gluten free chocolate cake, hands down
review/text: Since my diagnosis of celiac disease, my family and I have tried several gluten free cake mixes, all of them ranging from "yuck" and "at least it's cake" to "mildly disappointing."  Pamela's cake is the best, no question.  Not only is it free of dairy and soy (along with wheat, I cannot digest legumes, and many gluten free products seem to rely on bean flour), but it makes TWO layers of cake.  Compare that to Betty Crocker, who, bless her heart, tried to introduce a gluten free cake mix, only to have it make one measly layer.<br /><br />With one bag of Pamela's cake mix, you can make a two layer birthday cake for your favorite person with celiac.  This cake is so moist, and yes, the texture does change a bit over sitting, but we like our cakes denser, not so fluffy they flop around on our forks.  Usually I'm more a fan of the frosting than the cake, but this is a cake you could serve without frosting.<br /><br />Also, it's easy to make. My husband and kids made this without any practice, and they are not experienced gluten free bakers. It's easy as pie. Or cake.  We'll be trying the vanilla variety very soon!<br /><br />Thanks, Pamela!

review/summary: Rich, Dark Chocolate Taste!
review/text: As someone with various digestive problems, I am constantly searching for good-tasting foods that do not have traditional ingredients that seem to cause me GI grief.<br /><br />Pamela's Products have not disappointed me in texture, flavor or presentation.  This Luscious chocolate cake mix is easy to prepare and the package recommendations are to hand mix.  You just add two eggs, some oil and water, and mix until combined.  The batter is a deep, dark chocolate color that stays that way until you take the cake out of the oven.<br /><br />The texture of the cake is soft and moist.  The flavor is almost a non-sweetened dark chocolate, and this cake is great without frosting.  (I just added a scoop of vanilla  ice cream to mine.)<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this cake mix to anyone who doesn't eat gluten or wheat products, and likes dark chocolate flavor!

review/summary: Absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten, gluten or gluten-free!!!!
review/text: Just wanted to say that I am 56 years old and have been a chocolate lover ever since, as a small girl, I first ate my aunt's homemade devil's food cake. Recently, I made Pamela's chocolate cake for my 33 year-old son who is gluten intolerant. I used the recipe on the bag that adds some mayonnaise (or maybe it was vegannaise, which was what I used). All 4 of us who were there agreed that it was the richest, moistest, most chocolatey cake we had ever eaten and we could not stop picking in it! O, now we are spoiled! Tonight I will be making the brownies as we are visiting a family that has 3 gluten intolerant members. I'm sure we will be pleased! Thank you, Pamela, for all your labors of love to develop these wonderful products! God bless you! Betsy S.

review/summary: Chocolate cake that can pass for the wheat version any day!
review/text: I take this mix as a cake or as cupcakes to friends' houses all the time and they rave about it.  Three of my non-Celiac friends even buy it for themselves.  It is moist, springy and the flavor is excellent.  If you beat it too much or cook it in a pan that is too big it can take on a rubbery texture.  Cupcakes especially work well. I like to slightly undercook it so that the top of the very middle of the cake is sticky, almost fudgy.  Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream match the texture of this cake very well.

It is delicious.  Very moist and chocolate lovers delight.  I would even rate it better than most flour mixes.  I have brought this cake to many functions and all who try it fall in love with it.  I have tried the sour cream and the mayo preparation and both were excellent.  I also throw in a few chocolate chips and top it with cream cheese frosting. Yum!!

We had tried the vanilla cake mix and found it too heavy even with adjusting it with more water and more eggs, not bad, but a little to firm for our liking.  Then we tried the extra egg and extra water for this version, and holy mac, it turned out moist and delicious.  No need for frosting as on it's own it had a very chocolatey taste.  It was tough not eating them all in one go!  Filled our kitchen with such a wonderful chocolate smell!  I added 4 eggs to the basic recipe and an extra 1/4 cup of water.  here we go, we are now on subscribe and save!

review/summary: Darn Good!
review/text: If you want something sweet, evil and chocolate that just happens to be good for you, then you want this cake mix.  You can add your own touch to this gluten free product.  You can separate the eggs, folding the egg whites in during the latter part of your mixing the batter.  Even if you follow the instructions exactly as they are given on the package, you still get a cake that is so sweet, so delicious and so evil (as we all know chocolate is).  The cake itself tastes more like a brownie and has a brownie-like consistency.  I especially love coconut, so I suggest adding a little grated coconut and a tiny bit of coconut flavoring/extract to give this cake an even better flavor.  I love Pamela's Products and highly recommend this one!

review/text: My daughter is newly on a GFCF diet and her birthday is coming up. I made cupcakes for her preschool using a Cherrybrook Kitchen boxed mix and it was so disappointing (stiff, odd-tasting). For her birthday cake proper, I tried Pamela's Luscious Chocolate Cake Mix instead and WOW it's just really delicious cake! It doesn't seem like a dietary restriction at all. One advantage of Pamela's is that you add your own eggs, so I separated the eggs, beat the whites and folded them in gently at the end (being sure not to overmix, as the package instructs). The cake was fluffy, moist and completely delicious, with a fairly fine crumb. Be sure you bake it until it springs back to the touch, otherwise it may fall and just be a moist wad -- at least that's my experience with other GF baked goods.

review/summary: Best cake mix I've ever had!
review/text: My husband has had Crohn's disease for about 10 years.  Since we went gluten free, he feels great and has stopped taking any medications.  I feel great too so I will happily stay gluten free.  When we first decided to go gluten free, I went to the health food section of our grocery store and loaded the cart with a lot of different gluten free foods.  The first night, I made this cake.  I took one bite and thought, "I can easily go gluten free!"  This cake is wonderfully chocolate and the texture is perfectly gooey.  I quickly ordered a case.

review/text: Pamela's Chocolate Cake Mix is far and away the best gluten free cake mix I've found. This cake is moist and delicious, easily as good as any non-gluten free mix out there and better tasting than some. I've also used Pamela's Gluten Free Bread Mix and Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix. They produce the best gluten free bread and pancakes we've found. They are far superior in texture, flavor and moistness to any other gluten free mixes we've tried. And we've tried many others both packaged-complete and custom mixed flour blends. I cannot recomend them strongly enough for those that need a gluten free diet.

review/text: I bought a case of this chocolate, guten-free cake mix. It is delicious. My daughter, who has celiac, loves chocolate cake with chocolate icing. Now I can easily make it when she comes to visit. All the family likes it, too. It is pricey, but the convenience is worth the money to me. I send the packages of cake mix that I don't use home with her. One suggestion is to bake it in two round cake pans. It turns out better.

It was decent at best when fresh and a few hours later when the cake had cooled down the texture changed and it became really dense and chewy, very unpalatable. I spit out the bite I had taken and threw the rest of the cake away.

review/text: The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.<br />So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts "dancing".<br />I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again.

review/summary: Helped me get her weight down
review/text: These chew sticks keep my dog's teeth pretty clean between cleanings.  That's what they're supposed to do.  But when my dog developed a weight problem, and the vet vetoed "doggie treats", these little goodies kept ME out of the dog house.  When the treats stopped coming, my dog whined and put on a show of such pitiable neediness, that I had to do something to quiet her down.  I remembered that the ingredients in her Dental Stix were healthful and not likely to hurt her weight loss program a bit.  I went back to using these as directed, and my dog kept on losing weight, reached her goal, and has stayed there.  And we did it without her feeling deprived.  Not bad at all!

review/summary: How much caffeine?
review/text: Buyer beware.  Notice how carefully worded the descriptions are to avoid stating the caffeine content.  Many other sites still quote Perky Jerky's original advertizing claim that Perky Jerky contains 150mg of caffeine (from guarana).  Before you buy you should know that, due to federal Food Safety and Inspection Service intervention, Perky Jerky no longer contains anything close to 150 mg of caffeine.  U.S.D.A. officials explained that the Food Safety and Inspection Service "would not allow producers of beef jerky to add sufficient quantities of guarana to produce a stimulant effect." You can read the original source published in the New York Times:  [...]<br />Notice that the company now refuses to state how much caffeine their product contains.  The description says: "Perky Jerky, the caffeinated beef jerky is an all-natural, great tasting snack with a kick: an energy-drink's worth of invigorating caffeine in each serving."  But some "energy" drinks contain very little caffeine.  This new and intentional vagueness about their main claim does not bode well.  Buyer beware.

review/text: Food, like art is a matter of personal taste.  For me, Folgers was the best at home coffee made.  I happened to buy Kirkland Colombian Supremo buy chance and have bought it ever since. Kirkland uses 100% Arabica beans unlike other companies.  I've just<br />finished reading an article regarding the major coffee companies substituting lower quality Robusto beans in their mixes...including Starbucks.  Kirkland is still pure Arabica.  Amazon is one of the few places you can buy Kirland's if you don't have a Costco in your area, so the price is double from what I pay.  However, if I didn't have a local outlet, I would pay the price.  I like it that much...you may not.

So I'm done buying Kirkland products because they've raised prices on ALL their products when everyone is struggling for money. Good riddance.

review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by "the all natural flavor of bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Best Earl Grey tea!
review/text: Within seconds of immersing St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea bag into steaming water, the enticing, aromatic blend of Ceylon tea and the all natural flavor of bergamot, a citrus fruit, wafts gently above your tea cup.  The uniquely pleasing taste of St. Dalfour's Earl Grey tea could be due to its 100% certified organic status - no chemicals or preservatives to interfere with its taste.  Each tea bag is hermetically sealed in a foil-wrapped container which retains its flavor until tea time.<br /><br />From St. Dalfour's site:<br />"Does it taste great and is it as healthful and nutritious as possible? These are the principles which are at the core of each line of St. Dalfour products. A simple philosophy. For simply fantastic food. The quality of our products depends on each ingredient, so we travel wherever necessary to source the finest raw materials. Products are released to market only after they have attained and surpassed the most rigorous standards. In this age of finding shortcuts and cutting costs, we remain guided by only one criterion: offering our consumers in over 90 countries worldwide the very finest all-natural products and ensuring that they are worthy of the St. Dalfour name."
