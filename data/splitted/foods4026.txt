review/summary: Economical and Delicious
review/text: I've been drinking white teas for years and was thrilled to find the Prince of Peach Organic White Peony teabags on Amazon.  My local store only carries the smaller box of this particular Prince of Peace tea, and since we drink it daily, Amazon will be our go to source from now on.  The tea is not the prized Silver Needle, but for an organic tea in an unbleached bag with little packaging waste that is all compostable, it's a no brainer.  I brew it at a lower temperature, usually filtering the boiled fresh water over an ice cube as its being poured onto the teabag/s.  I highly recommend this white tea!

review/text: Should have known better as 100 tea bags for $9.00 seemed awfully low. This white tea cannot compare to some of the brands available where 20 tea bags cost around $4.00. Does not even taste like a quality white tea. After 10 cups will not use any more.

review/summary: Zippy Coca Tea
review/text: Mate de coca (coca tea) has been used for centuries in the Andean countries as a pick-me-up and to counter the effects of altitude sickness.  I didn't know it was legal to sell in the U.S. but was very happy to find it on Amazon!  I ordered some and just made a small pot of tea (using two tea bags) as a pick-me-up because I was feeling sleepy and tired.  The tea is mild-tasting, much more so than the bitter (but caffeine-laden) yerba mate of the Rio de la Plata basin, and relatively light colored.  It does pack a kick, though, and after a couple of mugs of tea I'm definitely wide awake!  Don't take this before bedtime!  It's definitely something to wake you up, not put you to sleep!<br /><br />The tea is not habit forming.  Andean Indians have used it (or chewed coca leaves) for energy and to stave off hunger from time immemorial.  You might find that as well as waking you up it suppresses your appetite somewhat, so this could be useful for dieters.  A welcome addition to Amazon's offerings and a way to help Andean Indians who grow coca legally to find a legal market for their product.

review/summary: Great refresher
review/text: I did some research on coca tea before I ordered this. I am a severe asthmatic and I get extremely fatigued. Coca tea is supposed to help blood oxygen absorption at high altitudes, so I figured it would also work at low altitudes. I brewed a pot with two tea bags and found that it was good for four cups (I put the rest in the fridge). Within twenty minutes I felt the energizing effect, and it tapered off somewhat over the hours, but helped me keep a nice energy level going for most of the day, and I drank less coffee. I slept like a baby at night.<br />The tea is the real deal and is of high quality.

review/summary: safety instructions
review/text: All NovoAndina Products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />NovoAndina products do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All our Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store NovoAndina products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Our teas are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.

review/summary: Coca Tea Delivers
review/text: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MVGVY6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img<br /><br />I have been in Utah over 25 years, at an altitude of about 4200 feet. My internist says that's not too high, but from all I can learn from family history, history, protohistory, and prehistory, my ancestors for at least 10,000 years have lived at or near sea level. My oxygen levels tend to get very low when the atmospheric pressure drops or I am extra tired. Since I know that coca combats altitude sickness, I decided to try it. Instead of spending the day in bed with an oxygen hose stuck up my nose to combat an O2 level of about 69, I am able to work all day with an oxygen level about 98. I dislike paying $[...] for coca tea, but I am paying $300 a month for my oxygen machine. I'll take the tea, thank you. My internist throws a tantrum about it, but my pulmonologist says that in his experience, a person with my background is unable to adjust to the altitude and it might take four generations before her descendants can do so. Since I was past child-bearing age when I moved here . . . . well, my coca tea is steeping, so I'd better go and drink it. I have a lot of work to do today.

I really did miss it and the energy and good feelings I get from drinking this tea. It is a pleasure to drink, I love the flavor also. It would be good to drink even without the benefits but in my case the benefits are numerous and I wouldnt and dont have a problem recomending this to friends or the curious.<br /><br /> Vendor=fast shipping, makes the difference for me and decent prices that I see went up everywhere.<br /><br />  The coca Tea will speak for itself.

review/text: Admittedly I, like another customer, misread the product. I was looking for cocoa.<br /><br />But my low rating does come from this product itself. I was weary about trying it, once I received it and saw what it was because I have always had a sensitivity to caffeine. So I made sure I tried this on a day when I was seriously dragging a**. Nada. No response. I tried it again when I wasn't as tired. Same. And then again on a morning where I was good to go. Still didn't see any effects.<br /><br />Maybe my box was exposed to elements and lost its ZING, I don't know. But it was basically flavored water for $25.00/box.<br /><br />Upside, it did have good flavor all on its own.

review/summary: WARNING***COCA LEAF TEA WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***
review/text: My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as "illegal" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that "coca leaf" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  [...]<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA OR ANY COCA LEAF TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK. EVEN IF IT SAYS IT'S "DE-COCANIZED" OR "DECAFINATED LIKE COFFEE"....DO NOT TRUST IT, DO NOT LOOSE YOUR JOB OVER TEA!.  The US requires 300 nanograms or more to be considered positive, well, with his 2 cups of coca tea his drug screen reading was 783 nanograms! I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court on the results of his drug test reguardless of some tea he drank.<br /><br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com.

review/summary: This is my Phat Boy's FAVORITE flavor of Whiskas
review/text: My precious young cat "Phat Boy Cuddlecuss" is a VERY picky eater and he has a very sensitive stomach which he takes medication for. He won't eat Science Diet, Blue, Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and just about any other expensive canned cat food there is. My vet even prescribed Science Diet ID for Sensitive Gastrointestinal and he ate that for about a week and then he'd never touch it again.<br /><br />As soon as I pull these Whiska's open he comes running. So far he likes all the flavors he's tried so far- Filet Mignon, Rostisserie Chicken (his favorite!), Tender Turkey and the 2 Tuna varieties. When you open these they have a lot of meat juices which looks just like meat juices that you'd have from cooking a steak and letting it rest correctly (au jus). It doesn't seem to dry out like other canned cat foods if you have some leftover.<br /><br />Usually, you can find these at Wal-Mart for .54 and other stores at .69 each. Whiska's usually has some great coupons for B1G1 if you go to their website. So, unless you just want the ease of having them delivered, you can find a better deal for these than they are listed here.<br /><br />Overall, these are great cat food for my picky eater with a sensitive stomach. For my 5 cats one of these split up lasts only through one feeding, but, I like knowing that they are always fresh. I'd recommend as this is the ONLY canned food that my Phat Boy Cuddlecuss will eat.

review/text: The cats eat it.  After that, what I like best is the container, it is a plastic/metal tub with foil lid.  This means rather than a can opener or a loud opening tab lid on a can, this is quiet to open.  I can easily feed one or two cats without everyone running because they hear food.  This is important if you are giving medicine or special feedings.<br /><br />It is a nice pate texture with juice/gel around the outside. The texture and juice/gel is always consistent, not dry one time and liquid the next, always the same firm yet moist pate with the juice/gel around the outside. (juice/gel is just that, mostly juice but a bit of the gel like you see with meat).<br /><br />My cats like all the flavors.

review/summary: quieter than a can
review/text: If you are reading this chances are you have a cat, so you know, I can't tell you if you're cat will eat this or not, but, all 7 of mine like all the Whiskas in a tub.  With 7 cats, what I like best about this is I can open it without any cat hearing it. That means if 1 or 2 missed the main meal, or need special feedings (like medication added) I can do it quietly without the whole crew running in demanding their fair share.  I feed the Whiskas about 1/4 of the time.  They all have their favorites, but I feed can food most of the time due to the cost.  Whiskas is priced well in line with other foods of that size, but again with 7 cats, I need a larger size.  But all my cats like all the Whiskas line of foods, their dry, the pouch, esp the purrfectly tuna and all the tub food.<br /><br />It is a nice pate texture with juice/gel around the outside.  The texture and juice/gel is always consistent, not dry one time and liquid the next, always the same firm yet moist pate with the juice/gel around the outside.

review/summary: Highly recommend
review/text: I would highly recommend Ultra Pet Tracks-Less Litter Pearls.  I switched to them after my very picky cats' favorite litter crystals were discontinued. It has been my experience that Ultra Pet Pearls are long-lasting and absorb liquid and smell better than any other brand I've previously purchased.  They also last at least one month with two adult cats, if you scoop out waste daily.  And...there is very little tracking, which is a huge plus!  Love this product and have used it for several months now.

review/text: I used two varieties of this kitty litter because I liked the idea of being able to go two months between total litter changes.  I cleaned out the litter box daily, but by the end of the first four weeks, the litter was urine-saturated and I could not stand it any more.  The whole area reeked.  I went back out and bought the cheap clay litter.  Now I really don't know what to try.  I was extremely disappointed.

review/summary: Not for use with ScoopFree litter boxes
review/text: I purchased this because I use the "Forever Litter Tray", and I was desperate for litter but "Just the Crystals" was not available at Amazon. I had hoped that this product would be a comparable alternative but unfortunately, I found that it is NOT!<br /><br />Personally, I own the ScoopFree litter box so that I have to deal with the litter box and kitty poop less, but after I began using this litter I noticed that the litter box required my attention on a daily basis!  My main complaint is that the crystals are way too large (about 3 times too large) for the ScooopFree sifter and a majority of the litter ends up under the lid that hides the poop, rendering it useless and unused. Despite daily maintenance, my home stunk, a lot of unused litter was wasted, and the litter box required a complete cleaning due to pee being stuck to the bottom of it.<br /><br />I am not the only one who hated this litter...  My cat hated the stuff!  She, who is Siamese and characteristically vocal to begin with, complained more than normal (giving me a headache), and even refused to use the litter box at times.  She resorted to peeing next to the litter box and even used an empty card board box, which she had previously enjoyed napping in.<br /><br />This crystal litter may work for a traditional litter box as an alternative to traditional clay litter or clumping litter, but I don't know - so this is the only reason that I didn't give it a one star rating. As for its use with the ScoopFree litter box, I don't recommend it!

review/summary: Tea Roulette:  The Inconsistent Oddity
review/text: I have purchased this tea twice locally:  once in a box, once in a tin.  Shouldn't make a difference, right?<br /><br />The stuff in the box sent me over the moon.  I sang the tea's praises.  I was nice to everyone all day, every day, until the tea ran out.  It was a little slice of heaven.  I love mild green teas with full flavor but no bitterness, and that's what this was:  only with that special bergamot gift to my mouth.  Think angelic choir singing.  I had a new favorite tea!<br /><br />Also, miraculously, this tea did not make me vibrate.  In theory it's fully caffeinated, but I drank as much as I wanted without a single negative consequence, so I'm guessing this has less caffeine than most green teas.<br /><br />My SO was headed to the local bed/bath chain where I bought the box, so I begged him to pick up another.  He priced them out and got me a couple of tins instead.  100 tea bags of bliss!  Or so I thought.<br /><br />It still doesn't make me vibrate, but this batch has a lighter bergamot flavor and goes bitter very, very quickly.  It can taste like bitter soap with a &lt;1 minute steep.  I have taken to quick-steeping 3-4 bags at once to try to approximate the magic of my first box.  It's still decent and I still drink it, but it's only dimly reminiscent of that first glorious box I had of the stuff.  Perhaps the first box was simply a miracle.  Maybe the tin was a mistake.  I won't know until I buy yet another box, at which point I'll let you know.

review/summary: Great Baby Food
review/text: I love the Plum Organics line as a whole, and the prunes are no exception.  While we make most of our own food for our daughter, it's of course more convenient to have prepackaged options.  I am very  happy that this is exactly what it says: just prunes.  The packaging is great: super portable, doesn't take up a lot of room, and it creates less waste than other types.  My daughter loves the food itself, and I like that I would use it as soon as she started solids (it's very smooth & liquidy) and keep on going with it (I now just mix it with her cereal to thicken it up).  The prices on Amazon are good, too.  It's the only line of store-bought baby food we'll use, and I recommend it w/o reservation... even to those who would prefer not to use pre-packed foods.

There isn't much texture to it, so I add it to cereal and other things for my almost 8 month old son.  If you are just starting feeding, this would be a great one to try, but it's great as a mixer for older eaters, as well.

So, after intensive research and tasting many, many prepared prune juice... We have a winner! The ingredients: Organic Prunes. That's all! It's so easy feeding him! He looks forward these now and everyone is happy again.

review/summary: Baby Prunes YUM!
review/text: When my son has been eating solid foods since about 3 1/2 months old. He was a LARGE newborn weighing in at 10 lbs 14.4 oz at birth. I exclusively breast feed him for the first 3 1/2 months, then he started getting fussy every time we would eat so with the doctors permission, we started feeding him by spoon baby cereal. By 4 months I was instructed by the doctor that it was okay to start feeding him fruits and veggies in moderation. I make all of his baby food with the Beabe Cook baby food maker organically and A LOT cheaper than buying the jars. He is still a HUGE baby, however, NOT fat he is in the 100th percentile in all areas of growth such as height and weight. When he turned about 5 1/2 months, his pooping became irregular, so I started feeding him Plum Organics Baby Prunes as I have NO idea how I would even begin to make prunes pureed enough for a 6 month old to eat. They are VERY runny, and somewhat difficult for him to keep in his mouth as it is like trying to feed a baby liquid soup with a spoon...NOT easy. To solve this problem, I thickened it with a little baby cereal, and walla they are perfect, and he absolutely LOVES them! Also, glad to say his pooping has gone to a normal state. I only feed him 1/2 the tube as I don't want to give him diarrhea, he gets 1/2 a tube of prunes and then some other fruit for breakfast. Than he has a green veggie and an orange veggie for lunch, and breast milk the rest of the day, and night.

review/summary: Great Ramen Noodles
review/text: I'm Asian-American, particularly Thai-American, and I've eaten Sapporo Ichiban ramen noodles for as long as I can remember, ever since I was a little girl. Yes, my family has been loyal to this brand for that long. I've tried many brands of ramen noodles in my lifetime, but the taste of the other ramen noodle brands is bland compared to Sapporo Ichiban. I'm very glad that Amazon sells Sapporo Ichiban products. It beats my family having to drive to an international food store, like we have always done, to get this product. Yes, this product is made in the U.S., but they're Japanese-styled. (By the way, my thoughts and prayers are with the Japanese people who are currently dealing with the earthquake and tsunami disaster mess in their nation.) I've read all the reviews on this page, and some people have complained about the taste. Each person is different, and personally for me, I think that Sapporo Ichiban tastes better than the other instant ramen brands out there. Plus, what can you really demand when it's instant ramen noodles, the keyword being "instant"? If you truly want an excellent noodle experience, go to Japan and Thailand and order noodle soup dishes at their noodle shops. I've traveled to quite a few Asian countries in my lifetime, and nothing beats eating noodles in Thailand and Japan and listening to customers slurp away and enjoying their noodle experience. But since we can't fly away to Thailand and Japan each time we want to, we really can't demand or expect that much from "instant" ramen noodles. My family eats the chicken and beef-flavored Sapporo Ichiban. We have also tried the shrimp-flavored and original style as well. My favorite is the chicken-flavored. But if you don't like the chicken-flavored, there are the other flavors mentioned. Plus, I like the fact that these Sapporo Ichiban ramen noodles only consist of noodles and a soup flavored base. There are no additional toppings. So, my family and I can add our own ingredients such as vegetables, meat, eggs, cheese, etc. Another good thing about the Sapporo Ichiban brand is that you get a lot of noodles for the amount you pay. One individual package fills up a big bowl. You get more noodles from Sapporo Ichiban compared to a lot of other brands. I think that Amazon is offering a reasonable price for this 24 pack of Sapporo Ichiban ramen noodles.

review/text: It's not only my kids' favorite, the entire family loves it.  We much prefer the Sapporo Ichiban brand ramen to the less expensive kinds.  The kids love the chicken flavor, while the other half prefers the original.  Just a really good quality, good tasting ramen.

review/summary: Stick with Original Flavor.
review/text: I went on a limb and tried the Beef and Chicken flavors, boy what a mistake. I was introduced to the original flavor by my Korean GF and was amazed at how much better the quality was over any other ramen I had prior.<br />The discount at Amazon was such I decided to purchase the other two flavors above. The noodles are still great quality but the flavoring is horrid. I've since given the entire boxes to a friend that will eat anything. Even he commented the flavor wasn't great.<br />Stick with the original and you'll be much better off. At least that is my opinion.

review/summary: Stale and annoyingly salty
review/text: These noodles took a long time to arrive, and I was surprised to discover that they were made in the USA.  My surprise because they tasted awfully stale to the max and the flavor packet was pure salt no flavor what so ever.  The stale taste stays in your mouth for the rest of the day as well.  The packages did have an expiration date printed on them of June 12, 2009.  I was very disappointed - I cannot really see myself purchasing these again

I personally think this is even saltier.Not sure if it is good enough for the price though.

review/summary: Tastes great for what it is
review/text: I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make. A teaspoon of real vanilla or almond extract improves the flavor.  I like to make the chocolate cake with iced coffee.  Then rather than use sugar free frosting (ugggh!) I sprinkle the top with either unsweetened cocoa or with chopped coffee beans.  The bitterness of the cocoa and the coffee beans enhances the sweetness of the cake. These mixes make a very thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.

review/summary: SURPRISING!
review/text: To be perfectly honest, I expected so much less from this product. I am not building this up onto a high pedestal to the point where I'm saying that it  is the most amazing cake that I've ever had and even regular cakes don't add up to this one, I'm simply saying that my expectations for sugar free products are terrible. My father is a diabetic, so almost everything in the house is sugar free or diet or in my opinion disgusting. I received this cake mix today and my father has so much of a sweet tooth, especially since he became a diabetic, he's had a craving for any and everything sweet. So as soon as the box came, it was VERY light and I had ordered two things. My father thought that it may have been another order for something else I'd placed. I placed the order on Friday night, it is now Monday night and I didn't pay for 2 day shipping nor did I request it using Amazon Prime, these people just shipped it SO FAST. I was particularly impressed with the shipping in this product because I placed an order for something else on Wednesday, then I placed the order for this on Friday and this came BEFORE the order I placed first. My order was scheduled to arrive by Feb. 2nd and it's January 30th and it's here already.<br /><br />Enough about the shipping, the product itself was surprising in several ways. For starters the box is a teeny tiny box that is about 1/3 the size of a regular cake mix box. I could be wrong it could be bigger, but it is definitely a little box. Being that it is sugar free and I'm expecting it to do something regular cake mix doesn't do, (which would be providing a healthy sugar free snack), I don't really mind paying the same price for less of a product, but maybe some one else might. It's very simple to make with out without a cake mixer, I honestly don't have one and I have to beat all my cakes by hand. So the fact that all I had to do was add water and I got a cake mix was pretty convenient to me.<br /><br />The product itself, before mixed or baked, it's very powdery. Surprisingly very powdery to the point where, while I was adding the water which is only 3/4 of a cup, I was very hesitant to add it because I felt like the water would dissolve the flour or powder or w.e. that was. To me the mix looked a lot like Nestle's Unsweetened Cocoa Powder, It felt like it too.<br /><br />Once mixed the product, does NOT taste sugar free. The cake mix, and I know it's weird and some people like to eat cake mix , and so do I, but the cake mix was delicious. It tasted almost like chocolate pudding, what ever it tasted like, I liked it, I actually liked THAT better than the actual cake.<br /><br />When I was purchasing the cake, of course I did a lot of research on the cake, the brand, the sugar content, nutritional facts,etc. I also looked up other flavors. Now personally I've found that chocolate sugar free products almost always taste better than sugar free vanilla or white products that don't contain cocoa or chocolate and I read some where on Amazon that the yellow cake mix tastes like cardboard. I was expecting a cardboard taste from this as well, however I was disappointed because it didn't taste like cardboard, it tasted more like cocoa/coffee that was turned into a cake. I also purchased the icing for the cake, I purchase chocolate. And let me tell you, the cake isn't all that by it self, the icing has a bit of an after taste by itself, but when you put them together YOU WILL NOT MISS A THING.! I guarantee it. Personally, after giving you this long detailed review lol, I have to say I was satisfied, AND I will ABSOLUTELY order from this manufacturer again. 5 STARS!

With vegetable dishes, the vegetable stock adds a nice element to the cooking. With crockpot dishes, the appropriate stock is a standard addition that I make (chicken stock for a chicken dish, beef stock for a beef dish or vegetable stock for a vegetarian dish).<br /><br />Other pluses for this stock--low sodium, no MSG, no fat, and it is gluten-free. Healthy and tasty at the same time! A daily double in the kitchen. . . .

review/text: I was looking to buy this stock in bulk to save money.  As the previous poster noted, it's great for using in recipes.  Using it my broccoli soup instead of chicken stock takes the faintly gamy flavor out and makes it pleasanter.<br /><br />But as of this writing, Kitchen Basics wants $4.85 per item for this 12-pack.  That's insane.  At my local grocery, which is not exactly cheap, these containers of stock are around $2.  Just wanted to make shoppers aware not to fall for the idea that you'll be saving money by purchasing it here in bulk.

review/summary: Great Taste From Simple Ingredients
review/text: Kashi Organic Promise Cinnamon Harvest is a great example of how simple ingredients can deliver great taste.  It has three basic organic ingredients:  wheat, evaporated cane juice, and cinnamon.  I am impressed by the amount of flavor that this cereal has.  It is not a knock you over the head in your face and overly powerful experience.  However if you are looking at a cereal like this, you likely have different priorities to begin with.<br /><br />Cinnamon Harvest is a fairly dense cereal with a one cup serving coming in at 190 calories - more than 50% more than a lighter cereal such as Kashi Organic Promise Strawberry Fields.  On the flip side, I find a serving of Cinnamon Harvest stays with me longer than Strawberry Fields does.  It really depends on what you are looking for, and the tastes between the two are completely different as well.<br /><br />Like most "wheat biscuit" type cereals Cinnamon Harvest holds up well in milk although I have found this to be true of most Kashi cereals.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a wheat cereal with great taste and natural ingredients, you should give Kashi Organic Promise Cinnamon Harvest a try.

review/text: Being a bit of a fitness-nut, I'm reluctant to purchase almost any mass produced cereals.  With very few exceptions, there's an over abundance of sugar, sodium and in some cases, fats, in a majority of breakfast cereals. Although Kashi's Cinnamon Harvest does have a dose of sugar at 9 grams/serving, for me, it's an acceptable amount.  Whole grain, great taste and good for ya too... it's a deal.

I was buying this product from the local discount store, but Amazon had it on their "Subscribe and Save" program and it actually came out less expensive.  It is also much fresher this way...don't know how long those boxes were sitting in the store, but these have a much crunchier crunch.  Another reviewer remarked that you need to ask for extra padding to keep it from getting smashed, but I didn't and mine wasn't(not anymore so than that in the store).  When I get to that part, I just throw in some raisins and almond milk and have it for breakfast. YUM!!

review/summary: My favorite cereal from Kashi
review/text: I eat a lot of cereal made by Kashi but this is by far my favorite.  In general, I do not like shredded wheat products.  The texture, to me, is gritty and dry.  Once soaked in milk, the regular shredded wheat pillows turn to a mush and are not pleasing.  However, I decided to try Kashi's Cinnamon Harvest mostly because of what I saw on the nutrition label.  Imagine my surprise when I bit into a crunch pillow of shredded wheat that encircles a slightly sweet cinnamon center.  Delicious.  For me, they generally don't have time to turn to mush in my bowl because I eat them too fast.  They have a good level of protein, are a great source of fiber and are not too high in sugar.  I really recommend them to everyone I know who is looking for a great tasting high fiber cereal.

I LOVE Kashi. never truly disappointed by them. This cereal is has a light cinnamon-sugar taste and very hearty and filling. It's like unfrosted mini wheats, with a little sweetness that isn't overpowering. Good for snacks to put in a trail mix, eat plain or for breakfast with some almond milk. The best thing is that it's made of only 4 ingredients. all organic. I just wish it had more protein and a lower carb count, but hey, it's wheat.

What I really like on the Kashi Cinnamon Harvest is the cinnamon!  I also noticed that the cinnamon is easier to taste if it doesn't sit in the milk too long (otherwise I guess it mixes in with the milk and the taste isn't as strong).  This is also an organic cereal, so it doesn't have a bunch of vitamins and minerals added in like other popular cereals (this doesn't bother me though).  I am satisfied with this cereal and will continue to purchase it!

review/text: This cereal is the best out there and healthier than most also.  The cinnamon taste is great and when it's on sale at Amazon the price is better than any local grocery stores.

review/summary: love it!
review/text: I eat several Kashi foods and I love this one.  It has got to be hands down one of my favorites!  The cinnamon taste isn't overbearing like in kids cereals, and the past several months I've even swithced my kids over to Kashi.  Even though they won't admit that they like it, my cereal is always gone within a day or two, so I know they are sharing my cereal.  What I like about Kashi is that it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup, it is organic and all natural, it really tastes good and not artificial like so many other food products.

review/text: This cereal was good but it is inconsistant with the sweetener and cinnamon flavoring. Seems every box varies in taste.

review/summary: Kashi - Cinnamon Harvest
review/text: Great cereal but the biscuits in some boxes get really shredded so you're left with the loose stuff at the bottom (which I don't like as much).  The Amazon subscribe-and-save makes it much cheaper and more convenient than buying from my local supermarket.

review/summary: Organic or Not?
review/text: Since the "voluntary recall" of the KASHI peanut butter bars and cereals, as a result of the Health Department issues in the news with a Georgia based producer (rancid old stuff, general issues with product quality etc.)  I have been left wondering:  If KASHI is as organic and picky about ingredients as they claim, how did they end up in the supply chain for the bad company?  I ended up throwing out about $25 worth of products and since the recall was "voluntary" did not receive store credit at AMAZON fore the purchases.  Anyway- assume they buy from the same sources as everyone else and ask yourself why you are buying the marketing spin and paying premiums for any of the products touted to be "organic.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHP62G">Kashi GOLEAN Protein & Fiber Bars Crunchy, Chocolate Peanut, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)</a>"  Also<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJK5W">Kashi GOLEAN Bar, Peanut Butter & Chocolate, 2.75-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: bait & switch
review/text: Was turned on to Kashi cereal by my daughter about two years ago.  I usually buy it from my local WalMart but on one occasion ordered from Amazon when local supply dried up.  As for quality of the product, no problem, it taste great.  The problem I have is with quantity.  The latest box on store shelves as well as on Amazon is 16.3 oz.  It replaces the 17.5 oz. box that until recently was available.  Thus the old bait and switch.  I've noticed a trend in the marketing of consumer goods in the last couple of years of less and less for more and more.  Whether it be the new 30 oz. quarts of mayo or the new and improved "smaller" sheets of toilet tissue and on and on and on.  Everything gets smaller but the price!

review/summary: Cinnamon & More?
review/text: There is no question that when it has came down to Kashi, they have made some very clever organic foods and whole grain cereals. But every so often, when a company does go organic, it doesn't mean they have a product that will taste as good. That is proof of the pudding with their Kashi Cinnamon Harvest cereal. While it is a good concept, my basic gripe about it is the fact that there could've beena  bit more cinnamon and sugar in the cereal. It would've been a lot tastier to stand up to those other cereals from Kellog's and General Mills to name a few. Still if you're a health nut whom likes organic cereals, than give Kashi's Cinnamon Harvest cereal a try.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: C+<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: Great product, shrinkwrap warps / damages cartons
review/text: I got this order today and while I love the cereal, the four boxes were shrinkwrapped together so tightly that not one box can actually stand upright on its own.  They are all dented, warped or damage from overzealous wrapping together.  When the 6 box was on subscription, it was just in the box loose, and one box did get damaged, but not all of them....

review/summary: Its The Best Quality So Far
review/text: I have been using Spectrums brand for a year now. I use it for hair, cooking, oil pulling, as a body moisturizer, and as a air fresher in my oil burner. Recently I made the mistake of trying other brands. I will never do that again. I'm from the islands so I know the true quality of unrefined coconut oil. I promise Spectrums Unrefined coconut oil is honestly the best quality, texture, and organic scent. I will never venture out again.

review/summary: A satisfying and refreshing treat!
review/text: Smooze fruit ice is perfect for the hot summer weather. The little pouches are surprisingly satisfying! I recently saw them at my local Whole Foods market and decided to give this flavor, coconut & pink guava, a try. It is delicious! There are ten pouches in each box, a lot more servings than many healthy frozen desserts give you (which is usually like 4). I'm ready to order these guys in bulk from Amazon and give the other flavors a go.

review/summary: I love these little things!
review/text: I recently bought these from Uwajimaya, a store in the International District of Seattle for 1.99. I love trying new things from there, so I bought them and I am in love with them! I can't wait to try the other flavours. I'm so glad that they're good for you. They're filling too, I don't feel like I have to eat 5 to get my sugar fix. I'm glad Amazon sells them if I can't get out to Seattle! Remember to shake them before freezing, cos they can separate.

review/summary: Contains "Natural Fruit Flavors", which means? UPDATED
review/text: I was going to buy, then checked the ingredients at their website. Natural Fruit Flavors is one of the ingredients, unfortunately. Google "natural flavors msg" , and wonder if the flavoring they add is high in free glutamic acid. Maybe, maybe not, who knows? I won't buy Smooze unless they remove this. I'll give a neutral 3 star rating and change if I hear back from the company.<br /><br />Here's the email I received: Hi,<br /><br />Sorry for the delay to response because we are waiting answer from the maker.<br /><br />They contain the natural fruit itself and traces of vanilla, carrot and cinnamon.<br /><br />Thanks<br />JC<br />SMOOZEUSA<br /><br />So I'll add a star, and order some!

review/summary: Summer Sweetness
review/text: My kids (7 and 5) are finishing one of these things right now and slurping up every last drop.  Love that they are not as bad for them as those awful traditional popsicles which contain about every no-no going for those of us trying to keep our kids away from the fake stuff as much as possible.  My kids aren't super picky, but you never know what's going to be a hit when you try something new like this.  After one taste (the cute package sold them before the first bite, so kudos on the design) they both declared they LOVE it!  I remember loving guava juice, so I took a nibble from one and it was refreshing and sweeter than I expected.  Lots of them in the package so you really get your $'s worth.  Good for all ages, even adults.  And I suspect if I whipped up some summer cocktails with this for adults they'd RAVE.

review/summary: Love 'em Anchovies
review/text: I love my pizzas with anchovies.  These Crown Prince anchovies sure are salty but definitely tasty.  The cans don't need opener as they have the latch/pop release.  The quality of the fish is consistent and tender--excellent in my book.
