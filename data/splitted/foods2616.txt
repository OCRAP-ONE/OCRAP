review/summary: Prefer the regular containers but they aren't on sale any more
review/text: I would give 5 stars for the flavor,  I really do like this blend,  but wish they would just package it the way they used to instead of making me pay extra for something I actually don't want.<br /><br />I know that fewer and fewer people like this particular blend of nescafe,  because it's getting harder and harder to find.  I used to buy the regular containers in my supermarket,  but then they stopped stocking it.  Thank heavens for amazon, I thought,  and ordered it here.  But now they no longer stock the regular containers,  you can only get these prepackaged lots.  It's unfortunate,  because I like a heaped teaspoon of coffee but these packets only measure out to a regular teaspoon.  So essentially I want one and a half packets.  Which is just all wrong.  But I do love the flavor,  so I'm trying these packets and hope it works out.  Or better yet,  that they restock the original containers.  Nothing wrong with them!

review/summary: Carry a Little Stick
review/text: Having tried all of the Taster's Choice single pack offerings, I would say that the Hazelnut is my favorite because I've always like hazelnut flavored coffees. I also like the VANILLA STICKS but don't find the flavor as intense as the hazelnut's. A flavored, brewed coffee has a more intense and better flavor and has a more effective caffeine jolt, but the Taster's Choice instant is good in its own right.<br />One problem with these coffee packets is that adding too much water can dillute  the taste enough to produce a bland tasting hot beverage. Were I to drink these as my morning coffee, I'd need to make at least three cups to get me going.<br /><br />Mostly I drink these as an after nap cup of coffee at home or as a pick me up cup of coffee at work. It's just far too inconveniet to brew a single cup of coffee at work and have to fool with the cleanup. Heating a cup of water in the microwave only takes two minutes or less. Occasionally I'll make instant coffee on Saturday, the one day of the week I work in the A.M.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I don't care for all the wasteful,extra packaging, and tearing open a single packet envelope while half awake in an unwelcome introduction to the day. Sometimes it's easier just to cut it open with scissors.<br /><br />2. I also am not crazy about the small serving size of individual cups. A jar of coffee would be much preferable, but for whatever reasons Nescafe has chosen to go the single serving route.<br /><br />Finally: I like Nescafe Taster's Choice Vanilla instant coffee and enjoy it as an occasional treat. You might also enjoy it if you don't mind instant coffee.

review/summary: Bring back the 6oz containers!!
review/text: I'm with the other reviewer who bought the regular container from their supermarket, then bought it from Amazon, and is now reduced to buying these micro packets of this flavor.  I also have to use 1 1/2 of these to make a 'good' cup of coffee.  This is the only flavor and 'kind' of coffee I like and now I'm having to pay extra for these micro packets!!<br /><br />I still have one "old" container and I have to take time to open and dump all these little packets into it to make these little things even somewhat convenient.<br />I'd rate this 5 stars if it was put back into it's old container!!

review/summary: More expensive than before, but 40 cents per cup (2 packets) is still cheaper than Starbucks
review/text: Really wish it was still available in the canister, I've been drinking this 20 years or so.<br /><br />I just open the packets from four boxes (80 packets, I hold 3 packets and cut them at one time), which just about exactly fills up an old canister.<br /><br />The price is higher than before, at $32 for this item each packet costs 20 cents.<br /><br />This 8 x 20 pack has about as much coffee as two of the old large container, which used to cost about $8 each.<br /><br />(Each packet is .07 ounces, 20 in a box makes 1.4 ounces per box, Amazon sells 8 boxes together, which is 11.2 ounces. The old canisters were 6 ounces, so this 8x20 pack from Amazon is about the size of two of the old canisters.)

review/summary: I want the cannister back!
review/text: I have been drinking Taster's Choice for years. I remember when it was packaged in a smaller glass canister and a level teaspoon was all that was required!  Then they switched to the larger canister and watered it down to where you needed a heaping teaspoon to make a decent cup of coffee. Now the ultimate insult - these little packages!  The coffee is still delicious. But it is very hard to find in the supermarkets and is way too expensive. Too bad Nescafe found a way to take a wonderful product and ruin it!  The taste gets 5 stars. The packaging and marketing gets 0 stars!

review/summary: Sticks too expensive
review/text: Besides my morning espresso coffees to wake up promptly, I always loved the Vanilla Instant Coffee in the afternoon. Unfortunately - like other reviewers mentioned - this taste doesn't come in the old containers any longer. It is much too expensive to use 2-3 sticks for one cup with full flavor.<br />Perhaps Nescafe will think that over - IF THEY READ OUR REVIEWS ???<br /><br />PS: At Walmart and Publix a single pack of 20 is cheaper than at Amazon. I'm just saying...

review/summary: Great vanilla taste, not-so-great packaging
review/text: Taste: The scent of this gourmet instant coffee is rich and inviting. You can definitely taste the vanilla. If you add an appropriate amount of water, the coffee tastes great for being instant. Otherwise, you are most likely to end up with a weak brew.<br /><br />Packaging: Not quite easy to open. I had to use teeth to make a dent in the stick. The single-serving size may not generate enough coffee for most coffee drinkers. There is a good chance of over-diluting. This is what happened to me first time I used it, compromising the taste. If you would like to drink more than 6oz of coffee, you will have to use 2-3 sticks. As a previous reviewer pointed out, this may be a quick pick-me-up shot in the afternoon.

review/text: I have enjoyed this vanilla coffee taste for years but the new packets are inconvenient and not in the right portions. This annoyance could be overlooked if it didn't also cost almost twice as much. Used to pay about $1.37 per ounce in the old canisters and now it costs $2.55 per ounce for the same coffee.

review/summary: Fine, for instant coffee
review/text: To give some background, I'm an espresso geek.  I like my coffee bold, and strong, so trying to drink normal coffee (especially of the instant variety) is like giving a whiskey junkie a glass of Kahlua and milk.  So with that in mind, take note that my definition of "weak" may be very different from yours.  Anyway, let me start with my review.  Taster's Choice is meant to be made in 6oz portions.  I filled my standard sized 12oz (The Who!) coffee mug around 3/4 to the brim, so I may have over filled it a bit. (READ UPDATE BELOW)  That being said, Taster's Choice would only provide you a half-full mug of coffee if you followed their instructions properly.  The coffee tasted similar to what you would find at a cheap gas station.  It can only be described as similar to Crystal Light packets, in that your water doesn't exactly taste like Gatorade, but it surely doesn't taste like water either.  I tried adding a few tablespoons of flavored coffee creamer to see if it improved the taste, and it did in a big way.  The flavor was then similar to what you would receive out of those automated "cappuccino machines" that you would find in gas stations and breakrooms. (You know, the ones that tell you to only fill up the cup 3/4 of the way because the machine keeps flowing coffee even after you let go of the button?)  If you have ever tasted the "cappuccino" out of those machines, you'd know that it isn't anything like cappuccino, but it doesn't taste horrible.  It's drinkable, and has a sweet kick to it.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I'm sure that using two packets would improve the flavor of a 3/4 full mug greatly, so I'm probably going to try that next time around and update my review. (READ UPDATE BELOW) I'm sure that some people would find this useful as a "fast food coffee".  It's not great, but it's not bad either, and it provides a little jolt for someone who doesn't have the time to brew a whole pot.<br /><br />*UPDATE*:  I have now tried it with two packets in 8 ounces of water, and it is MUCH better.  It now tastes like quite a bold flavorful coffee.  Highly recommend that you use two packets for each cup.

review/text: I have enjoyed this product for decades even though it is now over-packaged and a little difficult to find. HBC sent it out immediately, but USPS sent it across the country a couple of times. Because of the delay I contacted UBC and had excellent service from them. The series of emails I exchanged with "Cheski" were outstanding. It was the kind of customer service that lives up to the title and makes it feel as if the customer and the company are on the same team. For some reason that connection went away and I am now in the land of "canned responses" and "patronizing platitudes". Too bad. This was a problem successfully resolved; only the depersonalization at the end marred it. Karen

review/text: This Tasters Choice instant vanilla-flavored coffee is truly vile! It tasted like a cross between nonfat dry milk and dishwater, with a faint essence of coconut. I detected neither the flavor of coffee nor vanilla. As for the four-star average rating, quite frankly, I'm completely stymied. We just decided to cut our losses and heave this stuff into the rubbish bin.

review/summary: Coffee Taster's #1 Choice
review/text: I have been drinking Taster's Choice instant flavored coffee for years.  I love mixing the hazelnut and vanilla together creating a fuller bodied gourmet coffee-like blend.  Initially, these products were available in large canisters.  Then about five years ago the canisters for the flavors were replaced by the single serving straws.  Over the last year trying to find these flavored coffee's in the markets has become futile, or when found, priced from $ 3.99-9.99/20 stick box with club card. ("seriously?...!,")<br /><br />Then I went on-line, did a product search for my desperately needed java and found this wonderful link.<br /><br />Today I am a very happy camper!  My coffee arrived a few days early.  It was packed lovingly in bubble wrap as if I had ordered fine crystal. The unit cost per box came in at approx $ 3.49-3.69 and I will be ordering more as soon as I finish writing this review.<br /><br />Thank you soooooo much!

review/summary: Good for instant, but you need 2 sticks for a normal cup
review/text: Like others have mentioned, one stick is usually not enough to make this instant coffee taste like a cup of vanilla coffee. If you use only one stick, it will taste like diluted vanilla water with almost no hint that you are drinking coffee. You'll need to use 2 sticks, but you are now paying in the range of what you would for a K-cup. So if you don't have or want a k-cup brewer but want a decent flavored instant coffee, this one is good but you'll need to use 2 sticks to enjoy it.<br /><br />It disappoints that tasters choice purposely makes you pay for all the extra package to get this coffee. A company has a right to make a profit off of the merchandise it sells, but if you are purposely being wasteful in attempting to acquire those profits, that's bad.

review/summary: Review of Tasters Choice Vanilla Instant Coffee
review/text: I didn't really like this coffee. I thought it would come with sugar added like those Maxwell House International Coffees, but it doesn't. This is a good thing if you like your coffee black or if you like to be able to control how much sugar you are adding. However, I don't drink coffee without sugar added and usually prefer to buy instant coffee that already has it added so that I don't have to do it myself. Also, I feel like the coffee has a strange smell that is kind of bitter and stale.

review/summary: BLECH! Tastes like vanilla water.
review/text: Okay, first off, I'm not, like most of the other reviewers, a regular user of this brand and flavor of coffee. I noticed most of the reviews discuss the packaging, because the reviewers apparently like this blend and have been using it for some time.<br /><br />In my case, I usually drink home brewed coffee. However, the recent hot weather in my part of the country has persuaded me to start drinking iced coffee in the morning, so I decided to switch to instant.<br /><br />All of this is to say that I have only tried this product cold. Maybe it's better hot. However, as a cold beverage, it leaves much to be desired. It really tastes like cold vanilla water. I couldn't detect any coffee flavor in it whatsoever. Zero, zip, nada. Even when I closed my eyes and wished for coffee. It just wasn't happening.<br /><br />I've been drinking the Starbuck's version for a couple of weeks, and I like it pretty well. It's expensive, but decent. I was really hoping to like this product, since it is considerably cheaper. Maybe I'll give the non-flavored Taster's Choice a shot, but for now I'll stick with the Starbuck's.

review/text: I never got the product.  They took the money out of my account two months ago, but I have never received the product.  It was much more expense then when you purchased it in the stores, but I was willing to pay the extra because I really liked the prioduct, but I would advise everyone that looks at this to not buy, because it is obviously a rip off.

review/text: I have been using NuNaturals Pure Stevia Extract for years and love it!!!!!!!!!  I use to use tons of fake sweeteners that are chemicals and always felt sick but kept using them because I love sweets but did not want to use sugar and have to shoot insulin.  With the stevia, it does not raise my blood sugar significantly and it tastes wonderful.  I do have to watch my blood sugar when I use it in coffee and tea but my body is very sensitive and I have to take insulin with almost anything.  The stevia makes it so I can enjoy my sweet coffee and tea.  I always buy the stevia without any added carriers and the 2.2lbs lasts for months even though I use a lot.

review/summary: Tastes Good and Can Easily Be Worked into a Decent Breakfast.
review/text: I originally found out about Nutella from an internet article about some clueless woman in California who filed a class action suit because she bought whole hog into the advertising. The suit settled in April 2012 and the firm dropped the health claims in their advertising.  Coming from the generation who was told in television advertising that menthol cigarettes were soothing for your throat, I am amazed at the naivete claimed by the public.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought that the idea of a hazelnut (cobnut) cocoa spread sounded delicious and tried it.  Now I always keep a jar around. It doesn't need refrigeration although if it gets too hot the oil might settle out. In that case just give it a good stir.<br /><br />The important thing to remember is that moderation should be observed.  I enjoy at times having a breakfast of multigrain sandwich thins(100 calories), toasted for crunch, with two teaspoons of Nutella (67 calories)-- not the two tablespoons mentioned as a serving on the jar, an ounce of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BR24US">Nantucket Blend trail mix</a>(160 calories) and six ounces of plain almond milk (60 calories). This easily holds me to lunchtime.  For fewer calories the trail mix can be replaced with fresh in season fruit. No doubts the ones among us who don't buy fruit then find it a week later decaying in the frig, will actually have some fresh fruit on hand.<br /><br />Tastes good and can easily be worked into a decent breakfast.

review/summary: Flat, Stale Tea
review/text: Having lived in Asia for years and being Asian-American and having been a tea drinker (green, white, oolong, black,pu-erh, you-name-it), I was very excited to try this sampler pack of premium teas.  However, when I received my order, I was disappointed in the freshness of the tea.  Great tea should be vibrant and have the aroma of a thousand years of tradition and pleasure.  This tea smelled flat and only had a faint fragrance...it smelled like grocery store chopped tea leaves in bags.<br /><br />The taste of the tea was also disappointing.  There was no rich flavor, even after the second brewing.  Letting it sit for 10 minutes in hot water was the only way to get any sort of tea flavor out of the leaves and the tea tasted flat and stale no matter how long it was brewed.<br /><br />My opinion is that the tea I got sat in a hot warehouse for a couple of years before it got to me and therefore had all the flavor and aroma cooked out of it.  I won't ever order Heavenly Tea again.

I was given this product as a gift and I only have 1 cup of this coffee per week to save it.  I have a Keurig that I brew this in and it works just fine in the reusable cups.

This ghee is tasty and has the added bonus of being an import of Canada so it is rBGH free as Canada bans the use of the growth hormone.

review/summary: Better than butter
review/text: People familiar with Indian cuisine already know ghee: it's like butter with all the junk that can burn taken out.  Use this in your pan instead of butter and you'll have the advantages of oil with the creamy richness of unsalted butter.  Besides Indian dishes, I use it to make excellent grilled cheese sandwiches with crispy golden exteriors.<br /><br />As ghee goes, this is a fine one.  If you prefer a ghee that has the runny golden oil component this may not be what you seek if the jar I got was representational.  What I got was mostly solids, which I am fine with, as I have no preference.  I have bought many makes of ghee over the years and this is very good.  I bought this ghee to bump an order total up to get free shipping, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />I can make no claims about the healthy qualities of ghee as opposed to butter - all I can tell you is that it is great for cooking and tastes terrific.

review/summary: Did I love the lobster or the ghee?
review/text: This is my first pre-made ghee purchase after reading about it. I got this brand because of the price and the size given. It's big enough you'll be able to do some cooking with it without using half the container. As soon as I got it I had to try it. My first impressions.. it's a pale opaque yellow color and there are solids in it while as a whole it's runny enough to go off a spoon. The taste brought me back to eating lobster. Rich, flavorful and it made me forget about the little lumps of the solids in it at room temperature. It was so good it made me wonder what was better the lobster or being able to dunk it in the fresh made ghee the restaurant served. I heated some up for just ten seconds or so and all the grittiness disappeared and it turns into a bright, clear yellow state and the strength of the flavor seems to mellow out. Regular butter is extremely bland compared to this delicious stuff. I need to try the other brands out there to see if they're able to blend the consistency better at room temperature.

review/summary: Very Handy
review/text: I used to do a lot of Indian cooking, and made my own ghee in those days.  I decided to try a pre-made one again for the convenience, and bought this.  It's not the best pre-made ghee I've ever had, but it was the least expensive option on amazon.com when I bought it, and it's perfectly fine for everyday use.  I mean, ghee is just clarified butter; it's hard to screw that up and make a really bad one!  In my opinion, this one has a particularly strong flavor, which is a plus since you need less of it, and that also makes it a good mixer for combining with other oils such as olive oil (half and half ghee and olive oil makes a good sauteing oil for vegetables).  Use a little of this and maybe some other oil to saute potatoes or a variety of things and get a great and different flavor.  You probably won't need to add any additional butter either.  Also, if you want to make your grains like rice extra-tasty, saute the dry, uncooked grains a bit first in ghee, before adding the water to finish cooking them.  It is worth trying that easy extra step!

Doesn't it fall under false advertising to order one product and receive another, especially when React 2 has its own product page?  I guess I won't order Wheat Thins on Amazon for fear of receiving Triscuits instead...<br /><br />What this isn't, yet what you will receive: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YZ4LN0">Wrigley's Gum 5 -  React Fruit 2, 1.76-Ounce Packages (Pack of 10)</a>

review/summary: THIS GUM IS AWSOME
review/text: I love React gum, its by far my favorite gum.  When it became impossible to find and you could only find React 2, I finally decided to go online and purchase a few bulk packages of it.  So what do I get?  REACT 2 of course.  I can deal with it, React 2 def isn't the best gum, but its tollerable.  The difference in flavor is immense.<br /><br />I want answers.  Why is this page is still up.  Is React 2 suppose to replace the original? If it is, why have both for sale and only sell one?  Who actually ships this thinking I won't care I get the wrong product?  This is terrible service.  I'm forward deployed right now in the Navy, it takes weeks for anything to ship to me.  Getting packages makes my day, not very many other things do around here.  Opening up my package like it's Xmas only to find it's the wrong gum, that sucks.  Also paying nearly double for APO/FPO shipping... *sigh*

review/text: Edited my review to reflect that this is a different prodct.<br /><br />5 React Gum is amazing, the best ever.<br /><br />However this is not that, this is React 2 gum which is awful. I ordered 2 boxes and got the wrong product but didn't notice until well after my return period had passed (I keep them in bulk since that had become hard to find). Take the original React gum, fruity, fantastic tasting and then put a big pile of really strong mint in it... Awful. Fruity + Mint doesn't work, at least not here. I hate every other 5 gum I've tried except the original 5 React so it's very disappointing they'd change it the way they did.

review/text: I love this gum.  I have lots of dental work, and this gum does not stick to it, plus it is sugar free to boot.  As to the previous review, I would suggest chewing half a stick at a time.  They are quite correct in that this gum will not lose it's flavor and can be a bit overwhelming after a LONG chew.  Half a stick will do it.  This gum tastes GOOD.

review/summary: For proper Thai / Lao sticky rice.
review/text: When I married a Thai in 1973 She brought this type of pot and five baskets to the states with her.  Neither of us expected to find these things in America but in those days we had to drive 100 miles to buy fish sauce.  Now Thai restaurants are everywhere, Thai food is in ordinary supermarkets and lots of people are learning to cook Thai.  Thais are learning to cook differently, too.  I've seen videos by Thais showing how to make sticky rice in the microwave or a rice steamer.  I've tried both, the microwave way several times, and the results were not like the sticky rice I have known for decades.  I bought myself a new pot and basket via Amazon and it works a charm.  I'm now again making sticky rice as it's supposed to be -- I am quite satisfied.  BTW I don't use any cloth.  The wife never did, I never saw such in Thailand when I was there and I'm doing fine without it.  Dropping the bottom of the basket into water to soak loosens any stuck rice but there's very little of that.  The wife brought five baskets because she knew they don't last like the pot.  Five was enough for years but they'd eventually come apart at the bottom.  I suppose a basket lasted us about a year or two.  We didn't eat sticky rice all the time.<br /><br />I consider this pot and basket to be required for proper Thai / Lao sticky rice.

review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher parve. Sunflowers are so beautiful. Sunflower seeds are a joy. German whole grain bread. Moist. Hearty. Flavorful. Great with soup, or a salad, for veggie sandwiches with dressing, or with your favorite jam or marmalade. Or just plain to enjoy the moist whole grain German flavor right from the vacuum sealed package. Slices can also be cut into squares for making your favorite appetizers. Made with whole kernal rye, wholemeal rye flour, sunflower seeds, salt, oat fiber, and yeast. Long shelf life. My order has 10 months left on the suggested use by date. Pre-sliced. 7 slices (the long way) per loaf. One long slice can be cut in half for two square pieces for one sandwich. 140 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber per slice. Great option for those who like German style bread but may not have an authentic local bakery. Product of Germany. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.

I'm especially impressed with this line of breads, and this variety in particular, because it is made with 100% rye flour and not wheat.  The added taste of sunflower seeds really makes it great.<br /><br />I toast it and often top it with avacado or spreadable cheese for a special treat.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I used to live in a metropolitan area where it was readily available, but I now live in a small town in the Midwest where I can't find it.  I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.  I'm a repeat customer and will continue to be.

review/summary: Great Bread for Adding Fiber to Your Diet!
review/text: I lived in Germany twice, so I was familiar with this bread.  I don't care for it out of the package, but once it's toasted, it has a richer flavor.  It's especially good with butter or melted cheese.  Since it's unlike any American bread, it may be unfamiliar or unappealing to some, but this sunflower seed bread is wheat free and packed full of healthy whole grains and fiber.  It is somewhat high in sodium, but otherwise a very good choice for healthy eating.  One slice fills you up and satisfies your hunger. A good choice for high fiber dieting. Recommended!<br />Unless the recipe has changed, the nutrition facts provided are incorrect.<br />I have the bread right in front of me.  Here are the ingredients:  Whole kernel rye, water, wholemeal rye flour, sunflower seed, iodized salt, oat fiber, yeast.<br />Very high in iron (15% daily value).  360mg sodium, 3g fat, 23g carbohydrate, 6g fiber, 5g protein.  This bread is wheat free, but definitely not gluten free.<br />By the way, the price of the 12-pack is very reasonable. I paid the same price for one package at Big Lots ($2.50), but it just happened to be there.

review/text: My German mother makes a bread almost identical to this brand, so my wife and I were happy when we found this bread in the World Market. It has a firm texture, high moisture content and will last almost a year while in the unopened package. It is fiber rich and carries you for some time without feeling hungry. Note, it is not bread for toasting, unless you want to warm it up. It is too moist to toast, so don't bother and is better not toasted anyways. We love it with light butter or some jam. Finding a cheaper source from amazon in nice.

Though I would not recommend serving it plain or adding it to a bread and fruit tray for parties, it is very edible with just about any toppings.  It doesn't taste like any kind of bread I am used to, though, and the texture is a different as well.  But you can read the ingredients with satisfaction and know you are putting only good stuff in your body.

review/summary: A dark, bold roast that is a welcome start to the day
review/text: Noted as a "West Coast Favorite" this dark roast conjures up a scent of pine needles for me as it brews, a subliminal association perhaps tied more to the blend's name than the actual aromatics, which are pleasantly thick, sweet and strong enough to lift me from a groggy morning.<br /><br />I am still partial to Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, a recent purchase that knocked my socks off. Still, I would place Lake & Lodge a mere notch (star) beneath the Nantucket Blend. The Green Mountain website offers a fantastic description for Lake & Lodge: "This particular blend is very versatile, yet elegant. It makes a great espresso, partners well with cream, and is delicious iced. The flavors of this rich, darker roast blend reflect hearty West Coast style roasts. Dark roasted Indonesian coffees offer bountiful sweetness and syrupy notes. A touch of East African beans adds an element of berry-hued brightness to the blend's bold flavor foundations."<br /><br />I read that the blend's name has a peculiar history, first called "Tapestry Blend Dark" the blend was originally developed for a New York City shop called "The Coffee Station."<br /><br />Lake & Lodge is a better name, a blend that invokes ski resorts and campsites and sleepy mornings when a dark, bold roast is a welcome start to the day.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my other recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/summary: Best I have had
review/text: We picked up a box at their store in Waterbury, VT and it is one of my favorite K cups. The price was right, $16 for a pack of 24. It is great on a cold morning, perfectly balanced, not bitter, light and crisp!

review/summary: Close-dated K-Cups
review/text: I bought 48 Green Mountain Lake and Lodge K-Cups and they arrived on 9/24 with a 'best by" date of 10/7.  Nowhere did Amazon state they were close-dated.  I like coffee but cannot drink 48 cups in 12 days.  I think Amazon should insure the products they sell are fresh or clearly state this is a clearance item.

review/summary: Very Nice Blend
review/text: I like Lake and Lodge however, some of the cups I brew have less than others on the same water setting, in fact a few were substantially less than others, not sure if there is perhaps different amounts of coffee in some of the k-cups?

review/text: ITs OK. the k cup isn't consistent in strength.  I like a strong cup of coffee and this choice is uneven.

review/summary: Bold, yet mellow
review/text: If you enjoy their Kenyan AA but find it a bit bitter and not as smooth as you'd like, then you will love this!<br /><br />It's smooth and full bodied yet bold and strong.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: As a professional dog trainer who works 12 - 14 hour days, 7 days a week.......I am a coffee drinker! My clients purchased a sign which says "Dog Trainer Powered by Coffee". At home I use an antique vacuum pot to brew my freshly ground beans. At work I use a Keurig machine so that the coffee doesn't sit on a burner while I give classes. I enjoy a good tasting and strong cup of coffee. I have tried MANY k-cups. None have the flavor and aroma of this wonderful coffee, Lake and Lodge. I have finally found my "go-to" k-cup!

review/summary: Oh, these ARE good!
review/text: Hide them from the company, hide them from the room mates or family members! You will not get more than one cup if you share this set of 48! I am not kidding. These are so good and so hard to find that they simply vanish from the k-cup carousel. You will see people sitting on your couch holding mugs and they will all claim innocence !  A truly fine blend of coffee.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: I stumbled across this in an ad or something, and it's become my favorite.  It's quite a bit darker than a breakfast blend, but not too dark or too strong.  Like, I said, it's my new favorite
