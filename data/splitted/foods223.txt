review/summary: Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again
review/text: I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.

review/summary: Trying this product for the first time
review/text: I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool-aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.

review/summary: got me off the diet soda
review/text: I wanted something easy, tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction. This did the trick. I drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener. Once you get past the color, which is a nasty green, the tea is tasty. About a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste. I will buy this again!

review/summary: YUM....Yum, Yum!!!!
review/text: This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea "add to bottled water" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this "top shelf" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!

review/summary: Best Instant Green Tea Ever
review/text: Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.<br />Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves--no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K.

review/summary: Not for Me
review/text: I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.

review/text: this is the best iced green tea I've ever had; the hint of blueberry is just perfect.  I add a bit of Stevia for a little more sweetness.  It would be an insult to call this "instant tea," but I carry a packet in my purse because it's better than any prepared tea I could buy when eating out.  Stash tea is always good, but this is extraordinary.

review/summary: Just had a glass today
review/text: When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said "natural", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong "mint" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)

review/text: This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.

review/summary: Not bad.  A bit light.
review/text: I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.

review/summary: Great product - at last!
review/text: LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!

This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.

review/summary: Beware, if you have a corn allergy!!
review/text: The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a "helpful review", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself.

review/summary: lightly sweetened green iced tea powder
review/text: i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky

review/summary: Not So Much!
review/text: I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff, with the right sweetener
review/text: This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste.

review/summary: Don't bother
review/text: I bought this "flavor" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to "stash" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.

review/text: When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.

review/text: This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.  I have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and I do like them.  I have preferred the brand Einstein bagles uses, but since I have a Starbucks close by, have grown to like the one they use as well.  My favorite is the "masala" tea made my a local Indian restaurant.  This most closely approximates that.  I am still trying to replicate it, but for now, this is the best I can do.  I really like this tea.<br /><br />As a bonus, if I forget to empty the basket when I leave work, when I get in the next day, the whole area smells great!

review/text: I used this marinade exactly as the instructions say on the label.  I marinated two pounds of chicken breast, chopped up for couscous.  Now I will admit that the marinade smells amazing when you open the bottle, but it left me disappointed.  There is so much liquid smoke in this marinade, that my chicken ended up tasting like a chicken flavored ash tray.  Perhaps if I had used a smaller amount it would have worked out better?  I don't know.  I think perhaps the company needs to modify their cooking instructions.

review/text: The whole family loves this fajita marinade. Friends request it. The granddaughter forewarned her husband that he would be eating steak like he had never before tasted. Just put some Fabulosa on the steak, add garlic, McCormicks Montreal Steak seasoning and lemon pepper. Let the meat marinate for about 30 minutes before grilling.<br /><br />The marinade is made in Mesa, Texas, and we go to a great deal of trouble to find sources for it. I've even carried it to South Africa to help in the preparation of Mexican meals. Treat your fajita chicken with Fabulosa before you grill it. Yum.

It says each count (or bottle) would be $0.05 (or 5 cents a count/bottle) after subscribe and save.  Then in the product description it says contains 24 24 count cases and even says 576 counts, which one would take to mean this is 24 cases containing 24 bottles each totaling 576 bottles of water.  Well, the order comes and it is a case of 24 bottles. What? I can get a case of water with 35 bottles for less than $3 at Costco.  The water may be good but beware that their description here on quantity is WAY off before buying.

review/summary: Destiny Water
review/text: This is great water.  It doesn't have the nasty aftertaste that so many of the other bottled waters have.  This is the only unflavored bottled water that I enjoy.  When you drink it, it has a smooth taste and on the really hot days you can actually feel your body getting re-hydrated without getting waterlogged.  It absorbs into your system quickly which is great while for runners or bikers. You don't get the water sloshing around in your stomach like with many other waters. The high mineral content is a nice added benefit as well.

review/summary: Love it but.......
review/text: I really like this tea!  It has great flavor and is really easy to make.  I like it with just a tiny bit of sweetener and a wedge of lemon.  That being said, to get the amount and strength I like for my tea I have to use 2 k-cups for one cup of tea.  I usually do two 6 oz brews and it is just right.  I can go up to an 8 oz brew and still have good flavor but I want more than 8oz at a time.  For me it is just too expensive to use 2 k-cups at a time.  I have compromised with myself and still keep the k-cups around to use if I am in a hurry (or just extra lazy) but I mostly just use the tea bags of the same flavor.  I find it really isn't much more difficult or time consuming to use my keurig machine for hot water to steep a tea bag in.  The tea bags are just much more economical for me.

review/text: I'm a new Keurig user and this is by far my favorite flavor of tea.  I've tried 8 flavors of tea and the Mandarin Orange Spice is the most flavorful.  In addition to drinking it on its own, I pour a "small" cup of the Mandarin Orance Spice mixed with a "small" cup of the Lemon Zinger.  I like mixing flavors, but still my favorite is the Mandarin Orange Spice on its own.

review/summary: Mandarin Spice K Cups
review/text: This is my favorite tea.  I like it because it is caffeine free and I like the taste.  I do add a packet of Splenda.  If you want to make iced tea, my advice is to first brew it in a mug, then add the Splenda, then pour it over ice.  If you brew it directly over ice, then add Splenda, the Splenda doesn't mix as well.<br />I paid $16 for 24 k cups through Amazon.  This is about what I used to pay when I ordered from Keurig, except that I also either had to pay shipping, or order several boxes in order to get free shipping.  The Amazon Prime membership is a great deal.  It is worth the yearly fee, especially at Christmastime.

review/text: I've had good experience with pod teas in the past, so I was hoping that now that I have a Keurig brewer I'd be able to find some good tea blends.  This Madarin Orange Spice Herbal Tea is really good.  It has a pleasant orange spice flavor that is strong enough when brewed at the maximum 12 oz setting of my Cuisinart Keuring brewer.  Add a little sweetener of your choosing and it makes a refreshing beverage hot or over ice.  I will definitely buy again when I use up these portions.
