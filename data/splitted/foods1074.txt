review/summary: Clogs brewer
review/text: While the taste of this coffee is good, for some reason, it tends to clog in the brewing process.  I've used it in 3 different brewers with the same problem.  To prevent this problem, the K-cup has to be shaken immediately prior to brewing.  Perhaps the coffee is ground too fine and is getting packed down as the water is being pressed through the K-cup.  I probably wouldn't buy this brand again.

review/summary: 3.0 out of 5 stars I am a Starbucks extra Bold Roast kind of girl, so keep that in mind
review/text: I am reviewing all the flavours in my variety pack in the hopes of finding one I like.  I am pretty picky on coffee, and k cups, so you may notice my reviews are similar (mainly because I am doing the exact same thing to each cup, in the hopes of finding one that is similar and cheaper to what I usually like.<br /><br />I made Fuggedaboutdit,  as I usually make my K-cups (I drink Van Houtte Eclipse almost every morning) and used a 6 ounce cup of water. I don't use sugar and do use coffee cream.<br /><br />It smelled good, but when I poured cream in, went super white almost immediately, which usually means the k cup is not going to be a strong enough taste for me.  I did not pour it out, but still feel like I have not had a cup of coffee yet today. Too weak for me on six ounce setting.<br /><br />My 16 year old son made Cyclone and he liked it but he told me I would not.<br />Maple sleigh- i dont normally like flavoured coffee, but the flavour was alright.  Same problem with the coffee being too weak, even on a 6 ounce setting.<br /><br />That said, I am sure someone who is not as into very strong coffee as me, will like it. It's not bad, or anything, its just I am a Starbucks extra bold kind of girl, so remember that when you read my reviews. Interesting though that two of my favourite K cups (other than double black diamond) are Caribou regular (I don't like the mahogany which is supposed to be stronger tasting) and the Eclipse, both of which are sort of medium smooth coffees. Looking forward to trying and reviewing some more.  I did not buy the cups on Amazon, but have started reviewing things on Amazon, whether I buy them here or not.  Its not like you can try things in an online store, and I am a very regular amazon.com and .ca customer for other items, so I am motivated to review things so as not to be disappointed when I am shopping.  The more of us who do this review thing on all products, the better.

I don't even want to try these things again as I don't need the mess to clean up. If I  wanted the mess, I would use the my kcup which doesn't ooze the grounds all over the place but you have to  deal with the grounds in the dispenser. I can't believe they  are still selling these things without perfecting them.  btw, I had the decaf if that helps anyone.

review/summary: Good coffee taste but......
review/text: This is a good tasting medium roast coffee.  However, we have had trouble with grounds coming out of the cup during brewing. Thus creating a cup of coffee with grounds floating on the top.  Not my idea of a fresh brewed cup of coffee.  It happens randomly, not every cup.  I'm not sure what the problem is. It seems like some of the cups are not sealed properly or something.  We do not have this problem with other brands using the same brewer.

There is something off with the foil on the top of the cups.  A lot of the cups already had grinds on them when I opened the box.  It seemed that I ended up with grinds in the majority of the cups I brewed.  Would like to order again, but not if I have to deal with the same issues.

review/summary: Average taste, good for friends
review/text: I was hoping for more from this company, someone to take on behemoth GMCR. The coffee is weaker than most GMCR blends and the taste is average. It's not terrble,  but not a wonderful experience like Barista Italian roast, detrich's french roast or Caribou blend. I also got their French roast to compare and again it was average and weaker. I had to go 2oz less to get the consistency of both the same. It is cheaper, but for 14 cents more I can  get a great cup of coffee. I found that these are not quite what I am looking for, but are great for company who doesn't expect too much but likes a good cup of coffee. I still want to try Fogetaboutit and see how it compares.

review/summary: Great Company - Great K-Cups
review/text: I am rather torn about these K-Cups. The taste of the coffee is very good; actually one of my favorites. (Even better than Dunkin Donuts, which has always been my go-to coffee). That being said, as has been pointed out before, the quality of the physical k-cups is lacking.<br /><br />When I first opened the box there were coffee grounds everywhere. Upon looking closer, I noticed that the foil tops of two of the cups were not aligned with the plastic bottom and so there was an open slot for the coffee to come out. After rinsing the k-cups off and brewing some though, I discovered that it actually tasted really good; though there seems to always be coffee grounds at the bottom of my cup.<br /><br />To be honest, I still dont know if I will be ordering these again or not; on one hand they taste really good, but on the other its very frustrating to have had the cups break open before they even get to me, and depending on how many are broken it slowly drives up the price per cup.<br /><br />Update: 8/16/12<br /><br />This is really a great company that cares about the quality of their product. After the bad first batch, and being contacted by a company representative, I received samples that brewed perfectly and tasted delicious. Will definitely buy this brand again!

review/summary: Decent Brew. Exploding Cups
review/text: I tried this coffee because the price simply can not be beat.  We are not coffee experts by any means but we love a good solid brew.  The coffee has the right balance of strength with a mellow aftertone.  The only thing that I have found less than stellar is the exploding cups.  In a batch of 36 we've had 9 explode on us.  When you look at the cost per cup that's coffee that is lost plus the time spent having to thoroughly clean the machine.  Hopefully the exploding cup issue has been resolved.

review/summary: Great coffee, bad manufacturing.
review/text: I have to say that I have tried 3 varieties of Brooklyn Beans coffees, and I love all the flavors that I have tried.  That being said, now the negative, I hate grounds in my coffee.  All the varieties seem to leave more grounds in the cup than the Green Mountain cups, the decaf experience was extremely bad. I will not buy more decaf until I am confident the manufacturing issues have been fixed.  I purchased a box of the decaf cups from Amazon on 5/14/12.  I am not a frequent drinker of decaf and have not had more than a couple of cups before this weekend, when I brewed 2 of the decaf.  One clogged in my machine producing only a half cup of undrinkable coffee, a mess in my machine and on the counter.  The second one produced a cup with many grounds, and had to be strained before drinking.  Please fix the manufacturing Brooklyn Beans!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q822GK">Brooklyn Light Roast Bean Roastery Decaffeinated Coffee, Breakfast Blend, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 36-Count</a>

review/text: I am disappointed in this product.  After reading the reviews about the pods not working and the followups from the company saying the problem was fixed I thought we'd give them a try.  Guess what, 1 out of 4 of our k-cups didn't work.  Either they pop or they leak which both make a mess.  When they work they taste good but the faulty cups and the mess take away all the savings.  Buy at your own risk.

review/text: Despite several reviews that said these K-cups sometimes explode we decided to purchase them anyway. The coffee is delicious there's no doubt about that, but you can only have a cup of coffee when there is actually coffee inside the k-cup. We've had a few that were completely empty. Just foil lid over plastic cup, that's it. Great coffee, but apparently poor quality control.

review/summary: Several k-cups exploded in machine
review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this product, based on other reviews addressing issues with a manufacturer defect; however, I placed the order anyway and was very disappointed to find that several of the k-cups caused a very nasty, gritty substance to come out of the k-cup when making coffee. I had to use four k-cups before I was able to finally get an actual cup of coffee. Once I finally was able to make a true cup of coffee, the taste was pretty good (why I am giving two stars versus one star). I must've gotten an older batch of the k-cups because they apparently explode in the keurig machine if the top of the k-cup is flat instead of bubbled. I had to throw away over half of my package and needless to say, I will not be wasting my hard-earned money on these k-cups in the future. It's a shame, because for the price and the taste, it seemed like a good deal. It was very inconvenient to have to clean my keurig machine after the k-cups exploded. I have ordered other name brand k-cups (I.e. donut shop, green mountain, Gloria jeans, timothy's, etc) and I've never had an issue with their k-cups exploding in my keurig machine. I thought their manufacturing defect was resolved, but appartently it has not been resolved.

review/text: I held off on ordering this product due to some of the manufacturing problems they had. Seems i should have waited a little bit longer.<br /><br />I order the Cyclone because i like a strong coffee but not so strong that you cannot taste the flavor. The product was dead on when it came to flavor. taste, great strength, really made a great cup of coffee, but then the astounding packaging failure.<br /><br />Went to make a cup last night and walked away. All of a sudden i was smelling the wonderful aroma throughout my living room. My thought was 'Man this is a great smelling cup of coffee." it never occurred to me that i normally cannot smell my coffee brewing that far away. Then i went to get my cup and noticed that the coffee was all over my counter. Seems the foil top had a severe malfunction and spewed coffee all over the place.<br /><br />So in review, Great cup of coffee when it works, I hope they get the manufacturing problems fixed because this is something i would love to try again.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: While the coffee is at least under the $.50 a cup barrier ( with subscribe and save ) it pretty well failed in its comparison to Green Mountain's Dark Magic. First off , when the box arrived and was opened coffee grounds spilled all over the table. Upon inspection , 5 of the k cups had faulty foil and had come off in the box. The box itself was not damaged in any way and was packaged well by Amazon so I'm not sure what type of quality control goes into the product. Anyway , i figured if it at least measured up taste wise like it said I probably would have given them another try. Unfortunately , the taste was not even close!! While its not necessarily a bad cup of coffee , it compares more to the Folgers Columbian k-cups my wife drinks. It tastes more of a medium roast and is not very strong . In my opinion , it would make an ok secondary cup once you have had your morning powerhouse to get you started , it just didn't measure up to its claims of Dark Magic comparison or its quality control on its products.

review/text: Being born and bred in Brooklyn but now living upstate NY, of course we had to try this product.  Short and sweet, the coffee is good but the packaging is horrible, every two to three cups comes loaded with grinds.  Don't plan to order again.  Gave two stars only because few cups without the grinds were good.  We now put a tea strainer on the cup when brewing.<br /><br />PM - just heard from a friend who also ordered coffee a short time after we did.  I had written to see if they had any problems and they did not so I felt I needed to be fair and come back to edit my post to include their comment.  We both agree, however, that the coffee is good.<br /><br />6/11/12:  I know I am not the only only customer who had communication with Brooklyn Bean Roastery and I admire the fact that in true Brooklyn style, they stepped up, admitted there was a problem then made good and ensured it was corrected.  However, I am rewriting this review based ON THE COFFEE not the fact that the manufacturer replaced my original order and included some samples of the other blends.  As I said in my original review, the coffee was good without the grinds, now not having to deal with straining the coffee, we are truly enjoying it and have decided to replace our usual breakfast blend with BBR's Breakfast Blend.  We have been very pleased with all the samplers tasted.  Thank you for for giving us the opportunity to change our minds and truly enjoy the coffee.  BBR Rocks!

review/summary: bad luck on making coffee
review/text: so far have used 12 of these k cups for making coffee, 3 of the cups the grinds shot out of the cup all over the machine, seems to be a manufacturing quality control issue. the coffee doesn't drain out of the bottom, but shoots back out of the top. the other 9 k cups worked as designed.

review/text: We tried this coffee and enjoyed the taste, bold. However the filter in the k-cup does not work at least half the time.  About half of the cups I have used emptied the coffee grounds into the cup of coffee instead of staying in the k-cup.  Really not what you want first thing in the morning.

review/text: When you put these cups in the Kuerig the plastic is so flimsy instead of piercing a hole in the bottom to drain the coffee, the plastic is bent. So the water goes into the k-cup overflows out into your coffee cup, coffee grounds and all. I've tried to pierce a hole myself to no avail. I Wasted $17!!!! Don't waste YOUR money.

review/summary: 7 out of 36 cups not sealed.
review/text: [Update: Brooklyn Beans sent me a new box - as you can see in the comments below. 1 out of 24 cups was not sealed. I have now learned to squeeze the k-cup just slightly to see if the foil lid responds to the light pressure. If it bulges just a little, the lid is good. If it is loose, I pull the lid off and brew it in My K-Cup coffee filter so at least the coffee is not wasted. The coffee is very good. My favorite was Brooklyn Bridge Blend. But all of it was fresh and tasty. ]<br /><br />7 out of 36 cups are not sealed. I do not think the box was compressed in shipping causing some of the cups to burst. No cups were crunched. The BB box looks fine - undented. It was inside an Amazon box which also looked fine - all still-puffy airpillows inside. There was loose coffee in both boxes and coffee dust on  the k-cups and airpillows.<br /><br />The k-cups that have a good lid  look roughly made to me. The logo printing<br /> doesn't line up with the top of the cups. The edges of the foil is rough. Where the foil is sealed on the cup the foil feels bumpy... like loose coffee was not cleaned off the cup before the foil was applied.<br /><br />I haven't made any coffee yet. I will up date this review when I do tomorrow morning... but right now, already 7 cups down, I am not impressed.<br /><br />I rarely write bad reviews, but I do not want anyone else to be disappointed like I am right now.

review/summary: Don't fret the sulfur smell
review/text: We were curious to try this salt based upon an article we read in a health magazine. The "rotten eggs" smell was, of course, a concern, but we opted to try it anyway.<br /><br />Let it be known that the smell is exactly as described, as well as the taste when sample straight out of the packaging. However, once added to a dish and cooked (even sprinkled on veggies), the sulfur-like aroma and flavor changes into a subtle and interesting result for your palate.<br /><br />At first, I thought this might be one of those seasonings only for special dishes..but we tried it on some basics (other than adding to veggies). We added it to a crack-peppered hummus...and it rocks!<br /><br />Experiment and you'll find that it is an eggcellent salt!

My family actually prefers scrambled tofu and tofu based "egg-salad" over the same made with real eggs, however, the black salt steps it up a notch.

The lack of decent coffee choices with CBTL has caused me to rethink my recent purchase of the CBTL Briosa.  The capsules are pretty expensive for an eight ounce cup of coffee that is nothing special.<br /><br />The Briosa is being returned to Amazon tomorrow due to the fact that it arrived missing a part that caused water to spray all over my top cabinets and an electrical outlet.  The Briosa is also extremely loud and I had to put a towel under it to keep it from vibrating across the counter top.  Amazon was extremely helpful with arranging the exchange of the Briosa.<br /><br />The Briosa currently has no reviews, negative or otherwise.  Will post a review on the Briosa after I receive and test the replacement.

I find them to be tastey and nutritious. They are great to keep in your bag for work or play. They are great for a long car drive and a fun snack to give away. I understand there is sort of a cult following with Sahale, so I loke to give them away to people to spread the word.

review/summary: This is the stuff!
review/text: Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha is one of my favorite packaged teas. It has a rich, strong, and full taste. In comparison, Yamatoyama's genmaicha tastes a little burnt, and other genmaichas seem somewhat diluted. If you like the genmaicha served in Japanese restaurants, you really ought to try Ujinotsuyu's version -- you're going to love this stuff. These tea bags are strong enough for two uses (steepings).<br /><br />I've gone out of my way to purchase this tea. In the New York City metropolitan area, one may also find Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha in ethnic Japanese, Korean, and Chinese supermarkets, although searching may be required.

review/summary: Homey flavor
review/text: Delicious, warming, nourishing tea for a chilly day. This product is a bagged mixture of green tea and little bits of toasted rice. When brewed, you get tea that has a sort of cozy, toasty, nutty flavor to it. It's really pleasant to sip on a blustery autumn day! Some tips: green tea is more delicate than black, so use water that is slightly cooled from boiling--not at boiling temperature--as you would with an herbal tea. Also, this tea, IMHO, is best left unsweetened; the sugar would mask the delicate green tea flavor and the nuttiness of the toasted rice. Brew it for about 3-5 minutes, although (unlike with black tea) you won't end up with an undrinkably bitter brew if left in longer.<br /><br />Also, as noted before--this is tea, NOT soup. The rice is enclosed in the bag with the tea leaves. It lends flavor, not substance.

review/text: This has become one of my favorite teas for afterdinner.  I've never been a big fan of tea until I traveled through parts of asia.  One of the best parts of this tea is the aroma from the roasted brown rice.  It's a very subtle tea with a nutty flavor (roasted brown rice).  Definitely not a sweet tea, nor is it bitter.  Just so people don't get this confused.  This is not a soup.  Don't expect to be "eating" anything.  Just steep it up and enjoy.

I would advise putting it it a zip lock bag in the fridge but never had any trouble with mold as the other reviewers said. If anyone is familiar with small dogs you have to watch for hypoglycemia. But with these snacks around she gets the protein and calories she needs. She has never had any troubles digesting this snack and has eaten half a pack with ease, she would eat the whole bag if it was up to her.

review/text: I don't think theses make milk taste like chocolate milk. It's more of a malty chocolate flavor. But, I'm not complaining. This is more of a novelty thing in my opinion, and it does it's job. For those wondering how these work (I was before I got them) the straw is filled with tiny chocolate balls and then it is pinched at both ends. There are slits so the milk can pass through. You don't do anything but pour a glass of milk, or other drink I suppose, and add the straw. Your lips need to be past the pinched section (I had to cut one straw so my 3 year old's mouth fit). These would be perfect to carry in your bag or to put in a lunch box.They don't melt until a liquid passes through them.

review/text: When I purchased this item, it stated 6 pack of straws and I thought that meant 6 packages of straws (with 6 actual straws in each package) and the cost was $7.31 with free shipping through Amazon Prime. (They've now changed the price so that there's the price of the straw and the price of shipping.) Anyways, I thought 6 packages was a good deal and purchased it - I just received the item (which was shipped late and not 2 day prime) and it was only ONE package! Needless to say I'm a little mad because why would I spend so much on one package.<br /><br />The product itself - it's really good! I bought it at Target initially and loved it. Low-calorie sweetener that I've even eaten like a pixie stick for a little sweet fix without the calories.

review/text: The Loc Maria crepes are one of my favorites. Everyone I gift these to loves it telling me how delicious they are. They are light and not too sweet, so good you feel like you can eat the entire box in one sitting. I especially love the dark chocolate covered ones. However the merchant I ordered them from, Touch of Europe, via Amazon sent them so late beyond the date they posted it should arrive. I had ordered a couple hundred dollars worth of these from Touch of Europe, intending them to be Christmas gifts. I waited more than ONE MONTH for them to arrive, on the very day I was leaving out town. It barely came on time and made me panic, having to possibly go out and buy alternative gifts to give to colleagues on the day I was leaving out of town! Don't know if it was a postal problem or not but it was horrible that it arrived SOOOOO LATE!

review/summary: My Favorite Tri-Color: Watch for Amazon Sale Prices!
review/text: This is another product I keep on the shopping list to wait for sales. Luckily, it recently went on a smashing sale and I grabbed it up for almost half the normal price. When you combine free shipping, this is really an excellent way to get a favorite that is sometimes hard to find in your local market.<br /><br />For these tri-color Farfalle, you'll need to ensure you use LOTS of water. They need it and deserve it. When done, these have a texture not seen in most dried pastas and is perfect for pasta salads as well as hot dishes.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, I often find that tri-colors are just that...more color than flavor...but that isn't the case here. You get the subtle yet distinct flavor differences you're meant to. Perfectly balanced.<br /><br />In terms of shipping, these weren't quite how I usually get pasta from Amazon. The five boxes were packaged loosely within a plastic bag so that the boxes got all jumbled up inside the box with other products ordered. That means that the boxes got very dinged and crunched, though none were punctured or open. Still, to go into the pantry I had to combine 2 of the boxes into another container because they were so very banged up. Perhaps I should take a star from it for that, but the pasta itself is what I'm reviewing and that is certainly deserving of 5!

review/text: I bought these to sell at our video store and am super happy with them.  I did not expect each individual treat inside to be wrapped, I just assumed it would all be in one sealed bag (which, upon receipt, I realized was silly of me because the candy would obviously dry out of they weren't individually wrapped).  Point - I was already happy from the get go.  They are great because they are cheap and a fun movie themed candy that the kids love to buy.  We sold tons the first day.<br /><br />We busted a few packs open the day we got the first shipment and everyone in the store tried some of each.<br /><br />The gummy popcorn, in my opinion, is the worst of the bunch.  There is a theater box of gummy popcorn I tried in the past that was surprisingly good, but this is one chunk of foamy, airy gummy that smells very much like buttered popcorn but is just weird to eat in one gigantic piece.  But, there are kids who love it so no complaints here.<br /><br />The pizza and the hot dog are what you would expect, just like the efrutti candies people sell singles of.<br /><br />The gummi worms are great.<br /><br />The red licorice gummy strings are also good.<br /><br />The gummy cola bottles are okay, not my favorite but smell and taste like cola.<br /><br />All in all, great cheap movie-themed candy that we have bought several cases of and will continue to buy.

review/summary: Pine Nuts from China
review/text: These pine nuts are a product of China.  Had I known that I would NOT have purchased them.<br /><br />Why?  These Chinese pine nuts leave a distinctive and extremely unpleasant metallic flavor on the tongue which lasts for as long as two weeks depending on how many are eaten.<br /><br />Being a raw foodie, I use a lot of pine nuts in my raw food preparation, so it didn't take long for me to isolate the food which was causing the terrible, disagreeable reaction on my palate.  The nuts are expensive and I thought I was getting a good value with Azar but as it turns out, since the Azar Chinese pine nuts are not edible for me, they were a tremendous waste.<br /><br />Perhaps not every body will have the same reaction as I but I thought I must still flag a warning about Chinese pine nuts.<br /><br />I should add finally that I do NOT have any problems with domestic pine nuts or Italian pignolias and I much prefer them, especially if they are organically grown.  The flavor of USA and Italian grown pinenuts is far superior.  The metallic issue seems to come up with Chinese pine nuts only.

review/summary: Excellent deal!
review/text: Arrived when promised, and it was an excellent price-even without the discount code I used.  This is our favorite gluten-free mac and cheese so I was glad to find it on amazon.

review/summary: I don't follow directions
review/text: I serve Annie's Homegrown Gluten Free Rice Pasta & Cheese regularly to both people who do and who don't have to live gluten free.  It is always a hit with the kids, but I don't prepare it the way that the package calls for.  I do add the recommended amount of butter, but I skip the milk as it seems to make it too watery if I add it in.  The package also doesn't say to add some oil to the water when I am cooking the pasta, but I find it helps to keep the pasta from sticking to the pot.  I also recommend stirring more frequently than with regular pasta.
