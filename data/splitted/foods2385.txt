review/summary: really strong on the cinnamon
review/text: This is really strong Chai tea, the leaves smell like a pack of Big Red and cinnamon/cloves are the strongest flavors.<br /><br />The resealable bag is pretty sturdy so even if you threw it against the wall your tea would still be safe, not really much else to say besides it's well packaged tea that tastes good.

review/summary: Wonderful tea
review/text: I drink tea daily and was looking to buy in bulk to largely to save money.  I truly love this tea, and I've tried many brands of chai.  I like the flavor, the fact that is organic and the way it is packaged.  I'm thrilled to have found this tea at such a great price with great quality as well.  I've tried several other varieties of Davidson's teas  and think the quality of all of them is great, but the classic chai is my favorite.

review/summary: You will either love it or hate it
review/text: The pleasure or aversion that is gained from this tea seems to divide the population into equal halves. Before I bought the tea I read through the reviews with amusement. My thought was that the tea is either loved or hated and that it seemed like I may love it. Indeed, this was correct, for I find the tea highly enjoyable. Although I love the tea, especially the smell, some of my family members hate the smell alone.<br /><br />I suggest that you read through the reviews and decide if the descriptions of the tea sound like something you will enjoy.

Because it had a few good reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  Big mistake.  Perhaps I'll sprinkle it at the edge of the garden to keep away varmints this spring....

review/summary: Wonderful Tea!
review/text: Love this chai tea!  The balance of spices is just perfect and I love the extra hint of orange.  I put one regular-sized scoop of this chai tea in my glass teapot and don't even bother with the infuser, add hot water, and let steep for about 5 minutes - I can get about 3 large (12 oz) mugs of tea per scoop.  The flavor is very rich and robust and holds its own with honey and milk.  I have never found any chai tea-bags that can match the full flavor of this loose tea, and having it automatically delivered once a month on Amazon's Subscribe & Save program is soooo convenient.

review/summary: Works Great with our Ameda and Medela Pumps!!
review/text: We bought these bottles to use with our Medela PIS and Ameda Purley Yours Breast Pumps, yes, we bought both. We chose to use these bottles since the Medela 5 oz bottles cost a bit more, and the Ameda bottles are not BPA free. The Lansinoh bottles work great with both brands! The only thing I don't like is that the caps are two piece caps and the Medela Bottles have the solid one piece lids. I just use my 80ml Medela bottle lids with these since we are no longer using them anyway, and they work great and there are no pieces to loose. You can put any standard bottle nipple ring on the bottles so you don't have to change bottles if you don't want too, and you can just throw some nipples and rings already put togehter in a zip bag and throw them in your diaper bag for later. You can also find the Lansinoh storage bottles here on amazon in the 8 and 12 pks!! Hope this helps.

review/text: These bottles serve great for their purpose, and they do fit into the pump, but the bottoms of the bottles are too wide to fit into the BASE holder of the pump. Seems odd that they would make them to not fit their own product. But other than that these work just fine as storage bottles.

review/text: I purchased these bottles for use with My Medela Pump, they are not a good fit and will fall away from the pumping aparatus while in use.  They are just a tad bit smaller than the Medela bottles and annoyingly and messily break away from the breast sheild.  They do work for storage but not for direct pumping with the Medela line.

review/summary: Very good cute bottles
review/text: These are great light, easy to clean bottles. The reason I purchased them to begin with was because I thought they would fit in my Lansinoh double electric pump, which they did not :). If you want bottles that fit into the holders on the Lansinoh pump, you need to buy the Ameda bottles. However, they do work with the Lansinoh pump and you don't really use the bottle holders on the pump anyway. So overall a great purchase. Great for freezing milk or water in them and they have a great look.

review/summary: Not the tapered style bottle that comes with Lansinoh Manual Pump
review/text: When I ordered these, I chose this listing because it showed the tapered bottles, like the ones that come with the Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump.  The ones I received are the straight-sided ones.  They still work with my pump, but don't snap into the stabilizing base to keep the pump from tipping over when set down.  Darn.  Otherwise, fine, but I like the rubber (or rubber-like) caps that fit into the rings and came with my pump better than the ones that came with these too (they snap in).  Better for one-handed bottle assembling.

review/summary: Mostly for Storage
review/text: I started breastfeeding our son right away and realized that if I had several more bottles that would fit the breastpump, I could store it in the fridge right after or feed it too him if I was too sore. However, even though I bought Lansinoh bottles to use with a Lansinoh pump, when I used the bottles to feed him, for some reason the nipples would pop off thus spilling all over and wasting all the milk and making for a happy baby. I tried every nipple and everyone of them seemed like they didn't quite fit well enough. So now all I use the extra bottles for are pumping (in case the others are dirty and I don't want to clean them). Useful but probably wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Nice flavor, but difficult to 'pop' in your mouth
review/text: My trout roe arrived today and upon opening i was very excited by the beautiful light orange pearls packed in the tin.  With my first spoonful, i was a bit dissapointed in how tough the outer 'membranes' of the roe were.  they just kind of slip around in your mouth and are difficult to "pop" using your teeth.  even pinching them between your fingers, you need to apply considerable pressure.  Flavor was nice - similar to salmon roe, but a bit less briney and milder. they seem like fine quality, but the firm texture is very different from salmon roe, which in my experience pop in your mouth a lot easier.  i would say salmon roe is my preferred "red caviar."

All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.

review/summary: Good Nuts, Well Roasted but too many duds.
review/text: These Marcona almonds were well roasted and generally tasty. My only criticism would be the relatively high number of "duds" - the oddball nuts that are bad and taste very bitter. This happens in any batch but with good quality control, such items are usually removed from batches of premium product. Which suggests that these nuts although expertly toasted, were not taken from the highest quality product grading. Otherwise no problems.

review/text: This peanut butter is a favorite in our house.  All 3 of us eat it every day pretty much.  However, we made the mistake of buying a case of it online since it was cheaper.  It could be the heat (we are in California) that ruined it on it's way here, I'm not sure, because it wasn't expired.  However, it tasted very different than what we get at our local grocery store.  Not nearly as good and kind of melty.  This is the best peanut butter out there but take my advice and don't get it mail ordered.

review/text: I can't really compare it to other peanut butter to be honest because I don't eat that much peanut butter... I just grabbed this for a cookie recipe. These are pretty sweet on their own (honey + sugar... I guess its good to have some honey as a sweetener rather than just pure sugar!) so when I added the sugar the cookie recipe I asked for, it was EXTREMELY sweet. I think this is a good peanut butter to use for baking (or if you don't want to add anymore sweetener). The cookies I made were no bake peanut butter cookies and next time I'm not going to use any sugar in the recipe. That might make it a lil bit healthier than the other kind (because you don't need anymore sugar) it tastes pretty good on toast too.

review/text: Out of the gold foil package, this matcha smells amazingly fruity. Super fruit amazing! The smell reminds me of really tarty berry yogurt. Brazilian Acai matcha appears slightly darker in powder form.<br /><br />I prepared this as a traditional hot cup. This matcha didn't froth up very well nor maintain froth, but I didn't really care. Interestingly, this matcha prepared has a different colour than normal, a dark forest green, probably from the acai berry powder. By the way, I used 1/4tsp plus 175f water.<br /><br />The taste of  Brazilian Acai matcha is quite fruity. A mix between a tropical flavor and blackberries or blueberries. There is also a natural sweetness to this matcha - adding any additional sweetener would be overkill I think. With the fruityness and natural sweetness, this hot cup is very refreshing! There is no tart or bitterness to this matcha! I honestly was expected this to taste tart or puckery.<br /><br />In the end, this was surprisingly good! Is this matcha totally cheating with getting a double whammy of healthy energizing matcha and acai? Don't pass up this matcha - I'm thinking this is up there on being one of my fav flavors from Red Leaf Teas!

review/summary: A-sci-eeeeeeeeeeeee!
review/text: Okay, so, fair warning. I'm not overly familiar with the acai berry or how it should taste. I've had acai berry/blueberry juice before, and loved it, so I'm hoping I'll love the berry on its own. Of course now, all I can think of when it comes to this tea is RuPaul's Drag Race with all the different queens trying to say "acai" for a TV commercial. It's like the Pink Dragonfruit from Tealish. I've never had dragonfruit, but it smelled amazing and so I tried it and I loved it. Now I'm on the hunt for an actual dragonfruit to try. So while I can tell if I like the tea and if it tastes good or not, I have no real way to tell if it tastes like the actual fruit at all. But that's okay! Everyone should be open to new experiences, and I am looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Okay, yum! It's kind of like blueberry on steroids? I don't know, it's got this amazing berry flavor with a round tartness....yes, round. It was the word that came to mind as I sipped it. It's just...lovely and unexpected. The flavor is very bold and very...unique. I don't quite know how to describe it, but I liked it. I definitely want to try more acai flavored things if this is what I have to look forward to! I'm not sure if I need to restock on this ASAP, but it's definitely in the running for my must-have list.

review/text: This bread is soft and flavorful. Full of raisins and candied orange peel the bread is similar to raisin bread with an orange flavor. It is really good and is more of a breakfast or dessert bread as opposed to a fruit cake or something like that. Bread is light and fluffy and moist. It is really good so I recommend it without hesitation. The family has gone through 3 this holiday season alone!

review/summary: Money saver!!
review/text: As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the "My Kcup" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use.

review/text: I was a little worried about this one because of a bad (weak coffee) experience w/ the My K-Cup, but this product worked remarkably well!  I didn't think it was difficult to clean using the spray nozzle on the faucet.  Also, be careful not to use super fine grounds (as suggested on the package).  They will plug up the mesh and result in a half brew of coffee so strong it can not be consumed!  Kirkland 100% Columbian-fine ground works well, however.

review/summary: great coffee with no environmental impact
review/text: I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment.  I can use any coffee I like, or as I frequently do, I can use a pod.  One of the things about the Keurig I love is the ability to choose daily between varieties of coffee.  Buying a pound of one kind of coffee is boring to me. So I buy locally 1/4 bags and store them in a vented airproof (airscape) container. And I buy pods (frequently on sale so the price is the same as ground beans per cup) and dump the grounds into the Solofill. I use 10 gram pods, more is too much, less is not enough. With pods, the coffee remains fresh because it's nitrogen packed. I don't have to drink all the same kind at once to use it up =)  So i balance between my locally purchased fresh ground and the pods. The Solofill brews a much better cup than the K cups provide. Much richer mouth feel, and slightly stronger than an extra bold k cup.<br />I drink mostly dark roasts (k cups: dark magic, double black diamond) and I'm very satisfied with the cups from a Solofill with 10 grams ground coffee, either from a pod or fresh.  The device self-tamps when you close it so the water flows evenly throughout the grounds. No dry spots. I pop the Keurig open after I brew and come back to dump the grounds after I drink; that gives the solofill time to cool off.  The only caveat is to make sure you flick off any grounds on the rim before you close the solofill so it makes a solid seal. I bought two so I can always have one ready to go......

review/summary: Good product, does what it's supposed to
review/text: It does what it's supposed to. I have a few grumbles, however.<br />First, of the 4 I bought, on 2 the caps did not close very well, and it would tend to pop open. But it's okay when you pop it in for brewing.<br />Second, it does not stand on its own on the counter, so you have to hold it while you are filling it - it would be nice to be able to just have it stand on its own.<br />Third, if the coffee ground is too fine, such as espresso grounds, then the filter plugs and does not work at all.<br />Fourth, the mini well at the bottom does not clean easily, and the grounds tend to stick in there.

review/text: I have the Keurig My K-Cup and found it to be annoying to have to pull out the insert to use it after I use an actual k-cup.  This eliminates that and I've found it to make a better cup of coffee as well.  It's a nice one piece design so no messing with the 3 pieces like the My K-cup.  Works great.

review/summary: Much better than "My K Cup"
review/text: Great Coffee taste with all the flavors of fresh ground coffee and a French Press with out the mess.  Solofill Cup is almost idiot proof.  If you can read and follow directions you will have no problem with this.  My K Cup works fine, but the Solofill Cup works better.  Easier to use, better flow, more of the flavors of fresh ground coffee come through.  If you use the right grind, only fill to the fill line, make sure the gasket is clean and snap the lid shut it will work right every time.  Added bonus, when I am in a hurry and snap a factory K Cup in, I don't have to change the filter holder.  Best $15.00 spent in awhile.  Get to use local custom blend fresh whole bean coffee that tastes as good as French Press.  My K Cup coffee always lacked some of the flavor, Solofill Cup does not.

review/summary: FINALLY
review/text: Finally!! I love my Keurig, and I don't mind buying the k-cups. What does bother me is the limited availability of flavored decaf coffees. I am a coffee addict and could drink it all day if it didn't keep me up all night. I have tried every other do it yourself k cup product out there and they all stink! This product actually works. It brews a decent cup of coffee,  not watered down and not a single ground of coffee in the cup. This product is worth the money! Thinking about buying a second!

review/summary: very functional but too flimsy to last
review/text: Got 3 of these to salve my recycle conscience and save on cost. I have the smallest of the Keurigs and drink 2 cups a day, so I figured I could keep 2 clean. The good news is that size is perfect, fits beautifully and brew is excellent (just using my adc ground Green Mtn coffee). They work great and are 5 star for that. However, they are made in china of all plastic, including the important hinge top that is the one moving part. I am super careful with this, but it's just plastic, rather flimsy, and there's no way it's going to last repeated openings, which of course are necessary for both filling and cleaning. This would not be a killer if they weren't so relatively expensive. I'm sure it can't have cost the producers even a dollar for these. Either upgrade quality or downgrade price!

review/summary: I Can't Understand the negative reviews
review/text: I bought two of these, and have been using them for a couple weeks now.  They are well built, they seal nicely, and they work great.  I've been testing them out on various teas - loose chamomile, green tea, I even took some Tazo out of the tea bags and tried it in the Solofill - all tests passed with flying colors.  There isn't much documentation out there for using a Keurig as a tea brewer from loose, but I am extremely pleased withe the results so far - it will press tea from too weak to overly strong depending on grind and amount.  I ground some coffee and tried it in the solo - it was great.  The pressed coffee using Solofill and Keurig tastes superior to the drip-brewed coffee in our Melitta or Krups coffee maker.  A coarser grind on teas and coffees seems to work better, on fine grind the water has trouble pressing through the medium.<br /><br />Cleaning them is quite easy, as long as you don't wait for the grounds to dry overnight inside the Solofill.

review/summary: Low quality
review/text: Although there is a big convenience factor of shopping online and then putting dinners right in the freezer for latter so I gave a two but quality is not great. The burgers are very fatty and the steaks (filets) taste aged due to sitting around too long not part of the aging process for taste and quality. The fish comes out of the bag smelling fishy not fresh. Again all my opinions are based on that I'm used to top shelf very fresh or properly aged meats and fishes. I thought I'd try them and it wasn't horrible just not great. Everything was edible I just felt the need to cook well done.

review/summary: Wonderful traditional Mexican treat!
review/text: I couldn't believe I found the traditional glass jar! I grew up in Mexico, and a few years back, Coronado switched to squeezable bottles. Unfortunately, this means they also thinned the cajeta out to make it "squeezable"... also, plastic bottles just didn't feel the same to me.<br /><br />Now I can't even get the squeezable bottles since I live in the Bay Area, and am ecstatic to have found it!<br /><br />Cajeta is delicious- by the spoonful straight out of the jar, or spread on french bread or the traditional Mexican bolillo (these were always a dessert treat growing up). Also, many make sandwiches out of Cajeta and butter- much the way nutella gets made into a sandwich. Great treat for the kids!

review/summary: Best non-whey non-soy alternative
review/text: Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!

review/summary: Egg Protein Review
review/text: I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.

review/summary: Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
review/text: This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

review/text: I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.

review/summary: This is a great alternative to whey
review/text: I've been a fan of HnF's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion (that being said, the ONLY whey I've found that doesn't bother my stomach at all is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BOTGTM">Optimum Nutrition 100% Platinum Hydro Whey Turbo Chocolate 1.75 Protein</a>).<br /><br />The chocolate tastes pretty good with water (although I don't really care about taste), and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk. It also tastes good in smoothies (I use frozen bananas and rice milk).<br /><br />Only downside is you may get gas initially and you're going to smell things that no human should smell. This passes pretty quickly (huhuh) though.<br /><br />Oh and don't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap. I use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it's still not very good.

I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.

review/summary: It's good once you doctor it up a little bit!
review/text: I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually haven't used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice!

review/summary: The Best Protein Out There
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of "Metabolic" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.

review/summary: Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy
review/text: The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix

review/summary: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.
review/text: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Natural Protein
review/text: Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.

review/summary: TASTE ACTUALLY GOOD LOL, IM SHCOKED
review/text: I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,

review/summary: SEEMS TO CONTAIN SOY?
review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESN'T FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

review/text: So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.

review/summary: Good ingredients, but made my cat sick!
review/text: I really wanted this food to work. I'd heard so many great things about Wellness. First off this is pricey food, so I expect it to live up to what it claims. I started mixing this in with my cat's old food (25/75), and he barely ate from the bowl, and tried to pick around it. When he did eat it, he threw it up after. He has NEVER thrown up food, and rarely gets hairballs, so something is really wrong when he throws up 3 times in 2 days. And to top it off, I weighed him before I started the food and after, and he GAINED weight! Thankfully I bought it at Petco, where you can bring back any food for a full refund.

review/summary: My favorites, Mango tango!!!
review/text: These are my favorite. 3 have like 70 calories. I had them while on the Medifast program and still lost 60 lbs. Now they are a big part of my maintenance plan. I was happy to see that I can buy them separately without having to order the mixed pack. Don't get me wrong, they are all good  but the MANGO TANGO is the best one for me. But I dislike the sour ones, and of course, I got tons of with the mixed pack I ordered before. So even though these cost a little more,  they are a better deal since I don't waste any. Also, with the mixed package (5LB) you never know what you end up getting. I read reviews of people complaining that they got only a few ones of particular flavors and a bunch of others, while in my order I got different amounts that they did. so there is still no consistency in the mixed packages even though they keep saying they are fixing that to make them more even. One particular thing, the last order have one bag with a bunch of empty wrappers, some witht he sticks in them but no lollipop, I reported it to Amazon.

In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!

review/summary: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried, Best Part Of Rudy's Day
review/text: I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, "They are the best part of my day!"  We think so too!  ~ CJ

review/summary: Puppy loves these
review/text: My dog loves these treats. He's really picking with his treats so it says a lot that he loves these. I had been buying him bags of the freeze dried treats at petco, etc. and it was costing a fortune, not to mention they were smashed. These are great quality. You get tons!! in the 14 ounce bucket and my little dog is in love.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Our dog loves this stuff.  Ground up and sprinkled on his dry food he just gobbles it up.  No additives or fillers no carbs. We also use as a treat.  Best price at Amazon and quick delivery.

review/summary: Great training treats!
review/text: Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best dog treats
review/text: I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Pros:<br />Dog will do anything for this treat.<br />Doesn't smell as bad as many other treats.<br />Easy to break into smaller pieces.<br />Nothing artificial, easy digestion.<br /><br />Cons:<br />More costly than other dog treats.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product. While more expensive, my dog will do anything for this treat. He has several phobias, including getting in and out of the car, and walking through doorways, but he ignores all of his fears to get to this treat.

review/summary: Great treats for dogs
review/text: This is a great treat for dogs, but do read the label: dogs of certain sizes can only have so many of these per day. I violated this and my dog got an upset stomach, so I am just giving a heads up. The cost is a bit high for these treats, but you get a lot of you buy the largest tub. My dogs go crazy for them too!

review/summary: Like Candy for Your Dog
review/text: Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.
