review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I sit at a desk all day and usually feel the need for a little sweet snack in the afternoon, but don't want all the calories of "regular" candy so I thought I'd try out these sugar free gummy bears- especially since they are the original (and best!) Haribo brand!  They are DELISH and have all the taste and texture of the originals albeit they are slightly less sweet.  I will take the other reviewers advice though and not eat too many in one sitting!  So far, so good :-))

Then I found these<br />sugarless ones.  Oh Joy!  Now they are a little bit chewier but no less tasty or fun.<br />And my kids who didn't know they were sugarless had no problem with them either judging<br />by how much of them were eaten.  I have almost finished the 1st 5lb bag and am ready<br />for the next one, they keep quite a well if stored properly.  Go ahead and enjoy.

review/summary: The best Gummy Bears Ever
review/text: As far as the product is concerned, it has the greatest taste and well worth the money.  However the reason for the low rating is that you can only buy the sugar free Bears in a 5 pound bag.  It is a lot of product for on person to eat and if you are trying to watch calories it is hard when you have a bag of these great Haribo Gummy bears.  I have been eating them for decates at the flavor is just as great as the regular Bears.

review/summary: Gastrointestinal Armageddon
review/text: When I got these, I couldn't contain my excitement and I ate about a quarter of a bag.  Scenes from the movie 2012 could have been filmed inside my gut.  There would have been less pressure to make two winning free throws in the NBA finals than for gas to escape my bowels.  After a few hours, I had an EXTREME build-up of gas with no relief.  All I could do was lie on my bed and pray for a fart.  That might sound funny, but when you've eaten something that has basically turned you into the blueberry girl from Willy Wonka, you're pleading for relief.  Well, the farts came and I lived through it but I not only had a visit from the fart fairy, but the sales rep from Montezuma's Revenge stopped by and gave me a FULL demo of their services as well.<br /><br />In retrospect, eating over a pound all at once wasn't the brightest thing I've done (but it also wasn't the dimmest).  If I go back and finish the bag off, I'll probably leave a suicide note.

review/summary: Very close to the real thing.
review/text: I lived in Germany and have consumed my share of gummi bears. :)  These sugar free bears are very good.  This type of candy suits itself to sugar free treatment.  Much like hard candy.  You don't get the big taste difference like you do with lots of the chocolate sugar free treats.<br /><br />A word on some of the reviews listed here on Amazon... Sugar Free candies are not meant to be eaten by the handfull.  Sugar Free is mostly made for people that can't process the Sugar and people that are in this category have all learned from experience, you don't eat Sugar Free sweets in any large amount.<br /><br />I have a mild case of Type II which I am gratefully able to control by diet alone and can tell you personally that these candies are very good if you are in a Gummi mood.  The affect on my blood sugar is typical of this sort of treat.  Just as I wouldn't eat 50 carbs of anything, a snack of this type is only around 10 bears.<br /><br />People living with health issues concerning Blood Sugar understand the requirement.  Those just looking to cut carbs or lose a bit of weight may want to re-think eating most sugar free treats and look into other type of sweets to satisfy.

review/text: I bought 10lbs of these bears while I was doing the "Atkins thing"... and I found the same gastric issues that others experienced.  However, we like to keep them around the office for newbies to experience.  They're so tasty that people will sit at your desk and snarf down a whole bowl full.  We'd warn them not to eat too many, but they'd just nod and keep munching.  The next day they're a believer in moderation.  Apparently we're all masochists as we ate all 10lbs in a month regardless of side-effects.

review/summary: Tasty little buggers, the red ones are the best...
review/text: When I got these in the mail I was quite excited to finally partake in their goodness.  After all, I have had quite the cavity problem over the years and I figured I had to do something to save my dentist the despair that struck over his face every time I walked into his office.<br /><br />Nearly immediately upon receiving them I took the bag with me down to my home theater and ripped them open with a child-like craving.  I popped them in my mouth one by one, careful to roll them around with my tongue and over and back and fro between my gums, lips and tongue.  I relished how soft and plyable they were and the taste was exquisite.  I could not believe that I was experiencing nirvana from a sugar free product.<br /><br />About an hour into the movie however, things started to change and before long, it was as if the gates of he11 opened up in my room.  I could almost swear I saw the hand of Bealzibub himself reaching forth from the depths of a gaping, red fissure that had become of my rectum, claws and all scraping any which way they could to cause pain.  I was doubled over in agony--if the weatherman had come on television that evening I am sure there would have been a flash-mudslide advisory warning issued in my home as that is exactly what had happened.  My guts were on fire.<br /><br />I ended up creating a tar-pit that labrea would have been proud of.  If it were not for my beautiful wife, I could have become quite entombed within my abode and fossilized in the times gone by.  I will say this though, Haribo would _not_ reimburse us for damages to our door when my Wife came home and the brown flood of goop shot out through the narrow slit that she had created by turning the knob, busting it from its hinges into her.<br /><br />These gummy bears are an exquisite deficacy.

review/text: The Haribo Sugarless Gummi Bears I bought (the 5 lb. bag, of course)tasted EXACTLY like the fattening sugar gummi bears they make. I didn't bother looking up Lycasin to see if there were any side effects with this stuff - I would never have thought to do that - there was no warning on the bag stating that within two hours of eating a handful you will be literally RUNNING to the bathroom to expel all of those wonderful things you ate such a short time before. I have been chronically constipated all my life, but BOY this sure cured that problem! There is NO WAY you could go anywhere or do anything with this going on - it is that bad!!!!!  I don't know what to do - I bought two 5 lb. bags for $38 and will know they are sitting in my cupboard waiting for me to "sneak a few" even knowing what they will do to me. The reviews I have just read are SO FREAKING RIGHT - it has been three hours and my stomach still is rolling like I'm on a SHIP FROM HELL!  Seriously, if I were SMART, I would have eaten only a few, not two handfuls the first time to see how I would feel. Who thinks about these things when they need their Gummis??  If I can get the kind of reaction I got with my constipation problem, you can imagine what these will do to ORDINARY people. Handle with EXTREME CARE!!!!

I personally couldn't tell the difference in taste but they are perhaps slightly softer.  My wife says she could sense a small taste difference, but only a very subtle one.<br /><br />The net effect is that if you're cutting back on sugar, be it for weight loss, diabetes, etc. these gummis will cure your craving.<br /><br />Shipping notes: shipping took about 5 or 6 days, arrived in a relatively large box, though the actual bag of gummi bears is only a little larger than your average bag of flour.  They were shipped with a cold pack inside to help prevent melting.

review/summary: A few words of caution
review/text: I gave this two stars only because the shipping was on time and in the end Amazon refunded my money.  First let me say that we eat sugar free candy all the time.  I'm a big fan of nearly any sugar free black licorice! My point in saying this is that we are not unfamilar with the possible known side effects of sugar free candy and some of the artificial sweeteners that are used in them.  I have only ever had an issue with any of them when I over consume them, which most products tell you right on the package not to do so.  These gummy bears however are something very very different from anything we have ever tried, we've even had other brands of sugar free gummy bears without the problems I'm about to describe.  We are a family of five, none of us consume refined sugar, so when we get the craving for candy we opt for sugar free.  Always cautious when trying new sugar free foods all five of us sat down and enjoyed what we believed to be a serving.  Bare in mind there is no serving size on the actual package.  I assumed somewhere between 8-15 gummy bears would be a normal size serving.  We decided to have 15 bears each.  It seemed after about 30 minutes my poor husband reacted first, follwed by each of our children and later myself.  I won't get into all the gory details, but we only have two bathrooms, and if you recall I said five of us ate the gummy bears so I'll let you infer from that what you will, but I think you get the point.  This was a Friday evening, four of us were pretty much back to normal by Saturday morning, but my husband required until late Saturday evening to feel like it was out of his system.  When all was said and done they went up on a shelf for a few days and no one thought much more about them.  Well...a glutton for punishment we tried them again...yes all five of us, as if we didn't know better!  But here was this five pound bag of gummy bears just sitting there and we all wanted something sweet.  We thought that perhaps the issue we had was attributed to having eaten them on an empty stomach the first time around.  NOOOOPE, this time each of us had about 12 gummy bears and 30 minutes later sure enough the results were in...the gummy bears are a no go for this family.  I wondered if maybe the candy had expired, I was unable to find a date on the bag and they were a little harder than I had expected.  I contacted Amazon about a refund, which they did promptly provide and I tossed the gummy bears in the trash.  On a funny side note, my kids now call these things the "diarrhea bears", I mean you have to laugh, we were stupid enough to try them twice!  Also something to know, if you are still brave enough to try these, you might want to know that the first ingredient is Hydrogenated Glugose syrup (Lycasin).  I've never had this before, and since I consider anything "Hydrogenated" to be bad I won't be buying anything like it ever again.

review/summary: Flushed, Diarrhea from Hell, throbbing stomach, lips numb
review/text: These gummies are something that we do not want the radical islam terroist to get there hands on. From what I know now, there are no secrets that would be worth keeping, if they threatned to make me eat the gummies. First my head was on fire and my ears were pulsating. I looked down to see if someone by accident had stuck a brading iron through my stomach. It took so much energy away from me that I crawled to the toilet. This kind of diarrhea made me think of a new invention.... seat belts for the toilet. I had such diarrhea that I was producing thrust. Just as I was about to pass out, the noise from my ringing ears distracted me enough to not pass out and realize that ther was more thrust coming. Just as I thought this was over the finally came with dead lips. Yep my lips went numb like I had a shot of novacane. This was the conclusion and after my wife said she could now see my pupils again and my eyes came back down in alignment. At this point we told the 911 operator that we were going to hold off on the ambulance.<br /><br />T. Williams, an ex gummie bear purchaser.

review/summary: these should NOT even be considered a food..
review/text: getting stabbed in the stomach probably would have been more pleasant than what happened to me a couple hours after eating a handful of these. like others have mentioned, the horrible side effects that come from eating these are due to a synthetic sugr substitute called "lycasin". they may be tasty but you will be in a world of hurt if you eat any more than a few of these gummi bears. i ate some last night and spent half the night experiencing severe gastrointestinal pain which eventually led to gas, diarrhea, and vomiting. i've seriously never been in more pain in my entire life..and as a result, have had to spend the entire day in bed, still feeling dizzy, with mild stomach pain and unable to keep down anything except water. basically, if you want to induce flu-like effects and spend at least 6 hours in excruciating pain, eat these with reckless abandon.

review/text: Be forewarned! These gummy bears are tasty, but if you eat more than a couple at a time, you will get a bad tummy ache and diarrhea. On top of that, there are no nutritional information available, so who knows whether they are actually completely sugar free, and I also wonder about the carbohydrate content. Even my friend who is diabetic would not eat them because he said he would rather eat nothing than suffer with stomach cramps. I seriously only had a handful, and then about 2 hrs later, I got a terrible stomach ache and diarhea. I ended up throwing away the whole bag! What a waste of money!

review/summary: BEWARE!! Sugarless Gummy Bears Revenge!!
review/text: Should have read the reviews on these Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears before I ordered them. I've always loved the "Haribo" brand, and have purchased the regular ones in nearby retail stores. When I saw these sugarless ones on Amazon, I immediately ordered them thinking that since they were sugarless, they would also be less calories. They arrived yesterday, and after consuming only a few I developed severe abdominal pains within a very short period of time. I had a feeling that the cause was from these gummy bears. It wasn't until I finally read the reviews on this item that my suspicions were confirmed. Since there is a "no return policy", this bag of Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears is headed to the trash. Yes, I have learned my lesson, and that is to read the "reviews" before I purchase a food item. I hope Amazon will read the reviews for this item, and remove it before any more of their customers suffer from the "Gummy Bear's Revenge".

review/summary: What Is Haribo Hiding?
review/text: I bought a package of these gummi bears and was surprised that there was no caloric information, no serving size, no listing of how many carbohydrates, sugars, sugar alcohols, etc. on the label. Being a diabetic, it is very important to have this information. And what happened when I sent emails, TWICE, to Haribo requesting this information? I was ignored both times.<br /><br />So that makes me wonder what Haribo is trying to hide. Why won't they give me the information I have twice requested from this company and which is to the best of my knowledge, REQUIRED on ALL food labels on products sold in the United States.<br /><br />Because of Haribo's refusal to acknowledge my request for this information, I am now very seriously contemplating contacting the FDA to see what they have to say about Haribo's failure to not only put this information on their labels for this product, but for their continued ignoring of my repeated requests.<br /><br />Please, buy this product at your own risk.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I FINALLY received a response from Haribo regarding my request for the nutritional info. Took two months. I'm guessing that someone from the company saw my remarks and decided to cover themselves. At any rate, I was going to post the nutritional info in my post to help anyone else looking for this information, but I see that Haribo has already done this since I see that there's now a nutritional link provided. It shouldn't have taken an angry email and posting here to get the information we need posted, but at least it's posted now, and you all can be better informed when making the decision as to whether or not you wish to purchase this product.<br /><br />Btw, according to their nutritional info, a serving size is 17 bears. As many of you have already posted, eating that many has caused gassiness amongst other issues, so if I were you, I'd adjust your serving size to suit your personal needs accordingly. Especially if you are watching your calories since 17 bears = 160 calories.<br /><br />Good luck everyone!

review/summary: sugar free but requires moderation w/5lb bag, hard
review/text: I love these. They require a good deal of chewing thus gives you an opportunity to enjoy the sweetness longer. I can have 10-15/day but not at once. 3-5 at a time max (respectively without food-with food I can tolerate more), separated by at least 4 hours. These are great. I am on atkins and my ketones (stay) are unaffected. I also have a glucose monitor for trying out new sugar substitute products and these gummy bears have no affect.Receiving a 5lb bag of these requires one to use or quickly learn self-restraint. If not you will be in horrendous abdominal pain with bloating, flatulance & perhaps diarhea like some of the one star posters. I was forewarned by other reviewers and bought them anyway. I will surely buy these again once they run out in a few months. I don't feel deprived and I feel in control of what I do or don't put in my body.

review/summary: Sugar Free Bears
review/text: They are exactly what I've been looking for. Ever since I found them at whole foods in the Bulk Food area I've loved them. The whole foods by me stopped carrying them so I searched on Amazon and found them.<br /><br />These bears do taste exactly the same as regular gummy bears.  Most people who try them can't tell the difference, but after a while you will start being able to taste the artificial sweetener. Given enough times between "servings" you'll never tell.<br /><br />Now mind you this is not a "oh since it sugar free I can eat as much as I want"  item. This requires moderation. The artificial sweeteners in any diet or sugar free item will usually make people sick, with either runs or gas.  Except for very few people, you have to control how much you eat of this or you will get sick.<br /><br />This food is mainly for diabetics and people who can't have sugar in their diet. They usually control how much they eat of these types of items anyway. Otherwise if you can control how much you're eating at one time and not just using it as a replacement for Regular gummy bears, so you can eat more, this is an excellent item.<br /><br />And yes since this is Haribo they will have the extra stiffness most people have come to love about this particular gummy company.

review/text: Oh man...words cannot express what happened to me after eating these.  The Gummi Bear "Cleanse". If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy.  If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!<br /><br />First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5.  So good.  Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.<br /><br />BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose.  I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined.  Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare.  I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.<br /><br />Then came the, uh, flatulence.  Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited.  I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.<br /><br />But wait; there's more.  What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw.  I swear my sphincters were screaming.  It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste.  100% liquid.  Flammable liquid.  NAPALM.  It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.<br /><br />AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.<br /><br />I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day.  There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.<br /><br />I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.<br /><br />Silly woman.  All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened.  I think she was crying.<br /><br />Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating.  She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left.  She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc.  Lots of people who general have limited access to toilets on a given day.  I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day.  I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.<br /><br />If you order these, best of luck to you.  And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks.

Think again...<br /><br />This deceptive little gummi bear looks and tastes amazing. The flavor bursts in your mouth and you can't believe that this delicious treat could be sugar and fat free! Guess what: it's not. Lycasin has only a 20-30% lower glycemic index than sugar, not 0, like they lead you to believe. But you won't know this as you eat one after another of these tasty little fruity guys... A few handfuls later (maybe more...) you may notice your tummy rumbling. But these taste so good you may just keep snacking away. Even if you don't, it may be too late. Within an hour you are going to experience the WORST stomach pain you've ever experienced. Cramping. Gas. Nausea. Bloating. Diarrhea. Heartburn. Sharp, stabbing pains... Tight, twisting pains...<br /><br />When something seems too good to be true it probably is. I ended up throwing 4 pounds of this 5 pound bag into the trash. I bet you will do the same if you make the mistake of buying it. I'm sticking to Good Ol' Fruit as a sweet treat from now on...

I was wondering if anyone knows how many sugar alcohols and how many net carbs are in this product? Does your body process all 160 calories and 37 grams of carbohydates that are in the product, or are you able to eliminate some of the carbohydrates from your daily carb intake (as you would do with fiber since its undigestible?)

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: These taste exactly like the real thing.  Anyone with experience with these types of products understands like anything you are not used to, start in moderation.  I dont care what it is, if you sit down and eat a ton of something you dont usually eat, you're going to have problems.  Start with just a few and work your way up to more.  The reality is you probably shouldn't sit down and eat a 100 of these like someone in a post said they did.<br /><br />Bottom line, taste great, wont spike your blood sugar, just start out with a few until your body adjusts to them.

review/text: These are the real deal.  I was blown away that these tasted EXACTLY like the Haribos with sugar.  They smelled the same, tasted the same, had the same amazing texture, colors, the whole works.  They are amazing.  I've wanted to try them for years, and I'm so glad I finally did.  Oh yes, they'll send you to the outhouse all right, but I'll stuff one too many handfuls of these in my mouth any day!  Rock on Haribo!

review/summary: Don't eat more then a handful- But tasty!
review/text: So like others I bought these without reading the reviews. I had a couple handfuls and paid for it as 6 hours later had the worse gas ever. They taste really good, but I ate too many of them ( even though 2 handfuls shouldn't be that much ) So now I eat in moderation, about 10 at a time, and I am ok.. But I won't buy them again- The side effects aren't worth it!

review/summary: horrible
review/text: Actually no stars. Very good price for 5 pounds, but that's where the good news stops. The taste just sucks. Not sweet at all, more like sour but not a very strong flavor, just weak. The sugar free gummi bears from Jelly Belly (no, I'm not a corporate wanker) cost considerably more but taste much better. Total waste of my money, went directly into the trash. Just saying.........

review/summary: Tastes just like the real thing
review/text: These are FANTASTIC for people who can't eat sugar, i.e. diabetics.  If you've scoured the globe looking for a sugar-free snack that doesn't have that "fake sugar" flavour, your search has ended!<br /><br />I am a HUGE Haribo fan.  Before they were widely available in the US, I had a friend in Germany send me Haribo candies all the time.  My biggest fear was that these would not live up to expectations.  I was relieved to find that I can barely tell any difference.<br /><br />One word of caution that has been mentioned by several reviewers: You cannot eat these in large quantities.  THIS GOES FOR JUST ABOUT ALL SUGAR FREE CANDIES!!!  Stomach discomfort, flatulence/gas and diarrhea are all well-known side effects of most sugar-free candy, so it is not wise to eat more than a dozen or so pieces at most.

You will need to do this before binging, if you stop consumption of the substance then binge again the bears will make a cheap date of you and your sure to be held hostage in the bathroom.

review/summary: Cute bears, evil results.
review/text: Finally after many years searching for a good tasting sugar free gummy bear, I was so excited to see that Haribo made a sugar free product. At first I was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews, but I thought if I didn't eat as much a gastric reaction wouldn't be an issue. Boy was I wrong!<br />Sure, they taste great, wouldn't have a clue if I was eating the sugar free or the regular version. That's what got me into trouble. I couldn't help but going back for more and more and sure enough after 2 hours had passed I was on the toilet from 12pm til 9pm! But that's my fault since I had issues with portion control. I'm not sure if I will buy again. It's been 2 weeks now since I bought the candy and I still haven't touched the bag after that dreaded day. If you do plan on buying these tasty evil bears make sure you have no errands to run that day. Stay home, you'll regret it if you don't.

review/summary: Lancaster PA, Gummi Bear Alternative - Healthy!
review/text: I will tell you that this is the best thing in the world for those of us who have to eat a low fat and sugar free diet.<br />I have shared them with my friends and they admit that these taste like regular gummi bears.<br />I have ordered these for my friends as well and they are loving them as much as I am.<br />There is only one downfall to these - there is an ingredient in them that causes gas in many people - and if you do not know this before hand and eat them, you will wonder what is wrong that you are having gas pain, and everytime you think you need to use the restroom all that comes out is a huge thing of air.  So if you purchase these you need to be aware of this in advance.  They are very good and I highly recommend them - do not eat a ton of them though, because of the gas.  If you have had gastric bypass surgery this is definitely one of those things you need to be aware of.

It also has food coloring in it, that is banned in most European states, like Germany.  The rest of it is Gelatin, which is made out of grind up bones.  Further the product made in Austria, arrived wet and smelly.  Terrible.  This is a very misleading product, chances are it is cancer causing and definetely bad for your teeth, diet or moods.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I love this product. Works better than anything else I have tried. I did figure out that if you eat 50 at a time you better have some petroleum jelly by the toilet because your rear end will be on fire. If you eat only 20 every other day, this product will work better than any laxative without the "fire in the hole" or "farts that could wake the dead" experience. Don't order during the summer though, I was very disappointed when I ordered mine the first of August only to find out when they arrived that some of them were melted into one big "blob". I mean do you count that as 1 gummy bear or try to pull them all apart and see how many are really there?  Also, I was visiting a friend when mine arrived at her house, so this will definitely test your friendship. I will say her husband didn't find them nearly as hilarious as we did.  Thank goodness they had 3 bathrooms or a disaster could have been made. I think I even offended the cats to some degree. These would make a great gift if you have a friend or loved one who can't seem to go to the bathroom without help. Or if you have someone you don't like, you could always send them a bag and not tell them about the "side effects".

review/text: I am a huge Haribo brand gummy bear fan which is why I decided to go for the sugar-free variety to curb the sweet tooth and control the quantity. Anyone who has experienced the reaction to sugar alcohols knows what happens when you consume too much... this is not a reason to rank the product low. The texture is the same hard bite you get with the sugared variety, and the bears are clear just like the originals. Now for the taste... I could detect a very subtle aftertaste, but other than that they are exactly like the originals. I wouldn't know which bears were sugar-free if I was given both. These are a fantastic alternative to the sugar variety, but if you plan to eat your gummy bears by the handful, these are not for you... now if only I could find sugar free gummy cola's I would be set!

review/summary: Looking for a better way to relieve chronic constipation?
review/text: I have a severe shoulder injury that cannot be improved with surgery or physical therapy, I have tried.  My doctors have turned to various painkillers instead, these work to a certain degree, but the worst side effect is the constipation.  I can't help being blunt, anyone who has been on opiates for a period of time has probably experienced this.  The Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears can apparently cause diarrhea if you eat more than 15, for example (YMMV).  They are a godsend for me.  They taste great, they are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than all the medications to relieve the constipation I have been given (both prescription and over the counter), and more importantly, they actually work.  I am a normal person if I eat 25 of these in a sitting every day.  I have told my pain doctors about this and they are now recommending this product to all their patients.  They really are yummy, particularly the pineapple ones.

review/summary: Fantastic quality grain free product at good price
review/text: I've done hours and hours of homework on high quality, grain-free dog foods.  From product analysis, kcal analysis, ingredients, customer reviews, professional reviews, company recalls - all of it... I have become a mini-expert in the field.<br /><br />I was pushed into becoming an expert because my yellow Lab kept having seizures and I couldn't figure out the source.  I finally learned it was her food, which was the most expensive store bought brand my local Sams Warehouse carries.  I thought I was giving her the best, it looked fresh and rich, but it turns out it was just absolutely terrible food.  My black Lab also had terrible skin allergies, to the point where I would get a small rash on my skin if he laid next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I had no clue it was because of the food.  But it was!<br /><br />Since having that epiphany and learning so much about dog food, I've always made sure to feed them the highest quality grain free food I can buy.  This Taste of the Wild (TOTW) fits the bill very nicely, and they love it.  Since switching to a grain free diet, the yellow lab has not had any more seizures in over a year, and the black lab has the silkiest coat you've ever seen and his skin allergies are completely gone.<br /><br />They are on 2/3rds dry and 1/3rd wet combination.  Contrary to what I had previously been raised to believe, a wet diet is not bad for dogs but in fact is superior!  I use the combination to save money while providing them the best I can.<br /><br />Before deciding on TOTW, I had also tried Blue Buffalo, Wellness Core, and Orijen.  Briefly: they are all good foods, but my labs were happiest on TOTW and my wallet is also happiest on TOTW.  I also believe TOTW has a better formulation for them and their life style (some of the products, like Orijen, are simply too rich for the average household dog, despite being made of the best ingredients available).<br /><br />Enter TOTW.  The dry food is dark and rich, with no sign of crumbling.  The kibble is a good average size.  The wet food has nice chunks of meat and the right amount of gravy.  I use the wet food as a topper to mix the 2/3rd dry and 1/3rd wet together for their meals.  I use one whole can of wet per meal with my pack, which is convinient so I don't have to store it in the refrigerator - btw, never store canned dog food in the fridge in the original aluminum container!<br /><br />I still wish I could find a less expensive product with the same quality, but in the mean time, TOTW is the best choice for my pack.

Her bowl movements are now perfect (if you can say that about them), twice a day, formed and easy to pick up.<br />One important thing to mention is that this food has lower calories than your regular food, so read the label and find out how many cups or cans you need to give your dog... and adjust if necessary!

review/summary: Sticking to Homemade...
review/text: I purchased Taste of the Wild canned food for my dog who has been fighting a systemic yeast infection for most of a year.  I had gotten him to the point where his fur had grown back and his skin looked healthy through a regimen of probiotics, coconut oil, homemade grain free dog food, and bi-weekly Malaseb baths (thank goodness it came back to market).  My dog ate TotW wetlands for a few days, and then stopped eating it.  So we switched to TotW Pacific Steam.  He ate it a little better.  However, I noticed that his fur started falling out again and he was itching like crazy despite the baths.  So I have gone back to homemade  Chicken, Carrot and Pea dog food.  I'm sure this is a good grain free food, but the starchy potatoes in it must have upset the delicate balance I had achieved.In the week since I stopped feeding TotW canned (I still use the dry), his fur has started growing back and he does not itch as badly.  That, coupled with the fact that my dog just didn't seem to like it, is what has earned three stars.  It might work for you, but it wasn't what I was looking for.  Good luck!

review/text: This is an incredible food, it makes a great snack and can even be a full meal if you throw in a nice bowl of water.  Its like being a bear and eating straight from the stream, its that fresh!  Don't let the chucks throw you thats just the real flavor of wholesome American Salmon.<br /><br />*Seriously though I ordered it for a dog shelter wrecked by the tornados, hope it helped!

review/summary: taste of the wild canned dog food for all lifestages, Pacific stream canine with smoked salmon formula(pack of 12)
review/text: I used the Pacific stream with smoked salmon formula canned with my puppy's diet. He is on taste of the wild high prairie puppy formula with bison and venison. He is going to be a big dog. I vary his diet with the can salmon to add extra flavor to his food and to help the puppy food last longer. I am a believer in the taste of the wild products and will use nothing else on my dog. I mix about 2 tablespoons with his 2 cups of dry dog food in morning and the same in the evening. It still leaves the dog food crunchy. After opening the can, I store it in the fridge with a can top on it that I received in the mail. You could also put it in a sealed container. I do not heat the canned dog food, just mix it cold and he loves it. It also helps the dry dog food to last longer. I also vary the canned dog food to using the taste of the wild duck, lamb, etc. I hope this was helpful. I give this product 5 stars because it has all of the ingredients to give your dog what it needs to have a healthy coat, added nutrition, and for me it helps to stretch my dog food bill. Remember that taste of the wild is a grain free diet and I do not work for these people. I just did a lot of research on my own because I love my puppy.

review/summary: read your ingredients
review/text: This product has an ingredient called sodium tripolyphosphate, which is used to make fish look glossier and fresh, even if it's spoiled and expired.  It is a suspected neurotoxin according to the National Institute for Occupational and Health's Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances.  I would recommend reading more about this ingredient before serving it to your animal in canned pet food.

review/summary: Who would buy cheese from Amazon?
review/text: I LOVE this cheese with a nice quality red wine - but I couldn't get my daughter to buy it due to the price.  Amazon to the rescue!  I ordered it online and she came home from work to find it waiting at her door.  It was fresh and in good condition!  She was inspired to open a bottle of CA red, and discovered for herself why this is one of our favorite indulgences!  It's a great cheese and Amazon delivered on the freshness!

review/summary: A great way to learn about different flavors
review/text: This is a great way of learning about different cheeses, and what there flavors are.<p>Gorgonzola is a stronger cheese, usually used for salads - very tangy with a stronger after taste, something I think everyone can really enjoy in that matter. A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.<p>In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy. It tends to break and crumble less easily, and really stick to bread surfaces better.<p>Both will make you forget about the normal supermarket colby or cheddar. I recommend this sampler highly.

Sampling the generous sized cheese's with a San Francisco sourdough and a glass of fabulous California wine, and never having to leave the comfort of my own home is the best.

review/text: I know I could never possibly afford a plane ticket to any country that may be a featured/sold item for a purchase through igourmet. So the next best possibility to experience this country would be a taste of the authenticity. I have never been disappointed in the quality and selection (cheese and teas). They may argue with my choice of wine (slightly chilled merlot) when I enjoy any luxury. Nevertheless, I ENJOY IT. You should too!

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I am not a cheese expert nor do I claim to be one so this kind of cheese is new to me.  If you are not used to this kind of cheese you might have the same reaction I did and I guess since I am usually getting cheese that's found in the supermarket (like slices of Kraft cheese or a block of cheese) I found this cheese to be an acquired taste.  At 1st I thought the cheese was awful but than I thought about it and the main reason I thought that was since I am not used to the taste it might not be pleasing at 1st.  So I gave it a chance and over a few minutes I had found it to be great tasting and I wanted more and its the same way when someone eats it with me.  Even though when I let someone else taste this cheese they usually have the same reaction I had when I ate it the 1st time and I understand why, so I explain why it probably doesn't cater to their taste.  I have found its taste is still not for everyone so that's why I figure its more acquired if you are used to something else.  I have found any of the cheeses that came to be relatively strong tasting and always leaveing an aftertaste and that is not always a bad thing.  It was a nice way to taste the way different cheeses from different places vary.  Now that I have the taste for gourmet cheese and its grown on me quite a bit I don't know if I can go back to normal supermarket cheese anymore.
