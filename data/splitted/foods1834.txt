review/summary: The most addictive hot sauce there is
review/text: What's in this stuff? I'm not a hot sauce fanatic, and I don't even like overly spicy food, but this stuff is positively addictive. There is a sweet component to it, and a garlicky component that makes this more than just plain tabasco or hot sauce.<br /><br />I particularly like it on sliced avocado, scrambled egg or fried egg, and on stir fries, especially plainer ones with tofu and veg. It's also absolutely delectable on shrimp as a cocktail sauce mixed with ketchup, or on fish in general.  When we go out for Vietnamese pho (a broth with rice noodles, bean sprouts and various meats and garnishes) we squirt in a good lashing of this sauce to liven up the broth.<br /><br />I even saw a "pyramid" of food groups cartoon, with sriracha sauce squirted all over the pyramid, and I can only agree with the sentiment. There's practically no food, save chocolate ice cream, that isn't improved by a dash of this.

review/summary: Huy Fong means Death By Hot Sauce!
review/text: My son got me started on this stuff as he and I always loved hot sauce when he was growing up.  This stuff is great on just about anything and I love it.  We all make ribs with a family cooking process where the meat just falls off the bone.  This sauce just makes them taste perfect.<br /><br />We haven't found anything that this sauce doesn't go good with and we use it all the time. I like it in bean soup, chicken wings, Chinese food and even Mexican food. You can even mix it up in mayonnaise for a hot dipping sauce that is creamy.<br /><br />This is our favorite real hot sauce and it doesn't have the overpowering taste of vinegar as some do.  I like to mix it with other sauces and spice up our meals and barbequing.  This is the best and you will love it if you love hot spicy food!

review/text: I remember growing up and my mom would buy this from the Oriental Store. I loved this item then and I love it now. I'm glad I found this on Amazon. It was delivered quick and packaged properly. It will last me a while because you just need a few squirts if you're adding to dishes flavor. It's very hot and spicy. You can definitely taste the garlic in here. But I love it and would buy this again once it's gone. It does kick up the taste in food.

review/summary: If it's edible, this hot sauce belongs on it!
review/text: Excellent quality and depth of flavor.  Add flavor and spice to any food without loosing the food's original taste.  Unlike other hot sauces vinegar is not the main flavor.  Add to real Mayo with a little onion juice and a pinch of chili powder for a great "southwest sauce".  Add with equal amounts of balsamic vinegar (instead of oil) for an excellent glaze that goes with any healthy dipping food or sandwich.<br /><br />Tips: 1) the more red the chili sauce the hotter, the more orange is a little less hot.  2) leave the screw cap in open position all of the time, otherwise the temperature change when going from the frig to room temp can cause a tiny amount of sauce to spray out when you open the nozzle and small amounts to ooze from the cap.  3) another user had a good suggestion by buying the smaller bottles to always ensure the freshest product.

review/summary: Adds Flavor and Heat.
review/text: This is the first food product I ever purchased on Amazon.com.  The item came sealed and in perfect shape - I would have not accepted anything else.  I bought the 28oz bottle for $6.50.  I add this to soups and Chinese dishes which are just not spicy/hot enough.  This product is a little sweet, has a strong garlic flavor, has a vibrant and natural red color, but needs to be tasted to be judged - Taste is ultimately subjective.  Look at the ingredient list to get a better idea of what this product may taste like to you.  One of the real benefits:  You can add a little to a lot of food and still enjoy its taste.  One can use this as a dipping sauce, because its consistency is not watery - Before using, make sure to shake it a little.  I bought this around a week and a half before writing this review and the product's expiration date is in 2013.

I was amazed to find it here on Amazon. It was the first time I discovered food was available on Amazon too. I just thought... "Gosh! I am never leaving my house!". I couldn't find it in any supermarket in my neighborhood so I am very delighted.

review/summary: Walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha
review/text: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />There are many sellers offering sriracha on Amazon.com. I recommend you compare the shipping charges of each. You can save by buying in quantity (and sharing with friends and relatives). Many supermarket chains are now carrying sriracha for $5 or less per bottle, again depending on the size.<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/text: I think the first time I had this was served by a Hot Dog vendor on the street in Crystal City, Virginia. It was so good I asked him for the name of the sauce and wrote it down. I have had trouble locating it from time to time in the local grocery and Asian food stores so I am happy to see Amazon carrying it. Great for anything you want to add some spicy heat on. My favorite for adding to any Asian or American meat dish, fish, chili, spaghetti, and many other things. If the top of your head isn't sweating a little it just isn't helping your immune system. Just tell any restaurant that you want the hot sauce with the rooster on the bottle with the green top.<br /><br />CA Luster

review/summary: Not as hot as I feared and quite tasty!
review/text: For years I'd seen what I jokingly called the "screaming chicken" hot sauce out at various restaurants, but I was always too intimidated to try it, even though I love hot sauce.  The mostly non-English labeling and contents made me think it was probably wicked hot. As with so many things I was put off by, I'm kicking myself now that I've tried it, as Sriracha sauce isn't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes.  Truthfully it's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium (Tabasco is the next level up).  As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco, yet blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering. As I've learned, if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample, but don't live in fear of hot sauces.  Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it's a known quality and consistent, unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants (believe me...I've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT).  And certainly don't be intimidated by the "screaming chicken"; it might well become your new friend!

review/text: Screw hot sauce, I put THIS stuff on everything! Add it to chicken, rice, beef, pasta, your shoe, or ANYTHING you're cooking to add flavorful spice. Hot sauce is alright, but it's actually kind of bland compared to sriracha. Hot sauce is watery spice and vinegar, sriracha is condensed chili, garlic, and other flavorful additions. In my mind, there's no comparison.

review/text: I first discovered Huy Fong's sriracha hot sauce at a local restaurant and I love the flavor and spice it adds to soups, noodles, meat or vegetarian dishes, sandwiches and nearly anything. Sriracha hot chili sauce is a good balance between hot and too-hot; this does not ruin but enhances the taste of food. My one complaint is the salty taste it leaves; salt is the third ingredient in the sauce and it is overused. Still, this is a reasonably priced condiment worth trying.

review/summary: Asian Hot Sauce Win
review/text: I had a roommate in college who practically drank this stuff. Our cupboards were constantly filled with the stuff. His daily ritual was to eat it with white rice and plain tofu after class every day. After a few months I got curious and wanted to try his "bread and butter" myself.<br /><br />The Huy Fong Sriracha sauce gave life to a pairing that I always considered drab and lifeless. I'm not much for spicy foods, but I thought it still delivered a nice kick- not overbearing but your mouth is definitely feeling the spice. While maybe not good before a date, the strong garlic flavor in the sauce is nicely balanced with the hot peppers. For a simple hot sauce, it's surprising versatile. I put it on all sorts of stuff now: pizza, pasta, and even steaks just to name a few.<br /><br />I now follow in the footsteps of my college roommate- I keep a bottle of this stuff in my cupboards at all time.

review/summary: The other great mild hot sauce
review/text: This is a great tasting mild hot sauce.  While it is milder than Tabasco sauce, or Cholula's hot sauce, Sriracha tastes a bit hotter because it is thicker, making it a perfect candidate to put on a sandwich or burger.  I tried this for the first time on a chicken sandwich a few days ago -- the sandwich was aleady great and the "Rooster Sauce" complimented the sandwich perfectly.  I have not tried it on seafood but the hot sauce was actually created with seafood in mind -- it does seem like it would be a viable alternative to cocktail sauce!<br /><br />I generally prefer much hotter hot sauces, but there is no denying this is a great tasting hot sauce and is perfect for lunch sandwiches.

There's an initial garlic note, followed by a curious sweetness and then the wonderful, wonderful burn of chili peppers. It's as complete a hot sauce as you're likely to find. I recommend trying it on the tip of your finger first, and on its own as a condiment before mixing it into other sauces. It serves every purpose well, and is the only everyday hot sauce I'll need.<br /><br />Those who appreciate spicy food will find this sauce to be something of a culinary religious experience.

review/summary: Rooster Sauce...
review/text: As you can probably tell from the other reviews, this stuff is the new ketchup. It's popping up in restaurants and other venues, and for good reason: its tastes amazing! I can take really hot stuff, but this sauce isn't about killing your taste buds (or killing you). Instead, it lets you actually experience the flavor of the chilis front and center, while also complementing it with a strong garlic taste. I love to put this on hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as ramen noodles. Of course, feel free to experiment, I still experiment putting this on anything and everything if I think it might taste good.<br /><br />Believe it or not this sauce is made in America, despite its non-American-looking bottle. Its also as a pretty simple ingredient list that doesn't make you cringe when you look at it. I would recommend buying this (the 28oz bottle) as it is a much better deal than buying the smaller (17oz) one.

review/text: I first knew about it when I started working in a neighborhood that had a number of Vietnamese restaurants.  It's kept on the table like soy sauce or salt and pepper.  I was hooked.  Not only do I use it as a condiment at the table, I'll use it when I'm making spaghetti sauce, or chili, and it's great to kick up mayo for sandwich spreads, and potato and pasta salads.  It's fantastic and I consider it a staple around my house.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended
review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />CFH

review/text: You see this hot sauce very popular at most oriental restaurants. Not only because of the low price but because of its terrific flavor. You get 28oz (compare that with the skinny tabasco bottle) of hot spice that will last for a very long time. Great especially for soup lovers who want to spike it up a notch. Also good with your pizzas, burritos, nachos, ... and more.

review/summary: A Potent Hot Sauce - it should be in every kitchen. Far better than Tabasco. The 28oz is only a few cents more
review/text: This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note

review/text: I got a big bottle of this, and ended up bringing it to work to let everyone else eat it for me.  It just tastes too sweet for me.  It is great on some things (I liked it on popcorn) but there are other hot sauces out there that have good heat without the sweet flavor.  For someone that likes the sweet flavor, it would be a great hot sauce, but for me, I couldn't get past the sweetness.

review/text: This is an ok hot sauce. I read the ingredients and thought it would add a bit of sweet to help balance the hotness. First ingredient is peppers. Ok, great. It's what I expected. Second ingredient is sugar. Ahhhh, that's good, too. The problem? There is no sweetness at all. I was hoping for a really nice blend of the two but it just isn't here. Don't believe I'll be buying this again. But, as a 'disclaimer', it IS hot sauce so I really like that part. If you just like it hot, you'll love this. Product was shipped in a very timely manner and I would use this vendor again for other things.

Even with shipping they are still the cheapest. I oredered 3 bottles and shipping was only $18.84. The next closest deal was almost $25. So if your a spice, or Hot sauce Connoisseur like myself, and want a great deal, then go to Buy Asian Foods. I am not in any way affiliated with any stores, or online sales. I live in the Midwest, and came across the 28oz bottles at a new Asian Restaurant that opened locally. Before I seen them, I could only find the 17oz bottles for $2.64 a piece. If your looking for a great deal, I have shown you the way

review/summary: The Legend of Sriracha
review/text: Tuong ot Sriracha, Tyrant of the Ancient World, was born before civilization as the offspring of an ordinary chicken raped by a fire-breathing Tyranasaurus Rex.  Through study of the occult and dark magics now forgotten he extended his life unnaturally to become practically immortal.  Terrorizing the ancient villagers was not enough - he formed a cult of horrid worshipers whose tounges had to be cut out so that they could drink of his blood and gain some of his power.<br /><br />Sriracha was challenged by Atlanta, the Water Serpent of the West, and defeated in a battle lasting three hundred years and ending on Cinqo de Mayo.  On his death he dissolved into a giant bowl of tasty, yet spicy chile paste which was gathered by his followers and put into a temple in the Himalayas to be guarded for his return.  It is to this day bottled by the Tongueless Monks of Tuong Ot and shipped to the uninitiated so that his soul can be spread out among the world to effect his return.<br /><br />Last night, Sriracha was reborn into the world.  At 3:00am, my stomach weakened by ibuprofen taken to prevent a headache, Sriracha found new life in the pits of my bowl.  A horriible pain - his unholiness pecking through my gastric wall no doubt - jolted me awake.  I finally passed out, probably from blood loss.  When I awoke a single stream of red substance was trickling down my nose.  Blood?  No.  Sriracha sauce.  His unholiness has returned to the world.<br /><br />Some facts about Sriracha<br /><br />- The bottle has instructiosn for reading an upright chest film for signs of bowel perforation<br />- His favorite saying is "Pa-caw!"<br />- It is good on any food, including ice cream - though it will melt a bowl of ice cream just by sitting the bottle in the same room with it.<br />- Those who eat Sriracha's unholy paste have to relive the pain of Sriracha's death until the next time they take a dump

A day?  A week since I've had my beloved Huy Fong sriracha sauce...?  I don't know - time is irrelevant when your Jack is gone.  And in my case, there is only one Jack.  "The Rach."<br /><br />It was Visitor Day.  I'd been two months Rach-free (RF) and was looking forward to seeing people again - real people, not the sanitized, medicated zombies in the Ward... the stupified, insipid drones and their robotic dips of french fries into the sugared slick called "Ketchup."<br /><br />"Good enough..." the nurses would say.  "Remember, the taste is good enough..."  and nod in prescribed approval at our "progress."<br /><br />I hated the tastelessness of it all.  But what had my yearning gotten me so far?

Did it...<br /><br />(lightning flash, thunder - the sound of roaring rain, the gutteral humphs of bloodhounds)<br /><br />Time stretched and distorted - the space between the bottle and my reflexive snatch disappeared as if my arm had become the tongue of a chameleon; my hand the sticky  mass, the 28oz bottle of Rach in her coat, the prey...the food...the LIFE...<br /><br />SNAP!<br /><br />Foul, foul temptress...she'd removed the silver seal! But could I care!?  No.  At the moment, the deed was no betrayal of my Rach Sobriety but an act of glorious courtesy, saving myself the precious milisecond that it would have required to remove it before twisting the nozzle, dispensing the red SOUL onto my hamburger patty in a fantastic, psychedelic *splurrrrrrrtppplp!*<br /><br />Mwwwahhhhaaaaa...I shuddered in ecstasy, the wonderful aroma of rich, sensuous, spicy, sweet, delicious, holy Huy Fong Sriracha sauce filled my nostrils as Life itself fills the lungs of a submerged man breaking the surface of water, sucking in breath....<br /><br />Two bites and the cheeseburger was devoured...Rach spread across my face in a Joker-like grin, sprayed across my hospital whites, the result of a gruesome orgy of deliciousness...<br /><br />The alarm sounded like a WW2 air raid klaxon - "Flavor in Ward C!  Flavor in Ward C!"<br /><br />"QUick!  I've left the window open!"  She pointed to..well, one of the windows that was open and with 28oz Huy Fong Sriracha bottle in hand, made my break - landing in a spray of glass (in my haste, I jumped through the wrong window) and ripping of cheap nylon screen.<br /><br />How did I traverse the 100 feet to the fence?  How did I scale the concertina wired confines?  I have no idea.  It's all a blur.<br /><br />So.  Why the One Star (I keep giving Sriracha One-Star and people are starting to get a clue why)?<br /><br />28oz is lame!  It's just not enough!!<br /><br />I'm thinking a 3gallon bag...and a Camelback(tm) pack... this...this...28oz for the worlds most fantastically zesty and (it should be obvious by now) ADDICTING condiments?!?!<br /><br />More, please.

review/summary: Dilmah Premium is fantastic; not "individually foil-wrapped," though
review/text: Like many of the reviewers here, I discovered Dilmah while traveling (in Bali, actually), and fell in love. It makes a perfect "proper" tea, like the ones my good friends from the UK and NZ make when I'm there. And if you visit Dilmah's website, you will see that it is an amazing company as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for years here in the US, Dilmah was not available (though once I was lucky enough to find it in a market in Canada). How delightful to discover it here on Amazon the other day! I ordered this two-box package for a great price, just in time for our Thanksgiving holiday.<br /><br />I am gratefully enjoying Dilmah again; however, I was a bit disappointed to find that these were not "individually foil-wrapped," as advertised. I was hoping for those same tea packets I had experienced in Bali, which are individually sealed and keep the tea superbly fresh. (It does matter! Plus it's more portable that way.) Alas, these are standard paper-wrapped bags, and the product description should really be changed to reflect that. Otherwise, this would be a 5-star review. Go, Dilmah! :-)

It's as if someone emptied the inside of a solid Hershey's bar and filled it with an aerated chocolate that also tasted like a Hershey's bar.<br /><br />It's good, don't get me wrong.  If you're looking for a Choco-lite experience, it will do in a pinch, but it's not the same to me.

review/summary: Nothing special IMO
review/text: I was expecting something more from this since everyone raves about aerated chocolate. Really, it tastes exactly the same as regular Hershey's. It's just... lighter, I guess. Not as rich tasting. Sorry to all the aired chocolate fans, but I  wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: Better? Worse? Or about the same?
review/text: I've lived my entire life within 100 miles of Hershey, PA, so when I think of chocolate, I think of Hershey and the unique cocoa-y taste that only Hershey's has. However, the only flake or aerated chocolate I've ever had has been European, which of course tastes much different. It was a surprising combination to have this taste exactly like Hershey's but be a totally different texture. I can't say I liked it any better or worse than a standard Hershey bar. It's just different. I'm certainly not going to seek it out or pay more for it.

review/summary: Hershey's is selling AIR.
review/text: Sorry to be the ugly duckling in this little get together and it's good to hear the others seem to really like the taste of this particular candy bar but I just can't get beyond the fact that they are pumping this thing chock full of air and promoting it as all things well and good. To me, it doesn't matter if it tastes good or not, it's 50% (or more?) air.  And last I heard air is supposed to be free. This is a deal breaker for me , I've got no problem spending my money on candy, even other Hershey's products, just not on this one.

review/text: These taste so cheap, like dollar store groceries.  They have a really wierd salty taste in the yogurt that, instead of balancing the sweetness of the raisins, actually tastes just like salt.  Don't like them at all, especially for the fat content.  There are 6g of fat in each 1/4 cup.  That means that this little bag has 24 g of fat!  That's more than a small bag of baked chips!  definitely do not recommend.  Wish I didn't have 11 more bags.

Of course, I didn't know there would be such a difference in taste until I bought these in bulk and tasted them. So I'm giving them out to people and forcing myself to eat what I have. My recommendation would be to not buy these in bulk unless you are for sure you like the way this brand tastes.

review/text: I thought I would try these since the price was great compared to the cost for THE name brand in the supermarket.  However, I did not find the taste as good as the major supermarket brand.  The other thing is the supermarket brand packaging has a built in re-sealing mechanism which considering the calorie count on these things, it is best not to eat an entire bag at once.

review/text: This product is very unappealing to look at. These sweets are cut so thin , that they look cheap.Sugar is the compensating ingredient for lacking chemicals and preservatives.I was excited to order this product with FREE shipping and minimal ingredients but eventually disappointed because of overly sweet taste. The diamond shape cut of the sweets is very thin to the point that it screams " I am a cheap product" in price and quality. They can get mine and a lot more new business if they pay attention to the importance of product presentation, thicker cut , and product taste, reduced sugar usage. On the positive side , product was shipped in a styrofoam box with cold packs and shipping speed was lightning fast.

review/text: I was first introduced to Aloha Shoyu when I lived in Hawai'i, and it was a revelation. Up until that point, most of the soy sauce I had tried was all salt, no flavour. Aloha has only a subtle salt flavour, a base for the rich umami flavour of soy and spices. It really adds a wonderful flavour to any dish that requires shoyu. If you haven't tried it before, do give it a chance, you won't regret it.

review/text: My siblings and I grew up eating Saladitos.  When we moved away from Arizona we couldn't find them anywhere. The product arrived fast and was very fresh. The thing I like most about this product is that there are only 3 per bag. They stay fresher this way because you don't have one huge bag open and drying out. Since there are 24 bags I kept 12 and mailed 12 to my sister. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the salty treat but doesn't eat them very fast. The 12 bags I kept will last me several months. If you like Saladitos you should also try Limon Salt.

review/summary: One happy Buddy boy..........
review/text: Our mix-breed rescue dog had obviously been through a lot. 3 years of repeated & chronic ear infections (per the few records we were able to find) & itchy, red inflammed (no fleas) skin. His poor teeth are ground down to the nub, with two of the incisors broken off halfway. We were glad he has found a forever home with us!<br /><br />After we paid for two expensive vet visits, two rounds of prescription antibiotics and ear drops, I knew we had to find a permanent solution, or Buddy might not get to stay with us. I read online that many pet foods (including Science Diet and other "higher grade" type of pet food) have large amounts of corn, meal, or other grains as the primary ingredient........often causing some of the symptoms poor Buddy was having.<br /><br />One of the brands that was highly recommended instead was the Halo brand. He tried it, and within 3 days, Buddy's skin had become a normal color, and he was no longer biting his red, itchy belly or elsewhere. He was finishing up the second round of antibiotics & ear drops, so we wondered if it was the food or the consistent care?<br /><br />There are chunks of vegetables (I've seen potato, carrots, green beans......) in the canned food. I haven't seen any stems, but if I were dissatisfied with any of the foods, I would return them to the place I bought them for a refund. I took back a couple bags of food that were half used (after our rescue cats were deemed to have urinary crystals & needed prescription diets) and PETCO gladly refunded me the full amount.<br /><br />It's been over a year now, and sweet Buddy has had no ear infections. We love Halo pet food, and for us - it has been well worth the price.  Two expensive vet visits would pay for a year's worth of this food!<br /><br />Now - if only both my rescue cats health issues could be so easily (and cheaply) solved!  (Halo doesn't make a food that would help them).

review/summary: Awesome Taste, Great Aroma!
review/text: When I first got my Keurig brewing machine, I was a little skeptical about the quality of coffee any K-Cup could provide. After making a cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee using a K-Cup from a sample pack, I now stand corrected! Gloria Jean's makes great coffee to begin with and their Hazelnut coffee in K-Cup form is fantastic.<br /><br />The coffee gives off a wonderful Hazelnut aroma while it's brewing and it tastes great! It's the kind of aroma and taste you'd expect after grinding the beans yourself, but the K-Cup saves you the hassle. In the time that I've owned a Keurig brewer, this is hands-down one of the best coffees I've tried, and I'll definitely be ordering it again.<br /><br />My only complaint is in the packaging, but since it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the coffee, I can't rate it less than five stars. Just wish this 50-pack came in a differently-sized/designed box so it would store more easily in a kitchen cabinet.

review/summary: Gloria Jeans Hazelnut K cups
review/text: I absolutely love this k cup coffee,i've tried quite a few k cup flavors and always return to Gloria Jeans Hazelnut. You can't purchase it for less anywhere, that's a plus. Guests who prefer regular coffee not flavored comment that it's very enjoyable, not overpowering. Thanks for making these k cups available.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: This coffee is amazing, it is absolutely delicious!! And it was a very good price, some K-cups can run a bit pricey but this was a good deal especially since it had 18, most boxes for this price are only about 15 cups.

review/summary: Delicious hazelnut aroma!
review/text: I love Gloria Jean coffee and their hazelnut K-cups do not disappoint. The aroma smells mouthwatering as it's brewing and the strength is just right. I do have to admit that hazelnut coffee tends to be on the light side of coffee strength so strong coffee drinkers beware! I always use the medium cup setting on the Keurig B60 special edition so if you want it stronger, use the smallest cup setting. At $0.60 per cup, this is easily the best value for coffee, especially if you're drinking a mug everyday like me.
