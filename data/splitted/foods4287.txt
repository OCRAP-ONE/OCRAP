review/text: My little Doxie just loves these, and I have to say that they really do seem to help control "doggie breath". So it's a win-win. I just give her half a piece, however, because a whole piece seems to upset her tummy some. Obviously giving her half pieces means a bag lasts longer....so a better deal $ wise too.

review/summary: My 6 Lb Dog Missing Half His Teeth Chewed It Up In Under 2 Minutes.
review/text: My nine year old 6 Lb maltese had bad tartar, breath problems, inflamed gums. He has his teeth cleaned every year and in the past couple years he has had to have twelve teeth pulled. Vet wanted to go to twice a year cleanings. I had think about brushing more than the 2-3 times a week I used to and find a dental bone that wasn't made in China and effective. He likes Pedigree dentastix but I had not seen much improvement with him eating a couple a day. He also gained a pound, doesn't sound like alot but it is for a six pound dog. I then purchased C.E.T. chews, recommended by my vet, cost $10.50. My dog loved them immediately, but only chewed on one side and it was gone in less than two minutes. I did not see much in improvement after thirty days. I was worried the medium would be too big for him so I bought a second petite bag from Amazon to try for one more month and again, no improvement. His breath was a little better.<br /><br />  I bought the C.E.T. medium sized chews and after a month I saw a definite improvement in his tartar, gum health and breath. After using this for three months the difference is amazing. He had had his teeth cleaned five months prior and already had quite a bit of tartar buildup when I started giving him the medium chews. I leave the chew whole, I don't cut it in half, and he can hold it between his paws and I notice he chews on both sides of his mouth. I don't leave him unattended when he is chewing on it and I take it away after 30-40 minutes. I throw it away after 4-5 days, at least 50% of the chew remains but he has licked the taste off and is no longer interested. They also get gross after a period of time. It still is VERY cost effective over the petite dog chews. I always had trouble brushing his back teeth as his mouth is so tiny. The tartar on his back teeth is at least 60% improved.<br /><br /> For his inflamed gums I have found CET Oral Hygiene rinse to have made a huge difference. After using 4 times a week for a few months his gums are now a healthy pink and not at all inflamed. It also has really helped tartar buildup and his breath. It is easy to use, he likes the flavor. I use it at night after he is done eating. I get him excited by telling him it is a treat and making it a big deal. The bottle is half gone and I have been using it for three months.<br /><br /> I also bought the CET Aqua Dent Water Additive. My dog will only drink it if it is fresh. I tried making up a big bowl once a day for him and the two cats. They seem to prefer it fresh in cold water. Measure carefully, if it is too strong none of mine will touch it. The bottle cap is terrible, you waste so much running down the sides while trying to squirt it into the measuring spoon. I put it in a different bottle.  The product is good if your pets will drink it. If your dog has inflamed gums, the oral Rinse works much better.<br /><br /> While I do Not recommend the small chews I recommend the other CET products. It still can't take the place of a dental cleaning but it sure helps the health of my dogs mouth. I still believe you need to have your pet's teeth checked and cleaned. Note the last time he had his teeth cleaned he showed no problems eating or gave any indication as to being in pain but he had to have six teeth pulled and three had really bad cavities. (I do try to brush my dogs teeth every other day now. It is not fun for either one of us but he doesn't fight me like he used too. I think his teeth and especially his gums feel better.)

review/text: I chose these chews as a Christmas present for my dog and he does really enjoy them. Unless he's outside he tends to sleep quite a bit so I like the fact it takes a good 20 minutes or so for him to work his way through a whole chew so its one of his little daily activities. Along with with his walks and car rides, these chews are something to keep him occupied. His breath gets freshened and I'm waiting to see if his teeth look a little cleaner as he uses the package up. That would be a nice bonus.

review/text: My little Silky is very picky on what he eats.  Along with regular Greenies (Teenie size), this is the only other treat he loves.  It's incredibly hard to a point that I'm worried his tiny teeth may break trying to chew on this thing, but he chews on it happily and rapidly and I see vets selling these in their offices (I went to lots of vet offices to check them out) and my vet gave me a nod of approval when I told him I give these and Greenies to my dog.  My picky little one wouldn't bother unless I cut (more "break" - seriously, it's REALLY hard) one chew into several pieces then he sits down and munches on them ever so happily.

review/summary: Great alternative to rawhide
review/text: My 15-lb yorkie poodle devours these CET chews pretty quickly. We were introduced to CET Enzymatic chews by our veterinarian, after the dog had an awful experience with small Dingo rawhide bones. Though these do contain beefhide, they are much easier to digest for dogs with a sensitivity to rawhide. The first chews we purchased were for medium dogs and were shaped like rawhide chips, as opposed to the longer strips reviewed here. For whatever reason, my pup prefers the strips for petite dogs.  I glanced at others bad reviews of this product, and would like to point out what may or may not be obvious: dogs, like people, react very differently to the same product. Though my dog got ill from Dingo bones, I would not poorly review the product (he LOVED them).  His digestive system did not agree with all-rawhide based products.  The best combination is a product a dog enjoys chewing that will not upset his/her health.  For my dog, these are a great option.

review/summary: Perfect for the little dog
review/text: As with most small-mouthed dogs, my little shih tzu has dental issues.  After spending over $600 on dental work for her, I began looking for a product that would help eliminate or delay having this procedure done again.  On the recommendation of my veterinarian, I purchased a bag of these chews on Amazon (the prices are just too high at the vet's office).  My dog loves them!  They are just the right size for her (she's 9 pounds).  One of these chews given daily, along with 3X a week tooth brushing with C.E.T. enzymatic toothpaste, will hopefully keep her breath sweet-smelling and delay having more dental work done any time soon.  I subsequently purchased the more potent C.E.T. HEXtra premium chews, however my dog did not like the taste of them. Now I am back the the regular C.E.T. enzymatic chews and we're both happy.

They are dental chews and I can vouch that they help keep a dogs mouth fresher. I buy these for a quick chew bone. These smell stale,,,but they are'nt,,, that's what they smell like. I was put off at first but the dogs love em and every bag smells the same.<br /><br />Look for Virbac to see what works for you, the rawhide version of these runs large, so for a medium size ie;25-30# get the small dog selection.

Plus they are good for his teeth.<br />He eats one of these every morning and it is our time.  He climbs up on my lap and devours one of these, looking up into my eyes every once in a while.<br />He has never had puppy breath or any kind of bad breath.  I am going to ask the vet at his next visit how his teeth look.  They look good to me!

review/summary: Good for teeth AND stress
review/text: CET Chews Petite for Small Dogs (30 chews)<br />My dog loves all sizes of these CET Chews. She is a 15 pound Bichon Frise who loves to chew to relieve stress, but only bones, rawhide, or similar chewables. I've heard mixed reviews on rawhide in general, but in the last few years rawhide chews started giving her terribly smelly gas, enough to clear the room! We have discovered, however, that the CET chews do not have that effect, and they help to relieve her stress as well as clean her teeth. We recently switched to the smaller chews because even though she manages the larger chews just fine, we decided it was better to give her smaller ones more often than a big one just occasionally, and that it's probably easier on her small digestive system. Anyway, we love these and would recommend anyone whose dog enjoys chewing to give these a try. Do keep in mind that whenever your pet is chewing something like this that they should be monitored, though we have never had a minute's trouble with these. Thanks!

review/summary: Great way to control doggy breath and tartar buildup
review/text: Love these chews.  My two Pomeranians have terrible breath and need dental care yearly which is extremely expensive. I've used these chews for nearly 2 years at the recomendation of my Vet and they do a great job between cleanings. I'm so happy to find them through Amazon since my other suppier was charging nearly twice as much per package.  One thing I especially like about these chews is that they are made from tiny pieces of rawhide so as they get moist they break up and greatly reduce the danger of choking on a large piece.

review/summary: Best rawhide type chew available
review/text: We've been very happy providing occasional treats to each of our Cockers. However we were reluctant to give them dried rawhide chews (tied up bone shape) because the rawhide pieces can cause blockage in their intestinal tract. But our Vet (Dr. Purewal) advised us about the C.E.T. products. The fact that they are formed-and-flaked into the shape of a strip would prevent them from getting stuck in the intestines. And a great plus is that they have beneficial enzymes which will help prevent plaque build-up besides being nutritious. Shopping for them through Amazon helps us control the cost as well. Buying through a Vet can make them a bit pricey. I think you should try them if you haven't done so before.<br />Michael

review/text: I went by all the great reviews and saw people giving to 15 pound dogs and that is what my Pom is. When it arrived I see it says for dogs under 11 pounds only. Since I buy tennie Greenies for my dog and this is in overall length larger I gave him one. He tore into it and almost choked. Now for 20 min he is breathing heavy, if he doesn't calm soon I'll be calling the vet. I think I will be cleaning up vomit soon. I hate that I have given my dog something to hurt him when I wanted to help.<br /><br />Also what I didn't notice before I purchased it says wash your hands after handling. Now why do I want to put something in my dog that I have to wash my hand just because I touched it?<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon about these issues and they are going to update the page so that it is clear not to give to dogs over 11 pounds.

review/summary: Absolutely Fantastic Product!!!!
review/text: We have a seven year old Pekingese and she had really bad teeth, a lot of nasty buildup and her breath smelled like... well if you're looking for a product like this, you know. Last year, our Vet said we really needed to get her teeth cleaned and it was going to cost close to $400; not an cheap expense but something we were willing to live with to keep our pooch healthy. The Vet also said that the month of February is National Dog Teeth Cleaning Month or something like that and we could wait until then and get a discount (I didn't verify if there is a National Dog Teeth Cleaning Month). I looked at various different alternatives afterwards and decided to use this product and also a product called PetzLife Oral Care Spray. We used both for about 45 days before the dogs next Vet visit. The Vet said, "I don't know what you're doing to keep her teeth clean but keep doing what you're doing". That's all it took to have us sold.<br /><br />We gave her one of these treats once a day for the first 30 days and also used the spray every evening and kept her away from water for about 30 minutes. We still use the spray and she gets a treat about every other day. I don't know if she loves the spray but she tolerates it. She absolutely love the treats though. We're happy too; she can lick our face and we no longer worry about her breath smelling like... well if you're looking for a product like this, you know.

review/summary: Our Chewsy Dogs Like These
review/text: I bought these chews because our dogs were getting tired of the same old Beefeater chews every evening, and I needed to spend five dollars more to get free shipping. All the previous positive reviews also nudged me in this direction.<br /><br />From day one our two dogs, a senior bichon and a middle aged shih tzu, have greeted these chew snacks enthusiastically. We like their small length and thinness of being. They break into small pieces for easier consumption by the dogs. Be careful when presenting very hard chews to your dogs. We learned the hard way after discovering that poor Piper had four broken teeth. The doggie dentist advised us not to give the dogs any chew that does not bend. These oral hygiene chews fit the bill. I wish there were more chews in a package, but because our dogs have received these so well, I'll be ordering again.

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: My two dogs (6 and 10 pounds)  love these treats!  Every night when we eat dinner they each get one as a snack.  They walk over to the pantry and sit when they see the table being set lol! Both are powerful chewers, given their sizes, and it takes them a few minutes to eat.  We definitely can see the difference in the appearance of their teeth as well.  With Prime, I can get them delivered within 2 days when the supply gets low.  Cooper and Milo give these treats two paws up!

review/text: It is supposed to clean dogs teeth as it is chewed and it is supposed to last a while.  My Yorkie chewed a half inch off one end and swallowed the rest, all four inches of it in less than five minutes.  She didn't choke and it is digestible, but it scared the hell out of me and I won't give her another one!

review/summary: must be cheap
review/text: Why do they carry a random product that is standard offering at pet stores... I suspect because they are getting these really cheap from the manufacturer to be sold online only, since most people probably won't go through the hassle to return them. It is also possible of course that has quality issues and that this was a coincidence.

review/summary: Unsure about product....
review/text: I bought these because my vet recommended them for my dog's teeth. I honestly don't know what to rate them as far as how effectively they are reducing her tartar build up. I used to always give her bully sticks, but she developed a bladder stone and she can no longer have those. She is 4 pounds and one of these chews lasts her about 5 or 10 minutes, which is disappointing. A bully stick will last her a few hours. If you are looking for a chew to occupy your dog for more than a few minutes, go for something else. I will keep purchasing this product however becuase my dog loves them and they are recommended by my vet.

review/summary: Keeps my Yorkie busy!
review/text: I love buying treats for my dogs and when I came across this in Amazon, I knew I had to buy it for my Yorkie to help her with her bad breath (CET Toothpaste helped as well!).  I was worried she won't like it coz it doesn't have the usual scent of a dog treat (meat, lamb, chicken, etc...).  So when I gave it to her, she sniffed and tasted it and started chewing on it!  She loves it!<br /><br />I'm so happy that somehow I'm giving my Yorkie something to do while cleaning her teeth!  It also keeps her busy for a few minutes.  Normal treats will only last a couple of seconds but with this, it takes her more than 5 minutes to finish it!<br /><br />What more can you ask for?  Double benefits!

review/summary: The Only Form of Teeth Cleaning Our Dog Likes
review/text: We've been trying to be better about brushing our dog's teeth, but she absolutely hates it.  In addition to using CET's vanilla mint enzymatic toothpaste a few times a week (which she doesn't seem as crazy about as other dog owners claim on Amazon), we give her a piece of these chews on the other days.  Unlike the teeth brushing, she can't wait to get these chews.  They are kind of big for her, so we break them into smaller pieces and give her about 1/4 of a strip per day.  The price is much better here than our local pet store, so I will definitely be ordering online again. I don't know how much cleaner her teeth are yet - I guess we'll have to wait until her next annual vet visit.

review/summary: They really work! But my dogs don't LOVE them
review/text: After about a week of using these daily with my two pomeranians, I can tell their teeth are actually cleaner and their breath smells better.<br /><br />When I first gave them the treats, they were not interested; I had to pretend I was going to take them away before they snatched them up and reluctantly started chewing on them. Now, I still have to do that with one of my dogs, but the other happily eats hers without encouragement. So one dogs likes it, but the other dog only eats it because she doesn't want it to be taken away. Gets the job done, but if they could be flavored and still have the positive effects, that would be nice.

review/text: My two Poms love these things. I mean really love them. And they work. I ran out of them several months ago, and thought "Oh, forget it."  They ate them so quickly, they weren't spending all that much time touching their teeth. They went down so quickly that I thought they couldn't really doing much, but now I see a change in their teeth, and it's for the worse. Pomeranians are notorious for losing their teeth early and that just hasn't happened to my two. I have to go back to buying them again. I can't see arguing with success.

review/summary: Breath Refresher and Favorite Treat
review/text: My 9 yr old Jackie has always been a fussy eater. Even finding treats she likes has been a challange. Once she hit 5 yrs she started getting plaque buildup that required annual cleaning. Last year we started giving her CET AquaDent in her water and this Jan we added C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to boost in the cleaning. Not only is it helping to keep her teeth cleaner, breath fresher, but she absolutely LOVES them. When "treat time" is approaching she begins "woofing" to remind us of the time. When I open the bag she is fixated on me until I give it to her. She gets so excited over something that seems to be good for her. Finally she reacts like a dog to something to eat!!

review/summary: Good but make sure you purchase the correct size
review/text: These chews work relatively well but I'd recommend a few things:<br /><br />Make sure that you are purchasing the appropriate size chew for your dog. Rather than going by the weight listed on the package, it makes more sense to consider the size of your dog's head. For example, I have a 15 lb jack Russell that has a head that is out of proportion for his body. I usually go one size up on dental chews because otherwise they are too small and thus ineffective.<br /><br />Monitor your dog while chewing these! This is particularly important the first time you give the chew to him/her as they can sometimes go nuts and try to swallow large chunks.<br /><br />Give them regularly. In order for this product to be successfully used, you have to give a chew once daily. It's best at the end of the day after they've eaten their last meal.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: After spending a few hundred dollars on getting my dogs teeth cleaned the vet recommended that I use C.E.T. chews to help with his dental hygiene.  Brushing is preferable, but my dog will not let anyone mess with his mouth! I bought the petite size chews.  He was used to "greenies" for his daily treat, but he switched to the C.E.T. chews without a problem.  Also the prices here are about half of what the vet charges.

review/summary: Product from Amazon Suspect
review/text: Let me say I love Amazon and order a variety of products, including dog food so I thought I'd try these.<br /><br />I have been buying these for years, but this was the first time from Amazon. They smelled putrid, like oil gone bad.  I am afraid to give them to by dog.  The expiration date is good, but they smell bad. They were also extremely light.  Most I get are a bit dark beige or brown.  Not worth the risk to try these.  Maybe a bad batch.  I usually buy at vet's office, and I have never had any trouble giving them to my Yorkie or Maltese, both under 11 pounds.  Of course, never leave a dog unattended with any kind of chew stick.<br /><br />C.E.T. also has a mouth rinse.  Of course, brushing is best.
