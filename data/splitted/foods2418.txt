review/summary: Not a replacement for Senseo
review/text: Like many others here, I was looking to replace the now-defunct Senseo pods.  These don't do it.  The coffee is pretty terrible, lots of packaging waste and one pod doesn't fit in the single pod senseo holder.  You can use the two pod holder but the coffee isn't strong enough, even if you use the one cup brew button.  Not working for us!

review/summary: Good price, poor storage
review/text: Got a 12 pack of these on Amazon Warehouse Deals for $6. @ $.25 per egg, they're a good deal but they'd apparently been stored in a warehouse that isn't temperature controlled and there was some minor melting (this could possibly have been in transit, but it's the 4th issue i've had with food items purchased from Warehouse Deals, so I'm more inclined to place the blame on them.) They are edible, and tasty, but don't have much time left on the "best consumed by date" so I suspect they've been sitting around a while. I think I'm unlikely to order food products from Warehouse Deals again - too many "surprises"...

review/text: I love the flavor of Highlander Grogg coffee. It has been our Sunday morning special coffee for awhile. Whenever we have visitors they specifically ask where we get that coffee. So when I came across this 5 lb deal from Coffee Bean Direct I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately the the flavor falls short in my opinion. It smells wonderful but it doesn't hold up when brewed. I highly recommend Coffee Masters brand - its a little more expensive but tastes far better.

review/summary: Highlander Grogg from Coffee Bean Direct
review/text: This past winter I stopped at our local United Dairy Farmer's quick shop/gas station (my favorite place to get a decent cup of coffee when out running errands) and they had just brewed a pot of their brand of Highlander Grogg Coffee.  Have never seen it before or smelled such a wonderful caramel aroma! One cup & I was hooked for sure and asked if they happened to package that variety for sale & was told no, just the stores have it for their customers.  So I decided to just be sure I stopped every time I was in town to enjoy one.  After a couple months I went in & the clerk (who knew me by then) got a sad look on her face & told me it was just a seasonal thing with them & it would be next year before I could get any--boo hoo.  So being a customer of Coffee Bean Direct for other varieties of decent coffee beans I decided to search for the Highlander Grogg & right there it was & excitement was for certain!  Ordered it & it arrived quickly and had to brew a pot immediately.  After having a few pots of this the difference I can tell is that the caramel flavor is just not as strong as the one from UDF but still it is very wonderful & I would highly recommend it to all & the price cannot be beat!!  Enjoy it wearing your KILTS!

review/text: Having tried many different brands of canned octopus, in a variety of sauces, I personally rank this one as tied for first place with  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V228KC">Roland Smoked Sliced Octopus , 3.66-Ounce EZ Open Can (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />The bold, rich, and oily tomato and onion sauce is spiked with heat from small red chilies [not listed in can contents] which perfectly complement and cut the richness of the dense and meaty octopus.  No accident this is made in Spain---one could empty this out onto a pretty plate and serve it at a good tapas bar, as is.<br /><br />Outstanding!

review/text: Just tried my first tin of these, today, and was impressed.  I've had octopus before and was used to it being a pretty good challenge chewing on them.  These chunks of meat were easy to chew and tasted very good--they weren't grisly at all.  I was expecting there to be more veggies in there but there was just enough for flavor which is a good thing--means you get a lot more meat.<br /><br />Another plus is them actually using a healthy oil (olive).<br /><br />I'll buy these again, as I went ahead and did subscribe and save--and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />I'll be trying the Calamares (squid), by the same company, next.

review/text: OMG, sooo yummy that ever since it arrived I've been eating 1 can/day (I'm not admitting to more...).  This is chewy, but GOOD chewy, not as in rubber chewy or bad steak chewy, but in yummy, "chew 3-4 times" kind of chewy.  It is very delicious like I said, but watch out for the teeny red peppers! Not every can contains those peppers, but one can had a couple of them and I accidentally (read: blindly gulping down the entire can) chewed on one of them and yeah... yikes.  If you don't eat the peppers (I suggest you don't), I personally don't think it's too spicy in any measure (just a bit of kick to it), but I like spicy food...

Easy solution is to simply add another cup or two of cooked brown rice at the end of cooking, to thin out the saltiness and bulk up the meal a bit more. I throw this in my rice cooker and leave it to do its thing, low fuss meal with zero effort.

review/summary: Pure Cotton Candy
review/text: I really love cotton candy. It brings me right back to my childhood: days spent running around carnivals all summer, wishing I was one of the girls in the sparkly dresses riding on elephants. Of course I'd love to have it all the time now, but it's really not that great for you. I mean, it's literally pure sugar! And food dye. So, I just had to get some cotton candy matcha! The idea of cotton candy that is actually good for you, how can I turn that down?<br /><br />The taste of this is SO good. I can't believe it tastes so much like cotton candy! If you told me my glass had melted cotton candy in it with some matcha, I'd believe you because it is that good. AND with no sugar at all! Just water and matcha. And the taste lingers, my mouth was all cotton candy-y for a good half hour after I finished. This is just... it's so good. If you like cotton candy you owe it to yourself to try this one out right now. Seriously!

review/summary: Cotton Candy - YUM!
review/text: Cotton Candy Match!  To say I'm excited is an understatement!  I loved Cotton Candy as a kid and still at the age of thirty-seven will buy cotton candy when I see it.  My hubby humors my childlike excitement.<br />My first encounter with this matcha was heaven!  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I unpacked my matcha bowl that I specifically as for at Christmas time so that I could properly prepare matcha.  Then came the chasen from its tight plastic case.  Since this was its first use I warmed it up a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  I think part of what I love about matcha is the preparation that feels very ceremonial.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha and water!<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Of course in my preparation I was so excited and almost forgot to sift it first..disaster avoided!  Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar (this is cotton candy of course) and 6 oz of water.  After I properly exhausted any strength from my whipping right hand I was ready.<br />The smell of this matcha is not as strong once mixed with water.  The taste is there though!  The quality of this matcha is very tasty.  It doesn't taste too vegetal or clash with the sweetness off the cotton candy.  I think next time I will add just a bit more sugar as I didn't want to go overboard the first time and not really get  the original taste of the matcha.<br />My plan for the rest of Cotton Candy is to mix it first as a latte.  Then, try adding to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  So I'll be back to let you know how that works out!<br />To get your own tasty Cotton Candy Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />In closing - YUM!!!!

review/text: We all love cotton candy, right?  I mean, really ... who doesn't love the stuff?  There is nothing that is more evocative of a carnival or fair than cotton candy, and that's where the best cotton candy is found.  But THIS Cotton Candy Matcha tastes like it should be served right alongside the corn dogs and popcorn at the carnival!<br /><br />It really tastes like Cotton Candy & Matcha!  The matcha tastes like I'd expect it to:  bittersweet (although with the cotton candy flavor, the sweetness is really enhanced even more than usual) with vegetative tones, and a buttery undertone.  It tastes creamy and has a rich, smooth texture (no chalkiness!)<br /><br />And then the cotton candy ... it tastes, well, like Cotton Candy!  It is sugary sweet and delicious.  All that's missing is that texture:  fluffy, cottony feel on the tongue followed by a light crunch.  But, I'm willing to trade that in for the health benefits of the Matcha!<br /><br />This stuff is AWESOME!  You've gotta try it!

review/text: There was no way in the world I was not picking up this matcha blend. I've had some great tasting cotton candy teas in the past so I knew it could be done! Also, I have this vast collection of cotton candy flavoured drink recipes to be made - and remade - matcha style! Pinterest can be very inspiring! The one that is most intriguing in a cotton candy lemonade, where you just pour sweet lemonade over a glass full of cotton candy. Has anyone ever tried matcha lemonade? That is pretty much what this matcha was MADE for, and I wish I had some friends to come have a summer party so I could make some and not get heartburn from drinking the whole pitcher. So, you're invited! Just let me know when you're coming so I can clean!<br /><br />Yay! This Cotton Candy matcha takes me to my happy place! Fun times at the fair under a hot blue sky - that is what cotton candy is to me. I got the basic matcha with the delicate flavouring and it is just perfect! So much yummy cotton candy flavour - and it really blows my mind, because it doesn't just taste generally sweet and sugary - it actually tastes like spun sugar! Bright pink and blue spun sugar that just melts on your tongue.<br /><br />I enjoyed this flavour of matcha hot - but it also made a very refreshing and energizing iced tea. Since Cotton Candy is such a summer flavour, I was happy to have it by my side on a sweltering hot day. It is especially good sprinkled on some real vanilla icecream. Have you ever tried cotton candy ice cream? It's usually made with a pretty cheap ice cream brand, and although it's usually delicious anyways, it doesn't even hold a candle to a high quality ice cream sprinkled with this wonderfully flavoured cotton candy matcha. A cold, sweet treat on a hot day!

review/summary: Cotton Candy
review/text: Guh, cotton candy. This was the flavor I most looked forward to, and it's the one I ripped into and gleefully made a cup as soon as the package arrived. So much for my nap, I have matcha to drink! I didn't even read the description on the site, it just instantly wound up in my cart. Cotton candy is childhood to me, as well as a good number of college years spent drinking cotton candy cosmos. I can hear my mother in my head right now. "No, you can't get cotton candy, if we're going to pay $5 for a snack, it's going to be something more than just spun sugar!" But rarely she would cave and oh man. Oooooh man. I remember at one company picnic, they had a cotton candy machine, and you could have all the cotton candy you wanted. They even showed you how to make it! It was amazing. It was the ultimate snack of my childhood. Fast forward a few years to the summer between my first and second year of college. I had an apartment with three other girls, two of whom I didn't know, and I was working at Beech Bend Park. Now, if you know where that is, you either a) went to Western Kentucky University or b) are a biker, because it's adjacent to the Beech Bend racetrack and the Beech Bend Campground, where Harley days are held every year. Usually, I got stuck working the teacups (ironic, huh?), but every once in a while, I got to work food services and I got to make the cotton candy. Oh my goodness. Heaven. Hot work, but heaven. A year or two later I went to O'Charley's with a friend and spotted the Cotton Candy Cosmo on the menu. Unable to resist anything cotton candy, I had to try out. Out came a martini glass overflowing with fresh cotton candy. A little shaker contained vodka and when your poured the vodka over the cotton candy, it melted and mixed in so beautifully that you forgot you were drinking way too much alcohol.<br /><br />Now it's my go-to snack when the wife takes me to the movies. It's $3 and it makes my inner kid go bouncing all over the place. This tea does the same thing. It's...it's amazing how much it really does taste like cotton candy, especially when cold. The cooler my cup got, the more it tasted like those little fluffy clouds of heaven. You can still taste the matcha, and it has an odd creaminess to it, but it's just...wow. Wow. It all blends together and it even has that burnt sugar bit at the end of the sip. I'm going to take a cup of this to the Zoo next Tuesday, ride the carousel, and just go back in time to the carnivals and theme parks of my youth.

review/summary: If there was such a thing as organic coffee filters this would be it
review/text: before you buy coffee filters do your research. what chemicals do they use when making the paper? what glues do they use to hold the paper together? if you care rates superior in all categories in my book. if you don't care go ahead and drink something that is just been soaking in hundred degree water with acidic coffee. I think that's crazy if you're a health-conscious long-term coffee drinker. also drink organic coffee with fair trade certification

review/summary: Merci, Merci!
review/text: Not sure when I discovered how succulent this chocolate was- either way back in the more-than-middish nineties, or way, way back in the endish eighties. Yes, that's how good they are, that one will remember them while exchanging vows, birthing, or cleaning the patio. Anyway, you can get them at Target and Wal-Mart, which suprised me when I discovered this fact, as I figured that my grandmother had brought them over direct from Europe. Which could be correct, but presently, they have been bestowed on us heathen Americans.<br /><br />The facts:<br /><br />-Flavors: Milk chocolate, coffee and cream, hazelnut-almond, hazelnut creme, dark creme, dark mousse, and praline creme. Twenty pieces; good luck with the math.<br /><br />-Has a printed expiration date and a guarantee.<br /><br />-Besides nuts and milk, has soy and wheat ingredients.<br /><br />-Taste-wise, definitely European.<br /><br />I am a chocolate fanantic; my preferences are sometimes peasant-like, sometimes grand (I would be fine with "Hershey's" if stranded, but "See's" chocolate has been digested by me). I am not a constant chocolate sampler, as I just go with what I know and adore. If you want to go continental, grab these suckers.

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: I purchased this chocolate last night at Wal-mart. I had been walking past it and going for the Hershey's Pot of Gold for a while, but always wondered what this one tasted like. I tasted this chocolate and it was amazing! The chocolate is smooth and velvety and the flavor is strong. It's also not too sweet, and I love that because overly sweet chocolate makes my teeth hurt for some reason. I agree that the price is a little steep but I did not pay much less at Wal-mart. If this was the only outlet I had to get this brand then I would definitely purchase from this site. I think this item deserves higher marks than it has gotten because of the price. Purchase from Wal-mart if you can, you will not be sorry!

I had to place it in the refrigerator and have had to keep the boxes there.  The individual wrapper is fused with the chocolate and it is therefore difficult to separate chocoate from the wrapper.

review/summary: Good chocolate, but price scam
review/text: Honestly, I should stop my automatic one-stop-easy-shop addiction shopping at Amazon.  This is just another example of purchasing at Amazon a product that, after the fact, I find in several other places for a much lower price.  In fact, Amazon's "sale" of 2 boxes for $[...], is more than the regular price at several other stores.  Additionally, the packages came with big stickers "Ready for shipment," on them which were not easy to peel off (makes for tacky looking gifts).  Search elsewhere.  You'll find you'll save money.<br /><br />These are tasty, however.  We've had them before and enjoyed them.

review/summary: Hershey mini bars
review/text: This obviously is a chocolate candy such as you might buy for Halloween treats.  However, I ordered it in late spring and the weather throughout the country was unseasonably warm this year.  The people that shipped it simply stuffed the bag in a box and mailed it to me in the 80 degree weather.  Needless to say, when it arrived, there was not one piece of the candy in it's original shape.  It was melted every which way and stuck to the wrappers.  The Reese's peanut butter cups were flattened as though someone had sat on them so had to be pealed from both the stability sheet, the wrapper and the paper cup.  The flavor was ok but each piece was a real challenge to eat.  Doesn't anybody use their head when they are shipping such things?  Where is that supervisor???  This should have been shipped with dry ice.  Capeech????

review/summary: Torani vs Da Vinci
review/text: I read reviews preferring Da Vinci, so I gave it a try.  I prefer Torani.  Torani has fuller, truer flavor.  Da Vinci was very thin and had minimally higher sodium.  Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci.  Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked.  I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci.  But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating.

review/summary: GREAT!
review/text: I reserve 5-stars for the best of the best.  We've gotten several brands of hemp protein powder over the years, and really liked Ruth's brand.  It's excellent, has a much better texture than some of the others, and we've stayed with it for at least a couple of years.  But with a good price on the Bob's Red Mill brand, I decided to try it out, even though there were four bags in the purchase.  It's at least as good as the Ruth's, and the price was better.  Texture is fine, there is not nearly as much of the distinctive taste of some other brands, and even what's there with the Bob's brand is not at all a problem - it just adds "character" to the fruit shakes in which it's mainly used.<br /><br />Suggestion: go to a warehouse club, buy the largest bag of frozen fruit they've got to save money (multi-variety, cut up, fresh frozen), put it in a good blender (we use a Vitamix), add some hemp protein powder, and some other powdered flavoring or other ingredient if desired, a little water, and you have a highly nutritious smoothie with good protein content, several servings of fruit, and whatever else you put in it.  We make these a meal once a day on most summer days.<br /><br />Bottom line, it looks like we've changed brands for the foreseeable future.  Great product.

review/text: I use this in all my baking. Replace 1/4 of your flour and with the Hemp Protein powder. Does not change the flavor, that I can tell. If you are baking something light colored, the powder may give it a slight greenish color. The powder is green in color. I love this stuff for the nutrient benefits.

review/text: Gritty texture, doesn't mix well, hemp bits get stuck in teeth. The package recommends adding it to yogurt but that turns the yogurt into a gritty inedible slop.  I'm afraid to use it in pancakes for fear it will result in grittiness. It's just a terrible excuse for "protein powder", I'm not sure it can called that.

review/text: Well there isn't much to say about these, you get a bulk amount of Frito-Lay chips. They're fresh for sure, and taste great. And an important note about these is that the bags are about the size of something you would find in a vending machine. They're not the small ones that you would find in bulk packages in Walmart, for example. Although, I do wish the price was a little lower.

review/summary: I like a little variety
review/text: I prefer these smaller bags of chips for several reasons. One. I like a little variety; Regular Lay's today, Doritos tomorrow and Cheetos later. Another great thing is that each bag stays fresh because they are still sealed till you open each one. A big bag (which is only half filled most of the time) may go bad before you finish it.<br /><br />These are also good to keep you from eating too much, when you finish the little bag, you are done. My one complaint is the BBQ/ Sour Cream chips. You don't know which of these you will get till you open the box. I love BBQ, I despise Sour Cream, but I was lucky and got my BBQ on this order, the next I may not.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Organix Grain Free Adult Dry Dog Food,
review/text: My dog loved this food. I know it has soybeans and I was concerned about that particular ingredient and I emailed the company, and I feel so much better after their reply and doing the research myself. I definitely will keep her on this food, she seems to be doing very well on it.<br />Here is the reply from the company : Thank you for your question. I can understand why you ask as soybean has gotten something of a bad name but it is actually a very good protein source that compliments other proteins. Organic soybean contains a complete complement of amino acids, naturally complexed vitamins and chelated minerals; balanced and stabilized fatty acids; and lecithin which is an important brain and nerve component and helps increase immune response. The main concern people have is the possibility of digestive problems, this is mitigated in the cooking process, increasing the protein digestibility and helping reduce flatulence.<br /><br />This is about the ingredient poultry meal:The ingredient for the ORGANIX� Grain-Free formula states poultry meal, rather than chicken meal due to the organic certification regulations. The ORGANIX Grain-Free food is actually formulated with chicken meal, which is of the same high quality as our chicken meal in all of our ORGANIX diets.<br />Our product is certified in the "made with organic" category and there are specific regulations about how to label or communicate to the customer which ingredients are organic.  We are allowed to list 3 specific organic ingredients or organic food groupings in the "made with organic" statement.  This is why the front of our bags call-out "made with organic chicken, peas, flaxseed". Part of the regulations also require that if the organic ingredient is a call-out on the packaging that all ingredients in that category are organic.<br />Since our packaging references "made with organic chicken", it is required that all chicken ingredients in the ingredient dec are organic.  This seems like a simple problem to solve.  Just use organic chicken meal.  The problem is organic chicken meal does not currently exist.  There are multiple reasons why it is not available, but the main point is we cannot purchase organic chicken meal, yet our formulas were formulated to contain chicken meal in order to provide a wholesome balanced nutrition for our pets.  This is why chicken meal is listed as poultry meal in ORGANIX Grain-Free.

review/summary: A gift from the Goddess of Mercy.
review/text: Like the famously smoky Lapsang Souchong, Oolong tea comes from mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits, and where tea has been grown at least since the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279).<br /><br />In terms of production, Oolong tea takes a middle position between the fully fermented black teas (Darjeeling, Assam, Ceylon, Kenya, Lapsang Souchong, etc.) and the unfermented green teas (Sencha, Maccha, Gyokuro, Hougicha/Hojicha, Gunpowder Green), in that it is part-fermented or "brown" tea. Its long, dark leaves' fermentation is stopped when they are about 30% red and 70% green, after which they are rubbed to promote their aroma and texture and then dried over charcoal.<br /><br />Ti Quan (Kuan) Yin Oolong takes its name from the Goddess of Mercy (Quan Yin), whose statues can often be found in front of Buddhist temples. Quan Yin is a bodhisattva, i.e. a person who has earned the right to leave this world of misery and enter nirvana, but who has volunteered to stay on earth and assist others in their quest for enlightenment. Legend has it that in a village whose temple was adorned by an iron ("ti") statue of the goddess, one night Quan Yin appeared in a local farmer's dream and guided him to a cave behind the temple. There, she told him, he would find a treasure he was to tend and share with others. The treasure he did find when he went to the cave the very next morning turned out to be a small tea plant, which he took home and nursed. When it had grown to its full size, its leaves produced this particularly aromatic tea with the delicate fragrance of fruits and spices and a rich, golden color. As he had been bidden by the goddess, the farmer shared it with his neighbors, and he also dedicated it to Quan Yin in grateful appreciation of her gift.<br /><br />Goddess of Mercy Oolong makes for a great refreshment at any time of day and also goes well with meals. It can be enjoyed with or without milk (or cream), and its leaves will even yield a second cup when re-infused.

review/text: I received the item on time and the packaging it came in was great! However when I went to steep and taste the tea, to my dismay it was NOT up to the same caliber as other, better quality, Tie Guan Yin. Instead of a strong flavor usually associated with Oolong it was watery and weak tasting even when I over steeped it. It didnt maintain any kind of consistency through out the brewing which was very disappointing. I usually order from a shop in Orlando called Chinese Tea Culture which has AMAZING tasting Tie Guan Yin but went through these guys because of the amount and price.. I guess that's what you get when you buy through Amazon or buy from other places except quality shops.

review/text: This China Oolong tea tastes EXACTLY like what you are served for free in almost every Chinese Restaurant.  That's not a bad thing because the taste of such a tea is decent.  However, I did not expect that it would taste like this since the product description on the site says "... beautiful and full bodied with a fragrant flavor and fruity, sweet aroma."  This tea is definitely full-bodied but it is not fruity nor sweet; instead it has a very faint smoky aftertaste similar to Lapsang Souchong tea but definitely not as strong.<br /><br />On the plus side, when steeped the leaves unfurl beautifully.  It is only because the taste was not what I expected that I give it three stars. I only like the tea in Chinese Restaurants; not love it. Although insignificanat with regard to the product; the description on the tin says "TIKUANYIN China Oolong Tea" not "Tie Guan Yin......"  Apparently Amazon got more than the flavor wrong.

A bit confused I asked what was in the basket.  There were 13 boxes in the basket all containing ONE piece of whatever was on the front of the box (i.e. - Chocolate covered pretzel - contained ONE pretzel, Biscotti - contained three, 1" biscotti's (seriously...1" each), cookie(s) - ONE cookie, etc.).  Total in all - 13 boxes all with 1 item per box (give or take).  Since this basket was for 2 people, I have a hard time trying to figure out who will get the single pretzel or the "luxury" of the 3 - 1" biscotti's!<br /><br />Shipping date and speed was o.k. but having paid basically, $40.00 for this basket was definitely not worth it.  Will not order this item again and would hesitate about ordering another product from this company.

I wrote to the company asking if they reship returns or could it just have been a hungary employee.  They did not answer and just offered to send the single box that I found the opened package.  They advised us to discard the product as if the entire basket did not go into the garbage as soon as we discovered the tampered product.  This company is unsafe beware!

review/summary: Bought as a gift
review/text: After reading the negative reviews I was a little hesistant to order this basket. There were many more positive reviews though and this basket had the best selection between sweets and "food food" for the price then any of the others I looked at. After talking with the friend I bought it for, she said there wasn't one item per box like one of the reviews I had read. She said the only thing that just had one was the bavarian pretzel but she said it's large, the size of the box it comes in. She really enjoyed it, all in all I would say this is a very nice basket.

review/summary: Nice Packaging ...Shame about The Content!
review/text: It's True, Great Packaging...But in these environmentally friendly times, surely we should be using less packaging. I bought this for my sister, & she told me it looked good, but content wise a bit superficial, basically a lot of chips, a small round of cheese & a pot of mustard. I thought from the description the content would be better...So less packaging more substance please.

review/summary: NOT SATISFIED HARDLY ANY CONTENT!!!!
review/text: Not sure why all the rave reviews. I sent this as a gift to my mother for her birthday. She said all the items were in large  boxes with only one item in each except for the 3 1" biscotti. So 13 or so boxes with 1 or 2 items in most boxes. The only thing weighty was the mustard. She did say the cookies and such tasted good(THUS THE 2 STARS) but I think for the price there should have been more content. Will not buy from this company again. And I use Amazon alot.
