review/summary: New Product for me
review/text: I have been using Knox gelatine for years as a dietary supplement but switched to this brand when Amazon raised the price.So far I have been very satisfied and I think I will stick to this brand.  I also like the fact that it is porcine which settles the mad cow disease question permanently.

review/summary: Great Lakes gelatin is a trusted brand.
review/text: Great Lakes Brand of gelatin was recommended to me as a high grade, tested, pure gelatin. I trust it and make smoothies for breakfast with it. This gelatin is well-absorbed as I want what it offers to be completely used by me. It adds some protein, especially those helping with detoxification. It is good for joint health too. I continually order my supply from Amazon.

review/text: I typed "Kosher gelatin" in the search field on Amazon and this is what came up. After I ordered this and recieved it I noticed that it is made from swine (luckily before I ate any). Amazon won't allow me to return this because it's a gracery item, so now I'm stuck with this garbage. Make sure you read the fine print on this.

review/summary: Could Easily break a tooth
review/text: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.

review/summary: The Most Delicious Lobsters In The World
review/text: In my humble opinion, Maine lobsters taste better and have more meat than any other lobsters in the world. The title "Alive Maine Lobsters" is not quite accurate, because catches can be in the coastal area from North Carolina to Nova Scotia. My father placed an order with Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company for me and they were delivered at 6:18 am on Dec. 24th.  The lobsters were alive, healthy, and ready to cook.  I got a pot of water boiling and my wife walked into the kitchen to see what I was doing.  She got mad and wouldn't let me put them in the pot.  I had to buy a salt water aquarium for them and now they are my new pets.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. 100% Juice. Kosher. Yesterday, was driving through the forest on a very hot summer day. Stopped at a little convenience store at a crossroads for some much needed refreshment. Don't like canned sodas or that kind of junk at all. Had tried other flavors of Nantucket Nectars before (and liked them too,) but this flavor is really special. [Love pomegranates, cherries, and cranberries too. Had "fresh from the garden" pomegranate juice *every morning* I could when staying at a little family guest house on a surfer beach in Sri Lanka.] The cherry flavor note is very prominent, the other juices add to a beautiful bouquet. Highly recommended, if you would like a beautiful juice flavor bouquet surprise. 250 calories per bottle. Made with water, apple juice, cranberry juice, pomegranate juice, cherry juice, natural flavor, citric acid, & vegetable color. This review is out there for those for whom it makes a difference.

This classic candy bar from Hershey (first introduced in 1925) is the perfect treat for those who like their treats both a little salty and sweet.  The mixture of peanuts and chocolate is just the right amount to create a taste explosion in your mouth without being overly sweet.<br /><br />After being hard to find for a few years, Mr. Goodbar seems to have made a comeback.  If you have never tried one before I urge you to pick one up and give it a try.  You might find yourself saying, "That's a good bar, Mister!"

review/summary: Excellent and versitile tea
review/text: I've been drinking Yellow Label Tea since the 80's. This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular "brisk lipton" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the "Lipton Yellow Label" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of "Pure Ceylon," a box of "Coarse Black Tea" packed in Mumbai, and another "new bright & rich" Mumbai variety which is a blend of "Assam teas." These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour.

review/summary: Why this isn't a common US tea is beyond me.
review/text: Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common.<br /><br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the "English Breakfast" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label.

review/summary: A Favorite with Many
review/text: I first enjoyed Yellow Label in the Caribbean 20 yrs ago and have since in travels worldwide been looked at oddly at groceries as I purchased 20 boxes to take home. There it was only tea, in the US it wasn't available...or oddly in London which appears on the label.  A letter to Lipton 6 years ago gave no explanation for not marketing in the US, just "coupons to try our other brands".  Finally, Amazon has it and even better a market in Chinatown here in NYC.<br />What makes it great?  It's the only black tea that is full flavored but not bitter.  It's so smooth that you literally can make a pot of it, leave the bags in, reheat it the next day and still have no bitterness.  This is a tea lover's tea that I have turned numerous travel companions onto for life and something I would be lost without.

review/summary: The smoothest tea.......
review/text: I was first given a box of this Yellow Label from a co-worker who had traveled to China.  I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends.....

review/summary: Does not taste like Lipton Yellow Label tea sold in Italy, possibly stale, no expiration date on pkg.
review/text: This is a repeat of the same review I left for another Amazon listing for the same tea (but at a significantly different price).  Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT "foil-wrapped for freshness" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed.

review/text: I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is "insipid" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan.

Lipton sells it in many countries, and while the product might have the same smooth, almost inoffensive base note, to me the UK version tastes very different than the Indian version, which is perceptable stronger and has a more "citrusy" note. While it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas, it is distinctly better than the Lipton tea available in US supermarkets.

review/text: I've been buying primarily whole leaf, oolong, pu'er, jasmine teas from a wholesale tea market in Beijing (Malian St). Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality.

review/summary: Smooth and nice-perfect for breakfast
review/text: After running out of my usual every-day tea, Trader Joe's brand of "Irish Breakfast Tea," I found this Yellow Label first at my local Chinese supermarket in the tea aisle. I had only had the "brisk" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the "brisk" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea.

review/summary: Kids Say: Tastes better than most syrups
review/text: My children like IHOP and like their syrup, so I decided to buy it when it became store available.  Amazon is one of the only places that I found carries it.<br /><br />Anyway, here is the bottom line:<br /><br />The syrup tastes better than maple syrup and the other commercial brands, at least according to my son.  (I still prefer real maple syrup.)<br /><br />The downside is that the IHOP brand is about $10 a bottle, making it about as expensive as real maple syrup. (We buy 32 oz. at BJs for $12.99.)  I really can't understand the high price because it is basically corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup -- the same basic ingredients as Aunt Jamima syrup, which is about 1/4 of the price.  But it tastes better than A.J. syrup.

review/summary: These are my English Bulldogs' Favorites
review/text: My English Bulldogs LOVE these treats.  We get the large bones and they are a great size and last a little longer than a typical smaller treat.  I have bought them every treat known to man (mostly premium brands), and they like these the best.  I have seen these on other pet sites and Amazon is the best price and easiest place to get them from, shipping on the other sites is ridiculous.  One of my bullies has a very sensitive digestive system and has to eat grain free food - interestingly enough these treats do not bother his tummy at all.  They are all natural which I like.

review/text: I was hesitant to start mixing flavors so soon, but ran out of regular food while on family vacation recently. My husband grabbed this for our baby (7 months old) and I thought, oh great - this is going to suck. Well, it didn't - the baby gobbled this up the first time and every time we feed him this flavor. Even though I try to do all organic, this is one I happily make an exception for because he loves it so much. I appreciate that Gerber really is making the effort to provide healthy, good quality, affordable options for baby's developing palates.

This is so much better than those dry powder instant mixes requiring only hot water.  It is a blend of natural cocoa and Dutched cocoa that is great for recipes.  The Dutched cocoa reduces acidity for a smoother, richer flavor.  I was a kid raised on Hershey's cocoa, this is better.  I love it!  Satisfies that deep down choco craving!<br /><br />Just add a cup of fresh milk, 2 teaspoons of sugar and heat it in a microwave oven.  Presto!  Instant gratitude and cheerfulness!

Good for adding to soups, casseroles, or just tossing with some butter and veggies.<br /><br />Came well packed with no discernable breakage in the packages.

review/summary: A tea of strength and character
review/text: Lifeboat Tea instantly became my favorite and a daily staple from my very first cup.<br /><br />The original packaging described it as "a tea of strength and character," and that's entirely accurate. The flavor is robust with just a hint of sweetness, but even though I like my tea brewed strong enough to etch paint, it's never bitter.<br /><br />I also appreciate that proceeds from the sale of the tea help to fund lifeboat rescues off the coast of the British Isles.  Nothing like drinking an outstanding cup of tea and knowing that you're helping to do good at the same time.

review/text: I am both English and somewhat of a foodie, so I appreciate good tea when I find it.  Lifeboat is surely among the best.<br /><br />It is quite strong tea; stronger than some in my family like.  As a result, I have taken to making this tea twice.  I place two bags in a pot an add 3 cups of water and brew for a minute or two.  This makes very strong "builders'" tea.  I leave the teabags in the pot and later add 3 more cups of water and let that brew for 10 minutes or so.  This makes light, aromatic tea which is also quite pleasant.<br /><br />Two teas for the price of one, and they're both great.

review/summary: If you like black teas with robust flavor . . .
review/text: I have been a Constant Comment drinker for most of my life. No other American teas have the amount of flavor that I want. Certainly not the dreck that passes for tea from the major brands found in every grocery store & Walmart in North America. So I have been trying English teas. Who knows more about tea than the Brits, eh? I found this in a store specializing in all sorts of products from all over the world and it has turned out to be the best thing I have ever bought from them.<br /><br />Lifeboat is not a ladies afternoon sipping tea. This tea has the sort of flavor that one can imagine bringing life back to a surviver of an accident at sea. A hearty, robust flavor that warms the bones as it pleases the palate. But not overpowering or bitter as many strong teas can be. Even when brewed badly, it makes a worthwhile cup of tea. It's even good when made through my drip coffee maker. But when the time and proper procedures are followed, it produces an extraordinary cup. I have even made sun tea served with ice in the summer. Iced tea is almost a religion here in Texas. And Lifeboat passes the test.<br />All of my local sources have disappeared so now I get it off the web.<br /><br />If you want a tea to warm your bones on a chilly night. Or to just plain enjoy anytime, I highly recommend Lifeboat tea. The fact that it also supports a worthwhile organization and is a Fair Trade product simply gives one added incentive to try it.

I am ALWAYS looking for a good tea, and am universally disappointed by the "boutique" teas commonly touted in health food stores as well as most online imports which invariably arrive stale.  I wanted a good, strong, mellow tea that I could drink in the morning as a coffee substitute and in the afternoon as a pick me up.  This tea is it.  It is STONG, but not too tannic or bitter.  It's easy to drink and arrived so well packaged that it is fresh and fragrant.  If you like a tea as I have described, you cannot do better than Nambarrie tea.

review/text: Why on Earth did I start taking cinnamon powder you ask?<br />My diet is less than perfect.<br />When you eat sugar, your insulin spikes causing your body to store the calories as fat.<br />Cinnamon may be great on pasteries but it is also an ancient herb used for many things.<br />I'm using it as part of my weight loss arsenal and so far I like the results.<br />It makes you feel warm.<br />VERY WARM.<br />Be warned though, more is NOT better.<br />You need a half a teaspoon in the morning, nothing more.<br />If you take more than that it can be toxic.<br />Yes, cinnamon, toxic.<br />Do your research folks.<br />Trust me, I've learned the hard way too many times taking new herbs that I didn't research enough.<br />Anyway, half a teaspoon of cinnamon will keep those nasty insulin spikes in check and the lard down.<br />It's cheap, it has no side effects if taken at the correct dosage, and it tastes good.<br />Recommended.

review/summary: I love these cookies!
review/text: I happened to come across these while browsing at the local grocery store. They are perfect little cookies with lots of flavor and crunch! Delicious! And to satisfy my love for these cookies, I ordered 12 pounds of them from Amazon and have not been regretting my decision. They were nicely packaged, arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  They are my favorite snacks. The only problem? I can't stop at the 1 servings of 5 cookies! They are addictive!

review/summary: Great delivery service & product, but packaging not good
review/text: I have been having trouble finding these Murray Ginger Snaps cookies in stock at my local grocery store, so I decided to try and get them elsewhere. After an extensive search, I could only find them at Amazon. I figured that it was a no-brainer since just about everything I order from them comes through as advertised with no complaints by me. Not so here.<br /><br />I ordered 12 bags of cookies, and the price was good, and the delivery was fast, but the packaging for shipment was below average. When I used a box cutter to cut through the lid tape, the tape was attached to one of the bags of cookies, so I cut that bag open and the contents spilled into the shipping box. I lost a few of the cookies, and had a mess to clean up. As I opened a bag each in turn as I ate the cookies, every bag had large numbers of broken cookies. It was kind of like they had been crushed in shipping, but the bags had remained intact so the breakage could not be determined from a glance. The Murray bags are an opaque brown, so there is no way to see the interior contents without opening the bag. I was not happy with this, although I did not ask for them to be replaced, as they still were good otherwise. I am dissatisfied enough that I am definitely going to try not to order this way again.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that the Murray cookies are excellent, and of the four or five kinds I have tried, these are the best I have found. My criticism is of the boxing of the shipment and the apparent crushing of the packages at some point in the shipment/storage process prior to me getting them. Also, the breakage that I observed was not present when I bought them from the grocery store. 5 Stars for the cookies, 1 star for the packaging.

review/summary: Best. Tea. Ever.
review/text: This tea is and has been for many years the best daily kind of black tea I've ever tried.  While tea is a personal thing and what I like you may not like and vice versa, I've yet to meet someone who did NOT like this tea.  For many years I drank the non-decaf Typhoo tea and when I recently switched to decaf, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Note, Typhoo tea is strong.  More so than PGtips, I think.  Definitely stronger than the Lipton, Twinnings, and Everton black teas.  If you like a good strong black tea, you will like this.  The decaf is somewhat lighter than the non-decaf, but still stronger than most.  Don't steep it too long and it makes a perfect cup of aromatic black tea.

review/summary: Typhoo Decaf  Cheaper than PG Tips but Just as Good
review/text: Because I'm unable to drink cafeinated beverages, I'm always looking for tasty alternatives.  Most of the supermarket decaf teas I've tried are weak, but a few friends said that PG Tips was worth a try.  They were right--it has a robust tea flavor without bitterness.  I was sold on that brand until I discovered Typhoo Decaf.  It has the same great flavor, but it's less costly.  Yum!

review/summary: GLUTEN FREE!  So good, I had to review it!
review/text: BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.

review/text: The 12" size takes my 5 month lab up to a week to work through. She did just get all of her permanent teeth in, so maybe that time will speed up given some months. Yes, they do have a bit of a smell, but it's more like I get an occasional whiff when she's chewing on it.  If the chew is just lying around, I don't smell anything.  They haven't left any stains on my carpets, and she hasn't lost interest in them.

review/summary: Thin as a pencil, smelly
review/text: I am a frequent user of bully sticks from other vendors online and from pet stores. These are listed as "THICK" bully sticks. I usually buy thick ones from another vendor and my German Shepherd pup loves them and they last a couple of days. These arrived and I was immediately disappointed. Many of them are the thickness of a pencil or slightly thicker. They are about 1/3 the thickness of the "thick" bully sticks I usually buy. But I did not want to deal with sending them back so I gave one to my pup. It smelled HORRIBLE, like a person who had not washed in weeks. My pup liked them okay but because they are so thin she can eat an entire, 12" one in under an hour. Will NOT buy these again.

review/text: Having a puppy means having enough things for him to chew on. I love these bully sticks because they last a really long time and can keep him busy chewing for what seems like forever. Because they last so long they are economical as you don't have to buy them week after week. Bottom line is he loves them and I lvoe that he loves them.

Love that they are grass fed and hormone/antibiotic free. This is EXTREMELY important to me!!! The length was near perfect on every one. The smell was minimal. My dog loved them and I recently purchased more. The price is out of this world!!!! I was paying over $7.00 for one, locally. Great product, great price, great value!

review/summary: Excellent Quality Bully Sticks
review/text: I purchased the 12" bully sticks (7 pack) from Downtown Pet Supply about a week ago.  One of my two dogs recently passed away, and the other was feeling a little depressed.  I wanted to give her a "special treat", but also hoped that these would help perk up her poor appetite since her sister's passing.  Boy have these done the trick!  I let her chew on the stick for about 30 minutes & then took it away.  Low and behold, she remembered she was hungry and ate all of her food!  She is a 50lb Lab mix who is very healthy at 13.5 years old.  In the past I had purchased 6" bully sticks at a local pet supply store for $5 each.  These sticks come out to be just under $3.50/stick and are twice the size!  This purchase was well worth it -- quality product for a great price.  I will re-order again.  Thank you!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being "thick".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Well, I am very disappointed!  They are not thick at all.  They are the same, "slim jim" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!

Making any size of drink other than a small six-ounce cup results in the K-Cup overfilling and spilling out of the unsealed lid, resulting in hot water and tea leaf bits all over the inside of my Keurig - and in my tea.<br /><br />I thought this might be a manufacturing defect limited to one box, but K-Cups from two of the three boxes delivered by Amazon, as well as K-Cups from a box of the same type from the grocery store, all had this defect.<br /><br />I would not purchase the Twinings brand of K-Cups again.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/16/12: DH went to the grocery store unsupervised and bought another box. Every cup in the box still suffers from the same problem.
