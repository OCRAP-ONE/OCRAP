review/text: I have two very food-selective dogs.  They really like this.  Plus, I found that I could use less of this (because it's better quality and more filling) than the food I had been using.  Nothing to say bad about this product.

review/summary: Smiley Likes It
review/text: While our dog Smiley will eat just about anything off of the street, she is picky about her inside food. We finally agreed on Science Diet Senior and that has worked for almost a year. But when I saw this bag of Beneful listed on Vine, I couldn't turn it down. Luckily, Smiley really likes it. My only concerns are the extra additives, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.

review/summary: Tail Waggin' Difference
review/text: Just watching the commercials, Purina's "Beneful" is my most coveted dog food.  So when I saw it available from Amazon, I had to snatch it right up.  To sell pet food, manufacturers must convince us that their product has A.) the best nutrition for pets, and has B.) the best taste for dogs and cats.  "Beneful" easily looks like the most appealing choice for dog owners.<br /><br />Enter my dog. He is not normal.  He doesn't always eat right away.  He'll save portions for later, and he often eats later in the day.  The only consistent habit he has is that he'll eat right after vigorous exercise. Maybe I should have named him "Morris the Dog".<br /><br />A comparison to his near generic bargain brand isn't necessarily convincing.  Both claim to have complete nutrition, and the ingredients are often the same but listed in a different order, and the first ingredients listed are the top ingredients in proportion to the rest.<br /><br />The real difference came in my dog's reaction. With Beneful he eats right away, completely, and he sniffs and licks the bowl about four times after eating.  (Before Beneful he'd do this only sometimes and maybe once.)  He gets the same recommended portions as before, and his eating habits were about the same with the leftover portions of his previous owners' food.<br /><br />BENEFUL:  Crude Protein (min) 25%; Fat (min) 10%; Fiber (min) 4.0%; Moisture Max (max) 14.0% Linoleic Acid (min) 1.5%; Calcium 1.1%; Iron (min) 175 mg/kg; Selenium (min) 0.2 mg/kg; Vitamin A (min) 10,000 IU/kg; Vitamin E 101 IU/kg.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:  Ground yellow corn*, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrochloride, dried peas, dried carrots, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate (s preservative), choline chloride, vitamin supplements (E, A, B12, D3).<br /><br />OL' ROY:  Crude Protein (min) 21.0%; Crude Fat (min) 10.0%; Crude Fiber (max) 4.5%; Moisture (max) 12.0%; Linoleic Acid (min) 1.5%; Calcium (min) 1.0%; Iron (min) 80 mg/kg; Vitamin A (min) 10,000 IU/kg; Vitamin D (min) 500 IU/kg; Vitamin E (min) 80 IU/kg.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:  Ground yellow corn*, meat and bone meal, soybean meal, chicken by-product meal, wheat middlings, animal fat [preserved with BHA and citric acid], natural flavor, brewers rice, salt, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, choline chloride, color added [red #40, yellow #5, blue #2], zinc sulfate, vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate, zinc oxide, niacin, copper sulfate, vitamin A supplement, biotin, manganous oxide, calcium pantothenate, vitamin B12 supplement, thiamine mononitrate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, menadione sodium bisulfite complex [source of vitamin K activity], riboflavin supplement, sodium selenite, calcium iodate, folic acid, vitamin D3 supplement, cobalt carbonate.<br /><br />Price is the variable they never tell you about.  This factor usually comes into play when you visit the store.<br /><br />BENEFUL:  $17.71  for 15.5 lbs.<br />OL' ROY:  $16.88  for 44.1 lbs.<br /><br />The question remains:  Is your dog worth it?  Only you can decide.<br /><br />*According to experts, corn ingredients don't necessarily cause food allergies in dogs; it depends on the source and the dog. Also, some ingredients and their origins will determine the digestiblity of dog foods.

review/summary: A regular in our home
review/text: Our dogs have been eating Beneful for several years now. When our older dog had issues with weight, we picked up the healthy weight variety, however as she gets older, we are more concerned about keeping her weight up than down.<br /><br />Over the years we have tried numerous varieties, and this is the one that most satisfies our dogs and their needs. Because they are a "bit spoiled," we do supplement with small packages of moist food, but even without it, these make them happier than gourmet foods costing much more.<br /><br />I was happy to see this in the larger size, but suggest that you try a smaller size if this is a first time for your dog.

review/summary: Not as substantial as the better brands
review/text: I try to feed my wolfhound the more expensive foods which are higher in natural ingredients and generally feature healthier ingredients, but she tends to like the "cheap" stuff. Had been meaning to try Beneful for awhile as the picture on the package makes it look as though it is full of healthy ingredients!<br /><br />Unfortunately the kibble is composed of the following ingredients--most prominent listed first:<br /><br />Ground yellow corn, chicken-by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour etc. etc.  In other words there are a lot of fillers. Very little true meat or even vegetables.<br /><br />My dog does like this food. I tend to feed a combination of raw, healthy and less healthy. So basically she gets two cups of the "good" kibble (high in natural ingredients and meat content), one cup of the cheaper stuff to keep her interested in her meal and for the morning feed yogurt, cheese and green beans are added and for the evening meal she gets meat, rice and fresh veggies mixed with the kibble.<br /><br />I would not feed Beneful "straight" to my dog, but mixing it pleases her taste buds and the healthier stuff pleases me knowing she is getting a mostly high quality meal.

review/summary: Dog Eats It But Not Top Quality
review/text: My chihuahua is a very picky eater. She wasn't eating her current food, so I ordered this to try and mix with her food to get her to eat it. Well, she picks out the Beneful and eats it only. Therefore, I give it 4 stars because she is actually eating this food, but I would prefer for it to be made with more natural, real ingredients. I compare this food to Kibbles and Bits which is more like junk food for dogs. Soft, chewy, junk food. But my chihuahua is a junk food junky. She'd rather eat treats and junk food than her all natural real chicken food. What can you do? LOL.

review/text: This was our first time trying BENEFUL, original dog food. Had no clue how the dog would react to it. Usually, when the food choice is new he'll try it out. So, the real definitive test comes when the second day arrives. The second day and others have gone and passed and he has taken to Purina's Beneful nicely. Beneful, which I recommend, has fast become a favorite in my household!

review/summary: Read the Ingredient List
review/text: Make sure you read the list of ingredients before you purchase this brand of dog food.  With all the healthy looking vegetables on the bag you wouldn't get that cornmeal and chicken by-product were the first ingredients. However, my dog does like the taste of it (at least initially).  She happily ate the first 1/4 of the bag and then I had to start mixing in another brand.  I decided to switch to Purina One Beyond (yellow bag) because the main ingredient is either chicken or lamb.

review/summary: OK But Not Great for the Long Haul
review/text: Selected Beneful Original as a change from the dog's old standby, Harmony Chicken and Rice, which he isn't eating as heartily as before. This dog food is reasonably priced BUT looking at the pictures on the label I expected to see assorted veggies higher on the ingredients list.  Corn IS high on the ingredients list and TOO MUCH corn isn't agreeable with my dog's' tummy, and causes poop-issues and sensitivity/allergy.<br /><br />I like that there are added vitamin supplements but can do without the added sugar. The assorted colors and shapes of the kibbles look cute and appealing to this human, not sure the colors make a difference to my pooch. He eats this food happily but it doesn't agree with his tummy which doesn't make me too happy. His abundant paw licking isn't because this dog food was paw-licking good, his food sensitivity/allergy has returned. The food allergy may also cause runny eyes and scratching due to the dry itchy skin and I have to give him Children's Benadryl and Fish Oil like the last Vet visit recommendation.<br /><br />So I'll cook brown rice and mix that half rice/half Beneful and he can get by OK. I'll continue my search for a dog food that is BOTH heathful for the dog AND convenient for me. Cooking regularly for the dog isn't a life goal yet.

review/summary: Purina hits another home run with this dog food.
review/text: We have used Purina Beneful products in the past and were always satisfied with their quality.  This was the case with this Beneful Dog Food product as well.  Both our dogs (a German Shepard and an English Setter) love it right out of the bag.  They are very picky in what they eat.  With some of the other dry dog foods we have to add something to entice them to eat.  They enjoy every bite with no additives and are very satisfied.  This dog food is a little more costly, but if you check the contents you will see what a healthy choice this is for your pet. We consider our pets to be a part of our family.  As such we want them to be with us as long as possible.  We find the Purina Beneful Original Dog Food to be both healthy and good tasting for our dogs.  I recommend this product.

review/summary: Love the zipper top and easy open
review/text: Oh how I hate to buy dog food:  Lugging it into my basket; into the car; out of the car.  Hunt down the scissors or find a screw driver and rip that bad boy open where bugs will get in it or lift the whole heavy thing into a container.  This great new bag has a zipper on top and when I saw that I was happy!  Wow, I unzipped it and the bag unsealed and I didn't even need to pick the heavy ole thing to dump into the ice chest because I can get what I need and viola! Zipped that puppy right up.  That alone is something to look for if you lost several pairs of scissors in the garage.<br /><br />As to the food itself:  I've always felt good about Beneful:  It is colorful and smells good and my two rescued country dogs are not too picky.  Spikes wolfs down anything you put in front of him and looks at Baxter's bowl with lust. Baxter is a slower eater and we usually have to watch him to make sure he eats it all or empty it back into the container.  This time, Baxter ate it right up quickly and no extra to empty out.<br /><br />The price may be a little higher than the grocery store, but I am a Prime member and having it delivered to my door is a huge plus!

review/summary: My Dachsund Loves This Dogfood!
review/text: I always buy Purina, and decided to try this brand for Dobey since it was available in vine for us to review.  He was pretty bored of his other food, the only dog I know to leave the bowl half full after feedings and walk away.  But this stuff, he just gobbles it up!  I know some of the other reviews bash it for not being all meat and a lot of corn meal products, but I don't have the budget to spend money on expensive dog food and buy him all meat or organic dog foods or feed him better than I eat myself.  I also trust the Purina brand as through the years it has never been one of the dog foods to ever be recalled.  I am not saying this because I got free dogfood to sample, Amazon sent this to me not Purina, but as a loyal Purina customer.  When I had my siamese cat before my dog (who is now five), that's all I ever bought him was Purina, too.  Anyways, my doxie loves this Beneful better than his old Purina mix so we will definitly be sticking to it for now!  I also love the bag itself which is resealable.  I personally have a tote that we store our food in since they didn't used to have sealable bags, so we just dumped it in there and mixed his old food in there so his tummy could adjust anyways, but I thought it was worth mentioning as I thought that was a cool plus!  Highly recommended.  Sure, there is better food out there, healthier, meatier, more organic.  And sure, your dog deserves better if you can afford it.  I can't.  I give my dog my steak scraps sometimes and he's not complaining, he's happy with this mix and chasing squirrels and rabbits, and my wallet will be happy too.  :)

review/summary: Beneful is like the "Wendy's Hamburgers" of Dog Food
review/text: Dog Food is one of those things that's difficult for a human to properly review.  After all, we're not going to eat it (let's hope), and some dogs, mine included, tend to scarf down the stuff that's least healthy for them in the long run.  Put down a bowl of "Kibbles and Bits" next to "Science Diet" and my dog will go for the Kibbles and Bits, and yet we know that Science Diet is better for him.  And yet, we want him to enjoy his food...  What to do, what to do?<br /><br />Well, we give him Beneful.  Yes, it's not the "best" dog food out there if you're going from a pure nutrition standpoint.  Our local organic food stores and even a new organic pet food store (!) have things that are far superior, but let's face it, you're going to pay a LOT more for that than for Beneful.  Further, I know from experience that the human food there lacks in flavor and texture compared to "mass market" foods, and yes, while that's a trade off some are willing to make, my tolerance for it only goes so far, and I'm not going to give my dog food that may be good for it that it eats only as a last resort.<br /><br />So Beneful is for us that reasonable compromise between "good for the dog", "enjoyable for the dog", and "consistently affordable".  In that way, it's like Wendys.  A Wendy's meal isn't a masterpiece of cooking, but it's better than most fast food, and reasonably priced.  If I had to eat Fast Food every day, I'd pick Wendys.  And if I have to give my dog the same thing every day, I have picked, and will continue to pick, Beneful.

review/text: PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound I just opened the Beneful Adult Dry Dog Food and the dogs love it. They don't realize what is in it, they just love the taste. Beneful adult dog food does have protein from real beef. It also has a lot of vegetables such as corn, tomatoes and spinach, plus oatmeal, grains, iron and calcium for strong bones and teeth. They really like the chewy "meaty" chunks. The ingredients list ground yellow corn first which means that is the main ingredient, then chicken by-products. I would like to see meat as the main ingredient and less flour and vegetables. It is a OK product because the dogs love it.

review/text: Purina is a trusted brand in pet food. This product sounds like it is healthy, containing "wholesome grains and real beef, accented with vitamin-rich vegetables". My dog was uninterested in giving a review but she untypically put her nose in the bag and started eating, much more animated than with her usual dog food. She also took a nip at the cat (not really too menacingly) when the cat wandered over by the bag to see what was going on. (The cat seems to like it too, if that is worth anything.)

review/text: I will agree with other reviewers in the packaging can confuse you.  It looks healthy by the photo, and you really do want the best for your dog.<br /><br />However, I am also on a tight budget.  If I am not eating lobster and steaks, my dog can also cut back on expensive food.  Beneful fits that bill.  You get a huge bag that can easily be around for over a month with a medium sized dog.  Yes, he does pick through it and only eats certain morsels of it, but it usually isn't much. Also, when I open the bag he is always sniffing it.  I think he loves the smell just as much as the taste.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great dog food for your pet that won't put too much of your money, then this brand fits the bill.  If you are picky about giving your dog only certain types of dog food, it isn't hard to read the ingredients before purchasing it.  I for one, will continue to buy this brand and my dog will love it as well!

review/text: My dogs love Beneful.  I have tried Science Diet and I had to put cheese on it for them to even touch it.  I have tried Kibbles N Bits, and yes, they love that too, but Beneful is somewhat healthier.  If you compare the two brands, Beneful has 25% protein compared to Kibbles 19%.  Beneful also uses mostly natural ingredients, for example- sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup.  While it is not the healthiest or recommended by vets, it is the best of the cheap options available.  Also noteworthy, my parents switched their dogs to the Healthy Weight Beneful and they both lost about 10 lbs over the past year.

review/summary: A trusted staple in our dogs' diet
review/text: I obtained a shipment of this product though Amazon's promotional Vine program, but it's very easy for me to write a review based on much experience with Purina Beneful . . . we have used it for years!  We have a few favorite brands that we rotate through, including Iams and Science Diet, and this is one of them (and is the most economically priced)<br /><br />In short:  Our two small dogs love this brand.  It is reasonably priced.  And we are inclined to trust the Purina name regarding quality control and nutrition content.<br /><br />A great new improvement, which I did not see touted in the Amazon product listing, is the new bag. It's made from a fabric reinforced plasticized material (like tarp material) and has a zip-lock closure at the top. No more fighting with sewn seams and busted open paper dog food bags.  A great, great feature.  Whoever did this obviously has experience feeding dogs at home.<br /><br />The only negative (and is not really a problem), is that the dogs tend to "pick and choose" among the Beneful morsels and end up depositing the least desired ones on the floor outside of the dish.  (The obvious solution is to suspend feeding until they've cleaned ALL of it up, which they eventually do).<br /><br />This is NOT a boutique dog food touting organics, choice cuts of meat, or a pedigree of natural ingredients, but it is a proven product from a trusted name that my dogs have consistently liked as we've rotated it into their food mix over the years.

review/summary: A great fly attractant
review/text: I picked this dog food knowing it has predominantly corn in it. Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product, corn gluten, wheat flour are the four main ingredients.  Sugar is also one of the ingredients and that explains why the flies came right to this food as soon as I poured it into my dogs' food bucket.  As a fly attractant this product works as great as Bud Light beer.<br /><br />My dogs don't even care for it.  I poured some of this "Beneful" next to their Taste of the Wild Lamb kibble and they seem to prefer the Lamb kibble over their corn junk food.  My dogs just aren't used to eating junk food.<br /><br />And to top it all off, during my daily back yard scoop poop ordeal, I had to remove more than usual piles of soft, yellow turds.  This food is clearly not good for dogs.<br /><br />I don't even know why this is called "Beneful."  Beneful to whom?  Purina, perhaps?<br /><br />See my photograph under "customer images."

review/text: Beneful was a big bust in my animal filled household.  The dog wouldn't touch the food choosing her own kibble over Beneful. She usually has interest in a new dry food, just because it is new, but wouldn't touch this.  My previously feral cat who loves dog food refused to even try the Beneful.  And he eats just about anything from rat feet to honey-dijon rice chips. The chickens, which are true garbage disposals and especially love dog and cat kibble, wouldn't even try one kibble!  Kind of makes you wonder what they put in the stuff?  The first ingredient is "Ground yellow corn", so no wonder carnivores don't want to eat it. I prefer to always buy cat or dog food with meat as the first ingredient since they are carnivores.

review/text: ***<br /><br />One thing I don't like about PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound is the price as offered on Amazon right now.<br /><br />I do like the bag, though.  One reason is there's a photograph of a dog on the front, and that dog looks really startled.  It's kind of arresting, and you find yourself doing a double-take, because you so rarely see a dog look startled, with great big wide-open eyes.  Also, he's wearing a police badge on his collar because he's a police dog.  (Arresting, get it?)<br /><br />Another reason I like the Beneful bag is that Eukanuba, my dogs' normal brand, comes in a paper bag with a grease-proof liner whereas the product under review comes in a sturdy plastic bag, like thick Tyvek, that has a simple zip-type closure with a little handle that works every time.  I like the bag so much that I now store excess Eukanuba in it.  Also, last time I bought a bag of Eukanuba and placed it on the floor of the backseat of my car, a woman backed out in front of me and I had to hit the brakes quickly, which meant that my dog, which was also in the backseat, got thrown forward and ended up falling off the seat where, unbeknownst to me, he placed a foot right into the middle of the Eukanuba paper bag and punched a paw-size hole all the way through both layers, which would not have happened with the Beneful bag.  Imagine my surprise when I pulled the bag from the backseat and strewed dog food pellets all over the car and the garage floor.<br /><br />I was not surprised the dog did not set about snarfing down the food he had liberated from its bag, and here's why.<br /><br />***<br /><br />AD LIB FEEDING<br /><br />I have successfully fed all my pets, five cats [see update at bottom] and two dogs so far over the years, ad lib, and I strongly recommend you try it.  Ad lib is short for the Latin phrase ad libitum, which means "at liberty" or "at one's pleasure."  Feeding ad lib means you eat as much as you want.<br /><br />The benefit of my pets' feeding ad lib throughout their lives is that I can leave out weeks' worth of food at a time rather than having to measure and dole out portions every day.  From the moment I've gotten each new pet home the first time, I've always made sure there was a huge amount of food available in their feeding vessels.  When they come to realize there will always be more food than they can possibly eat all at once, they automatically regulate their feeding to what they need.  None of those pets ever overfed themselves.<br /><br />If you ration out one day's worth of food a day, those pets will always eat it all up and wait for the next day's feeding, which they will always eat up.  They will quickly realize that the supply of food per day is limited, and they will want to always eat all of it, which means you must then continue to limit their daily portions lest they overeat.  Ad lib feeding is MUCH better.<br /><br />I feed my current dog -- which is also the best dog in the world and I can prove it -- from a tub that holds 30 pounds of Eukanuba.  I feed my current cat -- which is the prettiest cat for miles but socially inept -- from a large emesis basin I stole from my mother's hospital room several years ago.  (Hi, Mom, and I'm glad you didn't need to throw up!)  As a result I have to add dog food maybe once every couple months and cat food every three.  Let's compare ad lib feeding to daily feedings.<br /><br />Whether they feed on rationed daily portions or ad lib, your pets will need you to do the following each time you feed them:<br /><br />1. Locate and haul out the container of the pet's food.<br /><br />2. Open the container.<br /><br />3. Dose out the food into the pet's feeding vessel.<br /><br />4. Seal and store the container of the pet's food.<br /><br />If you perform these steps once a day for one dog and one cat, that's 730 such operations in a year.<br /><br />The way I do it, it works out to only about ten such feedings a year.  That's 73 times better, which is why I say ad lib feeding is better.<br /><br />But, just to make sure you understand, (1) you want to get your pet started on ad lib feeding the instant it gets home, and (2) you want to make sure its feeding vessel never gets too close to empty.  Your pet should always be able to see and smell that there's always more food than it can eat.  As I said, this has worked for me for a total of seven cats and dogs [see update at bottom] out of a total of seven dogs and cats in the sense that none of them has ever overfed.<br /><br />***<br /><br />My current dog, whose name is PheyeG'hdeaux, really prefers Beneful to Eukanuba.  Maybe it's because he got bored with Eukanuba and wanted a change of taste.  You know how if you eat your favorite food for too long even it, your very most favoritest food, starts to pall?  Maybe dogs are the same way.  It seem like they would be.  Cats too, and giraffes and hamsters and monkey-eating eagles, I would guess.  I know my dog prefers Beneful to Eukanuba because when I mxed the two in his tub he actually went to the trouble of rooting through the various pebbles to track down the Beneful ones.<br /><br />(People who've had a chance to observe and learn about PheyeG'hdeaux agree he's the smartest dog ever.  He learned Shake, Sit and Down in fifteen minutes, although to be fair he was trained by Annette, who is and always will be a former professional dog trainer, although to be fair she says she wasn't training dogs, she was training dog owners.  Anyway, to be fair, PheyeG'hdeaux isn't all THAT smart, and the reason I say that is that I beat him a good four out of five times in chess.  I'm all the time having to remind him about elementary things like, "Don't bring your queen out too early" and "Don't forget about capturing en passant."  Sheesh.  None of this has anything to with how good Beneful is or is not, which is why it's in parentheses.)<br /><br />I am concerned that the first ingredient in PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound is corn-based.  Humans don't process a lot of corn well, as you (ahem) might have observed, and I'm just guessing dogs don't either.  (Now I have to tell you about how, according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316082678">Bartlett's Book of Anecdotes</a>, "After receiving a bad review from Munich critic Rudolf Louis, [German composer and organist Max] Reger wrote to him: 'I am sitting in the smallest room of my house.  I have your review before me.  In a moment it will be behind me.'")  Also, if I may be permitted to continue in this indelicate vein, on Beneful PheyeG'hdeaux's, er, gaseous emissions have a different smell, although I can't say it's necessarily any better than when they're fueled by Eukanuba.  Funny how dog food manufacturers never discuss this particular asspect of the ingredients they choose, don't you think?<br /><br />Finally, as some of you might have come to expect, I have taken the product under review outside the expected criteria such as, in this case, nutritional value and price and convenience and taste.  I can tell you that when you grind up this Beneful into a dust and sprinkle it on a Caesar salad, it remains unimproved.  The salad, I mean.  Same with pizza.<br /><br />And especially ice cream.  Beneful dog food dust is truly awful on almost every flavor of ice cream.  But then, to be fair, so is Eukanuba dust.<br /><br />Also, if you pour some into cereal bowls and serve them to your kids with a spoon and a carton of milk, they will not eat a second bite no matter what you do or say, which is too bad because this Beneful dog food, even at the price at which it's on offer at Amazon right now, is a lot cheaper than the same weight of corn flakes.  And, come to think of it, the main ingredient is the same.<br /><br />Did you figure out how to pronounce PheyeG'hdeaux?<br /><br />***<br /><br />UPDATE OF JULY 27, 2012:<br /><br />Since I wrote the review above, a sixth cat has been added to the list of pets that feed successfully ad lib, so it's eight dogs and cats, not a mere seven.

review/summary: This is my dog's favorite food!
review/text: We switched from Rachael Ray's Nutrish to Purina Beneful and my dog couldn't be happier! She actually paces in anticipation of her next meal (I swear she can tell time!) Where she used to look at her food and sigh before eating, now she does a little doggie dance while I fill her bowl and then gulps it down as fast as she can (I tell her to slow down but she doesn't listen to me). I know that there are products out there that are probably healthier for my dog, but with my budget, this is what I can afford. She loves it, she's happy and healthy, and that's good enough for me.

review/text: First of all, it lists the ingredients right here on Amazon and it's not like you couldn't go on the brands website and figure it out. I'm wondering what else you'd buy without 5 minutes of research!<br /><br />What did you expect for under $20? This bag for a small dog would last about 2 months or longer so at $20 it's about $.30 a day! I probably eat about $4 - $10 a day of food and I don't consider myself fancy at all.<br /><br />I bought this food because I was on a tight budget this month. Dog likes it. No nasty side effects or wet poop yet. Cheaper than Eukannuba which seems to be making him fat. I try a few more but this eems to be agreeing with my dog at the moment. Just read the packaging before complaining or buying.

review/summary: Picky dog likes it; picky dog's people not impressed with ingredient list
review/text: Lexie is a picky little dog. She doesn't like many brands of dog food, and turns down most offers of dog biscuits, etc.  But she eats the Beneful.  And that's good -- no dog food is healthy if the dog doesn't eat it.  She does eat certain shapes/flavors of bits first, but she eats them all.  They are smallish kibbles that would probably work for just about any size dog.<br /><br />But I wasn't thrilled to see that the main ingredient is corn.  I like that this food has both animal and vegetable ingredients, but would prefer to give Lexie more animal protein and less corn. (I consider corn a grain, not a vegetable, not something that dogs are designed to eat.)<br /><br />But given the price point, overall I think this is a reasonable choice.  3 stars from me, 5 stars from the dog = 4 stars.

review/text: It's a pain in the you-know-what to get our dogs to eat at times. They are so picky. But we had the chance to try Beneful for free, so why not? Without a backwards glance (which they usually do when we give them a dog food that is not the norm) they ate this right up.<br /><br />Of course, I cannot say if it tastes good. Or if it really IS more healthful to the dogs than the cheap brands. All I can honestly say is that my dogs like it, and they don't like many of dog foods. It's also nice that all the major stores in our area carry the brand, but with Prime, I just order it from Amazon and have it delivered. Hey, maybe that will make my dogs actually LIKE the mailman!!

review/summary: Props for improvements but still a lower quality food source for Dogs
review/text: Beneful has worked hard to improve their overall ingredient blend since it's debut as a brand but this is still a "Cheap" grocery store brand of Dog Food that is Corn-based and whose parent company, Purina/Nestle, has been known to source some pet food ingredients from problematic sources such as China where there is virtually NO oversight.  That said, Dogs do find this food palatable and MY DOG liked it very much but I only allowed him to have a few meals of it by itself.  I tried mixing it into his higher quality meat-based Kibble but then he started to notice the difference and would cleverly pick out only his "Good" food kibbles to eat, leabving the Beneful behind.  Smart dog.  Would you like to see a list of the ingredients by weight straight from Beneful's own site?  Here ya go:<br /><br />Ingredients by weight:<br />Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, animal digest, potassium chloride, sorbic acid (a preservative), dried peas, dried carrots, calcium propionate (a preservative), choline chloride, l-Lysine monohydrochloride, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, red 40, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, yellow 6, yellow 5, Vitamin A supplement, blue 2, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, brewers dried yeast, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br /><br />Now, looking at this list, I do notice some improvements and so I want to at least acknowledge that they are TRYING to make a better "budget" dog food.  The only problem with that is that Corn allergies and Corn-based diets are not natural for dogs and have been linked to any number of diseases but most comellingly to Canine Epilepsy, something I have personal experience with.  I can tell you honestly that it is far better to ante up for a Meat protein kibble all of your dogs life than to "save" money by feeding him or her Corn based kibble until they develop Canine Epilepsy.  If they do, you are in for a world of hurt in your pocketbook and wtaching your best buddy suffer through seizures and the side effects of the seizure meds it's just not worth that $5  to $8 less a bag.  Also, as I mentioned in another review, there's the idea of "False Economy" involved.  If you buy a higher quality kibble, you need to feed less of it to Doggie who digests it more completely and benefits from it with better health and fewer dental issues.<br /><br />I don't want to send Beneful the wrong message by giving them 1 star because they HAVE improved their overall mix of ingreidents a great deal since they first came out.  I would suggest that they may still be able to  make further improvements without raising the price a great deal more.  If they were willing to charge a dollar or two more per bag, they could use more quality protein sources and less grain based fillers.  I know some people will buy this no matter what.  I have a friend who showed me a comparison of the protein perecentages that showed beneful was "comperable" to a brand I once used.  However, it is the QUALITY and SOURCE of the protein that matters.  Corn Gluten provides protein as do ground up waste parts from chicken factory farming but is that good for Doggie over the course of his life?  No.  Not really.<br /><br />For those wondering what I did with the rest of the bag, I donated it to a shelter that mixed it in with higher quality canned food and they were glad to have it.  I'll still keep hoping that Purina/Nestle gets it right and I will try them again in the future  but right now, I'm awake to the False Economy of paying less now only to pay high Vet Bills in the end.

review/text: I was disappointed upon consulting the ingredients list of this food to find that the first ingredient listed was.....corn. I just can't recommend a dog food that contains more corn than it does any other ingredient.  The second ingredient was a meat "meal" and the next few were other grains.  While I do realize that dogs need balance in their diet just as we do, this is NOT a balanced diet for them and doesn't come anywhere close to meeting their nutritional requirements.

review/summary: Not Something I would Get Again
review/text: When I first introduced Beneful everyone dug in.  I was thrilled & thought I had a winner.  However by the next day everyone was a lot less enthusiastic.  By the 3rd day the previous days food was still in the bowl & they were begging to be fed.  After the disastrous results of the last food (Chef Micheal's) I tried out on them, I wasn't going to play around.  They aren't eating it.  I'm not forcing the issue.  I put them back on their regular food & they are chowing down & happy.<br /><br />Normally I feed everyone high quality brands of feed like Wellness & Before Grain etc.  I probably would have rated this lower if it wasn't for how sick the Chef Micheal's brand made everyone.  That & the other brand had even worse ingredients than this!  So for that, I would have to say Beneful is better but not quality.  Beneful is suitable for low income situations at best such as animal shelters or as a "treat" when higher quality feed is the main food given.  In the end cheap foods end up costing more due to dogs that get sick more often creating more trips to the vet.  When one considers the true cost of food, the higher priced higher quality foods are in the end more economical.

review/summary: Beneful but not Healthy-ful
review/text: I was suprised when this arrived, it was a huge 15lb bag.  I thought for some reason it would be a small sample bag.  The bag is large and attractive with a heavy ziplock top.<br /><br />The food inside is multi sized and colorful but way too big for my Chihuahua's to eat.  Also, I worry about all that extra dye in the food. Dogs can't see color, so the company is making the food look appetizing solely for the human owner. I picked out some of the smaller pieces of kibble but neither dog nor the cats were interested..hmmmmmmmm. While my animals usually eat "Taste of the Wild" food, I know the dogs are picky eats but the cats eat everything, including bugs so it was a little weird they wouldn't touch it.<br /><br />I decided to have a look at the ingredients-it was mostly corn.  One cat will eat corn of the cob so perhaps if I had wet it down he would have eaten it LOL.  On a serious note, corn as a main ingredient isn't really too "beneficial" to the health of a dog. I suppose this food is better quality than a lot of grocery store dog foods but it really as "healthy" as the advertising would make you think it was.  Not a bad food but not the best either. It's a shame-all the advertising and makeing the food look pretty but not spending that $$ on making it good for the dogs.<br /><br />Rather than throw away 15 lbs of perfectly good food, I found a local animal rescue that happily wanted the donation of the bag of food.

review/text: We have 2 greyhounds.  One will eat anything, anytime.  The second is picky and refuses to eat the same food over an extended period.  At our vet's suggestion, for the picky one, we started using mix ins.  This can be just a little something left over from dinner, broth, or a small amount of a different dog food.  The Beneful made a great mix in, and of course I give the mix in to both of them.  They both enjoy it and picky eater has been gobbling us his regular highly nutritious food along with a bit of Beneful tossed in.<br /><br />I've not used Beneful as their main food, and doubt I will. But did want to add a plus for the mix in option for those with picky eaters.

review/summary: This isn't good dog food. Here are rules for finding one:
review/text: If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), corn is a major ingredient of this dog food (#1 on the ingredients list! Couldn't be worse). Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. And the meat that's included is of the "by-product" variety. So, it's ground chicken bones and toenails, not muscle tissue ("meat"). So why are these things in there? They're cheap. Filler. That's it.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word "corn" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position ("meal" is okay; just means dried meat. "By-products" are not okay).<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the "good food usually costs more" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the "dog whisperer" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the "but my dog likes this brand" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy.

I figured it was just because it was new.  Nearly two weeks later they are still sorting their food.  Now the mix is about 80% Beneful and 20% Pedigree. They leave the Pedigree on the floor next to the bowl.<br />I haven't noticed and I'll effects-no excess gas, no digestive issues, no burnt grass that we tend to get with other brands (Iams).

review/summary: The Go-to Dog Food for Emmy
review/text: Emmy the cocker spaniel has been known to be a little picky about her dog food.  But she seems to have no problem with Beneful and has been eating it as her main dog food for years.  She is an older dog, but she seems to be maintaining health and energy on this food and continually devours her food. I feel good, as this seems to be a relatively healthy choice at a decent price.  But Emmy is probably the best judge as I have not gathered the courage to try it, and she seems to love it.

review/summary: Not crazy about the corn, but they sure like it!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:44 Mins<br /><br /></span>Somehow, I doubt if corn is the best thing to feed a dog, and that is the first ingredient listed. However, you can see how much they love this stuff! For my Water Spaniel (the brown dog) I slowly introduced Beneful into her diet, but even with a careful transition, it upset her tummy. And that means messy clean-up, if you know what I mean, lol! So, I'd recommend this food for a dog that simply won't eat other foods, as clearly they have the taste down pat, but in my opinion, there are better foods out there. If I myself try to stay away from GMOs, so should my dog.

review/summary: Doggy Loves It!
review/text: ...However, he can't read the ingredient list. I can and was somewhat disappointed<br />that meat was so far down the list. This runs contrary to the advertising. That said,<br />like most commercial pet foods it is scientifically formulated to provide proper nutrition<br />for a dog. My Terrier mix seems to love this and I've been keeping a close eye on him since switching to this as you really should with any diet change. Look at the coat, stool--going more or less. Hopefully the latter as this means the food is being better digested. And just the overall energy level. So far things look good. Like others have noted, my dog also goes for the soft bits first--but eventually cleans out the bowl. I could recommend this to anyone with a medium to large dog.

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), L-Lysine monohydrochloride, choline chloride, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.Fiber (estimated dry matter content) = 4.7%<br /><br />The first ingredient in this dog food is corn. Corn is an inexpensive and controversial cereal grain of only modest nutritional value to a dog.<br /><br />For this reason, we do not consider corn a preferred component in any dog food.<br /><br />The second item is chicken by-product meal, a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It's made from what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br /><br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered "unfit for human consumption".<br /><br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything -- feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat).<br /><br />I have seen enough:<br /><br />This is according to the Dog Food Advisor.<br />This is just a samll part of their review that can be found on the web just Google "review for Beneful".<br /><br />I am no expert so I felt the need to quote someone who is.  We love our dogs and they deserve the best food available. Personally I use only raw for my dog but thought he might like a change so I tried a few different kinds.  This is not as bad as some so I will use it for training since it is hard and not to greasy and I do not feed my dog large amounts.<br /><br />My dog does seem to like it but it is not going to be part of his mealtime.  Something I noticed on the label is a reference to feeding our dogs once a day, may I caution you, I used to feed my dog once a day until I found out that, that causes bloat.  Bloat is a very painful condition that only some dogs get when they seem to eat too fast, this is also due to the one a day feeding they seem not to be able to get enough. Please feed your dog twice per day.<br /><br />I do not feel this is a very good food for your dog.  Dogs are generally not made to deal with so much grain they are carnivores and do much better on a diet almost completely meat and bones. According to Peta some of these dry foods are the remains of dead and sick animals as eluded to in the later review.  I will stick to the diet I put my boy on.  I suggest you keep looking for something better.<br /><br />I am sure some of us do not eat the best food all the time and sometimes will eat bacon and eggs and a twinkie now and again and that is fine and it will not kill us and this food, on ocassion, will not kill our dogs but please do not feed them a food like this on a regular diet.<br /><br />We have our dogs for such a short time why not feed them quality food to keep them around longer.

review/summary: Evidently tasty dog food, but high in carbs, fillers
review/text: I have for some years now been feeding my dog a blend of appetizing dog foods with a costly prescription diet for his medical condition. He doesn't always have much of an appetite, and it can be difficult to coax him into eating much. He won't eat the prescription diet unless there's something a little more tempting with it. I don't know; maybe once he gets started he doesn't pay as much attention to the individual elements.<br /><br />On opportunity for review, I picked this up along with a bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LANN56">Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food</a> to see how these two foods would work for this purpose, and how they'd compare.<br /><br />Either of them does the trick. He was enticed by the smell of the Beneful before I even opened the bag. Put a few pieces on the floor, and he went after it like a dog in a dog food commercial. He gave pretty much the same attention to the Chef Michael's. He doesn't seem much to care which I put in the bowl with the prescription food; he has so far chowed down on each just as happily.<br /><br />Even allowing for the lower portion sizes of Chef Michael, it costs twice as much. Nutritionally, there are some differences between the pair. Beneful has 25% crude protein (minimum); 10% crude fat (minimum); 4% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 14% moisture. Chef Michael has 28% crude protein (minimum); 16% crude fat (minimum); 3% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 12% moisture. I've been doing some reading on dog food ingredients, and while I'm no expert what I've read suggests that the Beneful is heavy on carbs and, while its top protein source (chicken by product; second on the list) is a decent protein, it's not necessarily a highly digestible food due to its heavy reliance on corn. Chef Michael starts with beef.<br /><br />That considered, I'm not sure that the Beneful would be my first choice for mixing in with my dog's food, although in the right proportion I feel comfortable enough with it. With his tricky health, I don't think I would use either of these solely, but they both do the trick. While neither is exactly a health food, I can't pretend that everything I eat is the healthiest option, either. These are decent supplements, but I personally would not use them as mainstays.

review/text: So far, so good with this food. I can't tell if it has any of the health benefits it claims - my dog is healthy to start with - but he really likes it, and he's a picky eater. As soon as I brought it in the house, he was all over the shipping box. That's a big deal since he has not gotten excited about dog food since I switched to all dry. He seems to eat less to be satisfied, there's been no stomach upset, and his waste is more compact. That alone is a benefit since he weighs 80 pounds . . . I may switch to this permanently. I've got one more brand to try first.

I can't tell you how many times I've brought something home for the 4th member of our family , and although initial excitement was encouraging , it soon waned. So I was tentative to try Purina Beneful , as let's face it , it kinda resides on the costly end of the spectrum.<br />Couldn't be happier ! Or should I say Bonzo couldn't be happier!

review/text: We've used Beneful several times in the past year. Overall it's a good quality and the dogs seem to like it fine. They're not terribly excited about it though. They look at it and almost say "well, OK if that's all you got". We have three, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russell, and a mini schnauzer. We also have a neighbor dog, Lab mix, that comes over to eat whenever possible. Since there's enough competition (think, if you're not going to eat that, then I will or I'll eat it just so you can't have it) there are rarely leftovers. Sometimes there are leftovers and like I said it rarely happens, but does more often with this brand. Decent feed, but there is better out there.

But this was not the case, from the first time i gave it to them , they ate it with abandon and enthusiasm.<br /><br />The Beneful dog food is a nice tasting food for dogs I also know this because we have tried other dog foods with them and they didn't really like them . The packaging is a bit difficult to open and you will need another airtight container to store the food as the bag it comes with is not airtight and cannot be re-sealed once open. So i would reccomend an improvement in the packaging. From my Dogs perspective , its 5 stars based on taste, from mine 4 stars for the less than perfect packaging.

You want me to eat THAT?".  When I offered him Beneful for the first time, he sniffed it, and promptly started eating.  It was nice to see him accept a new type of food so quickly, and I know that he will be eating this for the rest of his days, and any other dogs that I may adopt at some point in the future will also eat Beneful.

My dogs are small and had no problems chewing it.<br /><br />But mostly, I was disappointed in the make up of the food. The first ingredient was corn, as was the third, making this mostly corn based. I would like my dogs to get more nutrition than that in their food. So while they are not picky, I am.

review/summary: Beneficial dog food? Not really...
review/text: Purina has named this dog food Beneful implying the food is beneficial for dogs.  Well.. it is.. to keep them "alive" but not much else. I would not feed this product to my dogs on a regular basis, if at all. Sure the cost per pound is cheaper than the grain free selections such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5SLB8">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 30-Pound Bag</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00609PJEC">Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free Lamb Meal and Sweet Potato Formula Dry Dog Food, 30 Pounds</a>, but once serving size and reduced veterinary bills are factored in, the implicate cost savings of these cheaper cereal based dog foods is usually not realized.<br /><br />Purina's marketing states Beneful has added color (yellow #5, red #40, yellow #6, blue #2) - these are artificially produced (chemical) FD&C food colors, some of which are derived from petroleum. Do you think these artificial colors are included as a benefit to the dog?  Now I realize why in the past when a dog had a fecal accident on carpet it stained the carpet so permanently...<br /><br />Ingredients:  Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrachloride, choline chloride, added color (yellow #5, red #40, yellow #6, blue #2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E Supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br /><br />My concerns (alarm!) stems from the primary ingredients being corn (fed to cows to fatten them up before slaughter), chicken by-product meal (it means the discarded portions of chicken - the heads, beaks, feet, feathers, etc is ground together), corn gluten meal (again more corn to fatten up the animals), and whole wheat flour (Really?  Do the dog's nearest relatives, such as wolves or foxes, eat grains in the wild?) which is very well known in Asian culture as being much harder on digestion than other grains such as brown rice.<br /><br />The customer service can be reached at 1-888-BENEFUL for information or questions. My first question is why are they adding the artificial colors, at least some of which are made from petroleum?  The color isn't for the dog's selection...<br /><br />I gave this product a whole 2 stars simply for the packaging.  The zipper seal bag is a nice addition to help keep the food fresh.  I would prefer Taste of the Wild or Hi-Tek came in a zipper seal bag of similar quality.

review/summary: My dog chows down on it, but it isn't exactly healthy for her.
review/text: Beneful portrays itself as a healthy dog food full of meat and vegetables - of which it has some - but, unfortunately, two of the top three ingredients are corn products... ground yellow corn (#1) and corn gluten meal (#3). As with cows and humans, corn is not exactly the most nutritious "vegetable" (actually it is a grain) for a diet. Eaten in moderation, it is fine, but as a primary source of carbon molecules and proteins, it is not the easiest food source for our or our dogs' bodies to process.<br /><br />In addition to the corn products, the second ingredient is a meat by-product - not exactly the best protein source we envision when hear words like beef or chicken or meat... or see a picture of sliced muscle meat on the packaging.

review/summary: Not Best Quality Food but Dogs Like it
review/text: So, the nutritional properties of Beneful are there for you to decide of your own volition, but as for a dog food my dogs like, this is it. I mixed it with Taste of the Wild which is grain free (and the mixture might be seen as sacrilege for the purists), but the dogs enjoyed it solo and in the mixture. I do notice they eat it by color though. The red kibble bits go first. Actually one dog loves the red kibble bits so much she dumps the whole bowl to get the red ones. Then goes the green, and finally the brown bits. Not sure what that is about, but it seems to be pretty standard by now. She actually started to growl when the other dogs came to eat before she was done with the red bits.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and can be zipped closed, which I appreciate. The kibble size is relatively small, so for my mini doxies, it is pretty perfect. My sister's yellow lab came by, though, and I am fairly certain he didn't even have to chew- just inhaled and the bowl was empty. So I think this food is fine, but nutritionally questionable...

review/text: I've bought this dog food in the past but don't feed it in it's straight form very often to my dogs.  The first ingredient is corn, which is the first ingredient in most crunchy snack foods.  If you feed your dog this as it's main food, it's  almost like feeding your child a straight diet of Doritos.  They may taste good, but they won't keep you healthy for long.  It's not a bad dog food, and there are a lot worse brands out there, and it'll do when money is tight and you need to feed your dog.  Today I saw a 42 lb bag of Purina Beneful at SAM's club for right at 32 dollars.

I feed them typically 4Health dog food I buy from my local Tractor Supply and the dogs love it. I had the chance to try this food for my dogs and I mixed it with my current dogs food as to not shock them. I will say both dogs ran over and chowed down on the food and ate only the Beneful leaving their original kibble.<br /><br />So the food appears to get a seal of approval from my dogs. I also checked and it looks like this food is made in the USA which is important to me. With all the dog food and treat issues coming from over seas I want to keep my dogs eating stuff made in the USA, sure the pet food standards aren't as high, but they are higher then imported food so I don't feel so worried feeding them this food.

review/summary: The Lowest Quality Food For Your Dog
review/text: Despite the manufacturer's claims to the contrary, this is actually one of the lowest quality foods you can feed your pet.<br /><br />The primary ingredient is corn.  Not only do dogs have problems digesting corn, it's also a major allergen.<br /><br />Next up we have "by-products."  By-products are things that are not fit for human consumption and are basically... garbage.  Think beaks, feet, intestines, insect wings, etc.<br /><br />As if it wasn't enough to have corn as the main ingredient, it makes another appearance in the form of gluten.  Gluten is the non-nutritous portion that is left over after corn is processed.<br /><br />Wheat is another ingredient that should not be in your dog's food.  Again, it's a major allergen.<br /><br />There are more problems with this food (such as artificial color), but everything listed so far should make you just say NO to Beneful.

review/summary: Dog Eats Dog...Food
review/text: My puppy...well not so much of a puppy anymore, Taz loves this dog food. He isn't a real picky eater, but he does have his favorites when it comes to dog food. I wouldn't say he'll eat anything you put in front of him, but if I want to see him eat from his own dog bowl right when I put food in it, then Beneful is the dog food of choice. All other dog foods sit there for hours or until the end of the day before he'll go eat...out of hunger mostly. I'm happy we finally have a dog food Taz will actually eat the second we put his bowl down on the floor for him.<br /><br />I've also noticed his weight is under control, meaning he isn't getting too thin or fat. Taz is at a healthy weight and has lots of energy...like when he was a puppy. (Taz is 5 years old now)<br /><br />If you have a dog who doesn't like their dog food, I suggest trying Beneful. They have many flavors to choose from. My dog likes this one best, but he will eat the others too.

review/text: Okay, it's really kinda hard to write a helpful review of dog food, because I cannot speak dog and don't know what mine really thinks about this. However, I can tell you that she's a VERY picky eater, and she dives right in and eats this up.  Happily. So, I think that's a pretty good endorsement, right?<br /><br />Also, so far (a few weeks on this food) I haven't seen any adverse reactions, so I'm giving this 5 stars.

review/summary: Beneful Dog Food -- Our Yorkies LOVE it!!!
review/text: Until we discovered the new Beneful dog foods, I always bought the more expensive all natural, no-grain, dry foods, which our dogs refused to eat. We have two small Yorkies - and they love this dog food! They even like the larger size pieces in other Beneful varieties.<br /><br />Our older Yorkie (She is 7 pounds) will pick out and eat the soft red pieces first before eating the crunchy bits, but our other, smaller Yorkie (under 3 pounds), will eat all but the lighter colored pieces. We also frequently add the wet Beneful Stews (in small plastic containers with colored lids) to the leftover dry Beneful bits. They have a very nice variety of 'prepared meals' -- which almost look good enough for humans! Big chunks of meat and veggies, and are a really nice compliment to the dry foods.<br /><br />Other than the all natural, no-grain dog foods, which my dogs really don't like, this is one of the best commercial dog foods on the market.

review/summary: Standard dog food.
review/text: To be perfectly honest, I am not currently a dog owner. Our Spottie died several years and we haven't gotten another pal since. But I am a fantastic dog sitter in the meantime; to the point that she doesn't like to go home when her little girls owners come to pick her up. So I think I can safely say I have good instincts when it comes to taking care of dogs. They really are man's best friend, aren't they?<br /><br />When I had the opportunity to offer a different food to my furry friend, courtesy of Amazon Vine, I did. Between me and her owners, we watched her appetite and it seemed that she was OK with everything. But not a eager scarfing down like she has done with other dogfood. Bingo is a small dog so I don't know if that plays into how a dog eats.<br /><br />This particular brand is supposed to contain meat but if you look at the listing of ingredients, corn and chicken by-products and flour are the first three. Not the best of food categories. It is supposed to contain meat, carrots, peas, corn, and wheat but not in that order at all. The colors of the food is orange, red, yellow, green, and brown. Bingo ate all the red nuggets first (I would assume it was the "meat"). The rest she nudged out with her nose, and she only ate those when there was nothing else left. Most of the time.<br /><br />Her owners were grateful for the opportunity to try another brand but they wouldn't buy this again. I personally feel that I would prefer to give a more nutritious dog food if possible. The price is fairly reasonable and comparable at the stores.<br /><br />Until later, hugs to all our four-legged homies!! Peace

review/text: I dont know, I really tried to like it but just couldnt get over the taste.  I think my review might have been biased so I went to the dogs.  I have three and they all liked it.  They ate it and wanted more.  To bad I didnt give them any.  The biggest, Chief, gave it 2 paws up and well, tipped over sideways.  He was very happy with it though.  My smallest, Coco, decided to hide hers for later.  All in all it really is a good priced item and even though my dogs will eat anything they liked this stuff.  Nothing bad to say about it.  I tried it on one more dog, my parents, and she doesnt eat anything.  Well, she ate this stuff.

review/summary: Beneful helps keeps our dog healthy
review/text: Our chocolate labrador has been eating Purina Beneful for over ten years.  And she loves the stuff.  We use the Beneful Original as a treat for her.  She started out on the Original formula and gained too much weight.  But I can't say whether that was the dog food, too many doggie treats from our oldest granddaughter or too many table scraps.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, we switched over to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ3HAY">PURINA Beneful Healthy Weight Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> and she has it almost all the time now except for occasional "treats" of the Original Formula.<br /><br />We feed her two cups twice a day and she is at a very sleek weight, especially considering her age and that she's not as active as she used to be.  She likes both types (Original a little better) and eats it right down.  Because it is a hard food mix, her teeth have remained healthy too.  We've only had to get them cleaned once in ten years.<br /><br />We are able to get this cheaper locally, usually at Target but sometimes at Walmart.  For our dog, this has been a good choice and she has stayed very healthy on it - per her vet.

review/summary: Maltese loves it!!!
review/text: We have a 8 pound Maltese that is five years old and he will only eat BENEFUL. It is healthy and does not contain ingredients that add to weight gain, yet it provides the protein which helps toy dogs with loss of blood sugar. I have tried all brands of dog food and found that Beneful is his favorite for the last three years. I do not use canned type dog food because it bothers his digestive system. Beneful does not cause his stomach any problems. Toy dogs tend to be very picky with their food and luckily I found a dry dog food he will eat.<br /><br />Whatever your dog's size or breed, I am sure it will love Beneful. I realize that it is more expensive than most dry dog food, but I feel it is worth it for a healthy diet. My Maltese will eat about one cup a day, so a bag last a long time. We live in a rural community and it is hard to find within a range of twenty miles and I'm glad to see Amazon finally sells it. The subscribe and save program ships monthy, with free shipping and NO TAX. Thank you Amazon and Beneful!

review/text: This dog food contains mostly corn and disgusting animal digest (slaughter house scraps like hooves, hair, feathers, etc). People are fooled into buying this because of the commercials and packaging. These types of foods do not give dogs the protein they need. It gives them awful gas because they cannot digest the corn meal. There are much better food for dogs like Natural Balance and Merrick's Before Grain. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Learn to read ingredient labels before you buy.

review/summary: Seems OK
review/text: It's hard for me to write a review for dog food because I'm never really sure what to say other than whether or not my dog liked it. She seems to like it okay, though I don't think she loves it. She'll eat it when she's hungry but otherwise ignores it. I'm not sure, though, that it is the healthiest dog food out there, though I'm not as "up" on what ingredients are best for dogs, and what should be avoided. It does seem like there are a lot of filler/cheap ingredients instead of the truly nutritious ingredients one would want. I did love how it was packaged, with a easy to use plastic zipper across the top of the bag. That has been really handy... but not a reason to buy dog food, of course.

review/summary: Not good for your dog
review/text: We picked this up as a sometime-treat for our dog. We definitely will not be using this as the main food for her and I'll tell you why. If you note in the ingredients, the very first item listed is corn, which is NOT good for animals. It is a filler and isn't nutritious for them at all. The first ingredient in any good food should be meat, and corn should definitely not be in the top 5, let alone the first item. The next four ingredients are also terrible: "chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols". Chicken by-product means not the actual meat of the chicken, but everything else (e.g. bones, skin, organs, feet, etc.); corn gluten meal is just more corn; wheat is the single most common allergen for dogs; beef tallow is rendered fat and tocopherols don't actually have vitamin E in them, but "may have" vitamin E sometimes.<br /><br />So while your dog will love this for the same reason that people love Big Macs, it doesn't make it good for them and you can find better food for them for a similar price. Just remember: no corn ever and meat should be the first ingredient.

review/summary: My dog seems to love the taste, but I don't care for the ingredient list
review/text: Typically I buy one of the Buffalo Blue varieties but I will admit when I am out and need to pick up a bag in a pinch I often get Beneful since I've been able to find it everywhere from grocery to convenient stores.  He seems to love the taste of this product.  Where as normally kibble sometimes sits around before he gets to it, this he does eat up right away.  So I guess I do get a certain amount of satisfaction in thinking he might actually enjoy eating his food.<br /><br />However there are a couple of observations I have made about this food.  The first is he seems to eat more of this food to feel satisfied.  Generally we free-feed at our house and I fill the bowl as it's empty (or as he clangs on it letting me know it is empty of food).  However I do feel like with this food I have to fill it twice as often.  It's hard to tell if it is because it is less nutritionally dense and therefore less satisfying or if he enjoys the flavor better and therefore wants more of it than he does with something like Buffalo Blue.<br /><br />The other thing I don't care for, personally, is the ingredients list.  It doesn't feel like the balance of protein to carbs is very high and the way ingredients are described I wonder about their quality.<br /><br />Overall this dog food is okay in a pinch, but not something I would personally choose to feed my dog longterm.

review/summary: Inexpensive food; Dog might like it, but not necessarily healthy
review/text: My dog likes this food. The food has a good variety of colors, shapes, and ingredients - beef, grains, and vegetables.<br /><br />It's actually pretty healthy and has a balanced overall nutrition.<br /><br />However, the one glaring flaw is the by product. True, this dog food does have a grains, vegetables and beef. But, by product is still part of the ingredients. It's quite unsettling not knowing exactly what is going into the food. By product could be cow feet, butt, skin, anything that is part of a cow but isn't truly meat.<br /><br />Purina can legitimately claim this to be a natural, whole product.The majority of it does have good ingredients. But as we take a closer look, there is still by-product. I wished it wasn't there, but that would likely increase the price.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily say this dog food isn't good for your dog, but there are better options. If you don't mind the extra ingredients that may not wholesome, this food is fine. It shouldn't be life-threatening nor fatal. I recommend going completely (or at least more so) wholesome and natural with brands like Blue Buffalo and Nutro.

review/summary: Nice, but I wouldn't feed it to my dog
review/text: The 15.5 lbs bag of Purina Beneful Original Dog Food is packaged well in a reclosable, easy to open bag.  The colorful food is appealing, and the flavor seemed to be find with our beagle.  However, I have one test to determine if a dog food is right for my dog and it has little to do with a reclosable bag, or color assortment.<br /><br />To evaluate a dog food, look to the ingredients.  The vast majority of dog foods will have corn as the first (and primary) ingredient.  That is because corn is an inexpensive filler.  However, it is barely digestible and has little nutritional value to a dog.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Here is a simple test.  For a week, feed a corn based food to your dog.  Note the amount of waste your dog produces.  Then switch to a meat and rice based food.  You will most likely notice less waste.  Why?  Because your dog's body is using the food, not just passing it through their system.<br /><br />So, despite a great bag and a pleasing look, Beneful is a corn-based dog food.  Keep looking, pet lovers.  Yes, the lamb and rice varieties are going to cost more, however, you will use less so it may even out and your dog will be better off for it.

Vitamins, carrots, and peas do show up later in the list, but so do Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 2, all for human viewing pleasure, not our dogs' nutrition.  The packaging looks great, showing chunks of fresh beef, fresh peas, carrots, and corn.  But  I think we will stick with our tried and true, high-quality dog food, as opposed to this well-packaged and highly marketed dog food.

review/summary: Dogs love it, but not an impressive ingredients list
review/text: Two miniature Australian shepherds, accustomed to very good food, found the Purina Beneful as tasty as their occasional treats and cleared their bowls quickly every time they were given it. There appeared to be no digestive issues, and they were satisfied with the usual size serving.<br /><br />That said, I can't in good conscience give this more than three stars. Reviewing the ingredients list and comparing it to other dog foods on the store shelves, this seems  over-priced for the quality of nutrition it provides. Still too many corn byproducts and other pretty non-dog kinds in its make up to want to buy it on a regular basis.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was cheaper than a lot of doggy treats that are not very nutritious either. Maybe buying a small bag and using it as a treat source while training a puppy could be a relatively inexpensive way to go and wouldn't throw off the overall nutritive value of the dog's overall diet.

When she would eat this food she would come in the next room where we were, almost gagging - like a cat with a hair ball. Plus she would not finish what was in her dish.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the corn meal which is the main ingredient, after all dogs are carnivores, or the funny shaped pieces that are included... who knows but this was not a hit with the 4 legged member of the family.<br />The bag is nice with a zipper closure though - that's about the good we found for this brand.

review/summary: Miss Ted Wouldn't Touch It!
review/text: We have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days.  Frankly, she has had a rough time of it.  She caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis, ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then, and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater.  Chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food, it is a 50-50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up.  As a result, Miss Ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff, the expensive stuff, the special diet stuff, the stuff from Walmart, the stuff from the grocery store, the stuff from the pet store, the stuff from the vet, even the refrigerated stuff, so I was happy to be given a chance to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.<br /><br />The bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch, the UPS driver carried this all the way upstairs for  me.  (I  was very grateful.) Miss Ted happened to be in one of her "that stuff is poison and I'm not going to touch it so I'll just eat the cat's food until I can get into the pantry for some real people food" mood, so her bowl remained untouched.  We tried another half-dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time. The dog food looks fine and smells fine, but Miss Ted won't eat Beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days.<br /><br />Others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food, as well as the low rating given to the product by the Dog Food Advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02:  if you are feeding strays like Grandma did out West, then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service.  On the other hand, if you have a "special needs" dog, the is probably not the best option.<br /><br />Your call.

review/text: Having tried several different dry dog foods for my puppy, this Purina Beneful food is by far the smelliest of the lot. If your dog's eating area is near the center conversational portion of your home, beware that this food will stink a bit. We place the food slightly behind a wall to conceal the sight and odor of the food, but I'm a bit disappointed that this food smells at all. Other brands of food haven't packed this much of a smelly punch. Our puppy seems to eat it OK but I wouldn't say that she's super excited about it. She has regular bowel movements with this food and these seem just the right consistency (if there is such a thing!) so apparently the food doesn't wreak havoc on her digestion.

review/summary: The dog and I agree.
review/text: The dog and I agree.  She doesn't really care for this food - she'll nibble at it off/on all day; she is typically a gobbler.  According to my vet, dogs need a balance diet of protein-rich meat and carbohydrate-rich starch but, Beneful, like most Purina products is mostly carbohydrates.  This isn't an optimal selection to ensure your dogs nutrition.  My biggest concern is that one of the main ingredients is by-product meal (the parts of chickens that slaughterhouses throw away) - my dog deserves more.<br /><br />The re-sealable bag is awesome - I wish all brands/products had this option.

review/summary: Not my dogs's favorite
review/text: I consider Purina a reputable brand and my golden retriever really likes Purina Dog Chow, so this seemed like a healthy alternative. My dog ate the food and did end up finishing the bag, but I could tell she didn't love it. After mealtime, she would sometimes leave some of the food in her bowl, which usually doesn't happen. The food doesn't have a strong odor, either good or bad, so maybe that's why it wasn't overly appealing to my dog. I'm sure some dogs would love the food, but it wasn't a favorite for my large dog.

review/summary: expensive filler
review/text: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour: as my vet always says, how much corn and wheat do you think wolves eat in the wild? Most dog food has some sort of grain product in it to serve as a binder. But quality dog foods should not include multiple binders as their primary ingredients. This is sort of like taking a bag of corn meal and a bag of flour and mixing in powered carrots before feeding it to your kids. Excess carbohydrates have the same impact on your dog as they have on people. A better option is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XZFZI4">Blue Buffalo Dry Dog Food, Fish and Sweet Potato Recipe, 30-Pound Bag</a> or a similar brand that has either no wheat products or wheat products low on the ingredients list.

review/summary: Good food for those who hate their dogs
review/text: But who hates their dog? We sure don't, so we try to give her what she wants and needs, and neither of those things are in this food.<br /><br />The name says it all: marketing hype disguising a complete lack of quality. "Hey Boss, this crap food made of crap needs a non-crap name that sounds healthy and nutritious. How about Beneful?"<br /><br />How about Artificiaful?<br /><br />The main ingredient is corn, which is nutritionally almost useless for dogs. I can almost guarantee it's also gmo corn, which is making our kids and adults fatter by the day while it destroys our soil as farmers dump more pesticides on it. And who knows what it's doing to us on a cellular level? While most countries in the world have forbidden gmo, we've had it stuffed down our throats with ZERO pre-testing. Human Guinea Pig Nation!<br /><br />The next main ingredient is "chicken by-products". What, my dog can't even get the meat of the tortured hormone-laden antibiotic nightmare in a tiny cage that is the modern factory chicken? She needs to eat the beaks, claws and other inedibles off these poor birds?<br /><br />Beneful?!<br />Crappiful!<br /><br />It's a disgrace that they're selling this stuff with all this marketing when they should be spending those ad dollars on real food for our dogs. Purina should be ashamed of themselves for claiming they care about dogs and then feeding them this swill, which is really just leftovers they couldn't stick in other crap. If this is what they feed dogs, I wouldn't TOUCH anything they make for people. Thanks for letting us know how much you care, Purina!<br /><br />If you love your dog, and want to get the best dog food for the least cash, go straight to the Land of Kirk, where a huge sack of real meat-based dog food, chicken or lamb, with almost zero fillers of any sort and full of real nutrition, is waiting to make your pooch happy and healthy.<br /><br />Or you could pay three times as much for this disgraceful junk that will only make your dog sick in the long run.

review/summary: Dog Says, "... I'll Eat It If I Have To"
review/text: We have a Bassett Hound who loves his food. He definitely knows what it's like to be hungry, so he's not overly finicky.<br /><br />We've experimented with different brands of dog food and found some he really likes and some he doesn't. If he won't eat it, it makes you wonder what it is actually made from.<br /><br />When we presented this to him, he wasn't overly excited about it, but none-the-less, he did consume the bag. So it is edible in that sense.<br /><br />I get that most of the dog foods are made with corm meal (as filler) and by products of meat or bone meal, but I don't understand why the cheapness in ingredients used.<br /><br />Dogs need more than filler foods to stay healthy. Like real meat and veggies, in addition to the dog food.<br /><br />Overall, it is mediocre food for your pet.

review/summary: Didn't like the carrots and peas.
review/text: I compared this to Purina Dog Chow which is my dogs' normal diet.  They sniffed and pushed the little pieces of carrots and peas around and then eventually ate it but they weren't particularly enthralled.  The next day the same thing they sniffed, snorted, pushed some pieces around and then just sat there.  After a few hours all the food was eaten.  For the price it was not particularly beneficial or dog friendly.  The next day they ate the Beneful but then kept going back to see if there was something else in their bowl, when I went back to Dog Chow they were much more agreeable and ate their dinner as they'd normally done.  I mixed in the Beneful into the Dog Chow and they'd eat the Dog Chow first and leave all the little dried pieces of carrots and peas.  By the end of the day they'd eaten them but it was obvious they weren't the favored food.

review/summary: Is this really beneficial for your dog?
review/text: I decided to try this food as part of the Vine Program for my schnauzer.  Manufacturers can say anything they want and the burden of proof is on you (the consumer).  In the end, what you choose to feed your dog boils down to whether the dog likes the food, the food's nutritional content and ingredients and the track record of the dog food manufacturer.<br /><br />The 15.5 pound bag is a good size, and there is a zip top for re-sealing the bag.  I kept mine in a large plastic container for additional freshness.  One of the first things I did was review the ingredient list.  This product starts with ground yellow corn (not digestible by dogs), followed by chicken by-product meal.  We all know what chicken-by product is, so I won't go there, but keep in mind that this is "pet grade" meat by-product.  Corn gluten and wheat/rice/soy flour are fillers or binders and offer little nutritional value.  Beef tallow preserved with mixed tocopherols is an ingredient used to make dog food palatable to dogs.  It is essentially rendered cow fat, the same kind used to make soap and candles.  I am happy to see beef listed in the ingredients, but unhappy to see sorbitol and sugar.  Tricalcium phosphate is an anti-caking agent that supplies some calcium.  Animal digest is another form of rendered animal tissue for flavoring.  I noted quite a few preservatives in this food as well: sorbic acid, calcium propionate.  There are also a lot of added colors and dl-methionine which is given to dogs to keep the pH of their urine from damaging grass.  Finally, there is an amino acid derivative (Lysine) and some dried vegetables and vitamins thrown in for good measure.  I suppose the addition of these ingredients make the food a source of "balanced nutrition."<br /><br />Although my schnauzer would eat most anything, and it would be easy for me to write a review that says how much my dog loved devouring this food, I cannot overlook the ingredients.  The ingredients are low quality, and many or most of them have been linked to one allergy or another.  As for Purina, their track record is also something I would suggest you research.  This product is OK if you aren't concerned with what you feed your dog, or if you are in a situation that prevents you from buying more expensive alternatives.  I would add the gentle suggestion that it may be more cost effective to provide your dog with a better source of nutrition to prevent costly vet bills down the road.  I would recommend going to a pet type store and checking out the alternatives.  You might be surprised that for a few bucks more you can get a dog food with a much better ingredient list.  And if you're like me and the dog is part of the family, you will be better off in the long run.

review/text: Yes, my dog loves this.  Is it good for him?  Probably not.  A little research confirmed my suspicions.  I guess it's a little better than the cheapest dog foods out there, but the ingredients are still low-end and rather disgusting.  Still, if you want nutritious and healthy dog food, you are going to have to pay for it, about two to three times what this costs.

review/summary: Colorful and chewy food, but not sure it's any better than our usual food.
review/text: We usually buy our dog food from the feed store, in very large bags.  When the Beneful Originial Dog Food arrived, I was impressed by the colorful bits and the chewy chunks, which looked more appealing than the all-brown food we usually buy.<br /><br />However, when I compared the actual ingredients and nutrients, they really are about the same.  Purina's Beneful had a number one ingredient of Ground Corn, a number 2 of chicken by-product, and then more grains before the seventh ingredient of beef.  Our usual food has a number one ingredient of Chicken, then corn meal and several grains, with beef also as the seventh ingredient.  So far, that puts my food a bit ahead of the Beneful, as we prefer that meat be the first ingredient in our dog foods rather than corn.<br /><br />I felt the Beneful food to see if there really were chewy chunks in there.  Beneful has a higher moisture content than our food (14% compared to 10%) and there are some chunks that I can squeeze a bit.  That's one point for the Beneful.<br /><br />When I compared the calories, they were essentially the same.  Beneful has 360 kcal/cup and ours has 350 kcal/cup.  The breakdown of protein, fat, and other vitamins were a wash.  Beneful might be higher on this one a bit, but then it'd be lower on the next one.  Beneful had a few minerals that ours didn't list, but ours had some minerals that Beneful didn't list. Beneful DID have 3% more crude protein than our food, which may tip the score in Beneful's favor once again.<br /><br />In the end, our dog enjoys the Beneful, but I don't feel it is that much better than the food we currently buy.  We can purchase our food less expensively than the Beneful, so we will continue to use our feedstore dog food once this bag of Beneful is finished.

review/summary: Recipe changed late-2010/early-2011; still a below average food.
review/text: Beneful is a (not so) new brand of dog food by Purina for the whole let's-pretend-to-eat-healthy fad for people who want to seem like they're doing the same thing for their pets.<br /><br />While the front of the bag advertises "whole grains", "vegetables with vitamin A" and "real beef", a closer look at the ingredient list on the back of the package lists all the nasty stuff that is really in this pretend-healthy food. For starters, the first three ingredients listed on the back are: Ground Yellow Corn, Chicken by product meal, and corn gluten meal.  These ingredients are hard-to-digest fillers that make the dog feel full and chemically boost the protein count up (remember the reason behind the melanine poisoning a few years back?) but offer little to no real nutrients.  As we go further down the list of ingredients, there are non-specified sources of meat and bone meal, food colouring, wheat glutens and even propelyne glycol.  For an in-depth analysis of these ingredients and their real purpose, additional research can be done online on dog food advisor sites and even the recall analysis sites.<br /><br />While I would not call this "candy" for dogs as so many people do, it's definitely junk/fast food for dogs.  A dog can eat this food and have most of the nutrients required in its diet chemically met, but it's like raising a kid on happy meals. Chemically the nutrients are all there, but it's just not good quality nutrients and contains a lot of filler.  The result is the dog eats more because it gets hungry more and also causes it to poop more.  If one does have to feed this food to their dog, I would recommend supplementing it with healthy treats and vitamins.<br /><br />When this bag of food arrived, my (non-food obsessing) dog was immediately attracted to the bag and pawed at it and sat next to it while giving me to "look".  For the sake of testing this food, I obliged by giving her a piece or two which she immediately ate and begged for more.  A week later after being on this food, she has daily mild indigestion and has vomited small amounts of undigested food back up and poops 3x a day up from her usual 1x a day.  The poop is larger, softer and not so firm as her poop when on her previous food (California Naturals Lamb & Rice).  While she seems to like the taste/smell of this food and seems to be excited at meal times, daily vomiting and multiple poops is showing that she is not tolerant of one or multiple ingredients in this food. I will be switching her back onto her previous food that she had no problems with.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This food is not as healthy, nor does it contain high quality ingredients as the packaging and adverts claim.  There are better foods at this price point.

review/summary: Misunderstood as really healthy..
review/text: This is one of the dog foods that people think is healthy for dogs due to its marketing and packaging! Oh it has vegetables on the packaging, it must be nutritious! Sadly its rated at the bottom of most dog food rating sites as far as nutritional value ( but for a one star food a high one star food )..<br /><br />With that said my dogs loved it- I mixed a handful in with my normal Kirkland brand food and it helped enhance their appetites and they wanted more. It's priced fairly high compared to other dog foods of the same nutritional value..<br /><br />In conclusion I try to feed my dogs the best possible food nutrition wise ( without breaking the bank ).. If you want a lot of dog waste to pick up feed lower grade foods with corn meal as first ingredient ( google the importance of first ingrediants ) Beneful might be a good filler food if fed with other higher quality foods if trying to maximize your feeding

review/text: Just because a dog will eat something, doesn't mean it should.  I think Purina should be ashamed for putting this product out there, but I think they obviously only care about making a buck, not the health of animals and what their product might do to them. Looking at this bag and the ingredients made me angry.  The bag shows big chunks of beef, carrots, peas, etc.  What are the first three ingredients though?  In order they are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. Followed by whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved, rice flour, beef, soy flour, and it goes on with more digusting ingredients that don't belong in dog food including sugar and artifical colors.  I won't feed this filler/junk food to my dogs, they deserve better.

review/text: I love the idea of all the healthy ingredients in this, but here's the problem.  My dog won't eat this.  She doesn't like the taste.  If she's very, very hungry, she'll finally eat it.  Basically, when I put this out for her, I end up throwing most of it away.<br /><br />I tried mixing it with everything from canned foods to bits of meat.  She eats the canned food and bits of meat, but leaves most of the kibble behind.  Since I feared the problem was that she was getting used to the canned food/meat, I tried feeding her just this kibble for a few days.<br /><br />I had an unhappy (and hungry!) dog.<br /><br />From the human point of view, it looks fine and smells fine.  No weird aromas or anything.  But she just won't eat it.<br /><br />I wish I had something more positive to say, but this one is now in the pantry to be used for emergency. (It's officially part of the earthquake kit for now!)

I normally buy a dog food that has chicken (real chicken and not by products) as the first ingredient and I found food made in my own state using the ingredients from local farmers so it is not outsourced to other countries like China. This dog food looks good and my dog likes it but I won't buy another bag after seeing the ingredients. If the package shows good meats and vegetables then that is what it should have not mainly fillers and by products garbage.

review/summary: Better than Ol Roy or store brand foods.....
review/text: I tested this on several dogs. I feed my own dog Blue Buffalo Wilderness as she has skin/coat issues if she eats a food with grain.<br /><br />Overall the dogs ate it with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The aussie mix (mine), nosed around in it and ate a few pieces. She has eaten this food before in the past and liked it. She just loves her Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />Before we discovered that my dog's crusty skin and constant scratching were caused by grain, I had fed my dog this food, and several other foods off the shelves at the store (like Iams, Chef Michael, PurinaOne, etc.). There were coupons for various brands and I took advantage of them to try them. Unfortunately CORN is the first ingredient in this food, and if your pet has allergies to grain or grasses, this food isn't going to help them. But if I had to recommend this food over any Ol Roy or 'value brand' store brand cheap food, I would pick this one over those any day of the week. At least it has SOME meat products in it.

review/text: We've been giving our Brittany Costco brand heavy meat dog food. He doesn't particularly like it, but the first ingredient is lamb, and he certainly eats it. I thought I'd try this stuff instead, and I'm shocked- he digs in like crazy. I can barely keep him from the bowl after I put it in. On taste, it must be a home run.<br /><br />It loses a star, however, due to the first ingredient, corn. Oh, and the third ingredient, corn. And the fourth, flour. Dogs aren't omnivores, and I've yet to see one farm any corn, let alone domesticate a crop and turn it into a staple grain, plus harvest it, blah blah. Dogs aren't meant to eat that much corn. I'll spend the extra for real meat, and keep searching until I find a brand he loves to eat.

review/summary: Nothing special...dogs weren't impressed
review/text: How do you review a dog food that you aren't even going to taste yourself?  Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina (this product), Chef Michael's Sirloin (fancy stuff), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).<br /><br />Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but Chef Michael got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the Beneful or others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give up the CM.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  The Beneful was the most colorful and interesting "looking", but it didn't make them appear interested. Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.<br /><br />As far as the next day, there was leftover Beneful, so the blue jays that look for freebies were checking it out. They liked it.  I don't think it's a bad dog food, but given the options, they were just not interested in Beneful (although I like the commercials!).<br /><br />One thing that bugged me (slightly) was that I was told that both corn and oatmeal make dogs coats itch...not sure if that's true, but Beneful seems to make a big deal out of their veggie ingredients.  Dogs are carnivores.  I couldn't help but think maybe the bag and advertising was intended to impress people with the ingredients, rather than the dogs.  They've been eating this since the Chef Michael ran out, and I didn't notice any itching, and I also didn't notice too much doggy doo-doo, which often is excessive with cheap dog food.  So I would think it's a quality product, just not in comparison.<br /><br />An unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online, if it's Prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free...so no lugging it from the store.  I like that convenience of that, and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on Amazon so that I don't have to run out when when we frequently run out.

review/text: First the positives - shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged. The bag itself is very durable and appealing to the eyes.  The food is multi colored and looks lovely in the bowl as well, AND the dog liked it (but he isn't very fussy either).<br /><br />The negatives are - #1 - it's just not a healthy choice for a dog long-term, in my opinion. It might be okay on an occasional basis if you were to mix it with some home-cooked rice and chicken etc.  The first (3) ingredients are: ground corn meal, chicken - BY PRODUCT, and Corn gluten meal.  It also has added chemicals from food dye used to make the food look more visually appealing.<br /><br />I would never choose to feed my dog this product on a daily basis, but glad I had a chance to have the dog sample it and learn more about it, so we could make an informed decision going forward.

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: PROS:<br />- Dog loves it, eats it up. Varying size snacks makes it a good fit for almost any size dog<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Not very "beneful" - anything with the top two ingredients being "Ground yellow corn" and "chicken by-product meal" is not nutritious. For those unfamiliar with "chick by-product" it is (according to wikipedia) "rendered parts of poultry carcasses and can contain bones, offal (internal organs), undeveloped eggs" and possibly feathers. And ground yellow corn is essentially just another non-nutritious filler.<br /><br />- Expensive. Obviously Purina is trying to market this dog food as a higher-end healthy product, but since it's actually not, and priced about the same as much healthier alternatives, it is incredibly expensive for something so cheap. I would recommend this product instead: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6">Nature's Variety Prairie Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Medley, 30-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />- Some pieces too big for small dogs.<br /><br />OVERALL: Not recommended. Your dog will eat it up, but won't be healthier because of it. For the same price, get something that actually is healthy and not just marketed that way.

review/summary: Dog likes it, but ingredients could be better...
review/text: I tried this food after switching my dog from another food that left him with a dry, flaky coat and apparently wasn't very satisfying because he was always hanging around the kitchen begging for more food. I did a slow transition into Beneful, mixing some of his old food, with the new food over the course of a week. Clearly he likes the taste because he gobbles it down and leaves nothing behind. I have noticed his coat is already looking better and he seems less hungry after meals, which is great because he's not begging all the time. The zipper top bag is very convenient because I don't have to worry about the food drying out before it's gone. Price-wise, it's a good value for this size bag. On the negative side, I was very disappointed to see corn as the first and third ingredients and the second being "chicken-by-product meal". I usually try to stick with pet foods that have real meat as the first or second ingredient and avoid anything with "by-products" or fillers, especially if it's listed in the first several ingredients of the food. As happy as I am he seems to be doing well on Beneful, I'd feel better about giving it to him if there was more pure meat and less corn, fillers and random by-products that aren't adding any significant value to his diet.<br /><br />5-stars for taste<br />4-stars for how he's doing on the food<br />4-stars for price<br />2.5 stars for ingredient list

review/summary: Where is the "protein-rich" nutrition?
review/text: It's so hard to balance price vs quality when it comes to dog food - but I've started erring on the side of quality as of late. I feel that with good quality dog food where some type of meat is the first ingredient my dog is fuller quicker, is happier and overall healthier, which equals less trips to the vet for an upset stomach (upset stomach happened too often with my small dog).<br /><br />Dogs do like Beneful and my dog will happily eat it. The packaging/resealable function is great as well. However, the poor ingredients are just not worth it to me. If you go on the Beneful site, you'll see claims of "Protein-rich nutrition, with real beef". However, look closer at the ingredients and you'll see that they start with: "ground yellow corn, chicken-by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat, rice flour", etc. BEEF does not actually enter the picture until ingredient #7...

review/summary: Only ate if hand fed
review/text: I was expecting slightly better ingredients.  I did not expect for the majority of the ingredients to be  fillers; I expected proteins.  Dogs are omnivores leaning to the carnivore end of the spectrum.<br /><br />The package was shipped in an appropriately sized box and had air pillows to minimize crushing.  Not receiving dog food dust was nice.  I was disappointed in the product packaging itself.  There was supposed to be a zippered seal, but the sliding mechanism was missing.  Now my pantry reeks of dog food.<br /><br />Now, the most important part. . . Did my dog like Beneful?  Yes, if I hand fed her or if she were truly hungry.  She seemed to prefer the soft bits, digging around the others to eat them first.  Plus, I have to stay with her while she eats to encourage (trick) her into eating.  Sigh, I have better things to do than beg my dog to eat.

review/summary: Should Have Read the Ingredient List First
review/text: I am not one to holler "Poison" if a dog food contains soy or corn meal but I won't give them a dog food with some form of meal, flour, and fat as the first six ingredients.  This is about as bad a list of ingredients as I've seen.<br /><br />The first five ingredients on the dry food I've been feeding my dogs, Solid Gold Barking at the Moon, a popular (but more expensive) dog food, are Ocean Fish Meal, Beef, Potatoes, Pea Protein, Canola Oil, Dried Eggs, and Tomato Pomace.<br /><br />You don't have to pay three times as much to get a super premium brand but I wouldn't feed them a product that doesn't have meat as the first ingredient.

review/summary: Too Much Filler
review/text: I don't mind chicken by-product for dogs, but when it comes to corn/wheat, I don't want it making up such a large portions.  Also not a fan of food coloring.  Dogs will eat this food and they'll live long lives on this food.  Is it a top tier food for dogs?  Not even close.  This dog food is good enough but personally I'd keep shopping since meat isn't listed as the first ingredient.  Sure they add vitamin and mineral supplements but since corn/wheat isn't part of natural dog diet, I simply do not want such high contents for a dog.  I do like that the bag has a quick zip on it to seal in freshness.  The price seems reasonable as well.  Indeed the bag makes it appear as if this food is really healthy, but dogs require a different diet than humans, so do research the essentials (and quantities) before you buy dog food.

review/summary: Not Bad, But Won't Get Again
review/text: Be it mutt or pure-breed, most dog owners are rather picky about what they feed their animals. I know that my mother goes to extremes when feeding her poodle, grinding up fresh veggies and chicken once a day.<br /><br />I don't think she'd buy PURINA's Beneful Origianl Dog Food for him though. Lets look at that ingredient list again; Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, ...beef is the SEVENTH listed ingredient. I'm pretty sure that means it makes up very little of the contents of the 15 lb. bag. PURINA claims the nutrition is 'balanced' and I am sure that in some objective way it is, but dogs are carnivores and a food that is mostly ground yellow corn isn't exactly what I'd call ideal. I'm sure it is as good or better than many generics or store brands, but for the added cost you might as well spend a little more and get a truly [[ASIN:B00139TT72 healthy] dog food.<br /><br />I suppose it is decent mid-range nutrition though. And my mutt seems to like it, though he isn't picky and eats Publix brand dry dog food with about the same gusto. The 15 lb. bag is a good size for a small to mid-sized canine and the re-sealable "ziplock" top is handy. I wouldn't get Beneful Original if you are very picky about your pet's nutrition, nor if you are a value oriented dog food buyer. It falls somewhere in-between and I'm not sure it's higher price tag is justified.

review/summary: There are WAY better options
review/text: mmmmm no. The first 2 ingredients are corn meal and the notorious 'chicken by-product meal.' This is one of those things that has a name that makes it sound good, but it's really not. We try it occasionally when we can't find our preferred foods (usually ProPlan, which is in the same price arena, but occasionally the fancier kinds), and it makes our dog (a 60ish-lb hound mutt) poop like CRAZY each time. She usually goes only 1-2 times each day, but when she eats this she gets the runny poops and goes 5 times a day or more. Can't be making her feel awesome.<br /><br />I was told by a friend years ago that his vet told him that Beneful is "like potato chips for dogs" and I believe it. Tastes great I'm sure, but not a whole lot of goodness in there. Also, as other commenters have said, the suggested serving size of this is larger than for better dog food, so IF you follow those rules, the savings isn't as great as you'd think.

review/summary: What I noticed was the smell
review/text: I'm sorry; I can't say the dog likes this brand of food better.<br />She does eat it as well as any other dry type,<br />but not better that I can see.<br />She has been a bit off her chow lately though.<br />The smell kind of put me off.
