review/summary: A great treat
review/text: My young Havapoo was very unhappy when I put him in his cage at night.<br />After I bought this product for him as a treat before going to bed, he is readily willing to enter his cage, munch a few little pieces of the dried liver and go to sleep quite happy. I can recommend this product to all pet lovers.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but pieces aren't sized uniformly and they melt when wet
review/text: I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the "special" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as "hypnotic" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart.

review/summary: Really good treats for training
review/text: I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.

review/text: It is a great product. It is very nutritional and our dogs absolutely love them. My only issue is that it is outrageously expensive. It is about four times as expensive as coffee per pound, and coffee is already expensive. Liver is a very cheap meat so why $25 per pound. Our problem is our dogs will do anything to get one of these treats, so were stuck.

review/summary: All Natural and Dogs Love them
review/text: We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver "dust" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this "dust" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted.

review/text: We have a miniature Dachshund named Buck. We used this product to house and obedience train him. Now we use this as his daily treat, and he loves it! My Vet. told me this is a nearly prefect low fat treat. As a result of using Pro-Treat, we hardly ever have to use a leash while walking Buck. If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices. It ranges from powder to 1 inch square, and every thing in between. I have done lots of research and Amazon is the best place to buy this stuff

review/summary: Great liver treats-extra benefits for white dogs
review/text: These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.

review/text: These dog treats are great motivators. At first the price seems high, but they last a long time because only a few need to be used in each training session. The piece sizes are not uniform, so I often break larger ones in half. The only downside is a tendency to crumble if you carry them in a pants pocket for too long.

review/text: When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss.

review/summary: Training Reward-High Protein and Non-greasy
review/text: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping.

review/summary: Rolls Royce of dog treats.......
review/text: This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!

review/text: Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.

review/text: Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats / B000255OIG<br /><br />This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them "puppy heroin". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Dogs LOVE it!!  Plus it is healthy...
review/text: My dog would do anything for his liver treats!  ...and whenever any of his playmates are out for a walk they drag their owners to our house so they can have a liver treat as well (in fact most of their owners now buy it for them).  It is healthy, a great training treat, and they all love it!

review/text: The dog loves these treats. But why is this particular package size not sealed? All other size packages of this product are strongly sealed, so that a plastic rib must be torn off to remove the lid. At least some tape could be used around the lid on this size. Please consider doing something to provide assurance against tampering.

review/text: We have been using these treats for a very long time, decades, and find they are accepted by almost any of our pets: dog, cat or ferret. They are their reward for taking their meds nicely. We prefer the largest size tubs for economy and convenience, which are usually not available at the pet stores. Thank you for carrying these.

review/summary: Travis loves them; inconsistent in size.
review/text: I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4" - 1" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING.

review/text: My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)

review/text: I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again.

review/summary: Great treat to use as a high value reward!
review/text: My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/text: I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats.

review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/summary: My dog would do anything for this treat
review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

review/text: How can you go wrong with a 100% fruit snack that is both crunchy and delicious? The three flavors are all great. Granny Smiths are a little tart (in a good way), Fujis are sweet, and Cinnamon are absolutely delicious. I give the 15g bags to my kids. Equal to one apple. What a perfect snack! I feel great giving it to them. I eat the 48g with lunch. Filling and low calorie. Hope it helps.

review/summary: Crunchy Yummy Tart Chips
review/text: *****<br />These apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.<br /><br />I would recommend (and it's way more economical) to buy these in bulk. If you like tart apples at all, and you like your chips crispy, then you have nothing to lose.<br /><br />Note: Each of the many dried fruits that are prepared and processed by Bare Fruits--each one is different--some are chewy, some crispy, but all are natural and vary as the natural fruits vary. In my opinion, their brand would tend to appeal to people who like things without added sugars and preservatives and whose taste buds and teeth can handle less processed food. The apple chips are very easy on the teeth, though...just so you know, not every product is like that<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Take pride in your grits!
review/text: I'll admit, I don't do the cooking in my house. I do some of the eating, though, and these grits are YUMMY! They are the only brand my fiancee (the house chef) buys and he cooks grits a few times per week. We like them with a bit of Earth Balance and some Himala Salt.<br /><br />Living in area where grits are not common, I'm glad to be able to have them whenever I want and however I want (sometimes, when there's extra, I put them in the fridge for the next day - still just as yummy!).<br /><br />PS - I had a problem with the shipping of another Bob's Red Mill product and I called the company. They were very friendly and provided me with excellent customer service.<br /><br />So, I recommend both the company AND it's grits!<br /><br />I rely on Amazon's reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you in the same manner.

review/summary: Fabulous Bread...
review/text: This is a fabulous bread mix.  It makes a 2 lb loaf at the price of a 1 lb loaf from the store and much better.  The only alteration to the instructions was to "proof" the yeast before mixing.  I put 3/4 c warm liquid (milk, etc.) w/1 of the tablespoons of sugar in a cup w/yeast while I mix the other ingredients.  This bread doesn't need to be toasted and makes great sandwiches.  My family and friends have eaten it at my house and enjoyed it.  I have used it since they introduced it last year and don't bother with other mixes anymore.  Their other products I have tried (cornbread and brownies) are the best.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/text: As a tea lover, I was ecstatic to find a herbal peppermint tea on the cheaper end of the spectrum. Normally, I stay as far away from 'cheaper' tea as possible, but I was glad to give this product a shot. The cool after taste is immediately evident, and the natural flavor of the peppermint soothes everything. It helps me sleep better, and have a fresh start for the day. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent Sun Dried Tomatoes
review/text: Ever since we returned from Melbourne Australia, there are certain grocery products that we got accustomed to there that are not readily available here. With the large Italian section in Melbourne, we would simply go to the Italian butcher or grocer. The product itself was excellent.They are superb in salads, appetizers, etc.<br /><br />MAJOR difficulty trying to open the 2 lb jar. I couldn't open it, my wife couldn't open it, my daughter-in-law couldn't open it. What to do-ran it under hot water-no help.Lightly tapped closure on a cutting board-no help, not so gentle taps-no help. I went to my tool box and came back with a pair of 10" channel locks and got it open. From my experience in the glass manufacturing industry, this problem can be caused by getting over-spill of the product on the sealing threads or the glass manufacture getting his tin coating on the finish of the container.

review/summary: Highly Sophistimicated Doo-Whacky
review/text: Apparently God has a twisted sense of humor, because to date, I have not been able to unscrew the lid. I tried hot water, I did a little jig, I even offered to give up my first-born son--yet apparently he is not a fair trade for 2 pounds of Italian sun-dried goodness. The kicker? I bought five of these. (I was disappointed to see that this product was offered in a 6 pack and in singles, but nothing in between. I needed a pack of 2.5 or 5 because one of my three children is really just a step-child, and she needs to know that, even though she is growing on me with age--like my bald spot.)<br /><br />It would have been a shame to throw these away just because I couldn't open the lid, so I tied two to each end of a sturdy rod to make a highly sophistimicated 8 lb dumbbell, perfect for shoulder raises. Of course, I removed the labels first. I don't want to look like some kind of idiot.

review/summary: My cat loves this, I'd love it if the chicken was from the USA
review/text: This is shredded and looks (and smells) exactly like human food, with a little gravy mixed in. My Maine Coon recently started losing her hair, we assumed she developed a food allergy to the dry Iams she'd been eating most her life. Switched her over to some grain-free  Blue Buffalo dry and her fur came back. She didn't care for any of the Blue Buffalo canned foods, so on a whim I picked up a few cans of this Earthborn at the local pet store. She loves it, so I give her 1/2 canned and the other 1/2 of her daily food ration of the Blue Buffalo. This is one of the very few canned foods she can keep down with her sensitive tummy.<br /><br />Edited August 26: I'm torn about this chicken not being from the USA. When I first purchased this food, the rep from Earthborn told me all the food was made in Evansville, IN. Yesterday I went to buy more, there was a Catcciatori Chicken box turned upside down in the store and it said Made in Thailand. My first thought was the BOX was made in Thailand, but I picked up a can and even though it said "Distributed by....Evansville, IN" on the can, also printed sideways in TINY lettering I had NEVER noticed before was "made in Thailand". I contacted Earthborn about this on their Facebook page and basically got the runaround as to why they can't use USA-grown chickens.

review/summary: Fine Nutrition, Outstanding Price, The Best Service
review/text: This was a wonderful find. My wife absolutely loves this particular cereal brand, and the price was far below that found in a retail grocery store. A minor glitch was encountered when the package arrived. Several of the containers in the box had been broken and the product spilled. I immediately called customer service, and to my great surprise, instead of merely replacing the broken containers, Amazon replaced the entire order, and I didn't even ask them to do that. I would have been perfectly happy with the former.  I've been dealing with Amazon for many years, and have come to expect great service, but this most recent experience clearly far exceeded my expectations. In my opinion, you simply have to search far and wide to find this caliber of seller. Amazon ranks among the top 3 or 4 of my absolute favorite sites at which to shop. I strongly recommend them for their broad product availability, their extremely competitive prices, their fast shipping, and their superior customer service.

review/summary: great product - poor packaging
review/text: We love this brand of oat bran, we also eat a lot of it. Our local stores offers this for a highly inflated price, and half the time it is not available. I decided to see if Amazon offers it, and I was excited that not only did they offer it, but they also have a descent price when calculating per item. Unfortunately, the way it is shipped, occasionally a tub or two gets opened in shipping. This has happened to me twice now. I don't like to eat contaminated food, so I throw away the opened tubs. The first time this happened, Amazon provided amazing customer service to fix the problem, so I bought again through Amazon. The second time it happened, I did the math, and decided I am still saving enough money even with one tub less. I'm sure Amazon would honor the problem again, though I would rather they would just fix the packaging instead.

review/text: I have been a big fan of Annie's products for some time. I like that I can have the Mac and Cheese experience but just a little healthier. The only draw back is that I have found that the other Annie's products tend to be a little salty. Some people may not notice it much but I don't use salt in my cooking so, to me, it is very noticeable.<br /><br />Now the good news. Annie's have finally licked the salt problem. Pun intended. Not only is this truly an Organic, easy to make, Mac and Cheese, but they have got the saltiness issue resolved.<br /><br />I am so pleased with the quality and taste of this new line that I will continue to buy this line of products in the future. The sauce quality is the same consistency. The noodle quality is the same. But the saltiness is gone. And the best part it is organic.<br /><br />If you want a quality, organic alternative to the "blue box" Mac and Cheese. Here it is.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Keep up the good work Annie's.

review/summary: Makes great dipping oil for home baked bread!
review/text: I really don't know how this spice is used traditionally, but a friend of mine introduced me to Zahtar. I mix this spice with cold pressed olive oil and a bit of salt to make a dipping oil for my home baked bread, and it's awesome! This was priced really good compared to ethnic food stores, and the amount lasts me for couple months.

review/summary: Finally found this spice
review/text: Read about this spice several years ago in the Wall Street Journal in an article concerning chefs' secret ingredients. Zahtar was one of them. Now that I found it on Amazon, I'm glad I bought it. It has an unusual flavor that is pleasant. One should try new things: this is one of them. Excellent.

review/text: I ordered these to help in the training of my two dogs. They are great because they are small and they dissolve shortly after the dogs get them in their mouths. No waiting for them to chew during training. They were exactly what I wanted, and ordered, and were shipped out right away. I had them within a few days of placing the order. I would order from them again.

review/summary: Perfect size snacks for Dog Toy
review/text: Until recently I was purchasing these snacks at my local Pet Supermarket. They no longer carry them so I went to Amazon.com. The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!

review/summary: Buddie Bits Review
review/text: My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.
