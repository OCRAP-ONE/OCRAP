review/summary: Loved the Belly Flops
review/text: The kids and my co-workers loved this.  I put them in a jar on my desk, with a list of the different flavors off your website, with a spoon and some dixie cups.  My co-workers dig through and we all find what we like.  We know there are only about 4-5 flavors in a bag but we then get to play the figure it out game and see what we like or don't - the kids liked them all.  We loved it all in all!!

We love the surprise of not knowing what will be in the bag. Thank you Jelly Belly for making these available online. It's about time! Also, glad to see that if we order more than 2 you'll throw into the box a mix of assortments. My belly is now happy!

review/summary: Not enough variety, but what weird shapes!
review/text: Jelly Belly jelly beans have become the favorite snack for my piano students, but have noticed that their parents cannot resist combining several flavors to make your "recipes"!  So I thought I would try the Belly Flops, but we were all quite disappointed to see the lack of variety in two packages.  I hope you do a better job this time!  By the way, my students love the misshapen Flops!

review/summary: Not a real variety
review/text: I bought 2 bags and they were 90% chocolate pudding--and I really can't stand that flavor, so I gave them to my mom.  But she did say that they were good, and so did her co-workers. They taste the same, I'm sure, but I can't say since none of the flavors I like were in the bags.  The bags were huge though--2 LBS of Jelly Bellies.

review/summary: Belly Flops are not that great of a value
review/text: I love Jelly Bellys, I am certifiable addict. I originally thought Belly Flops were a terrific value, I ordered 2 bags and with shipping the total was almost $22. I was at Costco the other day and happened to stumble upon a plastic tub of Jelly Bellys which were not defect and their total price for 4 pounds, the same equivalence as 2 two-pound bags of flops, was  about $15. I'd recommend getting them at Costco if thats possible--more variety, better taste, and you don't have to pay for shipping, or wait. It's a win win!

NO, mostly all one color not the varity I expected. I feel they ship out the ones that won't visually sell at the factory in their gift shop. I was very disappointed as I had to through the bag out because they were inedible. I won't buy again through the mail.

review/summary: Thanks Mr. president
review/text: I discovered Jelly Bellys when Ronald Reagan was president. I discovered Belly Flops a few years ago. Jelly Belly can do no wron as far as I'm concerned. Even the strange tasting beans are good. Believe it or not, my Labrador and I eat them while watching old movies on TV. I hold one in my fingers and he takes it gently from my hand. We agree that they are great and, cost effective. Be sure to brush your teeth though because I have it on good authority from my brother in law (a dentist) that they contain a lot of good old fashioned sugar. Belly flops forever!

review/summary: A Fun (and Tasty) Conversation Piece!
review/text: We've been huge fans of Jelly Belly for years, and we recently decided to try our the BellyFlops - partly as a way to save some money on our addiction, and partly just for fun.  We ordered two of the 2-lb bags, and both of them looked to have a good mix of flavors.  While not every flavor is represented, we do have a nice variety, and some of the flavors appear to be from the special lines like the Sours, which we wouldn't normally get in a mixed bag.<br /><br />For the most part, the beans just seem to be misprints.  The signature Jelly Belly stamp is missing, or the colorful spots on a Tutti-Fruitti bean are not very apparent, but there are some of those crazy monster globs in there!  They do look crazy, but they taste fine.  For the 2-3 bean conglomerates, it's kind of like eating one of those larger jelly beans you traditionally get at Easter.  For larger lumps, you might want to eat them in bites!  (We just ran into an enormous 10-bean fusion!)<br /><br />The best part about the Belly Flops, however, is that they're unique!  I remember years ago when Jelly Belly was harder to find and the concept of a Buttered Popcorn or Strawberry Daiquiri flavored jelly bean was still a novelty that sparked people's interest and got them excited about trying all the different flavors.  The Belly Flops seem to recreate this same reaction!  We took one of our bags to a party, and once we explained what they were, everyone was eager to dive in and see what kinds of unusual beans they encountered.  The Flops made a great conversation piece and really got people laughing and talking!

I don't know how many flavors they have, but I don't think it could be any more of an assorted bag.  Just about every bean is a different flavor in there.  So save yourself the 8 bucks and the 2 week shipping hassle and just go buy a bag at the 99 cent store! :)

review/text: This candy arrived today, and after reading some negative reviews AFTER I ordered, I checked it  VERY carefully.  Some were irregular in shape, indeed, as had been reported, but not to the extent they won't be appreciated by our 5 grandchildren on Valentine's Day.  Of course, we'll tell them that these are "special" jelly bellies that, like some of us, are not made "perfectly".  But, that won't affect the taste.  Also, consider that it is winter, and the candy travels better in cold weather vs. hot.  P.S.  Don't forge to brush your teeth after eating!  :)

review/text: The belly flops were awesome.  I wanted more as soon as I ate the last one.  I have no complaints about them.  The only problem I had was that I received them at least a month after I ordered them...apparently there was a &#34;glich&#34; in their system.  I was very happy when they arrived though! I just placed my 2nd order & I'm trying the pomegranate ones too.  Didn't care for the fruit gems, going over there to write a review now.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: After reading the other reviews, I was very worried about ordering this.  But, it was much better than I anticipated.  I had all different colors and flavors.  It seemed that the resaon the ones I received were flops was that they seemed to be connected.  Two or three same colored (flavored) jelly beans that were attached.  I did have to sort these out since they wouldn't work in my jelly belly machine, but otherwise I was very happy with the product.  I still think that the cost was extremely high though.  I don't know if I would purchase these again for that reason.

I think I will send a batch to each of my children for Christmas this year, with a suggestion that because we are all comfortable financially, we should probably skip presents and instead all chip in and make a charitable contribution of the money we would have spent on presents.

review/text: The packet says "Contains Two Servings". The instructions call for 6 oz hot water to 3 "heaping" tablespoons of the cocoa powder. Both packets I opened contained less than 5 rounded tablespoons, which definitely doesn't equal "Two Servings". 3 heaping teaspoons makes an adequate cuppa, but only adequate. Add 1 tsp to get a good flavor. And by the way, the instructions say "Watch it magically trun purple" It turns an unhealthy shade of pale blue grey. Really pretty lame stuff, & the seller hasn't bothered to respond, which makes them lamer than this crap. BTW, I just hoticed that my review of this seller has "been removed". I didn't remove it.

Obviously this is not the effect for the majority of drinkers, but I would have wanted to have been warned myself before buying it.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

Between the two boxes we received 3 Yodas, 7 R2D2s, 3 General Grievouses, 1 Anakin, 5 C3POs, 1 Clonetrooper and 4 Aserkas.  I think our partygoers will be pleased.  Incidentally, my order was placed with "AlwaysDirect" through Amazon.com.

review/summary: Smokehouse Chicken Barz 26015
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVUQAW">Smokehouse 26015 Chicken Barz 16oz Resealabe</a><br />Be careful when selecting Chicken Barz from Smokehouse.  It is not the same as the product that I usually purchase from local pet stores.  These strips are full of tough sinewy pieces which my dog has problems digesting. There is another product from Smokehouse with the same name, but different item number.  It is also priced much higher and is probably the same product found in pet stores. The next time that I purchase Smokehouse products from Amazon, I'll make sure to order the more expensive item.

review/summary: Tough To Digest
review/text: I have 2 dogs.  A Chow and a Berner.  These Smokehouse Chicken Barz make the Chow sick everytime she eats one. She throws up within 30 mins of eating a strip. I no longer give them to her. She has never had a problem with other chicken strip brands. My Berner has absolutely no problem with them at all.  She loves them and they never upset her stomach.  It probably depends on the dog.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite Treat
review/text: These treats look like chicken, smell like chicken, and contain only chicken.  There are other chicken tenders on the market that do not smell or look like chicken so I doubt they really contain chicken.<br /><br />My dog loves them.  Sometimes I take them to the dog park to share. I have yet to met a dog that does not like these treats.

review/summary: PRE-COOKED!!!
review/text: I am single and like to purchase individually packaged meat so I can just grill it on my George Forman.  I ordered pork and salmon from Omaha Steaks and they were individual vacume packed and uncooked.  I have looked everywere, thinking that I missed it, but there is no indication on this site that these are precooked; heating via microwave is not an option since it ruins the meat and why would I use an oven to heat up one chicken breast.  Very disappointed!!!

review/summary: Smoky, Tasty, Bacony
review/text: I mean to give this product four stars, though the interface is giving me a little trouble. I'm very fond of it. I can't have bacon in my household, and this sausage, while not replicating the texture of bacon, does suggest that smoky savory flavor when sliced thin and fried or microwaved to crispness, far better than that nasty turkey bacon does. Also, it's tasty in its own right.

review/summary: Move over Figis
review/text: For the last 15+ years, Figis.com has provided our family with what I've always thought was the best summer sausage available today.<br /><br />This Christmas, I was given a 20 ounce package of Old Wisconsin Original Summer Garlic Sausage. Without even opening it, I already made up my mind that if it's not a Figis product, it won't measure up.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong! I can't believe the quality of this summer sausage. The taste is one that cannot be described, you'll just have to try it yourself.<br /><br />Off to order more...

review/summary: Really wanted to like this, but sadly disappointed.
review/text: I have a regular monthly subscription to another brand of summer sausage available on Amazon. It's very popular with friends and family for snacking, and when the regular brand wasn't available, I purchased this one for a temporary replacement. I read through the reviews and felt this would do the trick until the regular stuff was available again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only thing the two seem to have in common is general shape and color. While the flavor isn't unpleasant, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. It's both fibrous and greasy, with globs/pockets of fat and strings of what I can only imagine to be muscle or gristle of some kind. They're like white threads, and the mouthfeel of the sliced product is very unappetizing.<br /><br />In reading through the reviews again, I saw one where the reviewer mentioned this summer sausage had potential when heated/cooked, so I sliced it thinly and tried both panfrying and microwaving it. This does improve the texture and allows the extra fat to render out (if you're microwaving, be sure to sit the pieces on top of paper towels, and don't let it go too long without checking ... LOTS of fat drains out of the meat!). After it's been heated/cooked, the product can be enjoyed for its flavor without the unpleasant texture.<br /><br />If our regular choice becomes unavailable again at some point, we'll just do without or look for something in a local grocery store. We won't be purchasing this product again.

review/summary: A Good Shelf Stable Product
review/text: For summer sausage that doesn't have to be refridgerated, this is a good choice. The rolls tend to be a little on the fatty side and the salt content is hard to miss, but the overall flavor is good and in a sandwhich or paired with cheese or crackers, it makes a good snack or meal.

review/summary: Not Really That Great....
review/text: This summer sausage was not that great.  Had a very "tangy" taste, with very little other flavor.  If it were not for the price, this would have been returned.  My dog enjoys it.<br />For real summer sausage I'll stick with the small, specialty companies.  Try Woody's Smokehouse or try the venison summer sausage from the Vermont Country Store.  Heck, even Hickory Farms is better.

review/summary: Best taste ever
review/text: I bought several of these as Christmas gifts.  They were outstanding in taste and leaness of the product.  Sometimes summer sausage can leave a very oily residue on your tongue as you eat it.  This product does not do that and is one of the best I have ever eaten.  They easily excel over Hickory Farms Beef stick which is a good product in my estimation.

review/text: Easily one of the best summer sausages i have ever tasted.  I personally like the beef version of old wisconsin summer sausage because i think it taste better than the others when broiled.  The original flavor is also good, and i would say that one is the best if you're just going to slice and eat with no broiling.  I havent tried the Garlic one yet but im sure i would love it as well.  This summer sausage easily gets 5 stars from me.

review/text: This is the best summer sausage I've had. The fact that it's gluten-free is a huge plus otherwise I wouldn't be able to eat it. Just a small piece is good for a snack but it really stands out when cut up into little pieces and sauteed with some onions and boiled cauliflower. That way you get a very tasty, high protein, low carb meal which will sustain you for a long time. We ordered this for our camping trip but ate all of the 3 sausages already ha..ha...so good, now I need to place another order.
