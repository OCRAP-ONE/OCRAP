review/summary: Stevia Extract from NOW
review/text: Great stuff, especially for those with sugar (metabolism)issues, diabetics. I use a teaspoon of product instead of a cup of sugar when I am making my decaf ice tea. Might be a bit tricky to use it to sweeten a glass of tea but making a half gallon or larger is best. I detect no aftertaste but then again I drink diet sodas.

review/summary: excellent quality for good value
review/text: Though the size of the can was somewhat intimidating, I bought these the first time because of a significant discount on Roland foods here on Amazon, and because I wanted to try Spanish piquillo peppers.<br /><br />I opened the first can at Christmas, while cooking with my vegetarian sister, and made a large batch of piquillo peppers stuffed with an herb and goat cheese mixture heated in the broiler.  They were sweet and savory and tangy, and my sister loved them.<br /><br />Those two sheet pans full of appetizers barely made a dent in the contents of that 5.5 pound can, however, so I put the remaining peppers and the oil they were packed in into a big tupperware container and tried to come up with less expensive filling options for the rest (I'm a cheapskate and goat cheese is expensive, even in my family's cheese-friendly hometown in Wisconsin!).<br /><br />By combining parts of two different stuffed bell pepper recipes that I found in my mother's church cookbooks, I was able to use up much of the leftover flat-leaf parsley from the goat cheese stuffing, along with leftover cooked rice, freshly browned hamburger, onion, garlic, oregano, and canned diced tomatoes and put together a tightly packed baking dish of stuffed piquillos with their stuffed ends upright (that took some careful packing, since their lovely little pointed tail ends make it impossible to stand them upright, unless they're packed so tightly next to their fellows that they have no room to fall over -- I didn't bother with that at all, the next time I made the dish from memory in my own kitchen, but just let them lay on their sides in a much larger baking dish, and the flavor was just fine, even if the individual stuffed peppers didn't look as fancy), covered the exposed tops with leftover canned spaghetti sauce and some parmesan and mozzarella cheese, and baked for 30 or 40 minutes, til the cheese was nice and bubbly.<br /><br />The result was VERY tasty, and I was able to use up about half of my remaining peppers.  The other half went into the freezer, double-bagged in plastic freezer bags, and when I thawed them out and made another batch of stuffed peppers with them a couple of months later, they were just as good as they'd been fresh out of the can.<br /><br />I bought another can of these peppers recently, because now that I know I can do almost ANYTHING with them (and that whatever I don't use right away will freeze beautifully in doubled-up plastic bags, to keep the olive oil from leaking out), I'm no longer afraid of the size of the can.<br /><br />The most satisfying part of this story, for me, was that I accidentally left half the leftover hamburger-and-rice stuffed peppers in my parents' refrigerator when I returned home after Christmas, and my mother phoned me a few days later to tell me that my 73-year-old father -- who HATES any kind of peppers, cooked or raw, and picks them out of any dish he finds them in -- was foraging for his supper one night when Mom was late getting home, and in desperation heated up some of my leftover stuffed peppers, LOVED them, and promptly heated up and ate up half of the large container of them I'd left in the fridge.<br /><br />Now Mom and I know that even people who say they hate all peppers can fall in love with these tender, sweet, fire-roasted peppers, and they've become a staple in my pantry.  Why go through the hassle of cooking pasta for lasagna or stuffed shells, or other casseroles, when roasted peppers right out of the can or the freezer will make an even better-tasting dish (and sneak a bit of extra vegetable into dear old Dad's supper)?

review/text: Royal "Bilingal" Strawberry Gelatin is the same product as Royal ("English Language") Strawberry Gelatin, but in English/Spanish packaging.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />Good strawberry flavor.  Mixes easily, makes 4 cups.  I like gelatin a little firmer, so I use only 3 cups of water, which I microwave for 5 minutes in a 4-cup measuring cup and then mix-in the Royal Gelatin.  I find a mini-mixer very handy for mixing the gelatin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E39LYO">Norpro Cordless Mini Mixer, 5 Piece Set</a><br /><br />ADD FRUIT<br />The strawberrry gelatin is particularly great with real (diced) strawberries which are usually too sour.  The gelatin adds just the right sweetness.<br /><br />JIGGLERS<br />You can make very firm "jigglers" for kids by using only 2 cups of water, or almost "Gummi-Bear" candies by using only 1 one cup of water.  Consider using candy molds  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VPW0V8">Freshware 30-Cavity Silicone Chocolate, Jelly and Candy Mold</a><br />Norpro Cordless Mini Mixer, 5 Piece Set.<br /><br />PREPARING FOR A COLONOSCOPY<br />Take a steak, cut into small strips, and then boil it to heck in 2-3 cups of water. Add a tablespoon or so of Braggs Aminos instead of salt. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U2SGWQ">Bragg's Liquid Aminos, 32 Oz.</a>.  Strain. Discard the boiled meat (or use it for cat/dog food). Chill the liquid. Remove the solid layer of fat from the top. Walla!! "beef jello" (aka jellied consumme). Really! Gelatin is animal connective tissue---and there is lots of in a steak. Beef gelatin is surprisingly satisfying and filling, and will easily hold you overnight until the terrifying "event" is over. Obviously, beef gelatin is a terrific food for older folks who can't chew or have trouble swallowing. You can also drink it hot as a broth, however chilling and gelling has the advantage of separating out the fat (on the top) and the fine solids (as a layer on the bottom) which could interfere with your colonoscopy.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Royal Strawberry Gelatin?  It makes the point that both are the same thing--animal connective tissue, and that gelatin is a good food for the day-before-the-colonoscopy. Many folks eat a packet of Knox unflavored gelatin every day to improve their joints, skin, hair, and nails.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQTD2">Knox Original Gelatin (32-Count Envelopes), Unflavored, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.  And you can use the Knox to make your own gelatin desserts with real fruit juice, etc., or even mixed with bullion to make beef gelatin.  However, Royal flavored gelatin mixes are much cheaper than unflavored gelatin---so why not have a cup of flavored gelatin every evening for desert? (and rationalize it as "medicine" for your joints, nails, hair, and skin.)<br /><br />DRINKS<br />You can use Royal Gelatin to make fruit-flavored punch or drinks.  The results are similar to "Kool-Aide", but with more "body".  You can mix flavored gelatin with bottled selzer water for a sparkling "strawberry soda"--which is more satisfying ("fills you up") much better than the completely empty calories of "strawberry soda".  A 2.8 oz packette of Royal Gelatin will make about 8 cups of "strawberry drink" or "soda".<br /><br />VEGETARIANS<br />Vegetarians may shun gelatin as an animal product, but many vegetarians will eat dairy products as a way to get needed nutrients without actually eating meat, and will take glucosamine-chondroitin (animal cartilage, similar to gelatin) for their joints.  Gelatin is not quite in the same category as "cheese", but it is a good way to get some of the benefits of meat without the cholesterol, etc. of meat.<br /><br />VALUE<br />1 oz packages (of 4 envelopes) of Knox unflavored gelatin (which makes 4 cups of gelatin), sells for $1.49 each at my local Publix.  That's equivalent to one 2.8 oz package of Royal Gelatin (the extra 1.8 oz is sugar and flavoring) which sells for $0.89 at my local Publix or $0.98 from Amazon ($11.82 / 12) at this time.  The equivalent 4-cup Jello brand package consisting of 3.0oz, but is considerably more expensive.

review/summary: Quality canned fish, but is it sprats?
review/text: Sprats are not a common meal in Colorado, but I was given a recipe which looked good, and I do like other canned fish (such as sardines, herring, kippers, etc), so I ordered this brand known for its quality.  The fish was a little soft, but the flavour mild and pleasant, and the canned packed full.  The olive oil is key for nutritional value, especially when used in salad or a casserole.  What confuses me, and why I gave four instead of five stars, is that the ingredient list on the can says "Smoked Brisling Sardines."  Online references say that sardines and sprats are different small fish, but when I phoned the company they disagree.  Whatever the fish, I recommend these if you want a convienent nutrienet dense safe seafood.

review/summary: Smooth as silk
review/text: I just found Starbucks Kcups in Bed/Bath/Beyond (also in Target) and of course I had to grab them on the spot!  I tried the House Blend and, unlike other Starbucks flavors, this is very smooth and not at all bitter or "burnt" like the Pike Place blend.  This flavor didn't require nearly as much sweetening and, since it isn't overly strong, it's perfect for use any time of day.  I bought a box of 16 for $11.99 - ($14.99 less the typical Bed/Bath/Beyond 20% discount).  I can't even begin to comprehend Amazon's pricing on this item.....or most other Kcups for that matter.  These kcups will be even more readily available nationwide than Dunkin' Donuts kcups so why the ridiculous pricing, Amazon??!!  Starbucks kcups (10-count) are also available in Von's (Safeway) supermarkets.

review/summary: Better than most!
review/text: Here's the deal with K Cups: they will always taste slightly different than regular brewed coffee.  The reason is with brewed coffee, you can control the strength of the brew, both with how you grind your beans and your water-to-coffee ratio.  With K Cups, the only control you have is how large or small a cup you choose to brew. Larger obviously is weaker, smaller is stronger.<br /><br />I have these K cups.  They are better than many of the others I have tried.  Again, it won't taste EXACTLY like a cup of Starbucks brewed coffee, but is pretty close.  I definitely recommend this over many others.<br /><br />Now, if we could just find them cheaper!

review/text: Very smooth but also bold on flavor, and no bitterness.  I like this better than Caribou which is also a very nice k-cup coffee. The Starbucks has more flavor than Caribou but pulls it off without turning you off. I brew this Starbucks House Blend on MEDIUM size (8 oz), which works out for my taste when a little creamer (real) is added.  I can't say that it tastes like the Starbucks House Blend you get inside a real Starbucks because I have never tried the house blend inside a Starbucks.  But as k-cups go, this is a pleasant blend with just the right amount of strength (for me) and no bitter aftertaste.  I only gave 4 stars because the price is higher than most other k-cups, otherwise this is a fine coffee.

review/summary: Great product - Great Amazon price
review/text: I have been a Starbucks afficianado for years and am a recent user of the Keurig system (from Amazon - gift that I thought I would never want!), which I have become very pleased with.  However, the K-cups can seem a little pricey so I was using the Solofill cups (from Amazon) and using my own coffee, but the price of this particular Starbucks House Blend was irresistible, so now I use both. The Keurig system is quick and efficient and now I am even happier with it than before.

review/summary: Very smooth but solid flavor, a great all around coffee
review/text: Everyone has different tastes, and I like to mix it up too. After trying many brands and blends for half a year, I have determined that this is my daily drinker, el numero-uno.<br /><br />The closest I can compare it to is perhaps the Caribou Blend, only this is a tad smoother yet somehow richer, and has zero bitterness, and zero aftertaste or chemical taste.  I brew it on the medium (8 oz) setting for what it's worth, but it is probably great stronger or lighter.  This Starbucks blend is very friendly for all drinkers, lightens easily with a little half & half, and so it is my go to for hosting parties.  It is definitely a good way to experience the best of your Keurig!

review/summary: One of the Tastiest of the K-Cups
review/text: Keurig has, for better or worse, pushed the coffee market in a strange direction.  Convenience is championed over quality.  Luckily, Starbucks' House Blend K-Cups are just as good as the bean versions of the coffee that you can purchase in stores.  Out of the blends that I have tried, the House Blend seem to be the most balanced: it's not too acidic, not too bitter, not too bland.  It's just right.  I would recommend this coffee to both coffee novices and coffee experts.<br /><br />With that said, I would recommend comparing prices off Amazon before buying these here.  The prices seem to fluctuate (as they do in other stores as well).

review/summary: Praise cheeses!
review/text: I absolutely love my Keurig. But every now and then I found myself getting bored with the selection of K-Cups. I resorted to buying a reusable K-Cup and filling it with freshly ground beans from Starbucks. The results were less than desirable. I would never get the mesaurements right and I would end up having to make a trip to get coffee.<br />These K-Cups from starbucks are a godsend! the price is not bad. The ratio of coffee grounds to water is the same every time so my coffee comes out great. I am a happy person once again! I also love the house blend because even though it says its a lighter blend, its starbucks. Its roasted darker than most. So if you are a strong coffee lover i think the house blend will suit you just fine.

review/summary: Not a "medium" brew IMO
review/text: This coffee was very strong and bold (great is that is what you like) when brewed on the 8-oz setting.<br /><br />I would brew two 8-oz cups with a single K-Cup and mix them and even then it was a little more then what I preferred. I love Starbucks but was felt I was mislead by this item being labeled as "medium". I will try other Starbucks K-Cups in the future; Veranda Blend Blonde is on my to-try list.

review/summary: ****Not your typical Starbucks, but good****
review/text: Living in Seattle and using K-cups for over 3 years, I can attest this is a better tasting and more complex flavor than the "typical medium roast" choices and would argue with reviewers that this is a generic blend branded with the Starbucks name.  I would compare this to Coffee People Donut Shop (highly-rated and our personal home staple) with a hint of deeper roasted flavor.  We've tested virtually every available flavor and this ranks in our top 3.  My only complaint (deducted one star) is the high Amazon price since you can often find this 25-30% cheaper at your local franchises.  I've bought 2 cases so far and plan on reordering.

review/summary: Good, but Strong Cup of Coffee
review/text: These K-Cups make a good cup of coffee. As others have said in the reviews, it is stronger than what I would expect from a "Medium." I make these on the largest cup size on the Keurig, and it is still a little strong. However, you can tell that it is Starbucks (even if not quite as good as the in-store coffee).<br /><br />I didn't want to comment on the price of these, but as others have pointed out, they are a bit on the expensive side. However, if you drink Starbucks regularly, you should expect that, and it is still cheaper and more convenient than going to the Starbucks.<br /><br />I would recommend borrowing one of these from someone else or buying a small box of them to make sure you like it, before you buy the bulk package.  But if worst comes to worse, I believe they can be made drinkable (or at least you will be able to find someone else that will drink it, unlike other K-Cups that I have tried, which I could not even give away).

review/summary: Great quality, expensive K-Cups...
review/text: Price per K-cups get poor marks when assessing for "value"; however, in terms of quality there is an earthiness and flavor profile that far exceeds any regular drip brew that I have experienced for home brewers (with an obvious exception for french press coffee).  What I sacrifice in terms of increased per K-Cup cost is made up for in terms of quality.  I enjoy Starbucks, regardless of their corporate profile.  Going to Starbucks is likely to result in a $4-5 dollar cup of coffee; where as I sit here now and for just about a buck I am enjoying a natural, black cup of Medium Roast Starbies... Loving it...

review/summary: Packs a punch!
review/text: I came to the amazon site to find these because I hate going to Walmart and that's the only place I've been able to find them. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are much cheaper at the brick and mortar stores than here. I do want to warn and defend this house blend as an extremely strong cup of coffee without the Bold Roast of the French Starbucks.  I find every other k-cup I've tried (Green Mountain, Newman's, even Starbucks' breakfast blend)to be too watery even on the smallest cup setting but boy these really make it taste like I'm drinking a good strong coffee house cup of joe.  I brew these with a medium cup of water but I think they'd even work with the large size brew. Shame they're so pricey.

I feel half a buck for a K-cup is too high, and over six bits is close to offensive.<br /><br />Pass 'em up, and wait for the purveyors to stop treating us like dope addicts.

review/text: I was thrilled to see the K Cups finally available from Starbucks coffee....bought a few flavors. I can only speak to the French Roast, as it's the only one I've tried so far in K-Cup form, but it's WAAAYYYYYYYY too bitter. I've had it a hundred times from the shop or at home from the ground bag, so maybe it was a "bad batch" or maybe it develops something from the K Cup packaging, but it's definitely not the typical French Roast flavor I'm used to. I'll give it 3 stars because I'm so happy they are offering it in K-Cups now, and I'm crossing my fingers the flavor is right with the other varieties I purchased.....for review ONLY on the French Roast K-Cup, I'd have given 1 star only.

I've tried other brands of tomato soup, from the can 'o condensed soup just about everyone grew up with to several brands that claim to be healthy. I find them all to be too salty, bland, or both. That is not the case here. This soup is wonderful. It's not too salty and anything but bland. It had just the right amount of spice and even though it's light on the salt it doesn't affect the flavor. This is the only tomato soup I'll buy from now on.

review/summary: Good but not that many chunks of tomatos
review/text: I love tomato soup - it's my favorite fall/winter meal.  This soup was very easy to prepare, just put in a bowl and microwave or heat up on the stove top. I tried it both ways and the soup tasted the same either way to me.  It was a little on the sweet side with only a few tomato bits in it which was disappointing, but I liked it other than that.  I thought if I added something more to make it a bit more hearty and perhaps add a sandwich it would make a nice meal, but on it's own I would say it's not filling enough, unless one eats a lot of crackers and doesn't mind doing so.<br />I like a creamy soup too, and since the maker recommends nothing be added, it doesn't have that creamy taste you can get from tomato soups by adding milk or cream.  I didn't try adding to it yet.<br />I like that it is natural soup which is better than what is canned in the grocery store so I will buy it again.  If it had more chunks of tomatos I would have given it a 5, but since it says it has chunky tomatos, it I rated it accordingly.  If you don't mind a little sweet taste, this is a great soup but it you prefer the standard tasting tomato soup that has more salt in it, you may not like it as much.  As for me, I will purchase again because it is easy to fix, I can take it camping without adding much and it is tasty to me.  I can offset the sweet taste easily and add something to go with it to make it a filling meal.  I'd recommend this one even with what I have written.  I've liked most of Dr. McDougalls's soups, this is not my favorite but it is good.  Happy eating!

review/summary: Best Tomato Soup I've Ever Had
review/text: I just returned from a trip and as I always do, I checked out the local health food markets for new gluten free foods. I came across this little gem and was amazed at the robust flavor and aroma. I have long missed my grilled cheese and tomato soup lunch combo but now I can once again enjoy. Preparation is as simple as it gets, no need to add water, just heat for about 2 minutes in a 1100w microwave. Use a covered bowl and DON'T put the box in the microwave. The box says it contains about 2 servings but if your a big guy like me, you'll want the whole box in one serving. If you look at close up of the picture of the box it's a pretty accurate depiction of what your going to see in your spoon. The soup is a bit thicker than your standard canned soup (which is a good thing) and has a bit of a zing to it. Not too much, but by no means is it your grandmothers bland canned tomato. Dr. McDougall's also makes a spicier version, a pepper tomato I think they called it. It's on my shopping list.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: After becoming interested in matcha for cultural and health reasons, and doing a great deal of research with regard to both,  I bought a tin of Kama Matcha directly from Matcha Source.  Prior to purchasing, the owner returned a message I left for her, answering at length several questions I had.  She was well-informed, patient, and pleasant, which gave me confidence in purchasing from her company.  She helped me select the accouterments I needed, based upon my budget, and spent as much time on me as if I had been buying the store. I got a discount for my first order and free shipping.<br /><br />Anxious to try matcha of any sort, while I waited for my tin of Kama to arrive (which it did promptly) I purchased a tin from my local Oriental store.  They had two types and I bought the more expensive of the two, Maeda-En, which was $10 for 28g.  The color is very pale green and it tastes exactly what I would imagine pulverized grass clippings out of the lawn mower bag would taste like.  Very bitter, nasty and unpleasant.  I can mix it into smoothies and such, in which fruit and honey mask the flavor, and I will continue to use it for that. But the stuff is horrific and, to me, absolutely unpalatable on its own.<br /><br />So with this my first experience with matcha, I was pretty worried that when the Kama Matcha arrived I wasn't going to like it and that I had wasted the money on it.  But I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Mind you, I've only had these two types, but there is a WORLD of difference!  The Kama is very smooth, bright green, and not at all bitter.  It has a light, delicate flavor which, though definitely still reminiscent of "grassy," is not unpleasant in any way.  I do prefer it with about a 1/4 tsp. each of raw sugar and milk, just to add to the creaminess, but it's good straight, too.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I have had absolutely no trouble with it staying lumpy after sifting and whisking.  I do sift it and mix it with a bamboo whisk, but I enjoy the ritual, and there are no lumps whatsoever.  When I tried whisking without sifting, I got a few tiny lumps but even then it was not at all unpleasant.  I can tell I have had a cup of it. The feeling is not one like you get from a cup of coffee.  It's a subtle sort of sense of alert well-being which actually surprised me.  I have a cup before work and a cup at lunch and I honestly feel that it has enhanced my performance and mood at work.  Add to that the incredible health benefits and I am definitely hooked!<br /><br />There's no denying this Kama Matcha is expensive, especially on my budget.  And I do intend to experiment with various brands, hoping to find an equivalent for less money.  The previous reviewer mentioned a brand $15 cheaper which they bought at their local health food store and thought was superior. I'd honestly love to know what it is.  Cheaper would be nice, but I have a hard time believing I could find a matcha I like better, as far as flavor, color, and texture go.  And, again, the customer service was superlative.<br /><br />I recommend you give this one a try!

review/text: I bought this online, willing to try a new matcha. I'm not impressed with the quality for the price. I can go to my local health food store, spend $15 less for the same amount of matcha and get higher quality. This matcha clumps and doesn't dissolve well in water. Even after being sifted and whisked.

review/summary: terminally mediocre (in my hands)
review/text: My experience is quite different to most other reviewers, so perhaps it will be a helpful counterpoint.  I used Droste to make a test cake for my son's birthday, and it had no detectable chocolate flavor.  I then just tasted the Droste cocoa and found it awfully bland.  I picked up a can of Pernigotti cocoa from Williams-Sonoma: horribly expensive, but produced quite a good chocolate cake from the same recipe.  For baking, if you are a foodie, Droste will be disappointing.  If you are limited to supermarket selections I would look for a recipe that calls for melted chocolate, perhaps in addition to cocoa, and use Lindt chocolate: the result should be more chocolate-tasting.  If you have more money and/or resources, Callebaut cocoa (from Amazon or another mail-order place) is terrific, Green & Black also performs well and is popular with pastry chefs (it is organic, so look for it at organic shops or at Whole Foods), and as mentioned I found Pernigotti to perform well (find at Williams-Sonoma or a gourmet shop).  Hope this is helpful.<br /><br />An earlier reviewer commented that Dutched cocoas will produce more flavor: Dutching is an alkalizing treatment used to bring the cocoa taste forward.  All Dutch-processed cocoas are not the same, however, and have different pH levels as well as dramatically different flavors.  For more on this see Rose Levenbaum's "Cake Bible" or hit the Cook's Illustrated website.  Rose recommends Green & Black's on her blog, and Cook's Illustrated recommends Callebaut as the best cocoa they reviewed (they did find Droste to be the best supermarket brand), although of the three cocoas I suggest only Callebaut was included in the Cook's Illustrated taste test.

review/text: For those who wanted to use this chocolate for baking read below:<br /><br />Dutch-Process Cocoa or Alkalized Unsweetened Cocoa Powder:<br /><br />Has been treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity. Because it is neutral and does not react with baking soda, it must be used in recipes calling for baking powder, unless there are other acidic ingredients in sufficient quantities used. It has a reddish-brown color, mild flavor, and is easy to dissolve in liquids.<br /><br />Unsweetened Cocoa:<br /><br />Has a complex chocolate flavor while the Dutch-process is darker and more mellow. Its intense flavor makes it well suited for use in brownies, cookies and some chocolate cakes.  When natural cocoa (an acid) is used in recipes calling for baking soda (an alkali), it creates a leavening action that causes the batter to rise when placed in the oven.<br /><br />[...]

Yes, there are a few out there that are insanely expensive and probably taste better, but unless your the french guy from cupcake wars or a world famous chef, you aren't going to notice. What you WILL notice is the higher quality of your chocolate baked goods as opposed to that of say, hersheys cocoa. It tastes like a dark , rich chocolate. I top my cupcakes made with this, with a bittersweet (80% cocoa) chocolate ganache. It really brings out the flavor. Don't let poor reviews fool you, if you know what your doing in the kitchen, this product will not disappoint you.

review/summary: I wanted to love it based on the hype ...
review/text: ... unfortunately, I was totally disappointed when using Droste.  I looked high and low for it too, and paid $8/box thinking I would have an outstanding product.  The finished 14" square X 4" high layer cake was very moist, but lacked the darker and richer chocolate expectations both in color and taste.  In addition, it also allowed for the cinnamon taste to lean forward - which under the previous chocolate used, was considerably the faint surprise that flavor was meant to be.  Droste may be wonderful for making devil's food, but did not hold up for the darker, richer chocolate that I was hoping for.  I was very disappointed considering all the hype.  But, I truly appreciate these posts.  They are a source of helpful input, inspiration, and the kindliness of sharing one's experience.  I appreciate all the information especially the comparisons to other cocoa powders.

review/summary: Best Cocoa You've Ever Tried
review/text: This is such an amazing chocolate and will blow the supermarket varieties away.  The process of converting regular cocoa to dutch cocoa involves soaking the nibs in an alkaline solution to reduce the acidity.  This  process reduces the acidic and often bitter taste of regular cocoa and brings out the smoothness and richness of the chocolate.  It has a wonderful rich full chocolate flavor.  Some cookbooks warn that the difference in pH of regular and dutch processed cocoa can cause problems with leavening when baking but I have never had this problem with anything I have baked or made.  Cooks Illustrated magazine even rated this particular variety as one of the best cocoas you can buy.  Chocoholics like me who take their chocolate seriously will not be disappointed.

review/text: I recall using Droste's cocoa powder for making easy and delicious hot chocolate as far back as 1956.  I dearly loved it then.  After not using it for several decades I recently purchased several boxes on Amazon.com, mainly for nostalgic reasons.<br /><br />It's quality still seemed excellent. It was delicous and easy to make.<br /><br />But I was appalled--just now my wife brought me a large mug of Droste's hot chocolate--[A LONG DELICIOUS PAUSE] I was appalled that the powder came in a poorly sealed box, and not in a sealed bag or in a sealed container.  The powder seeps through the cracks in the box, and it is a mess to handle or to store.  I gave one box as a gift and had to enclose the box in a sealed plastic bag before gift-wrapping it!  The Droste factory could do better.<br /><br />Product is a 5.  Packaging is a 1.  Therefore I rate the experience as a 3.

While it wouldn't be my first choice as a true dark chocolate lover (I usually go for the 72% dark chocolate bars and shavings), Droste's product has a rich enough flavor for everyday baking and hot cocoa-making when food allergies are a concern, and ranks higher in my book than the multitude of tasteless options available to most food allergy sufferers. Thank you, Droste!

review/summary: For a "quick" cup of "real" chocolate milk, this is the best. For baking, don't use powder!
review/text: OK, so I have and love this stuff for *cocoa* and *chocolate milk* so that's what I'm giving it praise for; for baking, I use chips that have only cocoa, cocoa butter, and sometimes sugar, never ever ever lecithins and other cheats!!More often, as I consider dessert a luxury to make sparingly therefore use the best, most purely produced stuff, I stay with my absolute favorite, CLAUDIO CORALLO 100% cocoa bars (makes Green and Black taste bitter even the sweetened, makes Callebaut taste sickeningly sweet, even the "dark")...<br /><br />So I don't and won't bake with cocoa powders... very self-defeating in my opinion to use ANY powder. For chocolate milk or hot cocoa (which I tend to do a mix of this and bars/chips for, along with scraping vanilla beans and grinding cinnamon bark and sometimes scraping a touch of nutmeg etc into... or even a little alcohol of choice!), it's simple: take this, some sugar, and a tiny bit of top notch milk or thickener-free (no carrageenan, etc) cream and make a paste, add milk in small bits to make the paste into goo, and eventually, when the grit is thoroughly absorbed, add the rest and stir thoroughly--more work than instant junk but it's worth it... or add a few ounces milk to the paste then microwave 10-20 secs (microwave dependent) and add your cold milk and you're good to go (that way is much easier, though be careful not to "burn" the cocoa powder if you do it this way--takes very little time).<br /><br />One thing to mention re: the complaints/criticisms is that you HAVE TO have unexpired stuff. Seems basic, right? Still, cocoa powder is EXTREMELY fragile, and not only must it have stayed in controlled environments (which is usually not the consumer's fault), but it can't be old, even if it's unopened (it's in a paper box with wax paper in it--that keeps mold from crudding it up, but it will not keep it fresh forever). This beats the frontiers and by a million miles that Ohlaska type stuff, also makes Rapunzel brand cocoa look bald in flavor... but it is powder. Don't ever expect powder to do what bars do, period. You take out the moisture, and you take out the fat, and you take out the protection against aging and quite a lot of what really truly makes moist chunks of chocolate different from cocoa powder... comparing it to bars is a bit unfair in my opinion; of course bars are different and better suited for baking... that's like saying milk powder plus water equals fresh cow milk :) Stick to this for drinking (what they rec you use it for anyway) or maybe little kid cupcakes, since they don't care but it's way more responsible than Hershey and less chemically-treated... oh, and if it's not super dark, just like with chips, it means it's gone bad/oxidized. If it isn't 4xs darker than hershey's powder, then you got a bad batch, so take it back and find a different retailer who doesn't either get it from a bad warehouse or who doesn't leave old stuff on the shelf. I HAVE had a bad box of it (and it's probably why I paid $8--they had trouble selling it), and it was oxidized and not like what Droste traditionally tastes like. All food has a huge variation unless it's processed so much (McD's or KRAFT) it's not really "FOOD" anymore.

review/text: I'm familiar with Droste chocolates from travel in Europe and recently ordered this cocoa mainly because I had come across a baking recipe that called for Dutch process cocoa and was unable to find it in grocery stores.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the rich, deep scent and taste of this cocoa product. Unlike many other cocoa powders, this has a wonderful chocolate taste without being too bitter. I've used it many times since buying it to make hot cocoa - opting for organic agave or honey as a sweetener in lieu of sugar.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product for any culinary uses!

review/summary: Good, but not like Dutch
review/text: This IS extremely good cocoa; however (regardless of what you've heard), it does NOT taste, nor produce results like Dutch process cocoa. In fact, in cookie recipes, it does not taste much differently than Hershey's. To this day, the best Dutch process cocoa I have ever used was that produced by Hershey's (in the silver can); unfortunately, they no longer make it. I have hunted for a replacement and nothing even comes close.

review/text: Wow! I can't believe how delicious and rich this cocoa is.  I love to bake so much that I am contemplating Culinary School. I had bariatic surgery and that cocoa hit the spot.  The taste is rich, refined, and just magnificient.

review/summary: REAL Holland
review/text: The Droste cocoa Product was shipped promptly and promptly gave me a surprise. It was Droste - Direct from Holland!<br />With Dutch printing and all of the European signs of an imported item.<br />None of the website info. or photos gave any indication of this reality.<br /><br />I have NOT used the product yet.

review/summary: tropical jelly beans not worth the money
review/text: Thus item is not worth the cost. You only get two bags of jelly beans and if it is because they are tropical flavored this is not worth it. With shipping costs it makes it worth. I suggest you find them in the store for a cost of under $3.

review/summary: Old Time Favorite
review/text: I've enjoyed Cuoco Sardine Sauce since a child growing up in NY.  I follow a recipe for St. Joseph's Pasta but serve it with sweetened breadcrumbs. Even my children enjoy it. I moved to VA and none of the stores hear carry this product. I usually order 6-8 cans to cut down on shipping costs, but this time, my delivery contained many dented cans.

review/summary: Horrible to deal with, bad warranty, unpleasant, many are hard to chew
review/text: We ordered a large sampler of most of their products and some other items from this company's brochure. The cover says "Harvest Fresh taste". So we thought it was like fresh fruit. It wasn't, and, being middle aged, we could not chew it, it stuck in our teeth, and most was drenched in sugar. We tried it all. No one wanted to eat any of it. We were dissatisfied. They also did not send a free item their brochure promises for purchases above 79 dollars.<br /><br />No fear, the second page says "100% guarantee. All our products are unconditionally guaranteed. If you or your gift recipient are not satisfied, please contact us for an immediate replacement or refund. It's important to us that you are happy with your order."<br /><br />So I did and asked for a refund. So far, not on your life. So far they have had roadblocks and stalling, like requests for data on the bottoms of tins, when most items, and there are a lot, are in  small cellophane packages in a large sampler with no tins. A mess and a time consuming, aggravating horror to deal with.<br /><br />Unless you are addicted to candied type fruits, many heavily sugared and tough and hard to chew, and cannot do without, keep away from this firm or find what you like elsewhere. Especially if your teeth are not the youngest. These people do not honor their guarantees and are really no fun to deal with. I emailed many times and called. Both ways were unpleasant. I probably will have to contact my credit card for help.

review/summary: Not a factory issued variety pack
review/text: I was very excited to see a variety pack offered from larabar. It would allow me to finally sample all the flavors without having to buy boxes of them all since no one my area sells all of these.  Much to my suprise, after paying almost $40 for the variety pack (single flavor boxes run between $19 and $25) I realized that the variety pack still has only 16 bars. The same number in the single flavor boxes that run half the price.<br /><br />When my package arrived, it was labelled as a box of blueberry muffin bars, sealed in plastic. I was very upset that I had been sent the wrong variety after paying a significantly higher price to sample them all. So I contacted customer service at Amazon to return them.  Since it was a food product, they were unable to offer an exchange or take a return, but they graciously refunded my money.  Problem solved by Amazon.<br /><br />So the good and the bad is this...I thought I'd go ahead and try blueberry muffin (because I never had) and hope I liked it since I am now the proud owner of 16 bars. Or so I thought. When I opened the box, I discovered 16 DIFFERENT varieties had been stuffed into the box in different directions and retaped to look like a factor issue box.  So I felt like a jerk. Because I honestly thought I had been sent blueberry muffin and Amazon has issued me a refund, so I essentially ended up with a free box of larabars.<br /><br />I logged onto Amazon to let people know that this IS a variety pack, but it will arrive in a single flavor box. That's just how they're packing them.  The seller wasn't exactly deceitful, because they never promised this was a factory issued variety pack. However, I feel the sale is misleading. In the long run, I got what I wanted, but was a bit shocked to see that someone had simply purchased 16 flavors and stuffed them back into the boxes. Not very professional.<br /><br />At the time that I'm writing this post, the item is listed as unavailable, so perhaps Amazon has already dropped this purveyor, or they are not going to keep offering it. Either way, if this goes up for sale again, just know what you'll be getting.

review/summary: Not what i thought it would be
review/text: I ordered a larabar variety pack for around $39 dollars.  It just said variety pack but did not indicate the amount.  I assumed it would be the same as another variety pack I ordered for about the same amount f $ ($39 for 36 bars);  however, when I received the box it had only 13 bars in it, which calculates for about $3 per bar, unlike my previous order which was just above $1 per bar. I love larabars and will continue to order them, I was disappointed to say the least and will not order from that vendor again.

review/summary: Paying for variety??
review/text: I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully, because like all of the other reviewers, I thought that this item might have more than just 16 bars, given that the price was at least twice or three times the regular cost of a box of larabars.  And it was a bunch of random bars thrown into a plastic bag, not even taped into a misleading factory box, as the other reviewer's had been.<br /><br />Bottom line, what you see in the picture, 16 bars of different flavors, is what you get.  In my mind that's a rip-off.  For that money, I could have gotten two boxes of 24, but I did have the convenience of being able to try all the different flavors and not being stuck with 23 of one variety that I wasn't fond of.
