I have tried many different brands of Darjeeling tea.  This is the best.  It is a loose leaf tea in a fabric bag which makes it possible to brew a cup that is as good as if you brewed a whole pot of loose leaf tea.

review/summary: Excellent flavor
review/text: I highly recommend this tea, as it actually has flavor to it, unlike most pre-packaged teas available on store shelves. The "brewtach&eacute;"s included make it easy to pour a perfect cup and get optimal flavor at the same time. Plus, the manufacturer's committment to organic and trade-friendly production is also noteworthy.

review/summary: Amazing tea
review/text: I can heartily recommend the ineeka brand, I've tried most of the 'flavors' and am really impressed by both the method of brewing, the quality and of course, the flavor. I use loose tea quite often but am not good at portioning this takes the worries away and offers a perfect cup each time

review/summary: Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!
review/text: This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues
review/text: If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need.

review/summary: One of the best dog food out there.
review/text: I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!

review/summary: Looks gross, smells gross, my dog loves it!!!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this because it costs a fortune and venison and fish sounded pretty unappetizing.  But I was desperate, because I have a 16 year old dog who's always been a picky eater but had now lost a dangerous amount of weight because of a heart condition.  The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.  Maybe your dog just has a sophisticated palette :-)

review/summary: Great Product - Too Expensive!
review/text: I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them.

review/summary: raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....
review/text: I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.<br /><br />Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.<br /><br />Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).<br /><br />Fresh breath, no more doggy odor!<br />Stools do not smell (or very very faint)<br />One of the dogs - a Maltese - her tearstains have completely disappeared!!<br />Glossier coats<br />More energetic<br /><br />Etc etc.<br /><br />So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!

review/text: I have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie. He used to like the Paw Naturaw Grassfed Bison meals, but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it. I tried Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food. This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too.

review/text: My dog started to become finicky with her Wellness Core dog food.  She must stay on it for allergy purposes so I really have no option but to encourage her to eat it.  I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat, I would strongly recommend this dog food.  It is quality through and through.  : )

review/summary: greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst
review/text: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!

Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!
review/text: I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.

review/text: My dogs are usually fed raw, but it was getting hard to find alternative meat sources for my highly allergic Lab-X. I ordered this and the venison after a holistic vet tech recommended it, and it is AMAZING. I add some cooked veggies and water, and they go gaga over it.<br /><br />Thank you, ZIWI Peak, for making a product without fillers! (For dogs that are allergic not just to grains, but also to rice, potatoes and sweet potatoes, as well as eggs and chicken, it's slim pickings out there! - Other pet food makers, take note!)

review/summary: Ziwipeaks: A great, all natural dog food
review/text: Ziwipeaks is a great, freeze dried diet for my dog. Though it runs a bit expensive and rare, it's a great all natural, product. I use the venison because I'm trying to stick with my mini dachshund's ancestral diet. My mini is 2 years old and has been using this food for about 16 months now. She has a beautiful, soft, shiny coat and is healthy and energetic. The food comes in these small bits which are softer and more manageable for little, 13# dogs. Ziwipeaks is an excellent brand if you want no grain or sugar additives and you want to give your dog one of the best quality foods available.<br /><br />S. Joseph

review/summary: Excellent food for dogs with allergies
review/text: My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared-up.<br /><br />The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.

review/summary: Great substitute for raw diet, but expensive!
review/text: We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.

review/summary: Best thing on the market (without the mess)!
review/text: My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!

review/summary: every dog should eat this!
review/text: This dog food is absolutely wonderful.  If I could afford to, I would feed my dog only this.  My 2 year old Vizsla is the pickiest dog I've ever met (won't even eat most treats) and she can't get enough of this food.  Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.  If you have a dog with any food sensitivities and have tried many different foods this will be the last food you will need to try.  My dog has never looked and acted healthier than she has on this food (and I have tried about 20 different brands).  You won't be disappointed, it is worth every penny!

review/text: Have a miniature poodle and he is a very picky eater.  When we eat rib eye, leg of lamb etc that is what he wants too.  Well we love our dog but we were looking for a compromise that would not cost an arm and a leg. He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.<br /><br />Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot. And we can feel good about the quality.  Also this supposedly keeps the amount of poo down to.

Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.<br /><br />An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.

review/summary: My Westie loves it!
review/text: I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY

review/summary: ZiwiPeak Addict
review/text: My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say "you gonna give me some of that?" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.

review/text: We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1/3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!
review/text: A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!

review/summary: Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It
review/text: I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line.

review/summary: 8 month Shih Tzu loves VENISON!!!
review/text: I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu breed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!

review/summary: Good supplement for raw diet
review/text: I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy-prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast-cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other "veterinary prescription" kibble(potato/ rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part.

Subsequently, I have learned that my dogs do not have food allergies but I kept them on ZiwiPeak because of its high quality content and delicious taste.  It is very expensive but I believe my yorkies are more than worth it.  I highly recommended this product to any dog owner who wants the best food for their pet.

review/summary: Amazing Little Mushrooms
review/text: I admit, I was a little skeptical about how these mushrooms would work out.  Well, I ordered them a few months ago and decided to finally try them. After hydrating about 2 tblsp of mushrooms in water, I sauteed them in a little butter and added them to some leftover slices of pizza.  They were delicious.  I like the flexibility of having them in the house without the pressure of using them immediately like fresh produce.  I like the texture, flavor and ease of use.  The price is great for what I pay for fresh mushrooms.  5 Stars!

review/summary: A Wonderful Way to Add More Flavor to Many Dishes
review/text: I have been a fan of the More Than Gourmet product line for many years (I think since right about when they started) and this sauce reduction is one of my favorites.  Unlike their duck, chicken, veal, lamb and seafood products this one can be added to almost anything.  Soups, stews, sauces, what have you.  This will add depth to all of them.<br /><br />They start with a classic "essence de champignon" (which is a mushroom stock containing sherry, salt, garlic and spices) and then they reduce it to 1/20 of it's volume.  Since it is bound with a starch (Tapioca) it will  help to add some body to a sauce.  It can be used minimally diluted and poured over carrots, fish (really just about anything that would taste good with mushrooms), or added to an existing sauce or dish.<br /><br />I often make my own mayonnaise using safflower oil, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and various seasonings.  I usually serve it as an elegant topping for fish or vegetables (it's great on asparagus) but I always thought that it could be better.  I now add just a teaspoon of the More than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold and I can't believe how much better it is!<br /><br />I am a lifelong carnivore but some members of my family are vegetarians.  When I cook for them I substitute this for a veal, chicken or beef demi-glace.  I even add it to vegetable stock to give it that extra dimension.  Sometimes I buy it in the 16 oz. tub, other times I like the convenience of the small 1.5 oz cups. If you can think of a dish that  would would benefit from the hearty, earthy flavor of mushrooms then I recommend that you give this a try.

review/summary: DO NOT SPEND A DIME ON THIS VENDING MACHINE!
review/text: Simply put, this vending machine is a piece of crap. And, dealing with the company is even worse. Just check the long list of complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau. That said here is the breakdown on how the machine works:<br /><br />Coin Mechanism - Most likely the worst Coin Mech in the Vending Business. Anyone with a piece of straw, a paper clip or even with their car keys can easily tamper it and get free candy. After a couple of months of use, it will start jamming and will work with everything BUT quarters. Unlike in the feature description, these plastic coin mechanisms will not last very long with normal use.<br /><br />Chute Doors - The chute doors are made of plastic. Very WEAK plastic. They will not last a week of normal use. This will leave an extremely unattractive machine that looks like a toothless Hockey player. Not to mention how unsanitary that is.<br /><br />Canisters - Sure the easy on, easy off design might be the best any company has come up with. However, the canisters are so weak that I have had them crack on my hands while cleaning them. Another flaw would be that these clear canisters will turn yellowish within a month if exposed to indirect sunlight of strong fluorescent lighting. Even if they aren't, they will still turn yellowish within a year.  Plus, they are very poorly manufactured. Finally these canisters would not only NOT keep the candy fresh, but also it is very easy for insects to get inside and make a total mess.<br /><br />Housing - This would be the piece attached to the metal pole and base and holds the canisters and coin mechs. It is so poorly made, that within a couple of months it will start to crack. I have had customers call me to tell me the machine fell on the floor. Imagine if it had fallen on top of a child!<br /><br />The Back "Security" Door - It is incredibly weak and made of plastic. Anyone with a screwdriver can steal your quarters without even breaking it.<br /><br />The Company - The Manufactures are Multivend. They might be one of the worst companies to deal with. As I said before, just read the complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau.<br /><br />If you are looking for a novelty TOY, this machine would be perfect if they didn't want to charge you over $100.00 for each (A new Unit can set you back almost $400.00). I would pay no more than $40.00 for a unit. But, if you are looking for an investment, then look elsewhere. I can recommend the Beaver Machines. Those are the best in the market. I've made more money with around 40 Beaver Units than the over 300 units of Vendstar 3000 Machines I purchased will ever produce.

review/summary: ***************BUYER BEWARE*************
review/text: ********Buyers Beware of Pegasus Enterprises******<br /><br />I have been a customer of Amazon for several years but, I have recently been high utterly disappointed with a transaction that I made with Pegasus Enterprises.  Of all my years on Amazon.com, this by far has been the worse.  On December 24th, 2008 I ordered a Vend Star Vending Machine.  The listed shipping price was $14.99 and the total amounted to $59.99.  I made my purchase and eagerly waited for my vending machine to arrive. Around three weeks elapsed before I heard from the company.  When I was contacted by the company, they told me that the machine would not be shipped unless additional money was sent to cover the shipping.  Although I had already made my monetary purchase for the listed price (including shipping), my order was being held and I was told that I had to pay more to cover the additional costs for Pegasus Enterprises because they listed the wrong shipping price.  Needless to say, I was not willing to pay additional to cover Pegasus's Mistake.  They cancelled my order and I will not receive my machine.  This was the most unprofessional business transaction I have ever endured.  I will never buy ANY item from this company again and I suggest that no one else does either!!!!

review/summary: illy issimo caff&egrave;
review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/text: ****<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Cinnamon Apple Green Tea mild and refreshing green tea. It contains green tea and is "enhanced by the all natural flavor of cinnamon & apple". It is a very mild, but quite pleasant tea with very subtle apple and cinnamon overtones. It does taste very pure. I use two tea bags at a time for a stronger green tea taste.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Although this tea was not particularly exciting, it was fine, pleasant, and a good buy. You can't beat the price of this six pack!<br /><br />****

review/summary: Reunion Island is a fine coffee
review/text: Reunion Island SWP decaf is a nice, bold tasting decaf coffee. Drinking it you would be hard pressed to tell that it is a decaf and not a regular coffee. Just note that this is for pod coffee makers, like the Bunn MCP, Bunn My Cafe, Opod, Senseo and others. This is not for K-Cup or T-Disk makers like the Keurig or Tassimo. Some single-serve pod coffee makers may have a hard time with this coffee, as it is a 10 oz pod, whereas the standard seems to be 8 oz or less. This pod is problematic in Senseo makers, as they have a shallower pod holder. These will work fine in the Bunn or Opod makers.

review/text: I buy my coffe pods in three-packs.  I suffered through my last purchase because I mistakenly bought a coffee I thought was from the Blue mountains of Jamaica but was really just flavored coffee with a Jamaican theme, Ack (think cat with hair ball)!  So, this time I made sure it was NOT a flavored coffee.  I am glad to say this coffee is just what it says, coffee.  It smells good and tastes like fresh coffee.

review/text: I had been buying the Senseo Kona pods for our Senseo machine, but they recently stopped offering them.  We enjoy the Kona blend flavor, & these are a good substitute.....a bit pricy tho.  One concern I have is that each pod is individually wrapped in a shiny foii  pod holder......don't think they are bio- degradable..... not good.  Will continue to look for a more sustainable solution.....have a coffee duck so may go back to that.

review/text: These taste good, have a moderately thick consistency, and have a high protein content. The biggest selling point to me is the cap, which (in my experience) seals it tight enough to shake the remainder up without worrying about it leaking. I drank half before and half after my workout; the cap allowed me to store the remainder in the work fridge easily.<br /><br />To me the money spent on this goes towards the convenience of not having to make shakes at work. Will buy again.

Also, air bubbles feel funny...as if there is something in your drink so be aware. I think the taste is excellent.  It is filling and the container seems to keep it cold longer.  Also, the carbs are low.  I moved from EAS Advantedge.  It does have high calories but it has more protein, feels fuller, and tastes better.

review/text: I originally bought this product as a ready to drink replacement that tasted much better than the designer whey I had been using.  It is rather expensive (protein/dollar) and although I like it the taste may not be for everyone.  It has a nice thick texture and good taste but has a slight aftertaste that is comparable to that of an ensure.  Being a 0 sugar RTD that was above average in taste it's only drawback is price/protein ratio.

review/text: I am not fond of the chocolate ice cream flavor of this drink. For some reason it tastes kind of watered down and not as creamy as it should be. If you don't like creamy tasting drinks, this may be perfect for you. However, the cookies and cream flavor is absolutely fantastic! Overall, I highly recommend this product in other flavors and you can see my review on the cookies and cream flavor. The 4 stars here is ONLY because of the chocolate flavor. I'm hoping the company will improve on the taste since I love chocolate. Overall, this brand is by far the best in ready to drink products of its kind and I've tried several.

I'd say it only tastes faintly of cocoa. But I'll probably keep ordering it to have some variety.<br /><br />On the positive side, the protein in these shakes is very high quality. It's a mix of 7 different components and the predominant one is whey. Perfect for drinking after a workout and that's when I use it. They also have no sugar and are pretty low in fat.

review/text: I have been drinking nutrition drinks off and on for over 50 years, and I think I can tell whether there is protein content by the texture. I have tried two so far, I have faithfully followed directions to shake the container, and I would be greatly surprised if there are even 15 grams of protein in one carton.<br /><br />Also, my flavor, "chocolate ice cream", is a serious exaggeration. There is some chocolate flavor evident, but the overall impression is that "ice cream" is overly optimistic.<br /><br />I also found a "no extra charge" extra-large cockroach in the packing container, and it had been thoughtfully colored chocolate. Fortunately, it had been poisoned, so it was nearly dead.<br /><br />Wow, is it ever easy nowadays to defraud the public.
