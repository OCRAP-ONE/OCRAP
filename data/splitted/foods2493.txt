review/summary: Smaller packs for people who hate stale crackers
review/text: I like the mini packs in these boxes.  I have always hated opening a new pack of graham crackers because I know I'll have to dig out a plastic bag to seal them up in afterwards or just have to toss the extra in the garbage.  I can't stand smooshy graham crackers!<br /><br />These packs are a little big if you want to eat them as a snack (I like 1-2 full 4-cracker pieces)with 6 2-cracker stacks in each package.  It is enough to make a few s'mores with my girls without going overboard, so I like that idea.  It is also small enough that I could pack one as snacks for the park or with a packed lunch for more than one person.<br /><br />For me, I love the idea but took off a star because it isn't a single pack (for one person)but is enough that I would waste less if I wanted to snack on grahams.  Just don't expect that you can get these and pack one in your child's lunch box unless your child REALLY likes grahams.

review/summary: No more crumbs all over me
review/text: The biggest plus feature of these Honey Maid Fresh Stacks is quite simply - you don't get graham cracker crumbs all over you when you attempt to break apart large sheets of typical graham crackers.  I don't know why they ever made them that way - long rectangles that you have to break apart to eat.  The convenience of being able to pull out of a smaller "square" container 1/2 of a regularly sized cracker is great!  You don't have to break them to eat them!  Except for this one convenience the product is the same as typical grahams.  But that feature is worth it if you are crumb conscious. :)

review/summary: Erythritol
review/text: I did my research and ask my pharmacist friend regarding this product before I took the plunge to invest in such an expensive sugar - it just seems too good to be true! The only "bad" things I could find are bloated stomach or diarrhea, which didn't occur to us at all.<br /><br />I first bought this from NOW Food. When I finish the 3 pounds, I order it from Prescribed for Life. Maybe it is just me, but I found both the taste and the smell are better than the NOW food one (I can smell watermelon). So now, I just reorder from PFL.<br /><br />I have one little tip to share with potential users: although this product stated that it is heat-stable up to 160C or about 330F, I found that it is best not to bake with it. The best way to use it as a white sugar substitute is to stir in the food you are cooking at the last step to minimize the cooking, or stir in hot tea or warm water to mix with beverages. Using it to sweeten yogurt also tastes great. Bottom line is avoid heating it.

review/summary: A Pleasant Surprise
review/text: When I ordered this new product I wasn't sure what to expect.  To me Newtons are those chewy little bars with the fig filling of which I am such a huge fan.  When my blueberry flavored Newtons Fruit thins arrived I found out that they are thins indeed and quite a departure from the figgy fruit bars. These Newtons are really a round thin cooky (a little over 1/8" thick x 2.5" wide)with lots of crunch.  In spite of the fact that this really doesn't meet with my preconceived idea of what makes a Newton, these are exceptionally good cookies, and appear to be healthful as well.  I love the ingredients--all natural and flavorful. They are sweet, but not overly sweet, which I like.  Blueberries and flax seeds are two of the ingredients I was happy to see as components of Newtons thins. If you are expecting a spin off of the old fruit bars you might be disappointed, but if you're into flavorful, healthy, crunchy cookies to snack on like I am, I think you'll enjoy this new Nabisco product.

review/summary: A delicious and fun snack
review/text: I confess that the brown sugar was what grabbed my attention, but the whole family enjoyed the Blueberry Brown Sugar variety of Newtons Fruit Thins.  I loved the brown sugar and blueberry taste and the crisp crunchiness; these thin cookies reminded me of shortbread or shortbread cookies.  One family member dipped hers in yogurt (perfect combination, she said), and we all said that we would be buying more of these!  They are perfect for snacks or dessert, and I think I'll try them with ice cream--the kind of dish where the cookie is stuck into the top of the pudding or ice cream.

review/summary: An Excellent Snack - Packaging Needs Work.
review/text: My husband and I both loved these cookie/crackers, and they didn't last long!  They did seem to be slightly addictive for both of us, but 3 is the serving size, and 3 was enough for my sweet tooth, too.  I didn't think my husband would like them, but I caught him eating them 2 or 3 times.  They didn't taste at all artificial to either of us.  The taste was like a blueberry muffin, but quite crisp.  They ARE thin, but they're also larger than most cookies, which is why 3 was enough.  I'm not saying we couldn't have eaten more, we easily could have, but 3 as a snack really did satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />There was a problem with the packaging on the bag I received - they were nice and easy to open, which I liked.  You just pulled on a plastic strip, and they opened.  I THINK there was supposed to be plastic left to close the bag on, but there wasn't.  Since the inside wasn't enclosed in anything, a closure was badly needed.  This could have been just one bag malfunctioning, but if not, this needs to be worked on.<br /><br />There were plenty of blueberries, and while you couldn't really taste the brown sugar, it was obviously in the mix.  Just a glance at the ingredients, compared to another type of cookies we had showed quite a difference in the amount of some of the ingredients - less of the bad and more of the good.  They're not meant to be a healthy snack, they're still a cookie, but healthier than most of the cookies we buy.  I will DEFINITELY be buying these again!

review/summary: YUM!!!
review/text: These are light, fruity cracker-like cookies that are amazingly good. They're stiff, so I imagine they'd be good carriers for cream cheese and fruit for a party yummy. The bag needs to be kept secure to prevent sogginess, so yummies made this way probably couldn't be made too far in advance. FYI, they're about 2 inches across, so they're not bite-sized unless you, like me, have a big mouth. Highly recommended.

review/summary: I wish my Mom were here...
review/text: That woman can wax rhapsodic about a cookie in a way that I can only dream of, but I'll do my best.  Actually, I'm not sure that I'm prepared to wax rhapsodic about this cookie, but I did like it.  The combination of blueberries and brown sugar sounded wildly appealing to me right from the start.<br /><br />As is generally the case with tasting/testing something new, I invited a group of my co-workers down to my office to sample along with me.  The reactions were varied, but none were too negative.  Most of my co-workers were happy to try the Fruit Thins, but weren't planning to purchase them for themselves.  Some commented that they felt the cookies were, "too sweet," but personally, I don't understand that.  These days, so many sugary, chocolaty treats taste overwhelmingly sweet to me.  I found this one to be just about right compared to more childlike cookies.  It's just the sort of nibble to enjoy with a mug of tea.<br /><br />Other co-workers commented on the cookie's texture, due primarily to the inclusion of wheat flour, oats, and flax seeds.  One compared it to a tastier teething biscuit, but having never tried one I'm not prepared to comment, LOL.  Personally, I like the inclusion of fiber and whole grains.  In fact, the entire ingredient list is reasonably healthy.  It's a treat I can feel good about eating.  And I especially enjoyed the subtle crunch of the flax seeds.<br /><br />As for me, I liked the flavor a lot.  You can see the crushed berries in the batter and you really get the blueberry taste.  Oh, and I've had the semi-resealable bag open on my desk for a week now.  The cookies taste as fresh and as crisp as they did on the first day.  That's impressive.  Not only would I buy these cookies again, I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: Tastes like a graham cracker with bits of blueberry...
review/text: These Fruit Thins were just OK in my opinion.  They reminded me of a Graham Cracker with pieces of blueberry throughout.  Although I don't think they were bad, I certainly don't think they were fantastic either.  It's not anything I'll ever be craving or would go out and buy.  If I want a munchie I'll grab something more flavorful.  My 8-year-old son liked these but my 9-year-old daughter didn't care for them much either.  Unless you're a fan of graham crackers and stuff like that I don't think I'd recommend these.

review/summary: Great new cookie for Newton lovers--all natural, too!
review/text: These cookies really do taste a lot like Newtons, but not as sweet. One problem with the regular Newton cookie is it can get a little too sweet. I found these cookies to be a bit more addictive than the Newtons. They have a great natural flavor, with all natural ingredients(Nabisco has taken some time to finally come around with healthier ingredients). The quality and freshness are also excellent, along with attractive and practical packaging.

review/summary: Tasty - but read the ingredients
review/text: They don't have the chewiness like the classic Fig Newton does. These are more like a chip consistency, or a very crunchy cookie, but about half the thickness as a cookie. Taste is quite good.<br /><br />However, they do contain Palm Oil, which is very high in saturated fats. This is the current trend, creative packaging to make something look like a healthy snack food, but when you read the ingredient list, you find that it is junk food. They do use unbleached, but enriched flour, and there is some whole grain flour.

The thing is, people who are looking for a sweet cookie are probably going to be disappointed. People who like things that are not extremely sweet but still flavorful and a bit sweet will. I am not sure what's with the newton label since the only thing it has in common with a fig newton is the name, but they are still enjoyable. On a side note, I like the package the cookies come in too, keeps them fresh and easily closed again.

review/summary: Blueberry Fruit Thins
review/text: These comments are for "Newtons Fruit Thins - Blueberry and Brown Sugar" sold by Nabisco.<br /><br />The package states "crispy cookies" think the firmness and thickness of a graham cracker - yes that firm. These 3-inch round wafers come in a rigid plastic tray that slides into a foil-lined package. Nonetheless several cookies in the two packages I sampled were broken into several large pieces upon opening. Probably not typical but that's what I observed.<br /><br />I found the cookies brittle; they had a tendency to break into several pieces after a bite. As an adult I could compensate be adjusting my method of holding the wafer but children will have a problem.<br /><br />I found the blueberry and brown sugar cookie without much flavor. The package state "made with real fruit" therefore what you have are many small pieces of dried blueberries throughout the cookie. The consistency was adequate but the flavor must have been baked out during the process.<br /><br />I was somewhat taken back by the work "Newtons" in large letters on the package. My understanding of this term is of a soft chewy fruit filled cookie like a fig or apple Newton. I do see the connection then again I am not in Sales or Marketing where these decisions are made.

review/summary: Blueberry muffins in cracker form
review/text: Despite looking a lot like cookies in the image on the packaging, these fruit thins are more akin to crackers.  They are very slightly chewy, but would have been better if they were more chewy, closer to what they look like in the picture, which is why they get only 4 stars and not 5.  The taste is very good, and if you like blueberry muffins, you will like these, as they taste like said muffins condensed into crackers. The blueberries in them are real blueberry pieces, these also provide some of the chewiness, which is pretty good and a great layer of flavor. They are a very good choice if you are in the mood for something sweet but crunchy, and not overly sweet like cookies or candy.

The right consistency that chews crisp with the taste of Fruit Newtons. The only drawback I notice is a few berry things get caught in the corner of your teeth similar to when you eat poppy seed muffins--not a negative, because it's a lingering effect of yummies you get to enjoy after the Fruit thin is gone. They actually paqk a lot of the thins in the package. We enjoyed them lots.

review/summary: Pretty Good Crisp Blueberry Cookies
review/text: I like things with blueberries, and I was hopeful for the Newton Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar.  I've been taking them in my lunch since I got them, and I'm fairly pleased with them.  A single serving is 3 cookies, and I find this to be enough to be satisfying.  They are crisp but not crumbly, and the taste is pretty good.  The only complaint I have for these is the ingredients.  I find it hard to believe that brown sugar and blueberries are not enough to sweeten them sufficiently.  Down the list of ingredients you will find "Fructose".  If they do need another sweetener, I would rather see evaporated cane juice.  All in all, though, this is picking nits for a non-organic product.  While there are better choices out there, they are many far worse.  It's probably one of the better products that Nabisco makes.

What I like about them is that you can actually taste and see the actual dried blueberries in each cracker, and three of them only have 5% DV of saturated fat.  That means you can eat up to three without feeling too guilty about it.  The packaging is attractive, with an easy-to-seal opening.  Each bag contains 30 cookies too; a good number.  I can see this being a painless, healthier alternative to actual cookies.  Good job, Nabisco!

These "Newtons Fruit Thins" are sort of a cross between a cookie and a cracker. They are thin and crunchy, and not overly sweet. The Blueberry Brown Sugar tastes just like a blueberry muffin. It is very tasty and perfect with a cup of tea or a tall glass of milk.<br /><br />These fruit thins come in other flavors as well, although I've now tried them all and the blueberry are my favorite. I passed these around in a "taste test" to my husband, 6 yo son, and 80 yo mother. All loved them. We buy them every couple of weeks and even put them in my son's lunchbox.<br /><br />Two Thumbs Up!

review/text: The taste was okay.  The cookie is thin and light and crispy.  You can really taste the blueberries, which is a good real honest to goodness blueberry taste.  But overall, the sweetness level was okay, the cookie was just meh.  I don't know it's like a cookie that was trying too hard.  We have been crumbling it up and putting it in ice cream, yogurt, mixing it in with granola.  The other problem that we have ended up having with these is that I did not know prior to purchase that the cookies had flax seed in them but not all of the seeds were finely ground, which means that well one the health benefit is lost but also the family members in my house who have diverticulitis got really ill after eating these cookies.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about them.  Perhaps because the serving size is 3 cookies or thins and that is not at all satisfying as a snack and so it feels like another junk food disguised as a health food.  Taste wise they are okay.  But since they aren't really that healthy, I'd rather pop a real fig newton.

review/summary: Good, reasonably healthy for a cookie
review/text: When I think of Newtons, I think of the incredibly portable snack that I could take along on long bike rides for energy.  They wouldn't really crumble away and were fairly healthy.  Since my biking days, they have expanded their flavor choices, and now they have expanded the product line further.<br /><br />These Fruit Thins *are* thin.  A package contains roughly 28 cookies, in two rows in one of those little plastic trays.  It was a great number for me, as there are seven of us, so they split up evenly.  Of course, I took the two that arrived as total crumbs, and the one that was broken... so this review is based on one whole cookie and a lot of pieces.<br /><br />My husband declared that, "these taste like blueberry muffin crackers!"  I don't happen to agree with the cracker part, exactly.  My kids (ages 5-13) all loved them and commented that it tasted like real blueberries, not that fakey stuff.  Opening the package, it even smells like real blueberries.<br /><br />These aren't as healthy as I would expect from Newtons, but they are decent.  This is something I would consider purchasing for my family.  I love that the ingredient list doesn't include anything I don't recognize.  Next time, I think I want to try the chocolate raspberry though...

I loved the flavor combination of the blueberry and brown sugar.<br /><br />My fiance who has a serious sweet tooth wasn't that impressed with them, but, I'd definitely try these again. These are more for those who don't want an overly sweet dessert.

review/text: A crispy little cookie snack, good for on the run and to tide the kids over. We have been crumbling them up and putting them in yogurt with berries instead of granola. Not bad at all, even if they can't compare to the original Fig Newton!

review/summary: perfect with a spot of tea
review/text: The Blueberry Brown Sugar "Newtons Fruit Thins" were not what I expected. Thin is the key word to this product. There is no discernible brown sugar flavor, and there is just a hint of blueberry. The cookies are slightly bland, very lightly sweet, and easy to break apart. The plastic tray held many pieces of broken cookie. My first reaction was "so-so", but then they grew on me! I realized that the blueberry flavor, although very mild, had no artifical aftertaste. Three of these cookies equal one serving with 140 calories, 5g of fat, and zero cholesterol. These cookies are absolutely perfect to serve with a cup of freshly brewed hot tea. I would also like to try the other flavors of this product.

review/text: These are all right.  Not sweet enough to be called a cookie, but good with tea.  They have a nice crunchy texture and a decent flavor.  I wasn't crazy about the blueberries in them that were more like chewy candy pieces than actual blueberries.  They aren't all that bad for you and are pretty low in sugar, but if I want a cookie I wouldn't reach for these.  They aren't great for you in the first place and I'd rather cheat with something that tastes better.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Before requesting these, I read a few reviews because the last time I requested a snack via Amazon Prime, said item supposedly had a laxative effect. Like many other people, I originally thought that these Fruit Thins (despite the name) would have a fruit filling within. I'm actually glad they don't. I'm also glad I chose this flavor over the figs, though that is the next flavor I do want to try.<br /><br />Opening the bag was extremely easy. While some of the cookies were broken, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. What's even better is the twisty tie attached to the plastic wrapper. Convenience, much?<br /><br />The cookies are thin crisps with little pieces of blueberries scattered throughout. They're crunchy, and while the initial bite was weird, I soon adjusted to the taste and fell in love with each bite. It didn't take me long to devour two cookies.<br /><br />The serving size suggests 3 cookies, and I had to force myself to stop eating these. I could easily pig out on these sometime, they were that enjoyable. And, surprisingly enough, my mother enjoyed them too. She even said she would be willing to buy these in the future.<br /><br />I'll have to agree with her. Try them for yourself!

review/summary: Somewhere between a cookie and a biscuit
review/text: The "whole grain" on the package is for real making the texture a little coarser than most folks are expecting in a cookie.  They are thin and dense, not chewy but not brittle and crumby either.  They are tasty (not overly sweet and the blueberry flavor is nice) but not special.  And they tended to get stuck in my teeth.  More of an adjunct to coffee than a dessert or snack on their own.

review/summary: Satisfying & Fun!
review/text: I don't recall how many years it's been since I've baked a dozen Betty Crocker Blueberry Muffins -- I used to love to, and loved them. Never got a dozen either since I always snitched dough (even though I was supposedly a grown up) so what a nostalgic treat to open this bag and get a whiff of blueberry exactly like the muffins were! The texture and consistency is somewhere between a crispy style cookie or a cracker. The taste is really good, and not at all overly sweet, as I had anticipated from it being called a Blueberry Brown Sugar Thin. I'm very pleased with these, they seem to have worked hard in their kitchen to get a good balance on this. I will plan to try the other flavors as well.

review/summary: A Darn Good Cookie!
review/text: I applaud Nabisco for putting a little more "health" into this cookie. However, I should qualify my review by stating that in no way is Nabisco marketing this product as some sort of healthy treat, but I think this product gets a good nod for being better than most grocery store cookies, without sacrificing taste. On the nutritional side, 3 cookies has 140 calories (not bad, Oreos are nearly 80 for one cookie). Better though, a serving has only 8 grams of sugar, 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. Even better, they really taste good! You can even taste the blueberries! These cookies don't contain the evil high-fructose corn syrup, but it does list "fructose" in the ingredient list, however it's way down on the list next to baking soda, as opposed to the first or second ingredient as is usually the case with most cookies.<br /><br />These cookies got an enormous thumbs up from everyone in the family (including our super picky eater!). If you love Fig Newtons, but can't tolerate the high sugar content, these are a good fruity cookie alternative. The texture is crunchy, but not hard like your teeth are going to crack, and the fruit flavor is the real deal. It comes in three flavors; fig, cherry and blueberry.

review/text: Pleasant -- though not memorable either for brown sugar taste or blueberries!  And since both flavors are personal favorites, I was understandably disappointed at this "wafer" even though I expected more of a soft "cookie'!<br />And at 140 calories per "wafer" -- well this is quite a diet-buster for such a pedestian experience.  Better stick with Fig Newtons.

review/summary: A diet-friendly snack that's still really delicious
review/text: I'm a big fan of Fig Newtons and their fruit-filled cousins, but if there's one thing that the original Newtons cookies aren't, it's low-calorie.  I ordered the fruit thins hoping that the cakey goodness of Fig Newtons had been preserved in a slightly less fatty format.  Upon their arrival, I discovered an entirely different-- but delicious-- cookie.  There's definitely an emphasis on fruit here as the flavor of blueberries comes through strongly, but these are more like a graham cracker in many ways.  The texture is good, but not at all cakey.  It's not terribly brittle, if I had to compare it to another type of cookie I'd say they're similar to the texture of a butter cookie.<br /><br />The calorie count on these is really quite low.  At a serving of three, it only costs about 140 calories and just a few grams of carbs!<br /><br />Serving suggestion from my family is: eat these with a glass of almond milk.  What a delicious desert, no sacrifice of taste for good health whatsoever.

review/summary: Delicious - Save Some For Yourself
review/text: I opened a bag of these and placed them next to the coffee at our morning meeting. Everyone grabbed at least one.<br /><br />After finding my first cookie sweet and full of blueberry, I deemed Newton's Fruit Thins worthy of hoarding. Too late. By the time I went to refill my coffee, the open bag was pretty much demolished. It less than ten minutes, eleven people had polished off all but one cookie.<br /><br />I am always pleased to find a satisfying snack that won't blow my diet. While these aren't exactly "diet food," they certainly are reasonable in the calorie count area. Three cookies come in at 140 calories.<br /><br />Whether or not you're dieting, these are a great tasting, sweet snack that you'll love if you love fruit.

review/text: I loved these.<br /><br />They are really crispy, which is hard to find in cookies - they all seem to be soft cookies anymore.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor comes through, although the blueberry bits have a raisin type of texture.<br /><br />The only downside I could see is there was a large amount of breakage.  Don't know if that was because of shipping or if they would normally have more breakage because of the crispness of the cookie.

review/text: This thin wafer is qite tasty.  The blueberrys taste real and not like an artificial facsimile.  They are sweet, but not too sweet. If you are someone who likes more of a biscuit type cookie, this is the cookie for you.<br /><br />However, one will not do or be satisfying.  These are a bit addictive and it is very easy to reach for another. Because they are thin and not too sweet, it is easy to think they are not too caloric, but they are, so be careful on that front.<br /><br />I bought some of the chocolate raspberry variety today and I like them even better!  But anything with chocolate is better.<br /><br />The only downside is the package, in my opinion, is a bit small to justify the price.

review/summary: Taste is Great - Good Cookie Alternative
review/text: Overall, I like this cookie alternative.  They're crunchy, not soft and cakey like I was originally expecting from a Newton ("A cookie is just a cookie, but a Newton is fruit and cake!", right?) but the crunch is pretty satisfying.<br /><br />What I didn't like, and what brought this down two stars was the blueberry bits.  I can't tell if they're seeds or if they're very hard dried bits of blueberry, but without a doubt, that stuff gets stuck in your teeth so it gets annoying to eat since you'll undoubtedly spend some time picking out the blueberry bits from your molars.<br /><br />The taste is great, and I really like the crispy cookie, so I'd probably buy this in another flavor, but those hard blueberry bits getting stuck in my teeth are enough to stop me from buying this flavor again.

review/text: Newtons Blueberry Brown Sugar Fruit Thins are a tasty little snack.  They have just a hint of sweetness from the blueberries and brown sugar but they aren't overwhelmingly sweet.  I love that they use real dried blueberries instead of some artificial imitation.  With the Newtons name I was expecting a softer cookie but the thins are very crispy/crunchy with more of a cracker texture.<br /><br />My 2 1/2 year old daughter and my husband both enjoyed these as well.  The Newtons Blueberry Brown Sugar Fruit Thins get thumbs up all around at our house.  I love that this is a snack everyone enjoyed and with whole grains, real fruit, and just a little sugar it is a treat I can feel good about giving my family.

review/text: These certainly seem a bit odd, with the way Newtons hype on the box about the whole grains, real fruit and lack of corn fructose syrup.  You might think they're too much of an attempt at a healthy cookie to be any good, especially when it's a 'crispy cookie'.  But, as people have mentioned, think more along the lines of cookie biscuit and you'll have Newtons Fruit Thins.  These remind me of ginger snaps in a way, minus the ginger flavor.  They're great with tea, a crisp cookie with lots of blueberry flavor that lingers in your mouth (and teeth...) thanks to the bits of dried blueberry throughout.  They don't come across as a 'healthy' attempt at all.  I'm now eager to try the other two flavors.<br /><br />My one complaint is I'd doubt that I'd order these through the mail again, as the package did arrive with about a third of the cookies damaged in some way.  They might be a bit too thin and crisp to be mauled about by the post.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I've never been a huge fan of fig newtons, but these cookies are pretty tasty.  They're kind of like Danish butter cookies with a bit of blueberry.  They're probably appropriate for someone trying to diet (but are tasty enough for someone who isn't worried about weight) because they don't seem to have that much sugar (8g per serving of 3 cookies (30 grams)) Also, they have some whole grain which you'd think wouldn't taste good in a dessert, but this is good.<br /><br />As you might imagine this is a dry cookie, not moist (again butter cookie texture) and they are thinner than a typical cookie, but also not that small - about 2 inches across, I think.  3 cookies (which is one serving) is pretty satisfying and a 140 calories isn't extreme.<br /><br />The packaging has the white plastic flaps on the end that let you sort of reseal the bag, but I've never thought that to be the best system for preserving freshness so I'd probably move the cookies to ziplock bags if you're not going to eat them fairly quickly.  Oh, and now that I'm looking at the bag, it says "contains: wheat, soy".  So now you know.<br /><br />I actually really like those Nabisco 100 Calorie Fudge Petites <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZJTX16">100 Calorie Packs Fudge Petites, Mint Fudge Chocolate Shortbread, 5-Count Packs (Pack of 6)</a> which obviously are slightly lower calorie and super delicious, but my issue with a lot of these portion control packs is the amount of packaging required seems less than great for the environment. So points for these fruit thins for not having as much packaging although obviously the temptation of eating more is there since the bag that holds all of them is open. (He says, now that he's had a total of six cookies.)<br /><br />Overall, it's not like triple German Chocolate Cake Supreme, but for a fairly "sensible" dessert with some whole grain and real fruit (oh, and the bag just informed me there is no high fructose corn syrup) I think these are pretty good, and I'll probably get them again.

review/text: As far as cookies go, this isn't going to ruin your diet (much) and it's pretty tasty too!  Three cookies, and they aren't tiny cookies either, are 140 calories.  There are 2g of both fiber & protein.  They aren't too sweet, which is great for me.  These are called "cookies" but they seem more like crackers.  They are kind of dry, which I don't mind, but the blueberries make them a little chewy.  The ingredients DO NOT list sulfur dioxide (a color preservative for many dried fruits).  Yay!  Sulfur gives me hives anyway.<br /><br />As of right now, these are $18.22 per package for 4 packages of 10 servings each.  I'm hoping these become subscribe & save items.  These are good & I will probably get them again.

review/text: One of the other reviewers really hit the nail on the head when he described these as tasting like crunchy blueberry muffins, although I would probably go with "crispy" instead. I really like the taste, which is strong on the blueberry and not overly sweet (probably due to the lack of partially hydrogenated corn crapola). That said, I did have them approved by a kindergartner -- it's not that they aren't sweet at all.  While I wouldn't exactly call this a health food, it's not too bad in that department for a snack food without artificial sweeteners. The only downside is that at nearly twenty bucks for 4 bags, they're kind of pricey.

By watching sugars in store bought foods I've been able to lower my sugar from 122 to 102, going from prediabetic to almost normal.  Of course my wife would disagree with anyone referring to anything about me as being 'normal'.  These crisp cookies have a pretty good flavor, are a bit granular and have a slight aftertaste.  Compared to mother's homemade cookies, they don't stack up very well.  But for those like me trying to watch their sugar, fats and sodium, they measure up quite well to similar products.

review/text: This is a promising whole grain snack, with the main caveat being that it is 47 calories per cookie. The taste is actually good. Not overpowering, but you can definitely taste the whole grain and the dried blueberries.<br /><br />Opening the bag for the first time brings up the smell of blueberries. Inside the bag, there is a plastic tray with two rows, with about half of the cookies in each row. The outer bag is the seal, so there are no extra material. One box contains around 30 cookies.<br /><br />The serving size according to the package is three cookies, which gets you 140 calories with 8g of whole grain, 2g of fiber, 8g of sugars, 2g of protein, 21g total carbs, no cholesterol, and a reasonable 90mg of sodium.<br /><br />The main issue is stopping at one or two or three cookies :)

review/summary: Newtons Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar
review/text: I was very excited to try these cookies, the description sounded fabulous.  I opened the package immediately upon delivery and I wasn't disappointed.  The blueberry flavor is predominant but not overwhelming, and I don't know that I could say for sure that I recognize a brown sugar taste, but the cookies are crunchy and light, with a nice balance of the fruit flavor to crunchy cookie.  The blueberries are actual small little bits, not just a flavoring.  Cookies are not too sweet, which is also very nice.<br /><br />Serving size is 3 cookies for 140 calories, 10 servings per bag.  There's little fat or sodium, but also minimal nutritional value.  You'll get 8% of your daily fiber requirements with each serving and a trace of iron, and that's it.  But then, it's a cookie, so what else does one expect from that? On the ingredients plus side, the cookies are made from unbleached flour, whole wheat flour, rolled oats, real sugar and flax seeds.<br /><br />Overall this is a very nice cookie and I would buy again for myself as well as serve to my friends and family.

review/text: I have only had a pack of Newtons Fruit Thins for a few days, but unfortunately they are almost all gone.  These cookies are really tasty.<br /><br />When I originally ordered the Newton cookies, I thought that they would taste like Fig Newtons, only in a new cookie format.  I was surprised when I actually bit into one of the cookies and it was a bit harder than a fig newton.  I love the fresh taste of blueberries that permeates throughout each of these cookies.  Furthermore, the cookies are not THAT fattening for you, as it is maybe 150 calories (I cannot remember the exact amount and do not have the bag with me at the moment) for three cookies, which is not too bad for this type of treat.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list when looking to purchase more cookies, as they are great!

review/summary: More like a cracker
review/text: I was expecting a cookie when I ordered these. They are actually more like crackers than cookies (which is not necessarily a bad thing). The blueberry taste is extremely strong. So, if you are craving a slightly sweet, fruity cracker, you will like this new Newton product. If you're expecting an after meal dessert/cookie, be prepared to be somewhat disappointed.

review/summary: Cookie?  Cracker?
review/text: The fruit thins are hard to define.  They are extremely thin, even thin for a cracker.  I was expecting something more like a cookie.  They are very crisp and crunchy.  (No sign of the delicious newton cookie / cake here.)  There is a mild blueberry flavor, and not much sweetness. I think the flavor would have fared well in a thicker, soft cookie.  As is, the fruit thins just don't work for me.

review/text: When you first look at a wafer, you may be disappointed, thinking that won't be tasty.  However, they are quite delicious and we're thinking it is the perfect thing to go with tea or coffee.  They are not overly sweet and more filling then their thin wafer may make you think.  I would definitely use these as a stand alone tea cracker, as a sidecar with ice cream, or possibly even with a wine/fruit/cheese plate.  Can't wait to go get some more.

review/summary: tastes like a crunchy blueberry muffin
review/text: Just as the title of my review says, these Newton Fruit Thins in the Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor taste just like crunchy blueberry muffins. The blueberry flavor is distinct but not overpowering. The brown sugar is subtle; the cookie isn't too sweet (I personally would prefer it sweeter, but my husband and younger son thought it was perfect as is!). The cookie is chewy where the blueberry pieces are, so that's either good or weird depending on your personal inclinations.<br /><br />These cookies are lower in sugar and fat than many cookies, so they're a healthful alternative to the typical sugar bombs. Should be pleasing to blueberry lovers of all ages! They make for a nice treat. My son has already asked for them in his lunch tomorrow!<br /><br />Not sure about the price here, though. Seems kinda high and worth doing a local price comparison (just as I did on the Nabisco fudge mint Oreos, which were considerably cheaper locally).

review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are quite delicious.  As soon as you bite into one of these crispy cookies, you can taste the real blueberries, right down to a few seeds, but I did not specifically notice the brown sugar flavor. They are just the right thickness to be crispy, not hard.  The package contains a plastic tray with 2 rows of cookies, 15 cookies in each row. Very enjoyable!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Simply, the cookies are delicious and have a pleasant amount of crispiness to them. Plus, per the package description, they are also a healthy treat. That's really the way I would sum it up, a delicious, healthy treat. As for calories, 140/serving, a serving being 3 cookies. So, the only caution I would offer is because they are delicious, there could be a temptation to have too many of them at a time, especially since they are thin cookies and not very filling by themselves.

review/summary: A Sweet Little Snack
review/text: I've never reviewed a cookie before this one, but I'm going to do my best to describe the experience of eating it and provide other information that might be of value.<br /><br />These cookies are circle shaped, with their circumfrences probably about half again that of a large cracker.  Despite the name they're fairly thick.  The ingredients they contain are pretty basic and mostly all-natural.  A serving size is three cookies, which will not be terribly filling but will probably be fine for those who want a midafternoon pick-me-up or to walk away from a large meal with a little sweetness on the tongue.  It's 140 calories per serving and is a bit heavy on the fat (5 grams a serving, which comes close to being 2 grams a cookie) but then, it is a cookie after all.<br /><br />Flavor is very much a matter of personal opinion, but I think it tastes great.  The brown sugar and dried blueberries are more or less equally present, and the distinct but complementary interplay of two mildly sweet flavors is more interesting than I would have expected from a cookie like this.  It's not going to satisfy a hard-core sweet tooth, but then that's hardly what this sort of product is meant to do.<br /><br />Texture-wise, it's just a little bit crispier than I'd like, but not to the point that this takes away much from my enjoyment of the product.  And, while not exactly moist, the cookies are not at all dry, either.  And, since the package seals quite efficiently, I don't see them drying out in the cabinet.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that quite a few of them arrived broken.  Not only is this a mess, it makes it much harder for me to keep track of how many cookies I'm eating; and since each one packs a fair amount of fat, I definitely don't want to go over.<br /><br />But, I guess, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

review/summary: Quite tasty
review/text: But personally, I'd classify these more like a cracker than a cookie, based on the fact that they're thin.  The blueberry smell & taste is stronger than I expected (good).  I kind of expected them, as a cookie, to be sweeter, but as a cracker, the sweetness is acceptable.  I'm not a huge cookie or cracker fan, but a few of these would suffice as a nice little snack.  I definitely wouldn't devour the entire package in one sitting.  I passed them out at work, and 5 out of 7 thought they were excellent, 1 wasn't thrilled because he thought is was a pathetic excuse for a "cookie", and I thought they were just good, hence the 4 star rating.  Based on current Amazon pricing, I'm thinking they're a bit overpriced, although if cheaper in the supermarkets, I would definitely buy again.  I would definitely be interested in trying other flavors.

review/summary: A tasty surprise!
review/text: The word 'Newtons" makes me think of figs but this tasty treat might change that designation. You can really taste the blueberries in every crispy 'biscuit' I use the 'biscuit' term because this is much more akin to an English biscuit (cookie) than the normal American fare. The package heralds the blueberries and brown sugar and for once it's a valid claim  - you can really taste them both. If you like a cup of hot tea, this tasty treat makes an excellent accompaniment! And if it goes well with my afternoon cuppa then this praise is praise indeed!

review/summary: Very Tasy, Not Quite Healthy
review/text: I have to admit when I first ordered these I was expecting them to be a low fat, low calorie snack.  I was a bit wrong.<br /><br />The "Crispy Cookies" (As they call them) are really quite tasty, a very crispy texture, but not particularly crumbly.  A pleasant brown sugar sweetness and tiny little blueberries throughout the cookie.  Overall the cookie-ness is really quite nice.<br /><br />Crazy thing is that the serving size is 3 cookie crisps and the calorie count is 140 per serving!  That is over 45 calories per little cookie crisp.  And almost a third of those calories are from fat.<br /><br />So, to break it down, they are tasty cookies, thin and crispy, maybe 2.25 inches in diameter, very yummy.  But not for calorie counters or those on a diet.  Only get these if you just want crispy little flavor discs.  But really short of the calorie count there is nothing not to like about this fruit thins.  If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I would be happy to respond.

review/text: Is what I innocently (Ha!) replied to my husband because these were so yummy I didn't want to share. Wonderful blueberry aroma when you open the package is followed with a cookie chock full of real blueberries, none of that gross fake blueberry stuff. The cookies are very thin and crunchy, a shape I normally associate with crackers, what I think the British would call a biscuit. Tastes a lot like brown sugar shortbread, and there are a buttload in the package. The only bad thing is how many you can eat before you realize you've been gobbling them like a kid :)

review/summary: Good taste but be aware  of the packaging unless you want "cookie pieces"
review/text: In a departure from my usual music and DVD reviews here on Amazon, today I'm reviewing a cookie (or is it a sweet cracker?). Hey, I love food too!<br /><br />This package of "Newtons Fruit Thins" - in the Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor - came to me through Amazon's Vine Program. They sent one 10.5 oz package to try.<br /><br />When I opened the sturdy box from Amazon I found the box well padded with an air bag. When I opened the product's bag, however, I found that about a third of the packages 30 cookies were broken into small pieces. I don't know whether this happened in transit from Amazon or in transit from Nabisco to Amazon but it did. The cookies are in a plastic tray with no top protection. I point this out because - even though this might be the case in a supermarket, I don't want you to expect to serve whole cookies to guests - or yourself - when you open the package.<br /><br />Because it's a packaging issue I deducted a full star.<br /><br />Now as to the taste.  I liked them. They are not too sweet, though sugar is up there in the ingredient list - before the "real fruit. Actually there is sugar in there twice - refined sugar before the fruit and Brown Sugar after the fruit. So, yes, I liked the taste.<br /><br />I try to read ingredients - especially when they tout "whole grain". Per the package the first ingredient is Enriched Wheat Flour and then Riboflavin and THEN Whole Grain What Flour. So it's there - just not at the top. So I took off another star.<br /><br />There are 42 calories in each cookie - suggested serving is three - but you'll be tempted to eat more. Personally, I wonder what they'd save with eliminating the "Brown Sugar" or the plain sugar.<br /><br />So in summary, I would eat them if served to me but probably wouldn't buy because of the "breakage factor". I'm still eating the "pieces" that came.<br /><br />Steve Ramm

review/summary: A Healthy Snack, not too sweet
review/text: It was not love at first bite.  It did not satisfy my sweet tooth; it was crisp rather than gooey/chewy like the Fig Newtons the name reminded me of.  But one serving is 3 thins, and I got to liking it.  I suppose it is a good thing that I won't feel like chowing down the whole package.  Reviewing the ingredients and nutritional info, I decided it's a nice enough snack. Though balanced more on health than taste, it is enjoyable too.  And it should be great for people who think most cookies are too sweet.<br /><br />I served them for dessert after a lunch for five people who have reasonably discerning taste in food and average concern for eating healthy.  We all agreed that they were pleasant, but not compelling, not bad for a reasonably healthy snack.  Some "health foods" are more focused on health and nutrition than taste; these seem to be a good balance between taste and health.<br /><br />TASTE / TEXTURE<br /><br />The thin cookies are crisp, more dense than most crackers, crunchy, not chewy.  They have some sweetness; you can taste the whole grains and the dried blueberries too, though they did not add any blueberry flavor to the cookie other than the blueberries themselves.  It has brown sugar as a sweetener, but "sugar" (presumably white) is listed well ahead of the brown sugar, perhaps explaining why the brown sugar flavor is subtle.  The dried blueberries tend to get stuck in my teeth for a short time, though if you're having these with tea or coffee, that should help.<br /><br />NUTRITION<br /><br />3 thins is one serving, totaling 140 calories, 45 from fat (32%).  The sweeteners are sugar, brown sugar, and fructose; no High Fructose Corn Syrup, as it says on the package.  The first ingredient is unbleached flour; the whole grains come later.  8% fat by weight; 5% is saturated fat.  No cholesterol, and low salt (4% of daily recommended).  No vitamins; a little iron. 2g of dietary fiber (8% of daily recommended).<br /><br />To put the nutrition in simpler terms, they are not bad for you, but they do not contribute a lot of what you need every day, either.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />I find them pleasant, but I won't be seeking them out.

review/text: My hubby and I tried these tonight after dinner.  I gave them 2 stars and he gave them 4 stars.  So, I averaged a 3 for these.  It tastes more like a sweet cracker than a cookie.  Hubby said the berries were a little too chewy. I didn't think that was a problem. It's not something I plan to go out and buy.  Hubby will probably finish this bag of them. I might like them better if they were in strawberry, apricot or cherry.  There just wasn't enough good flavor to make me want more than one.

review/summary: Pretty good. A bit strong on the flavor additive. Somewhat diet-friendly
review/text: At 47 calories each, these cookies are a very modest indulgence for grown-ups who want a little something sweet. They taste strongly of brown sugar and VERY strongly of blueberry -- probably due to the "natural flavorings" noted on the ingredients list. More "honest" flavored cookies are frankly better tasting, and if you are into all-natural or gourmet foods you're going to find them strange.  But if you want a blueberry "blam," you'll get it here.<br /><br />These pack a lot of taste into a small number of calories. The texture is very good, with just the right amount of snap when you bite them. And you get a lot of these thin cookies in each bag. Overall, pretty satisfying.

review/text: I really love these new & very different cookies.  They are crisp yet chewy, not extremely sweet like most cookies.  The dough reminds me of a cross between a digestive & a graham cracker, but very crisp & thin in comparison to either of these.  Bits of dried fruit throughout make it chewy at the same time, & quite unique.  I'm finding it very difficult to stop eating these.  I got both the fig & blueberry and they're both excellent, although I probably like the latter a wee bit better.

review/text: I tend to favor fruit desserts and cookies and cakes over chocolate, so be aware of that as you read this review. I like Fig Newtons and all the different fruit Newtons, but I wasn't sure what to expect in these cookies. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Unlike Newtons, these cookies are very light and crispy. They're a bit delicate, and they broke easily, which is probably why they're packaged in plastic trays in the bag as opposed to simply being free roaming in the bag. I think if I were to put them in a ziplok bag, they'd all break into pieces. Not the sturdiest of cookies, but very delicately crispy.<br /><br />The flavor is fantastic. I love blueberry, and these cookies have a strong blueberry flavor and nice aroma. The brown sugar makes it a bit sweet but not overly so. This was definitely less sweet than a chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />The texture is nutty and you can definitely taste the whole grains and fiber, which I like, but which other people may not care for. It's also a drier cookie, not as oily as normal chocolate chip cookies bought at the store or on the grocery shelves. I tend to favor this, but other people used to more butter or lard might find the cookie a bit dry.<br /><br />I enjoyed eating these with sweetened tea. I really think this is my new favorite store-bought cookie.

review/summary: Pretty tasty, and not your usual *Newton* cookie
review/text: These are very different from the old model Fig Newton cookies we grew up with, very crispy and no filling. You can smell the blueberry as soon as you open the package (which is very easy to open and seal back up again). The blueberry flavor is front and center and I also picked up on the brown sugar flavoring as well, but this is not an overly sweet cookie (which is great, as I don't like things heavy on the sweet factor). I picked up on a bit of an aftertaste, but nothing to deter me from trying more of these. The package was delivered to the office and I've shared it around with good comments from all.<br /><br />This is most definitely a *crunchy* cookie and not a soft one. Several of them were broken up a bit, so I suspect the boxes they came in took some rough handling from the men in the brown trucks. I've noticed some other reviewers commenting about putting  the crumbles on ice cream or spreading soft cheese on the cookies. Hopefully mine will be gone before I succumb to that temptation.<br /><br />There is a claim on the packaging that these do not contain high fructose corn syrup, which is all well and good, but I did find "sugar" and "fructose" in the ingredient list. The nutritional facts state there is 8g of sugar in each three cookie serving size.

review/summary: Delicious Heart Healthy Cookie!
review/text: Nabisco's newest Newton Fruit Thins Cookies are not only totally delicious, but they are loaded with nature's best ingredients that promote a healthy heart, arteries and cells. I'll begin with the taste. These round scalloped edged cookies are super thin and crispy and loaded with blueberries. There is no high fructose corn syrup- only real blueberries. Just opening the bag, you will smell each cookie bursting with the delicious blueberry aroma.<br /><br />As for the ingredients- unbleached flour, whole grain wheat flour, rolled oats, dried blueberries and flax seeds provide your body with nature's healthiest ingredients that will actually strengthen and extend your life. Blueberries are one of nature's strongest antioxidants that prevent free-radical damage. What blueberries do for your arteries is strengthen the artery walls, which very few foods can do. As we age, the artery walls thin out, and berries- in particular the strongest blueberries are the number one food that strengthens them-preventing blood clots. Whole grains are known to give you an abundance of energy and strength, just like a race horse gets from oats. As for flax, it lowers bad cholesterol, lowering your blood pressure, making it easier on your heart muscle. One of my parents line of ancestors lived on a flax farm for centuries and they easily lived into their 100's, the oldest being 107- without a nursing home!  That's what flax does for your heart and arteries- keeps them sparkling clean! If you want to live both healthy and long- eat those berries and flax seeds!<br /><br />These cookies are crispy and delicious, with just a hint of brown sugar added to the blueberries for additional taste. With real fruit, whole grains and flax seeds and only 140 calories from 3 cookies, you'll be satisfying your crunchy snack cravings and your body's need for a healthy heart and arteries. This is the best whole grain blueberry cookie I've ever tasted and it deserves a whopping 10 Stars!

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: These cookies were unexpectedly tasty and crispy given the fact that there was no hydrogenated fat in them. I always look at the list of ingredients for the word, "hydrogenated" even when the label says "no trans fat."<br /><br />They're not too sweet, with a slight taste of blueberry and brown sugar. I agree with other reviewers that they have an addictive quality to them, and with only 140 calories for three cookies (about 47 calories per cookie), one could get into trouble by overindulging. My husband and I really liked these, however.<br /><br />These would be perfect for dunking in milk or crumbling over ice cream. Enjoy!

review/summary: Good for a snack.
review/text: Newton's Fruit Thins are a good snack, as soon as my 2 year old saw the package he asked for a "cookie" and ate it quickly. I would not call it a cookie but they are quite good. The Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor was great, my whole family enjoyed it. The down side for me was that they are a bit too brittle and sometimes would 'shatter' when you bit into it. The package was also very noisy, there is no way you can get into it without the kids hearing you.<br /><br />All in all it is a yummy snack for the whole family.

review/summary: Yummy crumbles
review/text: I absolutely love the taste of these "British Biscuit-like" cookies. The smell of blueberries burst out of the package. The Newton's Blueberry Thins were crisp, tasty and filling. You can enjoy them without ruining your diet if you stay to the serving size of three. The only concern I have is the packaging....about half of the cookies were broken into tiny crumbles {these would be delicious sprinkled over vanilla ice cream, but I don't think that was the intent of the product designers) and re-sealing the package, once opened, is a bit tricky.

review/summary: GOOD BUT NOT MY FAVORITE TREAT
review/text: At first I thought they were very plain, but once you've had a few, you pick up on the flavors and they are pretty good. I didn't pay close attention to the nutritional facts, but I would assume they are a little healthier for you than alot of cookies out there since they are made with real fruit. These are good for snacking, a light dessert, and maybe even a quick breakfast if you are in a hurry. I had the choice between trying this flavor or fig and honey, so I'm curious what the other flavors taste like and may try them sometime if I run across them at the store and they aren't too expensive.

review/summary: You Can Really Smell The Blueberry
review/text: The minute you open the package, you can really smell the blueberry.  I didn't taste much brown sugar taste.  These Newton's Blueberry Brown Sugar Fruit Thins are not sweet, they seem more like a cookie biscuit to me, something you would have with a nice cup of tea.<br /><br />Or they taste to me for some reason like an unfrosted pop tart.<br /><br />If your a blueberry lover you might enjoy these.  Blueberry is ok, but definitely not my favorite fruit.  On the back of the package they do seem to make two other varieties in this product, which I might enjoy more.<br /><br />They are crispy, and the package says they are made with real fruit, naturally flavored.  If you are a Newton's fan you might enjoy these.

review/summary: Really good
review/text: I like Fig Newtons, but I was really surprised that these cookies are more like graham crackers than the Fig Newtons I am used to eating.  These a really good cookies.  For three, the calorie count is 140 and 5 grams of total fat. Three cookies contain 1g of saturated fat, 2.5g of polyunsaturated fat and 1g of monounsaturated fat.  I carefully watch my sodium intake so I was pleased to see that three cookies contain just 90mg.  The blueberry flavor comes through as does the brown sugar taste.<br /><br />I would recommend these cookies as a nice snack.

review/text: I have never been a fig newton fan but I figured I would give these a try. I am glad I did!. They were very tasty! The blueberries taste fresh and there is just the right amount of them in each cookie. They are not your typical soft newton cookie, much more crisp (as the packaging states) but I like that! My husband and kids (who are all fig newton fans) loves these cookies as well. I highly recommend these as a good healthy alternative to your typical cookie. If you are a friut and cookie fan these will no dissapoint!

review/text: Things to note about these cookies are they are not Fig Newtons, they are more like graham crackers, though not as crumbly.  They are low in carbs and contain High Fructose Corn Syrup.  The blueberry taste is there, but the brown sugar taste is not despite being prominent on the cover.  Good cookie product that is not as bad for you as others.  The price on Amazon or at least the seller that is listing on Amazon is very high and you can get these in stores much cheaper current.  Hopefully Amazon adds these to the subscribe and save program.

review/summary: Passes For A Cookie
review/text: I thought these were going to be a "Mommy only" snack. I even informed the kids (and my husband) that they were Fruit Thins, not cookies. They quickly informed me that they were cookies, and delicious ones at that. So, so much for a "Mommy only" snack. The kids (4,3, and 1) love them. And they are perfectly happy with just one, though the serving size is 3 cookies. My husband said they were the perfect dipping cookie. They are thin and crispy, but they don't flake or crumble. Even though the flavor is Blueberry and Brown Sugar, the Thins also contain rolled oats and flax seeds, which give it a nice oaty flavor. They are not overly sweet, but sweet enough to be a cookie. To me, they taste a bit like giant Wheat Thins with chewy blueberries in them. They are definitely a hit at our house. They are something I will most definitely buy again, since they do have some good stuff (fiber, protein, iron) to go with their "cookie" label.

review/summary: SUPER DELICIOUSLY YUMMY!
review/text: I admit I'm a Cookie Monster.  I think these are my new favorites.  I enjoy thin cookies because I can eat MORE!  These Newtons are crisp, not too sweet and  the chopped up REAL BLUEBERRIES add just the right chewy texture without getting stuck in my teeth.  There are lots of blueberries, oats AND Flax seeds!  Healthy ingredients.<br />I'm tired of granola bars.  They're either too hard or too chewy.  The texture, taste and ingredients of these are, in my cookie opinion, superior.<br /><br />As I said - I have a new favorite cookie and I'm definitely going to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Delicious crunchy cookies!
review/text: I love Fig Newtons - have since I was a kid. The soft and chewy bar, the fruity filling...Yum. So I was curious about these when I saw them and decided I wanted to try them. Having said that - they were pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />These are hard and crunchy, like a slightly sweetened cracker. The fruit bits were more chewy, and you can definitely taste the fruit flavor. I think I was expecting something more like a thinner newton - still soft and with a layer of fruit rather than mix-ins, but the flavor is quite tasty. They are not overly sweet, which is nice.<br /><br />They are lower in fat and sugars than many "cookies", though by no means are they truly *healthy*. It was nice to see that there is no HFCS, and the added flax seeds are a nice touch.<br /><br />I would certainly buy these again, though probably not on a regular basis. As a treat though, they are tasty and reasonably healthy, and the kids loved them. Actually, we all did. Well worth buying in the future!

My wife and I enjoyed them with our morning tea. For those of you who enjoy blueberries you'll love these tasty treats. While I would have preferred the fig taste, these are delicious. A word of caution about ordering them through the mail, the front biscuits in the package were broken into pieces, a minor fault that I can live with. L.W.

review/text: These new Newton Fruit Thins are really a good cookie. First of all I am reviewing the Blueberry Brown Sugar flavor. The taste is quite good without being too sweet or sugary tasting, also no funny tasting white stuff in on it or in it. A good blueberry flavor, with just enough of a brown sugar taste. Nutrition wise they are okay, better for you than most, also good with a cup of tea.

review/summary: Tastes great, but NOT a healthy snack
review/text: I got these thinking they'd be a great healthy snack to take to work for in between meals. While they taste great, they're not healthy. They're kind of a cross between a cookie and a cracker. They taste really good - not too sweet, and the blueberry flavor doesn't taste fake. Taste-wise, these get a 5 all day long.<br /><br />Inside the package is one of those trays like Chips Ahoy come in. It would be easy to eat a whole row of these (maybe 15-20 thins). But if you did that, you'd be eating 933 calories and 33 grams of fat! A serving size is just 3 thins, and even though they are kind of big, they're still...well thin. So 3 thins might work as a dessert if you pre-ration them, but otherwise I think you're always going to want more than 3 to be satisfied.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed is 'uncbleached enriched flour,' and 'whole grain wheat flour' doesn't make an appearance until about halfway down the list. It does have soy in it, and the fruit flavor seems to come only from dried blueberries and no weird stuff. The ingredient list is pretty short, which is nice. Nutriton-wise, it only has 2g of dietary fiber and nothing really notable for vitamins. I'm a bit disappointed. You'd think something called 'newton fruit thins' would have some redeeming nutrional quality, but these don't. It wouldn't be hard to make them a more healthy snack, and I wish Nabisco had done that.<br /><br />Despite how good they taste, the serving size/calories/fat issue makes them not a good buy for me, because they're just not a healthy snack. They're junk food disguised as a healthy snack, which might even be worse than plain old junk food.

review/summary: Tasty, but not completely nutritious...
review/text: What do you get when you combine blueberries and a cookie? You get these tasty morsels!<br /><br />The texture of these cookies is about the same as a Chips-Ahoy cookie, but instead of chocolate chips you get really tasty blueberries that are a bit sweet and tart.<br /><br />The added bit of texture and crunch from the flax seeds is nice to see (I add flax to practically everything I eat).<br /><br />Ingredients wise I was actually quite shocked to see very few and those few are actual ingredients, not junk!<br /><br />My only complaint (besides them being addictively scrumptious) is that they aren't really "good" for you. Three of these cookies have 140 calories, 5 grams of fat (1 saturated), and 8 grams of sugar. So I would probably suggest using these as an alternative to other snack cookies.<br /><br />If you are looking for something a little sweet and want that cookie texture, these will fit the bill perfectly.

review/summary: Delicious, but one is not enough
review/text: Being diabetic, I am always looking for snacks that have low carbohydrates.  Generally for diabetes they recommend 15-30 carbs per snack.  At only 7 carbs per cookie, you can eat 4 of these and still be within the recommended limit.  You probably will need to eat at least 4 to feel satisfied, as they are thin and not that filling.  They do have a nice blueberry taste; not artificial tasting at all.  The cookie texture is nice and crunchy; not too dry and not too moist.  Not exactly a brown sugar taste, but very pleasant.  I can't imagine anyone not liking these.  I liked them very much and recommend them.  They are not overly sweet either, which is really nice.  You could easily eat 1/2 a bag at one sitting if you are not careful, or even the whole bag.  If you have self discipline you can eat just 2 or 3 and satisfy your taste buds, although maybe not your hunger.

review/summary: Great Snack!
review/text: I'll admit, I wasn't expecting much when I received these. I figured they'd be dry with that fake blueberry taste, but I was wrong! These are a great between meals snack. Much better than the chocolate chip cookies or potato chips I normally reach for. Two of these thins along with a big glass of milk were just enough to satisfy my need for a snack. That's strange too...I'm not at ALL a milk drinker. I can't stand the stuff on it's own, but after my first couple bites, I felt the need to pour a glass. They go great together!<br /><br />Overall, I really liked these! The blueberry taste is spot-on, and they're a great size, not too big, not too small. I saw the chocolate raspberry flavor in the grocery store this afternoon...I think I may have to go back for that flavor!

review/summary: Delicious, cant wait to try other varities
review/text: Today, I had the opportunity to review a new treat:  Newtons Fruit Thins.<br /><br />Now, I have never been a big fan of Fig Newtons because, well, I do not like figs.  But when I heard about these cookies, I decided to try them, because they were not only healthy, they were also fig free!  The flavor I chose was Blueberry Brown Sugar.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the info on the packaging.  One serving was 3 cookies, containing 140 calories, with 5 grams of fat and 2 grams of fiber.  That is not too shabby for cookies, as long as they are good.<br /><br />Next I noticed that these cookies had appeal for those in stricter diets.  They contain real fruit, whole grain, and NO high fructose corn syrup.  So, in other words, Moms can feel good about giving these to their little ones.<br /><br />But, how would they taste?  I decided to dive in.  As I opened the package, I noticed the cookies smelled like real blueberries, which is always a plus.  The smell was sweet, and fresh, like homemade blueberry muffins.  I was getting really excited by this point.<br /><br />I got the recommended serving of three cookies.  I immediately noticed that their thin, crunchy texture reminded me of what the British call biscuits, so I paired them with a cup of chai tea.  Finally, time for my first taste.  I took a nibble, and was pleasantly surprised.  They were delicious!  They are very flavorful, and the serving of 3 cookies is just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.  They held up well being dipped into my tea as well.<br /><br />I am happy to say, I am a huge fan of these cookies, and so is Hubby. And since he is suspicious of anything healthy, fruity, and with no chocolate components, that is saying a lot! I will definitely be getting these again, and most likely will try the other flavors they have out as well.

review/text: I agree you can't stop at just one serving (3 cookies), so I would suggest hiding these. They are 7% of your calorie RDI, but the blueberry redeems them (what else would you expect from the Newton cookie subfamily of Nabisco?). At 90 mg of sodium (4% of recommended daily values), these fruit thins won't break your blood pressure (if you are concerned, read  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590771591">Bringing Down High Blood Pressure</a>), So far I haven't been able to find any of the sodium variants that are usually used in processed baked goods (they are present in Newton's Fruit Crisps, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK1GY">Newtons Fruit Crisp Snacks, Apple Cinnamon, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>).

They are more like a hard Ritz cracker.  I did notice after swallowing an odd after-taste that I cannot quite place.  It tastes a little like the carroway seeds from rye bread.  It wasn't bad, though, and it was gone pretty quickly.<br /><br />A couple of these will tide you over between meals, and the nutritional value is pretty good for a treat.

review/summary: Deliciously crispy and tasty, but somewhat messy.
review/text: Received my pack yesterday and couldn't wait to rip it open since I had just been contemplating what to eat to satisfy my sweet tooth. A number of thins didn't survive the shipping so lots of broken pieces, which were actually easier to eat than the full cookie. The actual thin itself is pretty hard and has a tendency to crack in several directions when you bite into it, which makes for a messy endeavor. I set it on my pant leg and was rewarded with lots of crumbs. But the taste is pleasing, nice blueberry hints and though I didn't get the brown sugar flavor as much as I wanted to, it's still sweet enough to satisfy a craving. Each thin is approximately 46 calories, which does seem a bit high given such a small snack, but I would definitely buy them as a nice cookie-alternative.

However, I assumed (never do that...) that they were reasonably low calorie, but in fact the serving size is three cookies and the calorie count is well over 100 for that amount.  They are addictive, so watch out!  All in all, a good cookie with a nice flavor and no funky aftertaste.  Just break out the food scale or bag up 3 in your lunch box and leave the rest of the pack at home!

review/text: I got these for free off the Amazon Vine program ... at the time I was pretty pissed because all of the electronics and other cool free stuff were already gone, and the best thing left were these Newtons so I settled for them.  Well, they turned out to be pretty good.

review/summary: Actually is delicious and as good for you as a cookie can be!
review/text: These cookies are crispy, lightly sweet and delicious.  They really do taste like real blueberries and brown sugar and make a great accompaniment to tea.  My husband who doesn't eat many sweets, picky 10 year old and 5 year old really enjoyed them, as well.  A big hit with this family!

review/summary: flavor vs aftertaste
review/text: These fruit thins have a wonderful fruit flavor.  You realy get a yummy burst of blueberry and some brown sugar.  However, the flax seed makes the texture a bit unexpected, and the soybean oil leaves a bit of aftertaste.  My children (5 and 7) liked the first bite or two, and then were done with them.  My husband does not really like them plain, but does like them with cheese (such as a brie).  I like the health value, but it is very crunchy with a slight aftertaste.  if you're looking for a healthy snack, however, these are worth trying.
