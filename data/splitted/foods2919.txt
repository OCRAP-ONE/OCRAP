review/summary: Great taste but some drawbacks
review/text: These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.

review/summary: a dark chocolate lovers' delight, a blueberry lover's disappointment
review/text: "Cocoa" is the ingredient on the label of the chocolate peanut butter Clif crunch bars but I found these Clif Crunch snack bars less overly-sweet than many others.  They taste like they contain dark, as opposed to the easy-to-find milk, chocolate. I recommend them to dark chocolate lovers and ordered three more boxes, straight-away.<br /><br />On the other hand, the blueberry bars are a loser, in my opinion. There is only a faint blueberry flavor.  This blueberry-lover would just love one choc-full of dried blueberries, adding the appropriate blueberry flavor to these crunchy snack bars.

review/text: I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.  They are so good, however, I've continued to purchase them.  Even my children really like them and they usually only like granola bars if they are packed with so much sugar and covered in chocolate to the point you can't distinguish them from a candy bar.<br /><br />I like the Clif brand and what the company is trying to do, besides offering a more wholesome granola bar without compromising taste.<br /><br />The granola bars are certified organic by QAI and packaging is made from 100% recycled material.  Hey, every little bit helps when you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint.

Each box comes with 5 packages of 2 bars a piece. These are a great snack for the middle of the day. I'm looking forward to trying out the other flavors. If you get it with S&S, the price is very low as well. Overall, this is a great granola bar at a great price!

review/text: My daughter loves these bars.  The order came quickly.  No complaints whatsoever.  The only thing I would mention is that these bars are crumbly and do not "travel well" compared to the softer bars out there.  So I think we will have some softer bars for travel and these bars when travel is not an issue.  Hope that makes sense!

review/text: I like Clif bars because they taste good but not great enough that you want to eat a whole lot of them. These crunch bars are no exception. I usually have clif bars in my school bag to stave off hunger during classes before succumbing to the call of a vending machine.<br /><br />The Chocolate Macadamia Nut flavor is a bit too sweet for my tastes which was a little surprising for a Clif bar (but it is chocolate). I like that each packet comes with two thin bars rather than one big granola bar - great for sharing or portioning.

review/text: I like Clif products in general and this one is also pretty good.  It tastes good and it has better list of ingredients than the more processed ones from Nature's Valley, etc.  But the thing crumbles too much.  It doesn't hold together very well and from the moment you open the package, there's crumbs all over you.  Just be aware of it.  It's tasty and crunchy as they say on the package.

review/text: I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut. However, when I bought them I wasn't expecting them to be quite so messy. They are definitely crunchy, and you will get crumbs everywhere - so keep that in mind. Otherwise I love the things! I'm a college student so this is a good breakfast or snack on my walk to class.

review/summary: Decent granola bar, but the packaging is a bit misleading
review/text: When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a "10-pack" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.

I'm not familiar with it, but a quick google search shows it to be a healthier and better alternative to regular cane sugar.<br /><br />Great texture and crunch, and great flavor.  A perfect snack that is much much healthier than a lot of alternatives.<br /><br />I could not imagine a better granola bar.  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Crunched Crunch
review/text: Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.

review/text: I bought these in Maui on a recent trip. The box is very attractive and makes for a suitable gift for all occasions. The balls are maybe the size of a large marble and coated with a fine dusting of powdered sugar. Inside is a whole macadamia nut (not a nut half). They are crunchy and really satisfying to bite into, and not overly sweet. The crunch from the toffee and nut is a wonderful combination. My only small complaint is the cup design of the holder. They're too deep for the candy.<br /><br />But that's really a very trivial comment. I wholeheartedly recommend these. As for the pricing, if it is for 1 box, it's severely overpriced. You can get order them a lot cheaper directly from Hawaiian Princess's website.

review/summary: Totonac Sugar Free Syrups
review/text: I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles.

review/text: but unfortunately, it was, to me, really unpalatable. I'm generally not picky when it comes to sugar substitutes - I get that nothing is going to match sugar exactly in taste. But oh boy, the luo han just doesn't do it for me. If you are ok with that sweetener, then you might just find this to be a great syrup. But, to others, I recommend you try luo han first before ordering.

review/text: If you like flavored coffee creamer, Coffee Mate is the best.  I've been using the flavored Coffee-Mate products for years.  I've used the store brands, but they're just ok in my opinion.  Not as rich and and not as flavorful.<br /><br />Of course the big plus for store brands is that they are usually 1/2 the price of Coffee Mate.  I work from home, and I drink alot of coffee, so when I found this bulk discount on Amazon, I jumped on it.  Best of both worlds (quality and price.

review/summary: Nice and strong
review/text: If you are like me, you like your coffee strong. I have found that even though I love the convenience aspect of using the Senseo coffee maker, most of the pods I've used come out fairly weak. Well, not Black Mountain Gold. The cinnamon coffee cake flavor I sampled was the richest coffee pod coffee I have tried to date. It was rich, smooth, and had just a hint of bitterness. Behind the Donut Shop Classics brand of coffee pods, I'd say these are the second best I've tried.

I think I may have found the missing ingredient.  Very cool.

review/text: This is one of our favorite gluten-free cereals.  It reminds me of Cheerios - crunchy and very lightly sweetened.  It's great with milk without becoming soggy quickly.  And it is not too stout, like some of the other whole-grain rice cereals that we've tried.<br /><br />It rarely goes on a significant sale at our Fred Meyer's (the local store with a gluten-free section), so it is a good bargain for us to buy it here by the case.<br /><br />I would also recommend Nature's Path Organic Honey Sweetened Corn Flakes.

review/text: I think the cereal gods have smiled down on all of us poor fools who at once are maddened by the loss of so much after the tragedies that we have encountered and the horrors of the response. Many alive today will look back on these days in their later years and they will remember Nature's Path as the company that may very well have been responsible for returning just one bit of sanity to the world. While some that make the snapping, crackling, and popping may get most of the publicity, the terribly corrupt fiber removal machines wreak vengeance on the digestive tract and will cause unrest and disrupt the natural movement of material down that wonderful tube.<br /><br />Thanks for the little brown grains of goodness.

review/text: I think Amazon is on the right track by offering groceries, but I think you need to stick to major brands and work a bit more on making your pricing competitive ( it was still quite a bit more than Safeway, not to mention Wal-Mart).I expect to pay a little for the convenience but not quite as much as I did. The rice crispies were a little "different" than I expected.I don't quite understand why you make us buy quantity when your packaging is not pre packaged? I expected to get four boxes somehow stuck together or banded together to ease your shipping costs and was quite surprised to get cereal one or two boxes of cereal to a shipping box.If that is how you are going to ship it wouldn't it be better to let us buy smaller quantities to increase your overall sales?

review/text: I heard about these cakes first from the ever popular YogsCast. Being a fan, and after hearing the hosts scatter compliments about the cakes time after time, I decided to give them a go. Unfortunately, they are not sold in the US, so I came to Amazon to get them shipped from abroad. I was told to expect the cakes between March 2nd and March 15th.<br /><br />They arrived a few days ago, three weeks early.<br /><br />The cakes were perfectly fresh when they arrived, still in possession of their famous soft, spongy texture that makes them so fun to eat. The orange jelly is probably my favorite part of it all. First you nibble at the cake around the edges, enjoying the texture, then you get to the real deal, where the chocolate, jelly, and cake break off into layers in your mouth, letting you enjoy all the textures at once. Love these things. Even if they didn't taste good (which they definitely do, they taste really good) they'd still be really fun to eat. Perfect cakes from the perfect seller. Would definitely buy from them again.

review/summary: Its nice to see these again
review/text: This review is based on my experience with the shipper British Delights. I ordered these Jaffa Cakes on the 25 and received them on the 28th. I only ordered one because I was not sure how the quality would compare to my previous experience of having these gems on my last trip to England. The package I received were fresh cakes and was sent very securely using UPS. It's hard to write a review about Jaffa Cakes because you either love them or hate them but if you want to give them a shot I would give them a try. I already fell in love with this item and was excited to see it available on Amazon but I was mostly afraid of the quality of the item as Amazon does not ship this themselves and I am somewhat scared to use other sellers so I gave British Delights a try because they offered the lower price compared to the others available and they had good reviews. I have not tried the other sellers so I can not speak for the quality of the item and at the moment I will stick with British Delights as I just ordered 4 more boxes to stock up.<br /><br />Just a little advice, Jaffa Cakes are a nice treat and snack to have every now and then but I really think they will be best enjoyed with tea or something light to drink with. Don't take this as if it is a dry cake because it is not but it just adds to the experience. You don't eat these like other snack foods... thou you could. I included some pictures of the box I received with health information and just how the box looks really. Today is September 28 2012 and the best by date on the box I received was November 17 2012

review/text: I was first made aware of Jaffa Cakes through the popular YouTube channel "BlueXephos", where the British hosts are fond of the snack.  In an attempt to expand my international snack food boundaries, I asked for a box for Christmas.<br /><br />Not going to say I was disappointing by the taste of Jaffa Cakes.  I was, however, slightly confused by the texture of the orange filling.  With the first cake I thought the filling felt like a gummy bear, but the more cakes I ate the more it grew on me.  The chocolate is good, and the sponge cake is very pleasing.  I think these would go great with tea/coffee/hot chocolate.<br /><br />Go ahead and try a box!  At the very worst, if you don't like the taste then you can amuse yourself by reading the back of the box with a terrible Cockney accent.

Not sure if I want to try to consume something that has obviously been tampered with to some degree. Too bad because I was really looking forward to trying these.

review/summary: Great Spice, just not overly spicy
review/text: This overall is one of my favorite spices.  It goes well in almost all dishes where either a hot spice, chili or black pepper would be included.  Used in moderation, it adds a wonderful flavor.  Used generously, adds a pleasant heat, similar to a microwave set to low in your mouth.<br /><br />Pros:  Flavorful spice that goes well with most foods, including soul food, Cajun, Southwest, Mexican, Indian or good ol' American.<br /><br />Cons:  Not overly hot.  For most people, yes, it is hot but it certainly doesn't stand up to the Habanero name.<br /><br />Again, if you are looking for a favorful addition to your food, this is the spice you are looking for.  If you just want something to make your best friend's eyes water, look for an extract.

review/text: these peanut squares have been dusted with flour or cornstarch or something, perhaps to keep them from sticking together, but the chalky powder is very off-putting. I won't order again.

review/summary: Addicting
review/text: During a recent trip back east, I had a similar item purchased at the Cracker Barrel restaurant. These candies are not quite as tasty, but very close. The problem is that it is very easy to pop these squares in your mouth and keep snacking without realizing how many you've had. Good taste, crunchy but not too hard, not healthy at all but delicious and I'll buy again.

review/summary: Just can't wait for my V-8!
review/text: While most members of my family like orange juice, it's much too sweet for my taste, so for a bit of extra Vitamin C, I opt for a fresh orange instead.<br /><br />And when it comes to my juice drink, I've always liked the flavor of V-8. Not only does it taste good to me, since it's made from tomatoes and seven other vegetables--beets, celery, carrots, lettuce, parsley, watercress and spinach--it's healthy, also. While I get a hint of all those veggies in my V-8, the celery flavor seems dominant to me ... a flavor I love, incidentally. Whether this is unique with me, I have no idea.  It's something I don't discuss with friends. All I know is that I can't help but smile as it slides down my throat. Yum ...<br /><br />Another thing I like about V-8 is that since the kids in the family don't like it (sorry, Campbell's), I never have to worry about running out. But what I don't like about it is that it's high in sodium, thus requiring that I limit myself to 4 ounces every other day.<br /><br />I know!  I know!  They make low-sodium V-8, but I've tried it and it's not for me. Just doesn't taste the same!  However, in addition to my favorite, the Original, Campbell's also makes several other varieties: Spicy, Lemon, Picante, Low-Sodium, and Organic. I'm also a person who likes "lemon" flavor (such as lemon-meringue pie), so I plan to try the lemon soon.<br /><br />There's something for everybody, so try it! You might like it! I certainly do! (Since I love the taste of this product so much, I feel guilty giving it a four-star, but I had to knock off one point due to the high-sodium factor.)<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley

review/summary: Nice snack--and good for you!
review/text: One of my Amazon friends reviewed this product recently and sent me into a state of shame and guilt.  This is the kind of thing I ought to drink fairly regularly.  It's healthy and it tastes pretty good.  But the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and I tend to drink this for awhile--and then forget about it.<br /><br />Well, after having been shamed, I bought some of this just a short while ago.  And, yum, it tastes pretty good!  I've started having this as a part of a low calorie lunch. High levels of Vitamin C. It tastes pretty good!  I forget why I get out of the habit!<br /><br />The only downside that I see is that the sodium level is a bit high--but not as bad as with a lot of processed foods (take a look at canned soups!).<br /><br />So, I'm trying to begin the habit of having this regularly.  How long will it be before I get out of the habit??

review/summary: V8 Lovin Lover
review/text: I'm not sure when I had my first V8, but I was very young. I've been told I would down one of those large cans, or jugs in a days time, if allowed. V8 Juice is one of the only drinks I'd be able to drink large amounts.<br />Having very serious health conditions which warranted dietary restrictions, having a V8 made the later teenage years a little easier while out. Today, I enjoy it for taste, no longer able to swallow food or drinks!<br />I noticed reviewers were upset over the salt count,as I have learned from medical people that it is good for most people, unless you have high blood pressure.In fact, I require large amounts of this stuff, and the doctors have no set limits!

review/text: I mean, a sugarless candy bar is not going to be delicious. If you have a sweet tooth as I do but have to reduce sugar intake, then try to get used to these. After a while you notice that real candy bars are way too sweet and you can actually look forward to one of these. If you're the type of person who loves soda, but can't get used to diet soda, then these are not for you.

review/text: When bought the shipping was a Great surprise! Shipping was more than the Sauce. Contacted Merchant & they said they would cancel the order. (It doesn't take 29.00 to ground ship a gallon of Teriyaki Sauce!!!) I was happy they said they would cancel the entire order, however... it arrived 7 days later & my credit card was charged... I believe they enjoy just telling you what it is you want to hear & they will do what they want & keep the exorbitant Shipping rate as margin. Very disappointed & would suggest purchasing elsewhere. I did keep the gallon & the sauce is average in taste & is not as great as talked up... Again BEWARE of exorbitant shipping with this merchant...

review/summary: Flavor is fine, but beware of extra fizz
review/text: Of all the flavors we have tried, this is my husband's favorite, but it is also the only flavor that consistently fizzes out of the bottle when added to the water.  The colder the water, the more likely this mix will make your sodastream bottle erupt like a grade school vinegar-and-baking soda volcano.  The trick is to add the mix slowly down the side, but even then, sometimes the fizz starts a few seconds after pouring as the mix reaches the bottom of the bottle.  Definitely create this mix over the sink!

review/text: I grew up with Brooks Tangy Ketchup in my home and anything else always seemed sub par. My preference for Brooks carried over into adulthood. When the local WalMart quit carrying Brooks Tangy Ketchup, I was able to get it at a local grocery. Although more expensive overall than WalMart, I would go to the local grocery explicitly to get Brooks Tangy Ketchup. Today I stopped in, and there was none on the shelf. I inquired and sadly, they no longer carry it. Upon returning home I immediately went to the internet and found it is still available. That's a good thing. But it is interesting to note that there is obviously a very loyal fan base for the product so why did it disappear from the grocery shelves?<br /><br />I hope it comes back to the grocery, but at least it is now available online.

Please never stop making it.<br /><br />I also love brooks' other products as well.
