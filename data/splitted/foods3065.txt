review/summary: Great gluten free granola
review/text: This is great gluten free granola.  I react to gluten free oats so this is the only good quality gluten free granola I can eat.  I have tried others that were basically ground up nuts and raisins--that's not granola to me.  This one has some gluten free grains to give it some added interest and texture.  It is very sweet so I sprinkle it onto my plain GF cereal to jazz it up a bit.  It is too sweet for me to eat all by itself.

review/summary: Tasty, but VERY sweet
review/text: I enjoy the flavors in this cereal a great deal.  I like the crunchiness and the fruit flavors and the maple flavor as well.  Unfortunately I find it to be way too sweet.  Four of the ingredients are sweeteners including evaporated cane juice, raisin juice, honey, and cranberry sugar. At least there is no high fructose corn syrup, but there are a total of 13 grams of sugar in each 3/4 cup serving.  A bit much for my taste.<br /><br />I don't think I will buy it again, but to help me get through the six bags I purchased, I mix it with an equal share of plain, unsweetened rice cereal.

review/summary: The Best Snack Food Around
review/text: After being diagnosed with Celiac disease, I looked for food that was gluten free.  I found the Bakery On Main's Gluten Free Granola at my local Walmart. I was desperate for something to snack on during the day, so I bought a bag.  That was three years ago and I am addicted to the product.  There are several flavors and I enjoy them all but my favorite is Nutty Cranberry Maple. Read the label on the front--It is so good for you.<br /><br />Because the store doesn't stock a large supply and runs out quickly, I always buy all they have every time I shop.  Finally I broke down and went to the website and found that I could order it from the source at a much lower cost that charged at the supermarket.  I order 6 bags every month and love it so much that I run out before the next shipment arrives. I may have to increase my order!

review/text: For the most part this was a very good product. It does have little seeds in it and one of the packages that I used had a large percentage of the seeds while the 2nd bag that I opened did not. The best part of the cereal are the small round crunchy things , the nuts and cranberries. The seeds just get stuck between your teeth! I do like the taste and consistency though and it is a good deal compared to buying it in the supermarket.

review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac's disease several years ago and one item I had a hard time finding a substitute for was granola (to eat with my yogurt in the morning).  Then a friend introduced me to Bakery on Main Nutty Cranberry Maple and my substitute was found!  I like that the granola is in small pieces (to mix with my yogurt) as well as in larger chunks (when I just feel like eating a bite of it)!  It has so many great things in it, too, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, almonds, sesame seeds and pecans.  A delicious accompaniment to many breakfasts!

review/text: I have purchased this at several stores and have ALWAYS loved it. For the first time I purchased 2 packs of 6 bags thru Amazon.  I have only started on the first box of 6 and the granola tastes burnt!  I thought the first bag would be a fluke and then when I tried the second it was the same and so on.  How very disappointing!!!! I'm guessing the rest are the same and have to figure out how to return them.  Anyone else have this problem??  I even sent and email to Bakery on Main telling them about it and requested a response and still haven't heard back from them and it was over a week ago! For the price of this stuff it's not going to be worth paying the money if you don't know what you are going to get. So much for good things come in small batches :(

The clumps of cereal and nuts are very flavorful and remind me of some other cereal I used to eat, long ago - I can't place the flavor, but it's yummy.  I think this would be great mixed in with some other GF cereal, like Nature's Path Gorilla Munch, or you'd eat the whole bag in one sitting.  I bought this for my son's breakfast but I am going to use the cereal for snacks instead - it's only got 13 g. of sugar.  Highly recommend this!

review/text: Simply put, this just doesn't taste good.  I'm surprised it got ratings this high, because it really doesn't deserve them.<br /><br />Edit: I should have figured; it's gluten free.  So the people reviewing this are probably used to eating bad-tasting things.

review/summary: Overpriced...Try Trader Joes Brand
review/text: My wife has been on a GF diet for a few years now, and recently our son was diagnosed as well. She found and ordered this product to try out and we all loved the taste right away. I was a little dismayed at the price per bag, but I soon found out that pretty much all GF specialty foods were on the pricey side and I needed to get used to it, especially b/c she had to order most of it online (add S&H).<br /><br />But then they opened up a Trader Joe's right down the street from us this past year and we discovered a near-identical cereal product for half the price!!! Same flavor, same ingredients, same GF assurance...but only $2.99 a bag.<br /><br />They even started carrying this product in our local Kroger grocery stores recently, but it's still $6.99 per bag!!! So no S&H, but you're still paying crazy $$$ for cereal.<br /><br />No contest for us...TJ all the way.

All 6 boxes arrived in great shape--and this was in the middle of the busy holiday shipping season. So perhaps the other reviewer's experience was not the norm.

review/summary: Tasty Organic Crackers
review/text: My family really enjoys these crackers and the Amazon price for the pack of 6 is the lowest I've seen anywhere.  They are just right for snacking with almond butter, peanut butter, or cheese.  I wish they didn't contain any white flour, i.e. the first ingredient, listed as "wheat flour".  However, they do contain a lot of whole grains and are organic.  We are pleased that they don't have preservatives or artifical flavors/colors.  So, we will continue to order these, and hold out hope for a truly whole grain organic cracker that tastes good!  These have always arrived fresh and with very few broken crackers.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Nothing natural about these.
review/text: I bought these crackers and I did not find anything "natural" about them. What is "natural" about "enriched unbleached flour"? Some manufacturers think we the buyers are too ignorant to tell the difference. When I read the list of ingredients (that the manufacturers conveniently hide from the online buyer) I was appalled. I will never buy these UNnatural, WHITE flour crackers with a little amoung of added vitamins of those that were removed when the flour was refined. On top of the poor quality and the misleading information provided, 70% of them were smashed to pieces. If you are really looking for natural, healthy crackers, look somewhere else.

review/text: I was shopping at Big Lots just before Christmas when my son spotted this Funnel Cake kit. He begged me and, well, it was Christmas, so I picked it up and it sat in our pantry till this weekend. I surprised the kids with these funnel cakes on Saturday night and they were a big hit!  They were extremely easy to make (just add water) and the included yellow pourer worked flawlessly.  It says to fry them for 30 seconds but I found that too mushy.  1 minute on one side, 30 seconds on the other gave me a crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Sprinkle with a little powdered sugar and it's just like being at the fair.

review/summary: The Rub You Crave
review/text: I was given the 3-pack by a friend of mine and I have to say that this person is definitely my best friend for life. I should begin by stating that I LOVE chicken wings - I try them everytime I see them on a menu. Since trying these rubs, however, especially the Finger Lickin', I just can't bring myself to try them any place else.  The rub is perfectly spicy, perfectly smoky and leaves you craving more. We grill up these bad boys at least once a week in our household, but I have also marinated whole chickens, spiced up some grilled shrimp and even added to popcorn. AMAZING. The levels of heat are, shall we say, pretty extreme. The Easy Pickin' is for those of you that like a teeny-tiny amount of heat in your dishes (think poblano), Finger Lickin' for those a little more adventuresome (think jalapeno) and for those of you that ski the Black Diamonds, well, you really should try What Was I Thinkin' (think Ghost Pepper, times 4). The first bite I took made me kinda giggle like, hey, I got this. I defeat you Ghost Pepper. Then....it....hit. I have never sweated, cried and guffawed all at the same time. It was, truly, an unreal experience and I'm ever so grateful I tried it.<br /><br />I sure hope you give these a shot. You will truly be impressed with the flavor sensations!!!

My husband and I named our black Lab-Rhodesian Ridgeback-mix dog "Zonker" because he was black on the outside and sweet on the inside, just like SYZs.  These are the perfect nostalgia food.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088UIBDW">Screaming Yellow Zonkers! Limited Edition</a>

review/summary: Fenugreek without the middleman markup sold by the pound
review/text: Spices from Butcher and Packer are always a pleasant event.<br />Whom does not want to get ripped off from buying spices from a middleman grocery chain whom jacks up the prices through the roof.<br />Instead, by from the source as i have always done.<br />One pound of spice is too much? Go find your family to split the spice order and buy in bulk. Next time you are walking down the grocery aisle LOOK at the price of one of those 4 ounce spice containers and instead envision yourself buying four times that much for about the price of that jacked up spice sold at that store.<br />Review their complete Amazon posted website store and add to your order anything and everything you would normally buy at the grocery store.<br />Then, when those one pound purchases arrive, they are in sealed plastic bags so you will need in advance spice holding containers to transfer that spice via funnel.<br />Buy extra of peppers cause you know you are already using pepper and determine whether ground versus whole is best for you.<br />Place a massive order versus small orders since the shipping fees by ratio become cheaper with the larger the order. Arrives packaged well.<br />Now, that Christmas holiday is soon arriving check out all their spices like nutmeg,etc and start your baking in bulk.<br />enough said, check out their amazon website and review your order per pounds.<br />Remember, one pound of spice is alot of spice too.<br />Enjoy and save some of your hard earned cash.

review/summary: Best Pinot Noir For My Taste
review/text: I was recently introduced to this Pinot Noir.  I've had 2009 & 2010. EXCELLENT!!! This wine is fullbodied and fruity. If you don't like the bitter dark types, then this one will bring you in. Have to buy from the east coast. No problem though...worth every penny.

review/summary: Wow! Surprisingly good for sugar free!
review/text: This syrup is awesome.<br /><br />First off, yes, you can tell it's sugar free. There's no major aftertaste or weird flavor to it. It's just a little subtly different from regular.<br />It is also very, very liquid-y compared to regular syrup. It's quite runny.<br /><br />However, do I really care if my syrup is kinda watery?? NOPE.<br />This stuff can't be perfect, but if the only thing wrong with it is the fact that's it a little thinner than regular syrup, then bring it on. I can deal with that. If you simply must have super-thick consistency to your syrup, then you might find this off-putting.<br /><br />It tastes extremely close to regular ol' maple syrup from the restaurant. It's delicious and amazingly low calorie, so in my opinion it is definitely worth the minimal sacrifice of having "thick" syrup, so I can plunk down another pancake or two onto my plate instead.

review/summary: Perfect for the Gluten-free, Vegan or Vegetarian Chef
review/text: I've been using these boullion cubes since I lived in Japan and had to buy all my health food online. They are made in Switzerland, are vegan and gluten-free, and are perfect for the gluten-free chef's kitchen. I like the flavor much better than packaged stocks, and although of course making your own stock or broth from fresh veggies is better, it is really convenient to have these cubes on hand for adding a little flavor to recipes. I use them in Chinese dishes, for risotto, and of course for soups or stews. I like the fact that they are convenient to store, don't go bad (within reason), and don't have to be stored in the refrigerator. They also have a low-sodium variety which unfortunately does not seem to be offered by Amazon. Also, love that these are available for Prime/free shipping. They run around $3.70 per package in California so this bulk offer is a good deal, if you don't mind storing a box. They are also soy free, but are not corn-free, if you have a corn intolerance.<br /><br />Happy cooking!<br />-gluten-free chef in California

review/summary: Delicious! Vegetable Enhancer!
review/text: I received my first bottle of this Viking Smoked Salt as a stocking stuffer. I like to cook and I started using it w/everything! I feel this really enhances the flavor of the veggies. It is especially delicious on roasted vegetables.<br /><br />1. Turn oven on to broil.<br />2. Prepare a baking pan with foil.<br />3. Lay out my veggies (asparagus, brussel sprouts, broccoli, etc) in a single layer.<br />4. Douse with extra virgin olive oil (evoo).<br />5. Sprinkle liberally with Viking Smoked Salt.<br />6. I sometimes add ground black pepper and ground garlic.<br />7. I leave the veggies in there till they start to get golden brown but I really like them kinda charred... About 8-14 mins.<br /><br />I have also used in sauteing vegetables (mushrooms, green beans, brussel sprouts, etc)<br /><br />1. Turn on stove to a medium high fire.<br />2. Prepare a large frying pan with evoo (just enough to cover the expanse of the pan).<br />3. When oil starts to separate, drop in vegetables.<br />4. Coat veggies w/oil from pan (add more if needed). I also sometimes add a few pats of butter for taste.<br />5. Sprinkle with Viking Smoked Salt.<br />6. Keep mixing the veggies.<br />7. I turn off the fire when the veggies are al dente(still a little bit crisp) but that is up to you...
