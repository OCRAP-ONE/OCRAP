review/summary: Delicious, Sweet and Light
review/text: These are delicious--taste very light and sweet, almost like a graham cracker sandwich with chocolate in the middle. The chocolate layer is very thin. It's a great way to get whole wheat in the diet, with one gram of fiber per two crackers. These aren't available everywhere in the country, though. And they are new--so there's a good chance they'll be gone at some point (which often happens to new snacks that I like!). Go ahead and try them--I wasn't sure but went for it and am now addicted to them!

review/text: I like Lance products but I wasn't sure how these would be received. Both kids loved them, they have a good texture and taste. Great change from chewy granola bars or cookies. Lance packs these with a small stiff liner so they generally survive in the lunch box without shattering. Definitely buying again.

review/summary: Vernont Maid Syrup
review/text: Vermont Maid Syrup is without equal.  It is the kind my mother always purchased and we always had.  By having this syrup on my pancakes now, I can feel the warm waffles or pancakes that I had when I was 6 to 10 years old ... it is 1952 to 1957, a Saturday morning, 20 to 25 degrees and 6 inches of fresh snow is on the ground.  Mom is saying,  " You need a good breakfast before you can go out.....and be sure and take your scarf and gloves....it's cold today."<br />Without Vermont Maid, the breakfast would have been skipped....I wouldn't have had a warm breakfast inside...I would've gotten a cold and would have had to stay in bed for the reat of the winter....no sledding, no ice skating, no hockey, no snowball fights, no snow forts...but, because Vermont maid was on the table, I had the breakfast.<br />Now THAT'S how good Vermont Maid is.

review/summary: Almost the real thing
review/text: I had this product 40 years ago when it first came out.  At that time, it was 1/2 maple syrup.  Now, it has only maple flavor.  However, industrial food research being what it is, the syrup tastes like the real thing.  If the price you see shown is 1/2 or less than real maple syrup(which I imagine it is), and you need a lot of it, then this offer is for you.

review/text: Have searched for this product for several years since we moved to Kentucky from Vermont.  We have always picked up several bottles when we go home to visit but since we flew the last couple of times, we were unable to bring it back with us.  I found this online at Amazon.com at a very reasonable price and shipping was free because I ordered something else as well.  Although we are from Vermont, my whole family prefers the Vermont Maid syrup to the genuine article.

review/summary: Balanced flavor for everyday drinking
review/text: Medium roast, mellow coffee with little or no bitterness.  We drink this for our everyday coffee - made in a french press.  It has a nice coffee flavor with no noticable overtones.  Occassionally when I leave a cup, I rewarm it in the microwave.  This actually tastes quite acceptable that way as long as I don't boil it - many other coffees end up with an off taste after the microwave.  Still, it is better fresh out of the pot though.

review/summary: Great more natural baking powder
review/text: I've been using this for a few years after I found out that it does not contain any aluminum.  Besides that, there is no genetically modified cornstarch in it either(I also use Rumford non-GMO cornstarch, too).  It is double acting, and I really feel like I get quite a bit fluffier cake, and quickbreads that are not as dense, which I personally prefer.  I do a lot of baking during the holidays, so getting a double pack was a great option, then I don't have to run to the store last minute.<br /><br />It is gluten free and made in a peanut free facility, in case there are any allergies a person needs to be concerned about.

review/summary: Good product, but expires too soon.
review/text: The Sweet & Tangy is perfect for making shredded chicken in the slow cooker, and it is sweet and tangy. The sauce is a thinner than most so that you can make perfect sliders. My husband and friends have raved about these very easy to make chicken sliders (which is uncommon for my husband because hes not really a food person).  The only drawback was that all 12 bottles in the pack expire in just a few months.  I bought the large box thinking they would have expiration dates that were at least 6 months out, so we could have this meal 2x a month.  Now I am giving the barbecue sauce away to friends because we will not be able to finish it in time.  They should indicate in the product description that the product will expire so soon.

These are great treats to reward any animal, they are healthy and don't have any invasive odors like a lot of other pet treats. I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well. Aside from being a little bland, they are pretty good, put a little hot sauce on them and it could pass along with most of the frozen snacks that kids eat. If you are looking for a premium treat to give to your pets I suggest Pure Bites.

review/summary: 2 bags rancid! calling company today!
review/text: UPDATED APRIL 2012: I'm returning 6 more pouches of PureBites Chicken today, after first calling the company for instructions. The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said "someone else likely helped you". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's "acceptable" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.

review/text: My cats love these treats crushed on top of their food. I mix it with their dry and wet food. Sometimes I just give it to them as a snack in between meals. I love the fact that it is pure freeze-dried chicken with nothing added.

review/summary: Best Treat Ever
review/text: I use these for my cat.  You get more bang for your buck if you buy the larger dog treats and just break them into smaller pieces.  She gest them while we eat dinner, if she stratches on her post, or does something very cute.  I love these treats because I don't feel guilty giving them to her.

review/summary: Cat loves these!
review/text: I had purchased something similar to these at a cat show.  But when I tried to find them in stores it was nearly impossible.  I was so happy when I found these.  My loves them and gobbles them up.  It is the only cat treat she will eat and I have tried them all.  she hates all other treats and just walks away.  But these she begs for literally.  If you have a finicky cat like mine, these will be a hit.  I even sprinkle it on her food so she will eat it, and the dust at the bottom is great for that.  I highly recommend these treats for cats.<br /><br />Update:  I have continued to purchase these and they are still the only treat either one of my cats will eat.  The older cat has apparently taught the kitten these are the only treats worth eating.  Still a great product and I have never had problems like other reviewers had.

review/summary: GREAT for dogs AND cats!
review/text: I had been buying the PureBites at a local pet food store at a considerably higher price.  Since both my dog AND cats love these treats, I was delighted to find them cheaper on Amazon.  They are pure chicken, which is wonderfully healthy, and the best part is that they don't make my dog thirsty or have loose stool as so many other treats can do.  I think they're GREAT!

review/summary: The cat and the dog love this stuff
review/text: I rate this a 4 star because of how it tends to have a great quantity of powdery crumbs in the bottom of the bag. The dog will lick it up, but with a powder, he tends to inhale and cough so I end up with unusable powdery crumbs that I can't give to the dog straight from the bag. Overall, this is a great product because it is just chicken and both the dog and the cat love this stuff. I frequently buy the biggest bag and will continue to do so. The good pieces are cubes of chicken, and are dehydrated and crunchy. Since its dry, its easy to handle and give to the dog or cat as a treat.  The bag has a zip closure to keep it fresh.

review/summary: Healthy Cat treats
review/text: I am a vegetarian and I feel bad that I never have any real meat to give to my animals as treats. They get so excited whenever others bring chicken or turkey into the house. My cats LOVE these treats. The only ingredient is natural USDA inspected chicken breast so I feel good about them eating these. They are marketed for dogs but they break up really easy into cat sized pieces.

review/summary: Wonderful natural treat Made in USA
review/text: We got these as a x-mas gift and this is the BEST treat! I am very careful about what I give my Shih Tzu who is a puppymill rescue and has health issues. This treat is a 100% natural made with 100% chicken and also VERY IMPORTANT is that it is NOT MADE IN CHINA. I never give my dog anything that is made in China (I have relatives in China and trust me you do not want to feed your dog anything that is made there) so there have been very few options out there for my dog. The added plus is that both my dog and cat LOVE these treats. My dog is more finicky than my cat and they both go crazy over these and b/c I know they are 100% natural chicken I feel confident giving them the treats. There are, however, two drawbacks and that is why I can't give it 5 stars. 1) A lot of the treats are wasted b/c they crumble and at least 1/4 of the bag looks like it is filled with sawdust (crumbs from the broken treats). Many of the pieces also crumble into pea-size pieces which are too small for a dog. Fortunately my cat does not mind the tiny pieces so I give these to him. These treats are also very expensive which I don't mind b/c the quality is so good but for this price, I wish so much would not go to waste. 2) Like another reviewer said, you do need to be careful b/c I have found a bone in them as well. I found a bone about an inch long embedded in one of the treats so now I am careful to inspect the treat before giving it to my dog. Even with these drawbacks, I still feel these are the best treats out there if you are looking for 1) healthy, 2)natural, 3) tasty treats that are 4) MADE IN USA. In my experience, it is nearly impossible to meet all 4 criteria. This is the only treat that does (at least for my pets where taste is concerned. My pets refuse to eat Newman's treats even though they are healthy).

review/text: Love this healthy treat for my cat! I actually grind it up into a powder, and mix with water on demand when giving medicine to my cat. I used to give him smelly wet food, but I just couldn't handle gagging 2 times a day...<br /><br />Since I ground it into a fine powder, I did notice some pea-sized bits of hard something, most likely bone. This might not be an issue for a big dog, but for my small, old cat, I have to be sure to pick these pieces out. Just be observant when feeding your pet.<br /><br />I used to buy this product locally, but I found they were selling it for over twice the price per ounce, so this is a GREAT value!

review/summary: The quality of the chicken is questionable
review/text: I just discarded 20% of the bag.  Some of the pieces had chicken veins (dark purple spots), others had fatty parts to them. A few pieces weren't completely 'dry.' This is the first time I've tried this brand and it looks like they use thigh meat in their mix, whereas the other companies I've purchased in the past seem to use only breast meat? It just looks much more yellow -- I don't know exactly what it means -- I guess I'm just used to seeing bright, white, crispy pieces when I buy the other brands that Amazon offers.

With 3 pets, the bag will last through a month. The cost is worth it to me....for the safety and happiness of my pets.  Will continue to order these.

The ONLY ingrediant is 100% chicken breast which is perfect for ferrets an is the most healthy "treat" out there, better then the other junk like N-bones, bandits etc. They say the best treat is meat, so this stuff is PERFECT! It takes time for them to get used to it but once they did, they started doing tricks the 2nd they see the bag.<br /><br />There has been a huge increase in there coat and there energy levels. And since i started putting it in there food they even eat alot less because there getting filled more with meat as well. I support this treat for dogs, cats and ferrets :D!

review/summary: PureBites freeze dried chicken treats
review/text: I bought a small package of this some time ago as I was having trouble finding something to hide their meds in (both cats and dogs). They love this stuff!<br /><br />They haven't gotten bored with it, or learned that I sometimes bury their meds in it.  Works way better than pill pockets, pieces of cheese, peanut butter, or even a bit of roast chicken. When using it to hide meds, it's easier to soak a piece in a little broth. The pill doesn't have to be completely hidden, just kind of indent it in a bit, let the dog smell that treat and he'll gobble it right down.<br /><br />Also, there are always crumbs and bits at the bottom of the package that I sprinkle on their dog/cat food and they seem to enjoy that a lot - one of my dogs won't eat anymore unless he's got the chicken crumbles on his food.<br /><br />I'm completely sold on this product.

This is her reward and she knows that if she puts up with me she gets a nice, fat free, carb free delicious treat.  Take care of your pets and give them nutritious freeze dried meat/chicken rather than the junk food treats that are loaded with uneeded carbs.<br /><br />Also, this is a great price and a large bag lasts for a long time.  Cat and dog Pure Bites are exactly the same with larger pieces in the bag for dogs.  Just break them up and kitties love them too.  I also use the crushed treats to top off a meal and make it tastier.<br /><br />When my friend's bring their dogs by, they always get some too.  All of the pets love this product!!!

review/text: My 13 year old Lhasa makes the title Prima Dona seem tame.  She is so finicky, we're at wits end.  I got tired of making her treats and needed something to bribe her with. What makes it harder is that she can't have salt due to her severely enlarged heart. We went to a doggy boutique and the lady "knew" that she had something she would like.  She tried EVERY treat she had and Michi just turned her nose up at everything!  The lady finally said, I'll bring out the big guns, and indeed, Michi loved the freeze dried chicken breast treats.  Unfortunately, I had to pay $12.95 for 2 oz. We were desperate so I paid it.  PureBites are a God-send!  Not only is the price more than reasonable, but Michi will do just about anything for them.  I recommend these highly for anyone with a finicky dog, especially one with heart problems, such as Michi.

review/text: These treats come in small (cat) packages and large (dog) packages.  I save money by buying the dog size for my 5 rescued cats and breaking up the larger pieces.  I have a timed treat feeder that is in use when we are away from home, and this is a big favorite with the group.  Short of fixing them some freshly cooked chicken breast (tough to do when we're not home!), this is one of the healthiest and tastiest treats around.

review/summary: PureBites Chicken Breast Dog Treats
review/text: My 3 dogs LOVE these. I have to limit them as best as I can. I think they would eat all of the treats at once if I let them. Of all of the treats I have bought them, they like these the best. The only problem with them is that some of the package has more crumbs than large pieces. I put the crumbs on top of their regular dog food which they also love. Maybe Amazon could protect the packages better for shipping. I recommend this product.

review/summary: Great yummy treat
review/text: My little chihuahua loves this treat. I crumble some and sprinkle them over his regular can food and he eats his food a lot quicker because of these treats. The pet store owner gave me this tip. He loves it and he loves the dried freeze liver treats too. I highly recommend.

review/summary: a REAL treat
review/text: First off, my dog will do ANYTHING for these treats plus I don't have to feel guilty that I'm giving her filler food or potentially harmful preservatives,  it is just plain old freeze dried chicken.  The best part about the chicken in comparison to other flavors.....it doesn't smell and breaks apart easily into smaller pieces!  A bargain to buy the huge bag- lasts me months.

review/summary: The Only Thing My Dog LOVES!!!
review/text: My dog is about as picky as they come. We have the hardest time finding something that he will eat, But He ABSOLUTELY LOVES CHICKEN PURE BITES!!!<br />Every night he expects his treat! He typically doesn't bark but if you start to go to bed and Don't give him his Chicken PureBites, he will sit on the bed and look up at the container we keep them in and bark. When we get them down, he hops around like a rabbit because he is So Excited. Now, if we could only find some dog food that he LOVED this much, we would be doing Great! Snickers ABSOLUTELY LOVES THESE!!! Nothing any better as far as me and my husband are concerned!! Thanks PureBites,<br />Cea

review/summary: Puppy love
review/text: My three month old yorkie mix, Gizmo absolutely loves these treats. Every time he hears the bag crinkle he would run up and sit patiently waiting for his treat. They sell Purebites at my local petshop along with various hollistic brand dog food, so I know it's good. When Gizmo became picky about eating his kibble a pet shop worker suggested I sprinkle pieces of this onto the kibble, and it worked wonders for his appetite. The chicken is easiest on his stomach, I've noticed with too much liver Purebites he begins to have diarhia. Otherwise, I higly recommend this.

review/summary: 1/3 of product is powder
review/text: My pets love the chicken treats. But over the last 3 purchases, 1/3 of the bag ends up as powder, which sticks in my pets' throats. Working out to $35/lb -- that's some very expensive chicken. So I expect to be able to use more than only 2/3 of the product. Maybe I should try to make my own.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend - Nothing Special
review/text: Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.

review/summary: Fine, But There's Better Out There
review/text: The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for.

review/text: I've purchased K-cups in a variety of blends and have learned that the batch to batch consistency isn't perfect.  But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.  If you enjoy a light roast this one seems perfect to me.  It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.

I was not disappointed.  In a couple of days I received my order.  I am drinking a cup as I write. I enjoy the flavor of the coffee with just a little sweetener added. A perfect start to my day.
