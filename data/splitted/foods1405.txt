review/summary: elegant addition to chicken recipe
review/text: I was trying a chicken recipe that called for this vinegar...didn't really see that it would make much difference. So I made it 1st with rice vinegar, then with champagne vinegar. This product made a far more yummy entre. Thank you.

review/summary: Awesome cheese for saganaki!!!!!
review/text: I live in Texas so there is not much, actually no, Greek cheese available here to make Saganaki.  This cheese was absolutely delicious!!!  Just as good as in a restaurant in Canada.  I'm a so happy to have found a source for this cheese.  It did arrive with the ice packets completely melted but it was 100 degrees or more that day.  It didn't seem to affect the quality at all.

review/text: Full black peppercorn flavor without the hype and expense of "gourmet" brands.<br />This is the top-rated "supermarket" brand of peppercorns by non-profit Cook's Illustrated / America's Test Kitchen.<br />This is the only non-Tellicherry pepper to make it to their final lineup.<br />If you use freshly ground black pepper as much as I do, this is a fine purchase for everyday use.

review/summary: Wine Country Gift Baskets Are Awesome!
review/text: We are very impressed with Wine Country Gift Baskets.  We ordered the soup basket for our elderly relative, but unfortunately there was too much sodium for her to enjoy the soup.  She called Wine Country Gift Baskets to explain her dilemma, and they very graciously sent her another basket absolutely complimentary.  They did all this before Christmas so she could enjoy her new holiday gift basket.  We certainly appreciate their efforts because they helped make a holiday brighter for someone else at their own expense.  We give them a big THANK YOU !!!!!!!!

I always ask them to be honest when I send things like this in the mail ( I think most poeple are not honest when they receive something as a gift). Anyway, thier comments were: "the soup was OK, just powder, nothing special". For the money this item cost with shipping you would be much beter off purchasing gourmet soup mixes at specialty stores and making your own gift basket.

review/summary: Tried a different KOA coffee - tastes burnt
review/text: In desperation & frustration from buying (and throwing out) pound after pound of bitter & burnt coffee beans of various brands and types for several years now, I ordered some expensive KOA Kona coffee beans in the 4-pack of half-lb. bags. Alas, after trying the first bag, KOA Kona Estate, I'm very sorely disappointed, and could cry at having thrown away more money for yet another bag of burnt tasting & smelling coffee.<br /><br />I grew up drinking great coffees that were quite affordable, but in recent years it is nearly impossible to find real, GOOD coffee that isn't bitter and burnt no matter how much you pay for it. After doing some research on why today's coffees smell & taste so terrible, I've decided to buy green coffee beans and roast my own. Coffee today is like most cheap merchandise made in China - made in huge quantities and processed with cheap methods, and no craftmanship or pride in the making of it.<br /><br />Most people I know today have never had truly good coffee, and they drink those ridiculous flavored versions with loads of sugar and artificial crap. Compare them to people who've only eaten cheap sliced white bread from grocery stores, with no idea of the fabulous aroma & flavor of home-baked breads made by hand - not machine bread made from a mix...<br /><br />Even the local coffee shops that once had excellent coffees have succumbed to mass production and inferior quality.<br /><br />If coffee were this terrible when I began drinking coffee decades ago, I would never have taken up the habit - I'd have spit out the first sip and said no thank you!

review/summary: Peach Iced Tea!
review/text: I 'discovered' Torani sugar free Peach about 10 years ago.  I've been hooked on it ever since, buying sometimes a case at a time from the only retail outlet in the areas where I've lived.  I've had to drive as far as 50 miles to get it.  I use this in my own home made iced tea for that wonderful 'peach tea' us southerners are known for.  Use a Torani pump, 4 squirts in a 24 oz glass with tea and 1 tsp of additional splenda, and you've got a taste you won't forget!  I was extremely happy to find the larger bottles here and under the subscription service, I get a product I really like for less without even leaving home.

review/text: The Dr. Started me on a new medication That Will Turn your tastse buds off of carbonated water. Including all Sodas!!  This was all I drank so I had to find something else fast. I started off with the flavored teas- but you have to be careful even some of these have carbonation in them!  I really preferred the peach tea, but with each different place you had no idea what you were getting!  So I decided that sense i couldn't drink soda I should leave the sugar alone as well.  So I got on amazon and found that they had sugar free peach syrup!  I was in business.  I make my own tea every morning and it goes everywhere I go. No more need for sonics or quick stops for a drink.  I am not getting all the preservatives that goes along with the other drinks as well.  I really recommend this syrup and i can't wait for winter to see what kind of coffee concoctions I can come up with.<br />ALL SERIOUSNESS aside This is really good stuff, I just signed up for them to mail me more onced a month.

There are days she doesn't eat much at all, but then she makes up for it when she probably gets hungry!!  As she gets older I can reduce the canned food & add more of the health extensions.<br /><br />If your dog doesn't eat it - don't worry.  Take the dish away after 30 min. & give it again @ night. Take it away after 30 min.  Eventually your dog will get the idea & eat it because it's hungry...but don't give your pet table food bcause it will think it's always going to get it & it will never eat it's own food.

I assumed they would taste like maine lobsters , but they are laganstino type lobster which is like comparing filet mignon to hamburger.  I will still eat them, but wouldn't recommend them to anyone that likes maine lobster.  I was wondering how they got them out of the shell and the type of lobster they used has a thin one.  It's like a big shrimp or cray fish.

review/text: Yamazaki is a well balanced single malt whiskey, for a fair price. Goes down smooth and finishes with a light smokiness. It's not too peaty, which is something I prefer in whiskey, but it comes down to your personal preference. Usually, Macallen 12yr is my go to, but Yamazaki is a nice switch every now and again. I definitely recommend. CHEERS!

review/summary: Used to be a bargain
review/text: Yamazaki 12 used to be a bargain when it was at the $28 price per bottle. Somewhere along the way, they got too big for their britches, and have been demanding more for their product.<br />While a decent Scotch-like whisky, they're too expensive when you can get similar for less - that is, you can buy a REAL scotch. For less.<br /><br />For about the same price, a Dalwhinnie 15 is superior.<br /><br />And the 18year Suntory selling for $109 to $140? Laughable when you can buy a Glenlivet Archive 21 year for the same price.<br /><br />In conclusion, this was once a good alternative to scotch when they were cheaper. At their current prices, this does not compete well with all the great Speyside or Highland whiskys to be had for much cheaper.

review/summary: Best Rice Ever
review/text: We have been using this rice for years, but are unable to find it near us.  The closest place we can buy it is Fort Bragg, a long drive each way.  If you have never tried CALROSE this is a real treat!  The flavor and texture are so different than any rice normally available it is worth the effort to try it.  This is NOT a Instant Rice - you have to actually cook it.  Microwave works great.  1 Cup Rice & 2 Cups of water in a 5 to 10 qt covered MW safe Casserole works fine (1/2 tsp salt or butter flavored salt optional).  Cook 10 min on high, Stir, 10 min on Med.  (Settings vary)  Serve with Butter and Soy Sauce (Kikkoman of course).

review/text: Very good rice with the sticky texture I enjoy a lot. Very reasonably priced. I'm very glad that I found it and selected it out of curiosity.<br /><br />Note: I own and adore a Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker. A good 'fuzzy logic' rice cooker will turn home cooked rice into something very special. Different rice types will show why they are considered different from each other. The cooker is very convenient to use and with only moderate familiarity will turn anyone into an expert rice chef. A Zojirushi 'fuzzy logic' cooker will absolutely make you enjoy your home cooked rice MUCH more. Do yourself a favor. Make the most out of your rice. Invest in a 'fuzzy logic' cooker. A good cooker can bring out the best that any rice has to offer. It's your call, but having the right tools can make a massive difference for you. Don't cheat yourself with an inexpensive rice boiler. You will understand after you develop a relationship with a fuzzy logic rice cooking system. Doing the job right is not hard, and the rewards are immense.

Perhaps if enough people start purchasing these, the price will come down a bit. The grass fed beef does not taste gamey either. I do wish they were certified organic though. My guess is that they are from organic cows on small farms but these farms don't want to pay for organic certification due to price.

review/summary: Tasty but thin
review/text: I bought this because I wanted an instant cappuccino mix free of transfats. It's fairly tasty, but it doesn't compare well to my favorite transfat brand in terms of mouth feel. If you're accustomed to a thick, creamy powdered cappuccino mix like Land o' Lakes, you're in for disappointment. The Victorian Inn mix is thin and watery by comparison, even if you double the amount of powder used, saturating the hot water (and yet, the Victorian Inn mix packs more calories into a single serving). On the other hand, if you're accustomed to the International Coffee tins of cappuccino powder, you'll feel right at home with the Victorian Inn powder and can switch without reservation.

review/summary: My "Economy" Cappuccino
review/text: I like to drink coffee and prefer mixing the coffee with a creamer.  Several years ago I started mixing in 2-3 teaspoons of Victorian Inn Cappuccino with each cup.  It has become my favorite receipe for a relaxing cup of coffee each day after work. I buy mine at a local Fleet Farm for about 7 bucks a tin, so this price for three is quite reasonable.  The instructions state to mix 3 teaspoons per cup of hot water.  This produces a good tasting cappuccino.  It is not as rich as some cappuccinos, but for the price per serving, it has become my economy cappuccino.  There are 100 calories per cup.  There are 43 servings per container. The mainingredient (of course!) is sugar.  Add a teaspoon of your favorite instant coffee for more rich coffee taste.  Compared to other store brands, this product gives you more cappuccino for the money.<br /><br />konedog

If you can get past that you'll really enjoy this product very much.  If you already took the plunge and are dissatisfied just add milk and sugar to your cup with this mix. Sometimes my son puts powdered non-fat milk in his to boost the protein without extra fat, but he's at that age when exercising and getting rippled ABS is important...to each their own. Good value when less than 20 bucks.

We use the Vanilla Cappuccino for both hot and frozen drinks and it is SO MUCH BETTER than the offerings at the local coffees stores.  Also lower in calories!  One container makes 3 weeks worth of drinks for less than 10 dollars?  How much would all those drinks cost at S***** or D** D**?  We won't accept any substitutes and we won't stop ordering from Amazon.  :)

review/text: I searched the web looking for a product that tasted like my local 7-11 French Vanilla Cappuccino. A lot of snow this winter was making the convenience store trek a bit inconvenient.  Of all the recipes and reviews I read, Victorian Inn Instant seemed to be what everyone else was raving about.  The problem?  I couldn't find it in any store to taste it.  Finally I just put my faith in the online reviewers, and ordered the 3 containers from Amazon.  That was in late December.  It is now late April, and I am about to put in my third order! I am quite happy with this.  I have only tasted the French Vanilla,<br />MAYBE if Amazon sold a three pack of mixed flavors, I would try the others too.

review/text: My family and I love this cappuccino mix and use it just about every day, especially when it's chilly outside.  It mixes well and has a really great flavor.  I mix it with regular coffee and it tastes better than the expensive stuff with the mermaid logo.  Enjoy!!

review/text: We used to get this in Sam's Club, but they quit selling it. I love buying from Amazon and this is a wonderful drink, and was so glad to find it available here.  We are all hooked on one cup a day for a treat.  I read one review where they received the 16 oz cans, but that had to be a mistake in shipping, because I have bought these from Amazon for years and once they did send me the 16 oz. in error, I called and they corrected it immediately.  They always ship 32 oz except for that one time.  No complaints here!  Put it with something else and you get free shipping, easy to do.

review/summary: V14
review/text: This is probably the very finest bottled vegetable juice I've ever tried. And although it's available locally, the six-pack sold through Amazon seems to offer about the best available price.<br /><br />As my review title suggests, you get not eight, not ten, not twelve, but _fourteen_ kinds of veggie juice in this mix. And you can taste pretty much all of them. Just chill a bottle of it in your fridge, pour a glass, toss it at your tonsils, and wait; aha, there's the tomato, and there's the carrot, and there's the broccoli . . .<br /><br />What I usually do with bottled/canned vegetable juice is to modify it myself with a dash (or six) of hot pepper sauce, some lemon juice, a bit of salt, and a healthy dollop of Worcestershire sauce. Well, I tried that with this juice and found that I liked it _better_ without my own modifications. This is a nice, flavorful, carefully balanced mix, and my tinkering didn't improve it.[*]<br /><br />Which is good for another reason: this stuff is pretty low in salt, and it relies on pepper and garlic to give it a little bite. So if you're watching your sodium, you'll be glad to know that one 8-oz. glass includes just 4% of your RDA and doesn't require supplementation in order to taste good.<br /><br />Good juice.<br /><br />(The product image shown on this page at the time I'm writing is a little weird-looking; it makes the juice look orange, which it isn't. The predominant ingredient is tomato juice, and that's what this stuff looks like.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />[*] However, I've discovered since writing this review that I do like to add a splash of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1DUDU">Lakewood Organic PURE Lemon Juice, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1IQ3Y">Lakewood Organic PURE Lime Juice, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>. Also, even though it contains celery juice, it's good with a dash of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XWNBWI">Simply Organic Celery Salt Certified Organic, 5.54-Ounce Containers  (Pack of 3)</a> as well.

review/summary: A Little Lime, Ground Pepper, and Celery Seed
review/text: Our first taste of Super Veggie made my wife and I reminiscent of a Bloody Mary. So much so, that we squeezed some lime in along with black pepper, a dash of celery seed and tabasco. No alcohol though, so I guess it would be considered a Virgin Mary! It was delicious and now we have one each evening.<br /><br />I have been drinking V8 Lower Sodium for quite a few years and have recently switched to Super Veggie for the additional health qualities. When compared to V8, it seems to be superior in every aspect. Super Veggie has a lot less sodium, higher fiber, less tomato and more of the other juices. I feel that it is more comparable to an actual serving of vegetables than V8. I'm very happy with this product.<br /><br />I gave Super Veggie 4 stars because it is 3 times as expensive as V8. I have calculated that I pay about 15 cents an ounce for Super Veggie, and a little less than 5 cents an ounce for V8. Don't get me wrong, Super Veggie is worth it. I think the health benefits make this product a dietary necessity. I just wish it was a little more affordable.

There are so many flavors I find myself sipping, and savoring, it a little at a time. I disagree with other reviewers about adding salt.

review/summary: Broccoli and Kale Lovers Only
review/text: I'm a long time aficionado of vegetable juice, especially tomato juice based products. I like the taste of V8 and similar products, but stopped drinking them a long time ago due to the additives, GMO ingredients, and their use of reconstituted juices. I had high hopes for this product, but honestly you can barely tell there's tomato in it, it tastes strongly of broccoli and kale instead, which are not my favorite veggies. It's back to mixing organic tomato juice with bits of other organic juices (and a little soy or vegan worcestershire) sauce for me.

review/text: This stuff is so good, and with a little lemon squeeze, it's over the top.<br />Want a fast delicious lunch or snack?<br />Try boiling up a handful of fine egg noodles, drain, return to pot and add a serving of this juice (dried parsley and seasoning optional) like soup...<br />heat up (don't leave boiling). (1/2 tsp."Mrs.Dash" (onion and herb) is a good seasoning for this)<br />While your noodles are cooking (only takes 4 minutes)...cut yourself a thick slice of Mozzerella and put it<br />in a soup bowl. Microwave for about 30 seconds to melt cheese.<br />When your juice and noodles are heated, pour in bowl over melted cheese. Mmmm. In five minutes you're got a healthy, hot, economic meal.<br />Variation: Can use leftover rice instead of noodles, add fresh baby spinach, fresh cooked zucchini, etc.<br />Thumbs up to this awesome product.

review/text: I had been drinking another organic veggie juice but found this today, and did a label comparison for nutrition.  Wow!  This is so much better - yes it seems to be less tomato and more of other veggies, but the flavor is still great (I'm used to making my own juice and including kale).  Definitely switching over.<br /><br />However I have to say, Amazon's price is currently 30% higher than what I pay locally for individual bottles, so I won't be ordering this from Amazon unless the price comes down a lot.

That is not bad, it means you are getting extraordinary nutrients.

review/text: If you are a fan of V8, or anything similar, you will love this stuff.  It is NOT from concentrate, and it is very noticeable via the texture, and the taste.  There is a hint of jalapeno, but not too much to where it might ward off those who don't like spicy; that jalapeno really sets this stuff apart from all the others I have tried.  So far this is the best over, all of the juices I can think of.  I recommend this to every veggie juice lover out there!

review/summary: Very tasty organic juice with higher fiber and lower sodium
review/text: Try it. I did and I really like the stuff. I wish it came in bigger bottles.<br /><br />14 organic vegetable juices, lemon, garlic, cayenne, jalapeno and salt. That's it. That's all there is in it. And it's not spicy or searingly hot. Delicious.<br /><br />I like it much more than regular V8 because it has much less sodium and more fiber. Plus it's pure organic and comes from Florida. And it tastes much better than V8.<br /><br />I wish I had the time to break out my super powered slow speed juicer but getting and keeping fresh vegetables, prepping them, juicing them, storing the juice, then cleaning the juicer is too much right now so I buy this juice and compromise. Besides, it would be impossible for me to buy 14 different organic fresh ingredients.<br /><br />Organic bottoms up!

review/summary: Delicious taste, but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose
review/text: I eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers, and it is quite tasty. While it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar, because it is essentially 100% fructose, which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose (white/table sugar)--more on this below.<br /><br />Most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams. It's ingredients are: "Juice concentrate (pear, grape), strawberries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor." This product contains no artificial sweeteners, which are associated with various health hazards.<br /><br />This product's primary claim to fame is that it is, as the label states, "sweetened only with fruit juice." Any jam will have its sweetener listed first, meaning that is its primary ingredient. If you are on a low-carb diet or diabetic, you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose. Since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose, so it has about half the calories of regular jam. (On the other hand, many cheap jams contain high-fructose corn syrup--but that's another health issue entirely.) The problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose, and 100% fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar. To my own taste, since I'm eating a fruit spread, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />The fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, so I am not sure why the company decided to add in  maltodextrin and call that "fiber" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is "gluten-free," but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />Another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the "natural flavor." It is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries, which are more expensive than a flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.
