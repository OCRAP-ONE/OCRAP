review/summary: Gives crap a bad name
review/text: As the previous reviewer notes this stuff is vile.  Amazon wouldn't post my prior attempt at a review since (I assume) it was too bad - it was all true, mind you, but apparently you can't describe something so revolting and nasty as revolting and nasty.  Unlike the previous reviewer I have 10 CASES of this stuff taking up room in my kitchen.  You'll coil back in disgust when you crack it open and then gag with every mouthful.  Though it turns out that after four cases you start to lose the nastiness tastebud and it's at least drinkable.  On the plus side, the plain black isn't bad.  Strong, but not bad.

review/summary: Organic White Tea tasting like CRAP!
review/text: Okay, background first, 45 year old white guy that drinks too much Coca-Cola and wants to cut back. I like tejava (a lot). I drink green and black teas, etc. So I am not a new-be to tea. So I bought this tea, the Anteadote Organic White Tea thinking it would be a convenient alternative to reaching in the fridge and grabbing a Coke. Man! Was I wrong. This stiff taste nasty! I mean, nasty with a capital "N". It's so nasty that I am not sure what to do with the remaining 14.5 bottles! That's correct, 14.5 bottles.... I could not even finish the only bottle I tried! Ugh! So, if someone writes and says "I love the taste of this tea and that other reviewer is smoking crack".... well... I hope you think twice. Fair warning has been served.

review/text: The fragrance of this tea is wonderful.  The taste is strong and spicy which I don't care for so at first I tried adding honey.  The honey made it taste disgusting.  So the next night I added 1% low fat milk which made the taste more tolerable.  It also seems to make me drowsy so I drink it near bed time.

review/text: The flavor of this stuff is better than any other grenadine I've ever had. Just a few drops into some ice water and it changes the taste so significantly it's delicious. Well worth the money. Unlike other Grenadines that just make the water taste like it's slightly sweet and essentially garbage this one actually has flavor. I pour in just enough for it to be a very light pink and it's amazing.

review/summary: Wonderful Cherry Aroma
review/text: Most green teas are too astringent for me; however, this tea is absolutely delicious, and smells wonderful.  It brews up a lovely color, tastes good, smells good.  It is mid-strength for caffeine content.  I also use this tea when I brew large pots of gunpowder green -- I put equal measurements of this and the gunpowder in the pot -- takes the bitter edge off the gunpowder tea, and enhances the aroma.  This tea is a treasure.

However if there is a VERY close second then that would be any flavor of revolution tea. This Oolong is nice because it has a pinch more caffeine than most tea for a nice extra jazziness.<br /><br /> It's got a subtle fruity flavor and full oolong goodness. I like it.

review/summary: Tremendous Tea
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully exquisite taste.  But what I think sets it apart from most other teas is the way that Revolution packages it with what they term the "infuser bag."  The infuser bag is sort of a three dimensional triangle shaped bag.  That allows for the hot water to get at the tea leaves from several angles.  It is very unique and, in my opinion, it makes the tea more vibrant in taste as well as aroma.  I found that Safeway has this brand locally, but not the specific dragon eye flavor.  So once again, I rely upon Amazon to provide me with quality service and products.  Try this tea - you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Delicious tea from P.F. Changs
review/text: Revolution's dragon oolong tea is the same dragon tea you get from P.F. Changs. They simply serve you the tea in a cast-iron teapot for that "chinese" authenticity.<br /><br />Regarding the tea itself, it has a sweeter flavor than most teas and smells and tastes delicious. The coloring is close to a lighter black tea.<br /><br />The 6-pack on Amazon is six boxes of 20-count Dragon Eye boxes. Each box is rather large (larger than Stash or Tazo), and each teabag is in a easy-tear plastic bag. The tea bags are pyramid infusers and the string to pull it out is a little short so long cups may have to hold their bags or put it in after the hot water.<br /><br />Overall, the tea is delicious, the 6-pack is a bit spendy but I left a few boxes at work for my coworkers (at a small company) and it was gone a few days later. I highly recommend this product for the daily tea drinker.

review/summary: Made great cream pie
review/text: This was an easy pudding for chocolate cream pie.  Thought it tasted great!  The only reason I rated it here 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the price.  I found it cheaper at my local Natural Grocer.

review/summary: This is not the German stuff
review/text: I bought the product shown because I thought it was like the German Dr Oetker pudding but it is actually very different. I did not like it at all !!! Also, it is made in Canada, really has nothing in common with what I know from Germany. I expected it to be at least similar to the German pudding because amazon had it listed under German food.<br />But I can tell you it is really easy to prepare. It just does not taste good at all. I ended up discarding the pudding I had prepared and I gave away the unused packages.

review/summary: Great Treats for your Pet
review/text: I love this product and so do my 2 coton de tulear dogs. This product is for either a puppy or an adult dog they are grain free and don't have all those other ingridients  where the dogs couldn't digest. I also feed them the Chicken and Sweet Potato Limited Ingidient Diet dry food and it's the best thing I did for my dogs. The food I was giving them they couldn't digest & they had sensitive stomachs and problems pooping it was a strain for both my dogs. Since I swicthed their food to this product they no longer have problems with their stomach or pooping they love the food and Treats. This grain free food has really made a difference in my dogs even their skin and coat are looking better then it ever did.There are a variety of flavors to choose from such as organic, and hypoallergenic products for skin conditions they exotic type flavors such as duck or venison w/sweet potato and lamb w/brown rice fish w/omega oils etc...<br />If you have a dog with digestion problems or are fussy eaters try this product you'll see a difference. I can't say enough how pleased I am with this food and my dogs are happy too!<br /><br />Suzan Rango<br />Mesquite, NV

review/text: This deal is for a 4-pack of Stewarts root beer. Why they prefer 4 over 6 I don't know. It is one of the better root beers available. It has a very creamy texture, and a nice foamy head. The bottles and label are very cool, recently went through a label change. They make quite a variety of flavors. A little too sweet, the sweetener is a mix of sugar and high frunctose corn syrup. No caffeine. See my list of root beers here at Amazon if you want more root beer info.

review/text: I ordered these late on a Thursday and they arrived on Monday afternoon.  I thought that was great processing/shipping considering they came from California, and I live in South Carolina.  All lollipops were packaged well and none were broken.  Taste was average.  Not really cherry (like in description), just sweet.  One disappointing note... the wrapper on the lollipop clearly says "Oriental Trading Company" and "Made in China."  It wasn't really fitting with the image of freshness I had from looking at their store description.

review/summary: up yours, Mr. Wonka!
review/text: Laffy Taffys are the greatest candy ever made, and banana was the most convincing, most addictive Laffy Taffy flavor.  I've eaten them for over two decades, and during that time my life has been nothing but misery.<br /><br />They used to come in rectangular cubes.  Then the cubes got smaller, flatter, but the price went up.  Then they moved to candy bar-sized versions, again with a price hike.  There are currently two forms available: long, stringy sticks and tiny oblongs, about 30% of the candy that used to constitute a mouthful in the late 80s, when I started eating them.<br /><br />But banana's getting hard to find.  The company's big thing now is combining flavors, so that I'm afraid the divinely simple "banana" will be irretrievably replaced with that horrid miscegenation, "strawberry-banana."<br /><br />Aghgghghhh.  If only Mr. Wonka would get the bilious cancer!

review/text: I don't make spicy dishes often, but when I do i always use dofino's havarti with jalapeno. I used to like pepperjack until a good friend of mine introduced dofinos jalapeno cheese to me at a party. I use it in my cheese dip, on top of steak, and even in my grilled mac and cheese. I have never been disappointed with the quality of this cheese when buying from my local grocery store. It has always held up very good for me in the fridge, not that it stays in there for very long though!

review/summary: Cancer Alert
review/text: This gum have is an outrage!  It worst than Coke Cola.<br /><br />  "When launched Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were cocaine (benzoylmethyl ecgonine) and caffeine. The cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut, leading to the name Coca-Cola (the "K" in Kola was replaced with a "C" for marketing purposes).[29][30]<br />Coca -- cocaine<br /><br />Pemberton called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola did once contain an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass, but in 1903 it was removed.[31] Coca-Cola still contains coca flavoring."<br /><br />I have read in Wikipedia, that Pemberton was a morphine junkie.  This man, a junkie, was allowed to formulate the formula for coca cola.  What a low down standard. I know when someone is hooked on something, they don't know the different between right and wrong, healthy and unhealthy and cannot be trusted.  It is a fact, that drug addicts are contagious, they spread diseases and just being around they bad behavior cause other people (who are not skilled to treat) to use bad drugs too.  Even thought this drink was latter said to be "kosher" by a rabbi.  I still will not drink it because the acid contain is so high it can dissolve a nail and the manufacturers of Coke Cola cannot put enough distance between me and the words cocaine free cola leaf.<br /><br />People happily smacking on this gum today, shows how America values have deteriorated over the last 100 years.  Most consumers, do not care that their are exhilarates in their food, even to the point they are defending the bad products in the food.  It seems like the phenylalanine is working, same as trying to tell junkie.

review/text: Bragg markets this product as "no salt added" and "Healthier than soy" while she herself advocates raw and natural food. This product is made by chemically processing "liquid soy protein" in a way that chemically creates table salt and strips glutamic acids from the soy proteins, creating MSG.<br /><br />Naturally fermented soy sauce starts with the same base, is obviously fermented rather than chemically processed, does add salt but is able to use healthier salt than the chemically made salt in Bragg's, keeps the glutamic acids bonded to the protein, boasts the same assortment of amino acids, and doesn't cost any more than Bragg's.<br /><br />In short, Bragg is hypocritically marketing a product with no advantages over a good-quality soy sauce.

review/text: We have used Bragg Liquid Aminos for years in our family.  It is a great soy sauce substitute that is lower in sodium and unfermented.  We ran out and while waiting for our order to arrive, we used a soy sauce in our scrambled tofu and grilled vegies and boy could we tell the difference.  The scrambled tofu had a bitter taste and the grilled vegies had a fermented smell while in the electric skillet.  I highly recommend this product and what a great deal buying it in a 3pack with the option of free shipping.  You just can't beat it.

review/summary: Yuck!! Reduced sodium soy sauce has less sodium & tastes better!!!!
review/text: I tried this stuff at a suggestion of a friend that does not know how to read labels. She told me how wonderful this stuff is and that it has a whole lot less sodium than soy sauce. My husband has high blood pressure so I am always looking for ways to reduce sodium in his diet. We were in the store together and in a rush so I put a bottle in my cart without reading the bottle.<br /><br />As I said, my friend does not know how to read labels as a serving of Braggs is only 2.5 ml (one half of a teaspoon) and it has 160 mg of sodium. If you use it like soy sauce, you would probably use about a tablespoon (15 ml) which has 960 mg of sodium. A tablespoon of reduced sodium soy sauce has 530 mg of sodium - a little more than half of the same amount of Braggs and it tastes MUCH better. (If you want to do further math, 2.5 ml or 1/2 teaspoon of reduced sodium soy sauce contains 88.3 mg of sodium compared to the 160 mg in the same amount of Braggs)<br /><br />I will stick to my reduced sodium soy sauce. It tastes better and it has MUCH less sodium than the same amount of this stuff. My husband and son won't touch this disgusting stuff. I used it for a while putting half this garbage on my food and half soy sauce, but I couldn't take it any longer.  After sitting in my fridge for almost a year, I finally dumped it down the kitchen sink.

When I started on the HCG diet, I was afraid that food would get boring in a hurry, but Bragg Liquid Aminos Marinade really adds to flavors.  It reminds me of a mixture of soy sauce, Worcestershire, and liquid smoke, all rolled into one.  I put it on everything, and I mean everything, from salads to meats.  The large size was perfect for me, since I shared with my daughter-in-law who also went through the diet with me.  Between the two of us, we have really experimented with tastes, and this one was a hit.  This also works well with the Miracle Noodles.

review/text: Liquid Aminos have been a staple in my food seasonings for a long time. I buy in bulk on Amazon, since its a much better deal and the bottles are so much bigger. I will never use regular soy again, since this literally tastes the exact same, yet is SO much better for you. I am so glad to have found this product and even more glad that Amazon sells it in bulk.

However, This is $6 a bottle and use to be $5 a bottle here on Amazon. $55 now for 3? I got the same 3 months ago with free shipping for $16! There is no reason for this to be priced so high!

review/summary: Hint of Spice
review/text: The Hot and Spicy variety is the best. It has just a little spiciness, the right amount of salt and shrimp taste. They are very good. If you have a Krogers, they have a shrimp cracker as well made in the U.S. It has the same crunchy texture, but the S. Korean ones have the spice which adds more flavor. Don't let it fool you into thinking they're hot. I don't like very spicy foods and these aren't even close to being truly spicy. They must have saved the real spicy ones for the Koreans. Maybe they didn't want to kill us. lol.

review/summary: Less spicier than the real Korean version
review/text: I guess NongShim made this as export version as they do with many many other noodle products.<br />Usually they are much less spicy.<br />And this is the same.<br />When I opened this bag, it was yellow, not red at all.<br />Original Korean version of this snack is much more red in color and has very nice spicy taste.<br />But this barely has any spicy to it if not at all.<br />Well, I couldn't taste any spicy at all, seriously AT ALL.<br />If you have Korean supermarket nearby, go buy one from there and compare yourself.<br />My non-Korean husband agrees with me one this so...

review/text: This cracker is great. It's a little big spicy, but my son loves it. It not like the usual snacks that are either ridiculously sweet or absurdly salty. the portion is also good, not too big to make you overeat nor too small to make you want to open another pack. Plus, the delivery is really fast.

review/text: These crackers are quite good. They're shaped somewhat like crinkle-cut french fries, but are puffy and crunchy. They don't have much of a shrimp taste, nor are they overly spicy, but the extra spice does make the crackers taste better than the "plain" flavor Nong Shim also makes.

review/summary: Great Popcorn!
review/text: I've tried several different packaged popcorns and this brand is my favorite.  Tastes the freshest and closest to movie theater popcorn.<br />My only complaint is that it's a little pricey.  Everyone else must love it too because I can never find it at my local grocery store; if I do, there's usually only one bag. When I can afford it, I like to buy in bulk.  Can't have too much of a good thing.

review/text: indiana buttered movie theater popcorn is the best pre-popped popcorn ever.  whenever i go grocery shopping to various stores, i always try to pick up several packages of this stuff.  once you start eating this popcorn, it's hard to stop.  it does taste like popcorn you buy at a movie theater.  buttery, a little oily, the flavoring and kernals are just right.  hardly a bad kernal in the entire bag.  this is the ideal popcorn to be sitting home and watching a movie to.  large and small bags of this popcorn is available, though i'd stick with the large bags.  enjoy!

review/text: I only drink decaf coffee, but I like a bold taste.  This definitely didn't taste like any "donut shop" decaf I've ever had. It was SO weak, even using the smallest size cup on my keurig.  If you like a mild blend, then I guess this would be a good one.  If you like your coffee to actually taste like coffee rather than water with a coffee taste, you might want to try another kind. :)

review/text: This is a great discovery for me. I've been going decaf lately, but I am no fan of the bold blends and I don't like flavorless coffee. This is the perfect balance. It has a pleasant flavor without being too weak or overpowering. It is closer to my beloved Dunking' Donuts than Starbucks. So if you are craving Starbucks, avoid this because it is too mild. However, if you like a mellower blend this is darn tasty for decaf.

Carmina was very nice. She was apologetic and agreed to send me an assorted shipment. This second shipment was assorted but the colors were silver, black, pale pink, and a goldish brown, still not as depicted. Due to time constraints I decided to make due with what I had. The capsules are fine. Just be forewarned that the colors shown are probably not the ones you'll be sent. If the product description had said "colors vary", then there would be no issue.
