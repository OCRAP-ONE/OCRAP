review/summary: Disappointing.
review/text: I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here.  He barely sniffed it and walked away.  I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list.  I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it.  Too bad though.  I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat.

review/summary: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, QUALITY DOG FOOD!!!
review/text: I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!

review/summary: Canidae 12-Pack Canned Dog Food, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth, 5-1/2-Ounce Can
review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

review/text: I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.

review/text: I bought this food after searching through many websites to find the right nutrition for our 3 dogs.  We decided to give it a try and our Collie/Lab was hesitant b/c of all the junk her previous owners had fed her.  The Yorkies and even the cat immediately jumped in to chow down.  Our Collie/Lab has now decided this food is great and we even purchased the dry food to go along with it.  I was very happy to see this food rated 4.5 out of 5 stars in a food guide at our local boutique pet store.<br /><br />This will be our primary dog food for a long time.

I have almost cut myself several times.  End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull-top breaks off.  Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers.  But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason.

review/summary: Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...
review/text: For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.

review/summary: BEWARE!  Picture is not what you get!
review/text: My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.

They're absolutely delicious, they cleanse your palette, and make your breath smell like sweet licorice.  Don't let their small size fool you, they pack a punch.

I think that even including milk and ice, I'm still probably spending only about 75 cents a cup, so it's a great deal.<br /><br />If, like me, you find the Caffe D'Vita flavors to be not quite up to snuff, you might try making your own Frappuccinos.  I found a recipe online.  The secret ingredient can be found right here on Amazon: xanthan Gum!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040DWCXG">Xanthan Gum 1lb Powder USP FCC Food Grade (Buy 5 get $15 off)</a>

review/summary: Love Java Chip!
review/text: I've bought Java Chip from Costco all summer and loved it!  It is better than Starbuck's blended drinks and much cheaper!  Instead of buying ice cream, our family enjoys these blended drinks and getting our calcium too!  I think the best way to make them is to use enough of the mix. I use about 1/3 to 1/2 of the blender full of cubed ice, put in 3/4 cup of java chip, and add about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of milk and blend till very smooth--about 3 minutes or so.  I top it off with Trader Joe's light whip cream and YUM!  I know there is a lot of sugar and probably calories, however it is a lot less than ice cream and healthier, too!

review/summary: Easy, great tasting chilli
review/text: Been using this chilli mix for years. Will crock-pot it for when people come buy in the winter and I'm amazed at how much they rave about it. Have tried using other mixes and recipes for stove top but there's just something about the taste of this chilli- from a packet no less- that lingers in the memory.<br /><br />Bought this bulk pack from Amazon because the stores around me seem to charge a much higher price than they should for thsi product. Maybe the word is out and there are people like me that really enjoy the simplicity and ease of preparation of this dish. Recipe hint: the packet calls for two cans of red chilli beans, for variety try a can of light red and dark red or a can of red with a can of white. It's almost impossible to hurt the base flavor of this tasty chilli.

review/summary: Great way to have an apple a day
review/text: I have one of these first thing in the morning while I get ready (so as to not keep my metabolism waiting before a morning kick-start) and might have another one in the afternoon as a snack. They tastes good and I like that fact that no sugar is added. Just like apples would, some batches come out sweeter than others. In general, a good item even if you are not a huge fan of apples. Very convenient to have in the car or to take a healthy snack while traveling.

review/text: Our kids love this Mott's Natural Apple Sauce.

Great flavor, and nice to also have on hand when a teen with braces can only eat a few things--this and pudding and mashed potatoes go a long way to tide them over until they can eat solids again.

I had it delivered to my front door in no time.  I didn't have to lug it anywhere and the package was in perfect condition.  I didn't have to pay for delivery because I am a Prime member.

I'd hand out the Mott's apple sauce cups to them and my daughter and they would munch on them.  When the other kids' parents got there they were picking up much less tired and cranky kids!  And I'd get the thanks from the worried moms and dads who would be late due to hold-ups at home, or car problems, etc.  They always knew I'd be there with their kids, giving them a snack.<br /><br />Mott's Apple Sauce Cups are a wonderful, portable, healthy snack for any time.  I even use it now when I take medications that can upset my stomach.  A cup of apple sauce eases the burning discomfort!

review/summary: and in not-so-blind taste testing, our consumer picked....
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act "stoned" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for "marinating" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a "harmless, euphoric state" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.

review/text: My cats will only get their buzz from Cosmic, even cat toys stuffed with catnip doesnt work with them. But I was becoming concerned when the last container I purchased thru Amazon had 2 ladybugs (dried and preserved) floating amidst the catnip. I have nothing against lady bugs, the idea of quality control concerned me. So I'm keeping an eye on this large container and hoping it was just a fluke last time.

review/summary: This is very fragrant, and loved by my kitties
review/text: I'm a cat lover, and spoil them very often. Recently we tried several local stores for catnip and none were very fragrant or very loved by my cats. The older Cosmic Catnip size was no longer for sale, and had lasted a while. After about a year of trying to get decent catnip locally, I came back to Amazon. Read the reviews, and came back to Cosmic catnip (now in a slightly larger size container).<br /><br />This stuff is great, my cats respond to it well, and they love it. The biggest problem is they have really been using the cat scratcher we put the catnip on much more than usual and have had to order a refill kit.<br /><br />If you want very good catnip at a very reasonable price, this may be a good choice.

review/summary: The cats prefer Kong but this will do
review/text: I have gone through several <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018N1DRW">KONG Naturals Premium Catnip, 2-Ounce</a> jars.  Looking for a bit more value, I decided to try Cosmic Catnip.  I don't typically like to change a good thing but went with it. I have house cats and also care for some free-roaming cats. Both populations react favorably to the product. For the house cats, I sprinkle some in their cat beds and on their toys and they roll around, sometimes head over heels. It is quite amusing to watch. However, I think the cats are more interested in the Kong product; they seem to spend greater periods of time playing with it and sniffing it.  In my house, that means more exercise and that is something I like to promote.<br /><br />Cosmic's catnip is packaged in a #3 plastic container, which is not as easily recyclable as a #1 or #2 plastic in most areas. The product's packaging also indicates that it is grown in North America, so that may mean outside of the United States. (For the record, Kong's catnip comes in a #1 PETE container that is easily recyclable and its catnip is also grown in North America).<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?  My cats like it but there is no reason to use a container that is only sometimes recyclable for catnip.  Additionally, my cats liked the Kong product a bit more.  I will likely stick with that when it is time to repurchase.

review/summary: I never argue with Princess Pia!
review/text: I bought this for my feline friend, Princess Pia. Actually I am taking liberties in calling her my friend.  I'm really her servant.  She loves it, and recommends it to all minions who work for cats.  Who am I to argue with her seal of approval?<br /><br />It's good stuff, according to her, and she reminds me that she has exquisite taste in catnip, among other things.  Your cats will probably love it, too.

review/summary: Great nip
review/text: Every year I buy a container of Cosmic Catnip to make a few "tube-sock" type toys with for my cats (currently 8 and 9 years- Female and male respectively) for Christmas. Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper, the cats go directly to their toy and try to claw off the paper to start playing with it. The toy entices them for about a week, which afterwards the smell of the catnip starts to vanish. If I accidently leave the lid of the container off, I'll find the jar tipped over and two kitties eating up the leaves and rolling their faces in it.<br /><br />The only down side of this nip, being sold in such bulk and so pure, is it has "stem-like" pieces in the container, which can poke through fabric when making toys for the cats. I try to pull out all the stems before filling the toys up with the nip or letting the cats nibble on the product raw. The cats don't seem to mind, however, and there have never been any incidents where the stem gets stuck in their mouth (you know, like when we eat popcorn and the kernel always gets jammed in our mouths).<br /><br />Bottom line: Some powerful nip, the most potent of any nip I've ever bought and will continue to buy it every year.

review/summary: Not The Same as Store bought??
review/text: Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!

review/summary: Cats loved it - Eight Paws up!
review/text: Only reason I give it 4 stars is because someone was right, there are ALOT of hard stems/sticks in this product but maybe I just have been buying catnip without stems in it for a while.  Maybe this means it is fresh and all natural too.  I saw lots of buds which was good.  I removed as many sticks/stems as I could and gave it to my cats.  They seemed to really like it alot.  They didn't go crazy nutty cuckoo but who knows, maybe tomorrow they will!  I bought it mainly for their digestion and it seemed to calm them and relax them which I liked.  I noticed a little bit later one of them was up on the table trying to get in the jar which I thought was cute.  They give it eight paws up!  (because there are two of them, four paws each).

review/summary: Cosmic Catnip is the Best!
review/text: I have been looking for this brand of kitty nip for over 10yrs. I bought this brand long time ago & my kitties were in heaven. This is a safe product for your pet, I trust it completely. I give it a rating of 100+. My pet is picky & when the package showed up & I opened the box, put the jar on the floor my kitty was all over the jar trying to open it up, it was hilarious. He new it was his. If you wanted to buy just a 1/2oz 10yrs ago you paid $10.00 for it. When I saw the price of this 4oz jar I was flabbergasted, I just had to snap it up in a heartbeat while I could still could find this brand. It is very hard to find it in the stores now days (go figure something that's good for the pet)I'm the cats-meow in my pets eye now! It's like a kitty Valium in green form,lol. So look no farther you have found the BEST & SAFEST product for your pet right here and the price is out of this world (inexpensive). Believe me the other catnip on the market today is bunk junk & will cause health problems for your pet, Cosmic Catnip will not cause health problems, I know because the other stuff almost killed my pet.<br />http://www.amazon.com/B005CGUUJS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CGUUJS">Cosmic Catnip Jar, 4-Ounce</a>

review/summary: Product Good, Service Lacking
review/text: There was nothing wrong with the pastries--everyone seemed to like them, so you'll be fine as long as they don't mess up your order.<br /><br />I ordered two boxes of pastries for Christmas gifts, but the shipping was slower than expected and, more importantly, they only sent *ONE* of the two boxes.  I tried calling them and got a recording--figuring they were probably just busy because of the time of year, I also sent them two e-mails.  So far I have not heard back.  The shipping label was attached directly to the SINGLE pastry box (rather that being affixed to a larger cardboard box that could possibly hold two) and said BOX 1 of 1, so I know it wasn't a delivery service problem.  They simply only shipped one of the two boxes that I ordered.<br /><br />Mistakes can happen to any company, but the fact that they are hard to get in touch with and won't return my e-mails is just poor customer service.

All received raves from my guests; so delicate; so fresh; so well crafted!  I need to give a special shout out for the burma; this incredible creation was hard to keep around for long; absolutely everyone went nuts for it.<br /><br />Mmmm, Shatila; anyone who lives in Michigan is very lucky to have such a fabulous bakery.  From 1500 miles away, I appreciate that even though I chose standard delivery, 6 days did absolutely no harm to the freshness of the items; they were so well packaged, and in such nice display boxes.

review/summary: Like being home...
review/text: After moving from the bay area to Louisiana, we found we couldn't find salami here. Well, not real salami anyway. That processed flavor added pre-sliced stuff that taste horrible, is even hard to find. We ordered this since we couldn't find a way to order what we usually got back in California, on line. While not quite the same flavor as we were accustomed to, it is still really good salami. It has a bit of a nutty flavor unlike our old usual salami. The pepper in it isn't as uniformly distributed in some of the chubs, some bites will have a stronger pepper flavor than others, but not too strong to make them any less delicious. Unfortunately, the cooling packs that were in the box broke and water logged everything in it. This seems to make the casing with the mold on it hard to remove--I would suggest overnight shipping if you plan on ordering, to avoid this. Five pounds of salami came to 15 little 7 and a half inch chubs, with a refrigerator life of about 2 to 3 months. This is a bit much for two people to eat; unless you eat salami like my wife and I do. This amount would be perfect for a party of 8 to 12 people if that is what you are looking for. Just make sure to slice them thin. If you are one of those unfortunate people who have never had a chub of salami, only the pre-sliced packaged stuff, you really should try this. It's like the difference between good cheese and processed cheese food. While both serve a purpose, only one is edible by itself. Add a bit of provolone and a club cracker and this salami is heaven in every bite!!

review/text: I was at Trader Joe's, randomly browsing at the deli meats section for something to munch on later when one of these individual links caught my eye. At first I thought the white on the outside was some sort of wrapping, but upon squinting I noticed that it looked like a residue.<br />"Hm. This is weird", I thought. Maybe I'll eat it. Sorta like when you find strange crumbs on your kitchen table and stick it in your mouth when no one's looking.<br />So I bought a link, and read the information about Columbus Salame Secchi. Lo and behold, it's actually a sort of mold that grew on the outside of meat! Well I had already bought the thing, and figure I might as well eat it, strange as it may be.<br /><br />I was back at Trader Joe's the next day.<br />They had ONE left. My entire week was ruined!<br />So I did the only thing I could do. Buy it on Amazon!!!!!<br />The package of 12 links came two days ago. Went to the nearby hippie grocery store, bought some Cabernet, Stilton cheese, and imported Italian olives.<br />Wow...<br /><br />The flavor on this meat is just... irresistible. I know when people say something is irresistible, they mean it's really, really good. I actually mean this thing is impossible to resist. I always start eating a link with the intention of just having maybe a third or a half of a link, not because I'm a health nut or something, but just because I don't want to pig out on just some salami. This isn't just salami. This is Salame Secchi. Before I know it, I've eaten the whole darn link of sausage, and I'm feeling guilty not because I've eaten the entire thing, but because I have one fewer link left to eat later.<br /><br />The meat, mold, and fat in the salame come together in a joyful union taste-bud heaven. There's nothing else quite like it. I've always been a fan of salami and prosciutto, but you NEED to try this. If you've ever been a fan of smoked salmon, sashimi, or any kind of meat period, I think it will be impossible to turn this down.<br /><br />I'm ordering another 12 links ASAP.

review/summary: Excellent Sugar-Free Thousand Island Dressing
review/text: I have used Walden Farms' products before. Indeed, one of my favorite salad dressings by them is the 'Bacon Ranch' calorie-free, fat-free and sugar-free salad dressing (two tablespoons is a serving and has Zero calories).<br /><br />That said, I found this particular product, the Walden Farms Sugar-Free Thousand-Island salad dressing, at a grocery store the other day: I loved it so much I returned and bought three more bottles.<br /><br />Mind, it is not calorie or fat free: a serving (again, two tablespoons) has 40 calories with 4 grams of fat (zero saturated). However, it tastes, to me, so much like one of the 'premium' salad dressings (with much, much more fat, as well as sugar) that I feel the splurge is worth it.<br /><br />I came here to Amazon to see if they had it cheaper, but I see that it is currently unavailable. I will keep an eye out for it.<br /><br />Final note: Walden Farms products can range from 'ugh' to 'wow'. For instance, I love the Bacon Ranch calorie free dressing, yet hated the 'Ranch' (no bacon) calorie free dressing. With this company you simply must try everything at least once, and you are sure to find several items you will enjoy.

It makes a good dip for celery. I've given this to people and not told them it's diet dressing, and haven't had anyone ask about it. If it were a non-diet dressing I'd give it 3 stars for flavor, but considering the small number of calories (the "zero" on the label means "less than 5 per serving" -- thanks, FDA) it's pretty impressive.

review/text: I love making Thai food, so I use fish sauce fairly often. I'm used to using Thai Kitchen brand, but I recently moved and my local grocery stores don't carry it, so I picked up A Taste of Thai since it was the only fish sauce I could easily find.  All I can say is that this stuff is SO salty that I could barely eat the food I made.  That's pretty bad considering I used less than the amount I usually use because I wasn't sure what to expect.  If you buy this brand and you aren't used to it, be aware that you will need to start with JUST A TINY AMOUNT and then taste your food.  Do not add what a recipe calls for or what you're used to adding, because you will ruin your meal!

So from 1 packet, I think, you can get 5-6 cups of flour<br />for me works best with fat-free milk or soy milk. I serve with maple syrup or sauteed veggies(spinach, baby corn, potato and chives, black pepper and garlic)<br />cons - since this is a very healthy product, it can get a little boring after a while, I tried adding pureed strawberries to the batter, didn't work too good, so don't try that, try to serve blueberry sauce on the side instead.

review/summary: Makes easy microwave cornbread
review/text: This lasted no time at all for me. I mixed small batches in a microwaveable mixing bowl with just water added, and stuck the bowl in the microwave for 10 minutes to get warm "fat-free" cornbread. Sometimes dumped a can of peaches over it after cooking. Or chili or soup. Ordering 2 this time ;-).

review/summary: Great!
review/text: We had these pancakes over the weekend and really enjoyed the freshness and the taste.  Seemed to be the underdog compared to their multigrain and high fiber versions. I will try those too, but we really enjoyed this mix and glad we bought it.

review/summary: Grainy, Healthy taste - but good alternative option from Bob's!
review/text: I was hoping that we would like this product more, however we just can't get over the texture. We found that it was easy to mix and made somewhat flat pancakes (we really like fluffy) Overall - I'd suggest buying one pack at your local store before springing for a pack of 4. On the other hand, the birds seem to LOVE this mix so I've been delighted to see them outside my window :)

review/summary: Doesn't suit our taste!!
review/text: I have always made my own pancake and waffle mix; no pre-made stuff for me!!  I tried this mix and not one person really liked it.  It is a heavy, cornmeal floury taste.  Back to my own recipe.

review/summary: cornmeal pancakes
review/text: the first shipment of this mix was excellent and we used it all, but the second shipment must have been old because it had a flat, sort of rancid taste. i wound up throwing most of it away, which i can't afford to do.  i love bob red mill products but i think i'll shop around for it at the local health food store where it will be more likely to be fresh.

review/summary: Sunday Pancakes and Waffles - Oh Yeh !
review/text: This is good stuff. Easy to make, we add real vanilla and almond extract - completes the flavor.Healthy and very tasty.This product has past the picky eaters test in my house.To balance textures and flavor we like to mix it with B.R.M's<br /> 7 grain flour pancake & waffle mix. So you'll have a nice rise and some corn crunch at the same time -YUM.

review/summary: Not So Good  -Don't Scratch and Sniff-
review/text: Well, I wish this mix was as good as reflected in the other reviews.<br />Tried the waffle recipe from the package. I guess we're not used to the "healthy" ingredients. Not such an appetizing taste or texture and the cooking waffles make a decidedly unpleasant smell. Funky, burned corn and whole wheat aroma? Lingered for hours.<br />In addition the waffle recipe calls for 1 cup of mix and does not make even 2 whole waffles in a standard sized maker. Not the usual waffle expansion or fluffiness but hey it's "healthy."<br /><br />Will need to come up with suitable additions or this stuff will go unused or well maybe the birds will get a treat.<br />Or not...

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: these bars are delicious.  i love them. they are the perfect thing to eat when you are looking for a healthy, yet filling, snack.  they are good anytime.  my favorite flavor is the apple raspberry, but all of them are actually very good.  they are a little on the thick side, but that's ok because it makes you feel like you are eating more than you are and takes the edge of your hunger till you can eat a bigger meal.  i'm happy i found these and will continue to order them.  great product.

review/summary: My Dogs Hate This Food
review/text: If this is supposed to be a top notch dog food, my dogs sure don't think so. There is a very odd smell to this food, it almost smells as if it is bad. Same smell came from the Bison flavor as well.  My dogs won't eat it.  Obviously other dogs like it otherwise they'd be out of business. Sorry I wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff.

review/summary: Actually Taste Like Something!
review/text: One of the problems with flavored baked tortilla chips is since there is no surface fat from frying, the flavor powder has nothing to stick to and the chips end up tasting bland. The Guiltless Gourmet line of flavored chips avoids this problem somehow. I've tried both the "Mucho Nacho" and The "Chipotle" both were light and crisp with a good amount of the seasoning powder on board. The have great flavor and are considerably lower in calories than a comparable number of fried chips.

review/summary: Great Taste From Baked Chips
review/text: These chips were formerly offered at Gelson's Market but are now only available online...at half the cost of retail stores :) :) :).  If you want to cut-back on unnecessary calories but still like to munch on tortilla chips then Guiltless Gourmet is for you !  They are baked and not fried in oil which more than doubles the calories.  I prefer the Mucho Nacho flavor but they also have Chili-Lime, Yellow Corn, Blue Corn, and other flavors.
