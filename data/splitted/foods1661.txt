review/summary: Candy is no joke
review/text: I bought these almonds because I LOVE almonds.  When I received them it came nicely packaged and I couldn't wait to try some.  When I sliced open the bag it had such a wonderful smell to it almost like a cotton candy smell.  When I ate one OH MY...it was wonderful.  I will order this product again and would send them to my daughter some time in the future for a gift as she loved the taste of them also.  To anyone wanting a great almond candy try these you will love them

review/summary: Great price, fast delivery, perfect almonds
review/text: We bought these to make traditional wedding favors.  They were large almonds, thick sugar (made them a little too sweet, IMO, but prevented cracking), almost every single one was in usable condition.  Fast shipping, great packaging, highly recommend.  By far the best price/value choice of any of the Jordan Almonds I saw online.

review/summary: excellent quality light but full of flavor -good company
review/text: First I have to say I ordered and tried 5 flavors of the syrups from this company. I was so sick of maple ALL the time. So, as a general statement each flavor was very good, they were light but full of flavor. And though every person has different tastes and will like them in different degrees I found the following to be my tastes:<br /><br />Peach: even though i would not have thought peach would be my fav of the lot it was. it had amazing flavor and was not too super sweet. plus it went awesome w a bit of butter.<br /><br />strawberry: was really really good flavor nothing artificial about it just lightly sweet with great strawberry flavor.<br /><br />marionberry: had great bolder flavor, sweeter than the rest and thicker, closer to traditional pancake syrups but good flavor.<br /><br />red raspberry: i was expecting this to be my favorite and it was really tasty, even if peach did steal the show. however this was good and also light, though it had just a hint of an after taste.<br /><br />cherry; of all i tried this one had the lightest flavor, it was also more liquid like and less syrupy. it was light and delicious I liked it alot but for pancakes it seemed to soak right in and disapear a bit. i imagine for crepes or something this would be outstanding.<br /><br />the company shipped super amazingly fast in a strong sturdy box. each syrup was packed in strong material individually. I recommend them and plan on trying more of their products.<br /><br />PS- i also tried using these flavors with each other or with maple in double whammy of flavor on pancakes- peach and strawberry was really good, also marionberry and maple...

review/summary: Not Recommended--stale.
review/text: I thought I'd try this product, as my Mom loves crackers and things like the Wasa crispbreads.  These were disappointing to both my Mom and myself.<br /><br />They tasted stale, even though the expiration date was almost a year away.  The flavor was somewhat improved by toasting them.<br /><br />They are edible enough, and I won't return them to amazon because I wouldn't want to cause them unnecessary expense, but I won't order them again.<br /><br />Note, the packaging is different from the photograph.<br /><br />Since I'm stuck with 11 boxes, I plan to take them to class, where hungry classmates will gradually eat them up.<br /><br />Just fyi, they are not vegan, for people that need that.  I've copied the ingredients list as printed on the box.<br /><br />"Ingredients: Spelt wheat flour, water, malt, expeller pressed soy bean oil, salt, egg whites, yeast.<br />Toppings: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic, caraway seeds, dehydrated onion flakes."<br /><br />"Manufactured for: Good Groceries Company, Brooklyn NY, 11231"<br /><br />They were mailed to amazon in Hazleton, PA from "Adam Gershuny, Good Groceries Company, 44 Heller Park Lane, Somerset NJ, 08873-1206"<br /><br />I appreciate amazon giving us the opportunity to try different products, but will try to do better next time in choosing which snacks to order.

review/summary: great fertilizer spike, but needs a little care to get spikes in ground
review/text: I've used these spikes for several years now on several dwarf apple trees. It's hard to tell how well they really work in contributing to the size and amount of apples, but I can say the trees that I used the spikes on have all produced really well. I'd recommend using them.<br /><br />The one caveat is that the spikes are somewhat brittle, and can split apart before you can really get them in the ground. It all depends on your hammering technique as well as how tough the ground is. Just take some care and some patience, and you'll succeed in getting most if not all of the spike into the earth.

The cost by buying it in packs of 6 saves a lot of money and also means one less thing I have to go to the store to get. The six pack tastes so good it goes fast. I would highly recommend this product...it is hard to find good organic Granola that is reasonably priced, not sticky and each pack has stayed fresh. A good buy!

review/text: This granola is great, it's sooo hard to find a granola that isn't toooo sweeeet or too bland. I think that really sums it up as surely you can relate. If by chance you don't like dried cherries it's not for you. Personally I got this after the Back to nature apple granola which pales in comparison for overpowered taste of completely dominant odorous fruit (yuk!). This granola has 2g less sugar than the apple which is just right IMO.<br /><br />What I love is that the cherries have a sweet and sour taste, similar to a good raisin but lighter. 10g protein per cup is awesome and truly makes a complete breakfast. All the ingredients are really well balanced with the puffed rice and oats, no soy. Now hopefully amazon will keep this one around...

review/summary: Better Than Chicken Stock
review/text: First, a caveat: I am a vegetarian.  Not a hippie, granola eating vegetarian (I am a decorated officer who served in an Infantry role in the Iraq War) but a vegetarian nonetheless.<br /><br />But, like anyone, I occasionally want a good soup.  To best test the Better Than Bouillon Vegan Base (No Chicken), the solution was to try to make a chicken noodle soup.  I consider myself a pretty good cook so my challenge was to make a chicken noodle soup that would outshine my Jewish friend's mother's chicken noodle soup (blasphemy I know).<br /><br />Well, after finding the right vegan chicken (not as gross as it sounds), noodles, etc., I tinkered with the recipe and thought it came out pretty well.  In fact, I probably make it every few weeks now.  In the real test, I gave some of it to my friend.<br /><br />Now my friend is a nice guy, so even if he hated it he would probably tell me he loved it.  Sure enough, he loved it.  In fact, he loved it so much he shared it with his mother.  Their family has been trying to eat healthy so she asked for the recipe and the rest is history.<br /><br />I use this base for all my soups now, but you don't have to stop at soups.  Anything that tastes better with some chicken stock (and let's face it that is a lot) tastes great with this too.  I also buy the vegan no beef base on a regular basis too.  They cost about the same as other Better than Bouillon stocks but without the meat products.  I am a big fan.

review/summary: Favorite veggie broth
review/text: This is my absolute favorite vegetable broth.  I find it is much more suitable in dishes that would traditionally use chicken broth.  (I know that's kind of a Captain Obvious thing to say about something called "No Chicken" but there you go.)  It has a light flavor that blends with a variety of dishes.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe it, I find most standard veggie broths to be too.... "orange."  I don't know if there is too much carrot in the mix or what, but this is my preferred broth for just about everything.<br /><br />I just wish I could get it locally.

review/text: just what the title says. the jars are sooo small 8oz, i used one jar up for 2 batches of soup. 5 quart pot at a time. way too expensive for so little in each jar. i went online and found that you can easily make your own for a fraction of the price. just puree all kinds of veggies in food processor and add alot of salt, some pepper, ext. let sit in fridge and thats your bullion. add little bit to flavor soups, sauces, ext. preserve some in freezer and use the rest.<br />easy and way, way cheaper then these jars, plus homemade is fresh.

I got a refund for the no-beef that arrived all oozed out, but the no-chicken seals looked good.  I went to use a new one and they ALL oozed out!  I threw them all in the garbage!

review/summary: Tastes great, but the jars ooze.
review/text: I was initially pleased to find a nice price on this soup base on Amazon having previously purchased it at my grocery store, however the box arrived with soup base ooze in its box and all over the glass jars.  None of the jars were broken.  It made me concerned that the product was not properly sealed, or did not tolerate air travel very well.  Either way... not good.<br /><br />I wish I could split the review and give two stars for shipping and five for the soup base itself because it really is an excellent product and adds terrific flavor to many soups.  I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but this has such a nice flavor that I love adding it to many dishes.  Unfortunately, with the shipping "goo" I won't order it again.

review/summary: Great way to get fast "stock" for veg dishes
review/text: This has been one of the best deals in the vegetarian food world.  We use it at home to make a base for friend chinese dumplings, for making soup, for making spanish rice, and I don't even know what else.  I keep one in the fridge at work so I can have a cup of soup during the day instead of constantly sucking down coffee.  When there are extra veggies left over from the healthy snack in the office pantry I can put in extra broccoli, carrot sticks, and cauliflour into a bowl with water and a bit of this for 2.5 minutes and have delicious soup.<br /><br />It's not as salty as most of the other "better than boullion" choices, so it can be a background flavor for dishes like stuffing, or it can be made stronger to help make a roux or to blend beans to make refried beans.<br /><br />Yum.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JDVFQ">Emerald Forest Ricochet Mints, Mixed Case, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I purchased the Emerald Forest Ricochet Mints, Mixed Case, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6) from Amazon because of the natural Xylitol sugar that is suppose to help protect your teeth from plaque and cavities. Xylitol is suppose to coat the teeth to prevent plaque from forming on the teeth. These mints dissolve in your mouth within 5 seconds, very little flavor, and you will NOT feel that you just had any mints. I don't recommend these at all. Too expensive, and some of the flavors don't taste good.

review/text: These Emerald Forest Xylitol Wintermints may meet your needs or may not. I tried them out because I was looking for a xylitol mint (for the dental/gum health benefits) that had xylitol as its primary ingredient. These fit the bill. They are moderately sweet but very mild on the mint side. The drawbacks for me are that they are very small and dissolve very quickly. I usually pop at least two at once because they are small, and they dissolve in the matter of a minute. If you are looking for a strong flavored mint that lasts more than a minute, these are not what you are looking for.

I love the wintergreen Lifesavers, and these mints taste just like them without all the sugar. They are soft mints, but that just means I can chew them up without breaking a tooth! If you want a mint to suck for a long time, this may not be a good option. The only problem I have with these is that I want to eat too many--they are that good! These mints also take care of funny mouth tastes effectively, and promote a healthy level of saliva flow.

review/summary: Bariani Balsamic Vinegar - Superb - But Worth it?
review/text: I have never purchased vinegar for cooking.... it was my first experience and using a Vegan recipe from my stash of cookbooks I tried this and ooooooh was it ever tasty.  Balsamic vinegar is, from what I hear now, some of the best vinegar there is.  However, as far as buying the Bariani Brand again, hmmmm I'm not sure I will.  The reason is due to my experience with their Olive oil and the lack of response from the Manufacture.<br /><br />Bariani EVOO - Generally I buy olive oil in large 2 liter containers because we use in for cooking, baking and just about anything that asks for lard or butter. We feel using olive oil is a far healthier and tastier souce of oil to use than the latter. However, when I started researching more and hearing stories of outdated olive oil and needing to have it in a dark container I became worried about where I get my olive Oil... Generally at Sams Club or Costco.... So I opted to spend a few extra bucks more to get it in a dark bottle and hopefully current year stock. I purchased this lovely Bariani EVOO and it looked and smelled great, but honestly it didn't taste any different than the EVOO that I get elsewhere and the date on the bottle was confusing.... harvested in 2010 and bottled in 2011? Since I just purchased it September 2011 I was trying to figure out why. So, I contacted the company that produces this oil hoping to get some clarification on the details (since olive oil does not improve with age) and never heard back from them. So now I won't bother spending the extra money on that product. I did buy their Bariani Balsamic Vinegar 16.9 oz. and that is superb, but again sine I never heard from the company, why should I buy from them again? Disappointed!

review/summary: Did not like...
review/text: I had heard so many good things about using this in place of wheat (white) pasta.  For me, it did not do it.  Now, I did not cook it as I eat raw foods.  I soaked it overnight and rinsed it well, but it did not have the same texture as al dente pasta.  I tried to warm it a bit in my dehydrator which made it harden very quickly.  This means I would always have to eat it cold if I did not cook it.  I did not like it.<br /><br />As far as the fishiness, though, that some may be concerned about.  I did not find it fishy at all and I am not a huge fan of sea veggies.  It was very mild.  I think it is worth "trying" if you are a raw vegan/vegetarian because you may like it.  I just wish I did.

review/text: This "pasta" was really gross.  I prepared it using the package instructions soaking for 24 hours and then draining and it was really tough and had no flavor. I was expecting a fishy taste but that is not there at all. I purchased it to try a recipe that I got from a raw food online site and the whole experience was a disaster.  In my opinion, you would have to prepare this spaghetti with a really flavorfull sauce so that it can mask the texture and lack of flavor of the product and just use the pasta as a filler to help keep you full.  From now on I will stay away from all recipes suggesting sea spaghetti.

review/summary: Loose tea is better than tea in a bag--and cheaper!
review/text: Just got this today.  Have opened several, and have noticed a clear pattern so far.  This tea tastes "cleaner" and "fresher" if that makes any sense.  To simplify it:  This tea just tastes substantially BETTER than the bagged tea I have traditionally consumed.  I unhesitatingly recommend it.<br /><br />The main beefs I have with this order came before I received it.  The product description does not list the 10 flavors that come in the box.  I don't know if that is because of sloppy marketing or because the selection changes with whatever flavor is currently moving slowly at the company.  I guess I will let you know if I order this sampler again.  However, if anyone is as curious pre-order as I was, here are the 10 flavors that came in this sampler as I received it:<br /><br />Spiced Chai<br />Ceylon Tea<br />Earl Grey<br />Rooibos Tea<br />English Breakfast<br />Jasmine Green Tea<br />Sakura (Japanese Cherry Blossom Tea)<br />Peach Rooibos<br />Japan Sencha Green Tea<br />Sechung Oolong Tea<br /><br />Each flavor weighs 5 ounces and comes in a heavy, foil-lined paper sack that has a Ziplock-style top for re-sealing.  NICE.<br /><br />Each flavor I have opened so far has a VERY nice quality, fresh and robust nose to it.  Once it has steeped, the promise of the aroma IS generously fulfilled in the flavor of the tea.<br /><br />I used a baby spoon to get the product out of the bag and into the stainless steel mesh tea balls I bought for the purpose of making this transition.  (Baby spoon for its narrower bowl, making it easier to spoon the tea into the tea balls without spillage.)  I am new to bulk tea and so far, I don't think I ever want to go back!  I don't know if this is due to an inherent advantage of bulk teas or if I just happened to stumble upon an extra-high quality supplier first time out of the chute.  I am looking forward to finding out, however!<br /><br />Either way, I am glad I made this purchase.  It is a great way to get introduce to a variety of bulk teas without spending a fortune.  I do not know whether I will order this exact product, but I CAN say that if finances permit, I am going to order my favorites out of this box from this same company. (plus a good mint tea, which I wish had been included)

review/text: I have been using loose leaf tea since the 80s when a friend brewed some South American black tea and it was amazing.<br />My review will be for unsweetened iced tea as I steep and pour over ice at work in an attempt to wean myself from colas.<br />I have been looking for a mellow black tea that is good cold and I found it in this sampler.<br />I didn't need to review the Earl Grey because I loved it already and is good hot or cold, sweet or not and milk or not. Just all around good!<br />The real surprise was the Ceylon! I had never heard of it but it went to the top of the list with Earl. No bitter after taste and not weak, mellow on ice and very very good.<br />The Rooibos were pleasant but not every day tea for me. The Peach Rooibos has dried bits of peach that swell when wet and is the better one to me.<br />The English breakfast is good too.<br />I don't care for the green teas at all so I blend them with one I like.<br />Spiced Chai was good but again not an every day tea for me and has a cinnamon taste.<br />Would probably be good sweet.<br />Sechung Oolong is not good but that's my opinion and I've had it before.<br />The Sakura (Japanese Cherry Blossom Tea) was ok but not great.<br />Here's how I rank them;<br />1. Ceylon #1<br />2. Earl Grey always good<br />3. Peach rooibos nice<br />4. Rooibos nice<br />5. English Breakfast good<br />6. Spiced Chai ok<br />7. Sakura (Japanese Cherry Blossom Tea) ok<br />8. Japan Sencha Green Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, Sechung Oolong Tea ( these 3 all qualify as YUK in my opinion.

review/summary: leaking plastic bottles
review/text: The five star system doesn't work well when the product is excellent but the packaging is terrible. I give the order two stars because several bottles were not sealed and leaked all over the box and the other bottles.  This company needs to totally rethink the sealing method it uses so that the product arrives clean and dry. It was a real mess and I had to spend a lot of time dealing with cleaning it up.  In addition to the mess, I have chosen to refrigerate the unsealed bottles to avoid possible spoilage.  This takes up valuable space in the fridge for something I had planned on simply shelving in the pantry.  Had the order arrived as I expected, I would give this product five stars.

review/text: Wellness is the only canned food I buy for my cats. I has no by products, preservatives or any artificial junk. No grain, and it's first four ingredients are good meats. My cats love it (even the finicky one) and I'm happy there is at least one cat food company out there that provides nutritious pet food. Thank you Wellness! Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you  need a can opener to open these cans.

So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/text: I recently did a bunch of research on Cat nutrition, and my conclusion was that the Wellness cat foods offered the best combination of excellent nutrition, good variety, and affordability.  So I bought some for my crotchety, picky, 16+ year old cat who had been eating Nutro.  To my great relief, she accepted the switch without complaint!<br /><br />Although I haven't had a long history with this cat food yet, I've been pleased with the results so far, and based on my research I'm convinced I'm doing right by my furry friend.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

review/text: My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.

review/text: I haven't bought Wellness through Amazon yet, but the prices are very competitive and will do so.  After discovering they carried Wellness, wanted to comment on the product.  When I adopted my cat, she came with unrevealed health problems.  She was on a nebulizer every day, no energy, vomiting and more.  As one reviewer stated, I did some internet research.  I tried some of the top of the line natural foods.  Once I got her on the Wellness wet food, her health was a complete turnaround.  She's twelve and acts like four or five years of age.  No more health problems.  The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.  The dry, is very small pieces and she's slow to eat it, but I keep it as a 'treat' food.  The wet is perfect in every way.

My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!

After about a week of ordering this '2 day shipping item' i received notification that it had not yet shipped and was expected to be delivered a month later! The reasoning I was given was that if I order from Amazon.com directly I should expect a month wait time and they were out of stock. 1-I received no notification that the item was out of stock. 2-Don't promote something as a special with 2 day shipping when you don't mean it. People order things based on delivery time for a reason. I'm angry that I wasted my time and was relying for the food to get here in a timely manner. I will not order directly from Amazon again.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Healthy Canned Diet
review/text: Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up "health food" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets.

People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it ("they've been eating Wellness for years!"), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation.

review/summary: Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.
review/text: We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.

review/summary: Our cats no longer will touch any of it.
review/text: We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat.

review/summary: wellness canned cat food
review/text: We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.  Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.

review/summary: My 2 cats love cubed Wellness food
review/text: I only feed Wellness to my cats - grain free is what I like the most about this brand.  In the wild, they would never eat grain, so why feed low quality, grain filled foods at home?<br /><br />Wellness ingredients are stellar, I'd eat this food.  First ingredient is plain turkey.<br /><br />Wellness Cubed 3oz varieties are my cat's favorites.  Sliced type is second, minced is third.  I also feed Wellness pouches and pate styles, plus Core as well.<br /><br />Cube size is approximately 1/3rd of an inch.<br /><br />Turkey is what I prefer to feed them, Salmon and Tuna are their favorite, but I try to feed less fish, make sure they get plenty of high protein turkey instead.<br /><br />Analysis:<br />Crude Protein  Not Less Than  8.0%<br />Crude Fat  Not Less Than  4.0%<br />Crude Fiber  Not More Than  1.0%<br />Moisture  Not More Than  82.0%<br />Ash  Not More Than  2.8%<br />Magnesium  Not More Than  0.025%<br />Taurine  Not Less Than  0.05%<br /><br />Ingredients: Turkey, Turkey Broth, Water Sufficient for Processing, Peas, Dried Egg Whites, Natural Flavor, Dried Egg Product, Guar Gum, Spinach, Sodium Phosphate, Ground Flaxseed, Salt, Potassium Chloride, Cranberries, Minerals (Iron Amino Acid Chelate, Zinc Amino Acid Chelate, Cobalt Amino Acid Chelate, Copper Amino Acid Chelate, Manganese Amino Acid Chelate, Sodium Selenite, Potassium Iodide), Carrageenan, Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate, Niacin, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Folic Acid), Choline Chloride.

review/summary: My cats don't like it
review/text: If my cats could leave reviews they would probably give this product a 1 star. Fortunately they can't, so I'm giving it a 3 stars for effort :)  I realize that different cats used to different foods, however mine for some reason would rather starve than eat turkey formula cat food from Wellness. Otherwise I trust Wellness brand, they seem to put good ingredients, and no grains.<br />Also there was no mentioning anywhere about quantity. It comes in 12 large cans.<br />Before getting it tho, I suggest you go to local Petco and get a smaller can of same Turkey formula and check if your cats will eat it.

review/summary: Our 2 Kittens Love It
review/text: Our 2 kittens who are now 5 months old love Wellness Canned Kitten Food. They lick their dishes clean. And I feel very  good giving them a healthy food to eat.<br /><br />I've been so happy with the canned food orders I've placed with Petco. Have had trouble with orders coming from other companies arriving dented. Petco packages them very well and I have not received one dented can yet. Fast shipping too.

review/summary: Superior nutrition at excellent savings
review/text: My 14 year old feline - Archie - was diagnosed with diabetes 2 weeks ago.  His diet for the previous 6 years consisted solely of Science Diet (adult/senior/light/age defying)kibble and a small amount of Friskie's canned at dinner time.  Per his veterinarians instructions to feed only high quality canned (wet) foods, I purchased Science Diet MD for diabetic cats.  Over the course of the following 3 days, there was no significant change in Archie's blood glucose which prompted me to start investigating cat foods a little more thoroughly.<br /><br />As stated on the Science Diet MD label, their carbohydrate content tested at 13%.  This seemed very high to me as diabetes maintenance is nearly ALL about carbohydrates.<br /><br />I discovered that Wellness brand Chicken tested at 4% carbohydrates. The fat content, at 60%, is higher than I'd like, but I'm okay with that, at least for the time being.  Archie's blood glucose plummeted 100 points within 24 hours of his first meal of Wellness Chicken.<br /><br />At less than $3.00 per 12.5 oz. (Amazon price PLUS free shipping)compared to Science Diet MD at $2.75 per 5.5 oz., Wellness also wins in the cost category. A double win X2 as I live in Alaska which is prone to unnecessary and outrageous shipping fees from unscrupulous/lazy vendors.<br /><br />Wellness Chicken is not vegetable free - it does contain peas and potato fillers (among others) but it is grain free which is also in it's favor.  Cats, after all, are carnivores.  It makes sense to me that their diet reflect this as much as possible/affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: Cats love it! And it's a brand I trust. Cats only get canned food once a week, and this does not adversely affect kitty tummies or the litter box between dry food meals.

review/summary: Not for my kittens
review/text: My 6 month old kittens won't touch Wellness Kitten canned food.  I'm sure it's good for them but I can't get them to eat it.  I've tried on 2 separate occasions without any success.  One of my kittens is very finicky but the other one eats almost anything so I've given up on this brand.
