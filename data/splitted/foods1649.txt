review/text: I really like the taste of these little cookies, and this is the best flavor (IMO).  I got these when they were marked down to $12 and felt like I was paying an OK price.  They have gone back up in price, so waiting for it to come back down so that I can buy more.

review/summary: More chocolate than you expect
review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

review/text: So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/summary: Box won't close with bags standing up.
review/text: This is a nice box, but the lid won't close if Stash brand tea bags are sitting vertically.  I purchased the box assuming that Stash could make a box that would hold their tea bags.  It does, but they have to sit at an angle, and one slot will only hold about 12 bags.  The compartments will hold 20 bags which is a standard number of Stash tea bags, but to do so, they have to be put in vertically, then the lid won't close.  I suppose you could force the lid closed, but the little hinge screws would likely pull out.<br /><br />Make the box 1/4" higher and the problem would be solved.  I am requesting Amazon return my box as it doesn't work like it should.

review/summary: Excellent Box!!!!!
review/text: This box is WONDERFUL! I bought it for my parents for their anniversary because my dad had always been saying how he wanted a nice, real tea chest. He had another tea box before but it was awful because the latch broke, it was tiny, and it wasn't even real wood, it was plastic. I was looking at different boxes and I didn't care if it came with tea or not, what the lining was, or the color of the wood. The thing I really wanted to sea was if the box was REAL wood. When choosing the box to get them I was torn. I decided to get this one because it looked beautiful, the perfect color and lining, and it was the heaviest out of all the boxes I looked at. This meant to me it was the most likely to be real wood. It arrived in the mail and it was perfect. I was so incredibly happy with this purchase. It's nice and big, it has a beautiful wood finish, the latch is excellent (very sturdy) and it is real wood. For 40$, this box was a steal. My parents saw it and immediately said I paid too much because it is such a high quality box it's hard to believe that it's only 40$. I love this box. I can't even begin to say how great it is. It's beautiful and sturdy and perfect. If you are deciding between this and any other box, choose this one because I guarantee it will be the best and you will be so happy with it. Don't get any Bigelow or Bentley boxes, those are the awful ones I was talking about. They fall apart and are made of plastic. This is the best box out there. Five stars all the way.

review/text: Trident is one of my favorite brands of gum.  The minty flavors are my favorites, but I also enjoy the fruit flavors every once in a while.  I like how each flavor is packaged individually.  However, within the packages of each flavor, there is no plastic wrapping like you would find on a store bought pack of gum.<br />It's a good variety, something in it for everyone.  The bubblegum and fruit flavors are ideal for kids, and the original and spearmint are great for adults.

review/summary: My dogs love them.
review/text: The best part about these treats?  MADE IN THE USA.  With horribly inferior Chinese dog treats making dogs sick here in the U.S. -- I want to be sure that my dogs are safe.  And they really love them.  I found these treats at Sam's Club before, but I don't remember how much they cost.  And after reading about the massive cargo ships that Sam's (Walmart) had made strictly for the transport of merchandise from China to be sold here in the U.S.A., I'm letting my Sam's club pass expire and I won't be renewing.<br /><br />Economic and political views aside... my dogs really do love these treats.  Yes, they are just treats and are gone in an instant -- but I also use them for training treats.  You can break off just a tiny piece and they are a really high value reward for my 2 Australian Cattle Dog rescues.  I'm also buying the beef flavor for them as well.

review/summary: TOXIC INGREDIENTS!  WILL RETURN....
review/text: After reviewing the 3-star review on Amazon, I checked the label on the container. Sure enough, this product contains propylene glycol!!!! as one of the top ingredients!!  I've done some research also and found that propylene glycol is toxic to pets and people. Please do your research.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I WON'T FEED ANYTHING TO MY PETS OR FAMILY THAT MIGHT HURT THEM.  THERE ARE TOO MANY HEALTHY TREATS ON THE MARKET.

review/summary: Ingredients
review/text: I recently purchased these treats because they were on sale. However, I waited until a week after training my dog with these treats (quite successfully, he loved them!) to check the ingredients. I already know that most doggie treats may contain unhealthy ingredients, but I wasn't worried too much, as snacks are often unhealthy, both for people and for dogs. However one of these ingredients worries me a lot. This product contains propylene glycol. I've done some research and I've found that propylene glycol is toxic. It is banned in cat foods, but for some reason dog food and treats are allowed to have it. It hasn't harmed my dog yet, but I've decided not to take any chances.

review/text: I volunteer at the local animal shelter. Usually I buy these from Costco.  However, I was in a pinch and Costco did not have them in stock at the time.  They are a bit more expensive here but they are nice and soft.  The ingredients are not the best.  For dogs locked in a shelter it is definitely fine.

review/summary: Duke loves 'em!
review/text: Duke, the 17 year old wonderdog, gives these four paws up!  He LOVES them.  He likes the smell and will drop everything to eat one of these.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they are "jerky" but they are not chewy at all.  They are soft and can be easily broken into pieces with little effort.  I thought they these would last longer.  But Duke eats this like it's a thin piece of bread.  It only lasts a few seconds of eating and it's gone.

review/summary: Fussie Cat canned cat food
review/text: My cat, Mango, is delighted with his new food which arrived a few days ago, one day earlier than I expected!  I had been giving him "Tuna with Shrimp" which he loves also but I wanted to give him some variety.  I alternate the food on a daily basis which he really likes, given the rate at which he consumes it!  I would definitely recommend this brand as it is the only one which I have found that he will eat consistently on a daily basis.

review/text: I tried a couple of cans of Fussie Cat after checking to be sure the ingredients didn't come from China.  I emailed the company and the owner actually emailed me back with detailed information on their plant and food sources!  Fussie Cat is about the only wet food my cats eat any more.  EVO is the best dry food and they also eat that.  I first found it at a pet food warehouse in Anaheim, CA.  I tried it and all six really loved it.  But that store is a 70 mile round trip for me and I haven't found it anywhere locally.  That's why I love the subscription program on Amazon.  Not only is the food cheaper, it's delivered to my front door on a regular basis.  This one's a hit in this household.

review/summary: Finally! A soft food my dear old Bagheera loves!!
review/text: (Member's daughter here.)  My cat, Bagheera, is nearly 17 years old and wasn't getting enough hydration through water alone.  I keep her on the hard food that every vet I've had recommends for her dental health (and at 17 and having no dental issues, I guess they've been right!)  But her vet and I decided it was high time she get some wet food as well this year.  Thus began many tries of different purchases, and several months of sniffing, licking, backing up and walking away from food dishes.  My other cat, Marguerite, loved every wet food I brought into the house, so nothing was lost... but that my older prima donna feline wasn't getting the wet food hydration she truly needed.  Until finally, finally!  I don't know what it is about this food, but from the moment I first put some in her dish, she cautiously crept up to it, sniffed, sniffed again, licked, then started eating like she'd never known food before!  She has shown no signs of liking it less, and we've been on it now for a month.  And the vet has given her a clean bill of UTI-less-ness as of this past week!  This wet food may not be for all cats, but it has made my household a cat-happy one.  Thank you!

The clerk at our pet store says it's much healthier than FF, and my old cat needs nutrition. I tried finding the Fussie Cat brand website, but it's not up yet, and their Facebook page is skimpy.

My cats love this, price is ok and ingredients seem good - does not contain grain or by-products and supplements all check out (except maybe Vitamin K, which I am still researching to make sure it is the safe, non-toxic form).  Very happy so far, as this gives me another alternative that my cats will eat.  (I feed Wellness, Weruva, Spot's Stew and recently this and Precise Holistic.)

I have tried a variety of grain-free cat food (both wet and dry) and Fussie Cat is the most affordable, and my cats have loved every flavor I have bought. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who really cares about feeding their cats high quality, healthy cat food.

Worries were unfounded.  1/2 cup of oats, 1 cup of water, some cinnamon and chopped up dates and 2 minutes in the microwave and I had my perfect bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />As far as the actual oats... couldn't be happier, very aromatic and fresh right out of the bag.  If you like oatmeal as much as I do don't hesitate in buying these.

But<br />I ended up buying them online, because Walmart stopped stocking them.  You have to like granola though or you won't like these.  Everything that is<br />in these cookies is good for you.  So they're a healthy alternative to those cookies that aren't good for you.

review/summary: MUCH BETTER Than Starkist or Chicken of the Sea~
review/text: I am very happy to report that this case of "No Salt Added-Natural Value Yellowfin Chunk Tuna {in Spring Water}" is exactly what the sellers say it is!  The tuna itself is much pinker in color than the usual store bought brands, and as firm and chunky as the standard albacore tuna that I have been used to buying at my local markets. It's a true 6 oz. can of tuna {no shrinking portions here} and this brand is Wild Caught and Dolphin-Safe.  So, let's see now:  No added salt, beautiful pink color, firm and chunky-size pieces, and best of all, a really excellent price delivered right to my door, compliments of Amazon.com!  What's not to like?  I'm permanently sold on the Natural Value's brand of Yellowfin Tuna.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Really Good Tuna!
review/text: This tuna is very tasty!  It also is not watery, so you're not paying for half a can of water.  It's also larger than the average size tuna can you get at the store (have you noticed they've shrunk lately?).  This is a great value considering it has free super saver shipping, and the size of the cans.

review/summary: Beautiful wonderful tuna
review/text: I was buying the Star Kist Select low sodium chunk light  but when it became temporarily unavailable I ordered this tuna instead.  It is every bit as good as the Star Kist. There is nothing in the can but yellow fin tuna and water. The tuna is mostly large intact chunks like you get with solid white albacore but it's not albacore which is better since it's the big more mature albacore that has accumulated  more mercury.  This tuna has more juice in the can than the Star Kist Select and that may be why the cans say six ounces instead of five. Still it Is very good tuna and because there is no added sodium my cat gets to eat it too and she loves the juice.  Something else nice about this tuna is the can.  I use a Good Grips opener, the kind that cuts the lid off at the seam and leaves no sharp edges.  With most cans I have to go around the can more than once to effectively cut off the lid but when opening these tuna cans one time around is all it takes.

review/summary: My New Favorite Tortillas
review/text: I'm picky when it comes to tortillas, not just because I want tortillas that taste good, but also because I want tortillas with quality ingredients and not a lot of additives.  I steer clear of most supermarket tortillas, especially when I look at the long list of ingredients that are more evocative of a laboratory than a kitchen.  Simple is better, both for taste and health.<br /><br />La Tauna tortillas were a pleasant discovery.  Where I live, Tucson, Arizona, tortilla companies have a lot of competition.  The fact that these became an instant favorite after I tried them speaks to their quality.  They taste great, have a very nice texture, and don't tear easily when they're being folded to make a burrito.<br /><br />Something I've noticed about the chiltepin tortillas is that they keep in my refrigerator for a long time.  I don't know if that's because of the freshness of the ingredients or if the chiltepin serves as a natural mold inhibitor.  Either way, I've been buying these for quite a while and have never had to throw any out because they were moldy.<br /><br />For people who are spice-averse, the chiltepin adds a very mild heat to the tortillas.  If you like a lot of heat, I recommend adding hot sauce.

review/summary: I grew up on this mayonnaise
review/text: JFG is an excellent mayonnaise made and sold in the south. My family was in the grocery business back in the 30's through 80's. The JFG salesman made weekly calls to keep us well stocked. JFG was best known as a coffee manufacturer.<br /><br />I ordered the 4-quart case a couple of months ago and had it delivered to my cousin in Kansas where you cannot buy it in the stores. My father and his brother (my cousin's father) both made pimento cheese using JFG mayo. My cousin's son made a batch soon after the mayo arrived and can now make several more batches.

review/summary: My kid is happy with it = 5 stars
review/text: My son, 5.5 months old, loves Similac.  He had trouble breast feeding for the first few weeks and similac is what we got from the hospital.  For two months we switched to only breastfeeding.  Then two months of supplementing with similac, only really because he was just eating too much and my wife couldn't keep up.  My son had no problem switching back and forth between the two.  And at 5 months we have weened him to only formula since my wife had to go back to school.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Kid loves/drinks it. No difference for him between this and breastmilk.<br />2) We were buying only the pre-mixed travel bottles.  He can't tell the difference between those and the powder (which is cheaper).<br />3) Can mix with warm water.  Takes two seconds to make.<br />4) Amazon Mom, if you haven't heard of it sign up.  You get Amazon Prime 2 day shipping for FREE.  I think I've had it free for a about a year now.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) A little expensive, I believe Cosco does sell the powder for a little cheaper, but Amazon Prime is more convenient.  And cosco doesn't have the pre-mixed bottles which I also order for travel and the middle of the night if I'm lazy and don't want to turn the lights on to mix formula.

Nothing.<br />The king of 'em all is a brand called "Handlmaier's", but this one is very close to it.<br />You put it on any sausage, any cold cuts (excellent in sandwiches!), basically any meat - and it's a different world of taste. You either love it or hate it. For me, I'm willing to pay the 40 bucks plus 9 bucks shipping for a couple of small tubes of this stuff. I drive across town to every WorldMarket in the city to get this mustard in jars (only to find out they don't carry that product anymore). When a tube is empty, I will put the opening in my mouth and squeeze the last drop out of it. Then cry.<br />It looks like even Amazon stopped selling most Bavarian mustards so this kind is the last one standing. Buy now or I will.

review/text: My sisters really like this kind of Pasta Sides, but personally I'm not a huge fan. That may be because we tried to eat it as a main dish, but I wasn't able to stand eating it like that (unlike all the other flavors of pasta sides) until I made some buttered toast to pair with it. If I eat each bite with a bite of toast, then it's tasty. If its plain though, I don't think I could eat very much of it. So my suggestion for those who weren't crazy about it but didn't hate it: try making some plain toast with butter, OR make some texas toast in the oven and pile some of the pasta on top of it before serving. You might like it a little more then :)

This is the first one I simply do not like in the least.<br /><br />I had the EXACT same result as reviewer  "Lee_Dailey" did. There is a hint of bacon smell, but no bacon to be seen. Literally none.<br /><br />As far as the "cheese" flavor goes....it tastes exactly like the amount of bacon I found (zilch). Without a hint of bacon, the nastiness of the noodles and "cheese" shines through wonderfully! ;) If there was even HINT of bacon it would have helped a little bit.<br /><br />I give it two stars rather than one because if you add other stuff to it, it becomes at least edible. It's just not edible on its own.

review/summary: Fabulous, especially for salads and vegetables
review/text: I recently tried a package of TrueLemon packets. The packets are like little sugar or sweetener packets in size. However, the packaging is quite sturdy; it won't rip open in your purse. The taste is just like intense, concentrated lemon. Although the ingredients do contain a small quantity of evaporated cane juice, there is no sweet taste and only approximately 1 calorie per packet. (They claim the product is "unsweetened" and has "0" calories, but that is a slight exaggeration).<br /><br />Anyway, this product works fine for adding lemon to iced or hot tea or colas. However, I think the product really shines when added to salads and vegetables, and is a wonderful tip for those of us trying to lose weight. I sprinkle some TrueLemon onto a salad, and then find it adds so much flavor that there is no need for salad dressing! I also sprinkle some on cooked broccoli and it is delightful. It adds a burst of lemon flavor without making anything watery.<br /><br />I will definitely continue to purchase this product, and I look forward to looking for more ways to use it on healthy foods, to cut down on salty, high-calorie sauces and condiments. I also look forward to bringing some with me to restaurants, to add some pizazz to itmes like salmon or grilled chicken.<br /><br />The product is a bit pricy, so I will use it sparingly. And mostly just save it for sprinkling lightly on vegetables and salads. For drinks, I can easily add a little lemon juice. Very tasty product.

This is not a lemonade mix or one of those other funny drink packet mixes, this is literally just lemon flavoring.<br /><br />I know a lot of people are nervous about restaurants putting unwashed lemon slices directly in their glass - this is perfect for that. Just ask for it plain and stir it in yourself! I bought the massive pack of 6 boxes and I go through them like crazy. Can't live without this stuff. The box of packets stays out on my counter like the sugar stays out on the counter at my parents house ;)

review/text: I love lemon on everything, especially on vegetables.  With these little packages, I can even take them with me to the restaurants.  THey are also great poured into cans of diet SPRITE.  It adds a little more zest to my drinks.  I love this product!
