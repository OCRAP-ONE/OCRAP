review/summary: Pure peach
review/text: These preserves are made with sugar, which has more character than the high fructose corn syrup used in most jams.  The peach flavor is as peachily intense as can be, so you can use less of these preserves on your toast, in your yogurt, or cottage cheese!

review/summary: Great Shanks for cooking
review/text: The 8 Country Ham Shanks arrived at my door 36 hours after I ordered.  I live 100 miles from California, Missouri so that might have helped in the expeditious delivery.  The Shanks are much larger than I expected, about the size of a football (American) cut in half.<br /><br />They were not frozen on delivery.  They come in a durable plastic as pictured and I guess they weigh about 2 pounds.  The Ham Shank is cut in the middle, but not all the way through. I made navy bean soup with it and it was great.  Meatier than usual.<br /><br />If I could get good shanks locally, I would not have tried Burger brand.  But the butcher I frequent does not sell ham hocks.  I'm hooked and will order again before winter is over.  In summer I will make a trip to Missouri and visit the smoke house.

review/summary: LOVE THESE! but many times the cans arrive dented...
review/text: This are wonderful black beans!  And black beans are SO good for you!  so I give the product 5 stars, but I give Amazon no stars.  The problem is that Amazon's canned goods sometimes arrive dented.  I don't know why.  I have ordered cases of canned goods from Walmart, and they do not arrive dented.  not one dent.  But Amazon...  hmmm... I wonder if they are selling goods that were already damaaged, because it's hard to understand why every case of canned goods I get from them has at least 4-5 dented cans, and in many, every can had bad dents.  But yet when I order a case from Walmart or another place, the cans have no dents at all.  Packaging seems about the same.  Carrier is always UPS.  So that is my only reservation about buying this product from Amazon.  Product is great.  But I cannot recommend buying canned goods from Amazon.  It just seems very suspicious -- like many other customers here, I wonder if Amazon is selling damaged goods.  I've ordered about 20 cases of canned goods from Amazon over the past year, and every single case arrived with badly dented cans, so I am now looking for these products at other places that don't sell damaged goods.

review/summary: Saves a lot of calories and money
review/text: This might not be as great as the coffee down at your local cafe or Starbuck's but it is the next best thing, low in calories and fat. With all the calories you save, you can dress it up with your own cocoa powder on top and still be ahead of the game. Buying in bulk means saving even more money. Just keep in mind that the pack will be half milk discs and half coffee discs so it will be more expensive than buying just straight coffee. You might want to use only half the milk disc by brewing two cups and then splitting it.  Some people find Gevalia bitter, but it is certainly better than Maxwell House. I love the House Blend Starbuck's discs myself, with one of these creamers. Still a fraction of what you have to pay in a shop. Enjoy!

The seller at least emailed me to let me know that (after of course the product was already on its way).<br /><br />The product itself isn't that great. The milk discs don't always work correctly and it doesn't taste nearly as good as most of the other Tassimo drinks.

review/summary: Great Comfort Beverage/Coffee Alternative
review/text: I have tried to like coffee but just never could get into it - I would add so much sugar and creamer it hardly resembled coffee when I was done. I have been a tea drinker for years, but at night after dinner, I crave something a little more creamy and substantial. For years I drank Cafix, another grain beverage similar to this one. After trying the Roma Kaffree once I made the switch. The Roma has a better, richer flavor than the Cafix and with a little sweetener and creamer/milk it's the perfect after dinner beverage.<br /><br />I am pre-diabetic and watching my carbs, and the Roma Kaffree only has 2 grams carbohydrate, 10 calories, 0 grams sodium and 0 grams fat per rounded teaspoon. The only ingredients are roasted barley, roasted malt barley, roasted chicory and roasted rye. Pretty simple, but quite satisfying. I haven't tried it over ice but it might also be good that way.<br /><br />My husband is a coffee drinker and he also likes the Roma after dinner. The price on Amazon can't be beat.

review/text: I have a small batch coffee roaster and often roast my own coffee from green coffee beans.  So I think that I know a fair amount about what is and what isn't good coffee.  This is good coffee.<br /><br />I rarely buy flavored coffees but figured I'd give the hazelnut decaf a try.  The flavor is quite nice and strong but not overpowering.  The beans seem to be of a very good quality and are roasted to what seems like a full city roast to me.  The coffee was also very fresh and this was something that I was concerned about prior to ordering.  Also, you probably would never guess that this was decaf, so it allows you to enjoy a flavored full-bodied coffee without some of the unpleasant side-effects associated with caffiene.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that this is a five star product.  If you like the taste of hazelnuts paired with a full-bodied decaf coffee bean, I think that you would enjoy this.

review/summary: Tasty with a nice Crunch!  August 17, 2009
review/text: I had tried this product before, many years ago. When I saw it here on Amazon, I remembered how good it was. Old London Melba toast is a great healthy snack. I love to eat it with tuna or soup. Low in calories and salt, it is a great way to stay trim around the middle! I am so glad you carry this product. I love melba toast,and now that I have to lower my sodium intake this is the perfect product.

review/summary: Melba Toast, whole grain
review/text: This product is very good but expensive as I could buy it<br />somewhere else cheaper. I bought it as I could not find it<br />in some stores here so I ordered it. I found it later for<br />sale at a lower price. I bought 24 boxes and I could have<br />saved a lot if I waited and bought it here. I checked the<br />description of the item to make sure it is the same as the<br />one available here and it is exactly the same. Any one buying<br />it should check first the price in stores where you live and<br />make sure it is whole grain.

review/summary: Best noodles ever!
review/text: These are the best noodles ever! We had these for our homemade chicken noodle soup as kids growing up in Chicago. Having moved away from Chicago, where these noodles were once readily available, I had to rely on my family to bring me a supply whenever they visited. The real Kluskies were getting harder and harder to find, even in Chicago area stores. I was so glad to find these online, and ordered 12 packages. They were exactly what I wanted and arrived in excellent shape. Everyone who has tried my homemade chicken noodle soup with New Mill Kluskies has become hooked!!I am now stocked up for a while!! If you have never had New Mill Kluskies, you have no idea what you are missing..you will never want any other kind of noodle once you try them!

review/text: I've been yearning for these kluski noodles for decades ever since moving out west from Chicago (could never find them anywhere.)  I've already made a few simple dishes from my childhood.  Although they were a way to "stretch" a tight food budget, they are really rather expensive to have shipped to my home. But bringing back those memories was worth it.  I'm sure they would be on a "less than healthy" list, but they are an occasional treat that I treasure.

review/text: This hot sauce is, as you might imagine, very spicy. It's not for the faint of heart. A few drops in some salsa will give it a real good kick, but trying it straight is probably way too much for even the most seasoned connoisseurs. Luckily, it's not just straight heat - there's a nice smoky flavor that will give whatever you put it in some nice flavorful undertones. This would make a great addition to any hot sauce collection, or if you just need that one bottle of something that will make your friends squirm.

review/summary: Caution: these olives may be addictive!
review/text: Last November, at a small tapas bar in Barcelona, we chose these olives as one of our evening's selections. I'm usually indifferent to green olives, but these have a decidedly 'more-ish' taste!<br /><br />And it's not just me who finds them irresistable: every person who's tasted these in my home has insisted on knowing where they might find more... Never are there any leftovers, darn.<br /><br />I hesitate to submit this review, in case the demand for this product exceeds the supply. Were that to happen, I'd have to check myself in to a rehab center for sure, to combat my withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Wonder if they're available by the barrel?

Unfortunately they were the small cans and did not last long.<br />When we served them to our friends, they too got hooked and wanted him to bring some for them. Even people who did not like anchovies loved the olives.<br />My husband reetired and no more olives. We missed them so much I went online and found them on Amazon.  Last year we gifted shipments to relatives and friends at Christmas.  It was easy and they appreciated getting their own supply.<br />The great part is you control where, when, and how often you want delivery.<br />Thanks Amazon.

I happen to love anchovies (salty and seafood-y, what's not to like?) and I've never seen olives stuffed with anchovies in any of the stores I've been.  Like another reviewer said, it's subtle, not overpowering with anchovies, but if you're unsure (of anchovies, that is), this size (you get TWO of 1 pound 9oz cans) may be too big of a "testing" size for you; I, on the other hand, thought whoooray, perfect size!

review/summary: Great Stuffed Olives
review/text: We have a local farmer's market nearby that of all things sells anchovy stuffed olives.  My wife and I are hooked on them.  You might expect these olives to have a strong taste, but they don't.  The anchovy pieces are small and add a subtle taste, which in our opinion helps to make the olives more mellow than usual.  The really great thing about this purchase aside from the quality of the product is price and accessibility.  Home delivery is always a plus, and we pay less than 20% of what we are charged at market.  Two thumbs way up on this.

I realize that the olives are stuffed not with whole anchovies, but rather with an anchovy paste and the paste that was used with these olives was more filler than anchovy and therefore was lacking in anchovy flavor.

review/text: Well everyonyone likes something else when it comes to flavor, but these don't have spices which I dislike such as mint.  These are somewhat 'strong' in the sense of the saltiness/acidity, which I like.  The texture is on the mushy side.  The expiration date was a couple years into the future.  The one problem is that the way they are packaged caused a few of the cans to dent.  Amazon needs to be more careful packing these.

review/text: Well these don't have any meat in them. For a non ground lamb stuffed grape leaf they are very good. The salt didn't bother me (although I wouldn't want any more) and the grape leaf taste was nice to have. Some Yogurt on top and you are good to go. I think they are very cheap for the quantity and none of the stuffed leaves were split or broken in the cans. I thought it was pretty impressive that the cans were that full and everything looked picture perfect. They are darker leaves and not the young light green leaves that my grandmother used. Of course, she had a vineyard and picking the new leaves is a luxury to be sure. This is not to say the leaves have heavy veins - they don't. Very nice on that score. It's all edible. I plan on buying these again and again. The only thing that I worry about is the product of Turkey part. I hope they have their food safety laws together. I wish I knew more about that. But my hunger for Stuffed Grape Leaves needs to be sated and these do make the cut.

review/summary: Galil is the best canned stuffed grape leaves I have tried so far
review/text: I grew up eating homemade stuffed grape leaves.  Of the canned varieties, I have tried Galil, Roland and Sultan.  Roland is rather bland and the leaves are tough, with the veins being too large, I.E. they were allowed to grow for too long and are no longer tender.  Sultan had good flavor but far too much oil, which also affected the texture.  The Galil are the best tasting by flavor and texture and they are also reasonably priced.  The first Galil I bought (case of 12 cans of 14 oz each) were twenty-seven dollars and forty-six cents after the subscription discount in February 2011.  I will type out the money in words, in hopes of escaping the Amazon censors.

review/text: I grew up eating homemade stuffed grape leaves so I am very biased, sorry. I have tried so many different brands of canned stuffed grape leaves and found most to be too mushy or too crunchy. These Galil brand strike the best balance. Someone mentioned that they tasted too salty. I did not sense that at all. They have a very mild lemon "zing" on the palate which to me is perfect. I will continue to buy these at a great price from Amazon. Oh, these Galil's are the first canned grape leaves that I could eat and not feel compelled to smother them in Tzatziki yogurt dip. That is a real compliment in my book!

I rolled each one in paper towels to remove the liquid before placing the grape leaves on the plate. I have served these a number of times and always get very good comments from guests.  I would have given them a rating of 5 except for the packing liquid and the fact that a number of the cans were dented, some severely. Amazon replaced my first order since all but one of the cans were damaged. A little better job with the packing would be a very good idea.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is soooooooooo much better than at our local grocery chains.  I will keep ordering these and hope the packing improves.

review/summary: Would You Like Some Grape Leaves With Your Salt?
review/text: I've been eating stuffed grape leaves for decades and these are far and away the worst ones I've ever had. They ARE edible, yes. But they're so incredibly salty that I'm eating them at about 1/10 of the pace that I normally would (especially considering how many cans I now have). Bottom line: spend a little more money and get something better.<br /><br />P.S.: Another reviewer remarked on how some of the cans were dented in transit. That was the case for me too.

review/text: these are simply the worst stuffed grape leaves i have ever eaten. i cannot believe all the good reviews, which, regretably, influenced our decision to buy. we threw the first can out, it was so bad, then tried another a few weeks later, hoping there was just a bad can in the case. no such luck.  i would even say, this is one of the worst things i have ever eaten! these are a major rip-off.

review/summary: AMAZING!
review/text: This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows.

review/text: I'm a huge Stephen's fan but I'd only ever had the regular Milk Choc hot cocoa.  Deciding to be a little more health conscious I thought I'd try the fat-free variety.  DON'T! :)  Okay, if you aren't expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it.  It's much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesn't do justice to regular Stephen's Hot Cocoa.  I'm going back to the good stuff.

review/summary: Very good hot Cocoa
review/text: I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.

And on Amazon!  She was surprised and pleased.  The price is good, as is the cocoa.  I would only be more happy if I could get an assortment.

review/summary: Incredible Hot Chocolate with Raspberry
review/text: I ran into this product at a bed and breakfast.  Unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component, the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate.  You don't get just a hint of it that soon gets lost.  You taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip....very very enjoyable.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa, Cherry Chocolate, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)
review/text: This is absolutely delicious.  Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow.  I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha.  That also cuts the sweetness.  It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries -- a treat I have loved since childhood!<br /><br />I get mine through the "subscription program" along with several other flavors from Stephen's.  The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed.

I've never been able to find it where I live now, I should of known to check Amazon! By the way, I've never tasted a variety I didn't like, but I've never tried the reduced fat kind, either.  I also like to make it with coffee instead of water when I need a little boost, it almost makes coffee taste good (sorry, but there's nothing out there that can do that).

Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!!

review/summary: Stephen's Hot Candycane Cocoa is the best!
review/text: We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision.

review/text: Well, I love hot cocoa but this is truly different. It literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing "warm you from the inside out" hot cocoa drink. If you are someone that isn't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it. The peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate. Truly different from any hot cocoa that I have ever enjoyed.

review/text: I originally received this Mint Truffle hot chocolate as a gift, and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water, because in the past that always results in a weak flavor. Amazingly, that is not the case with this mix, even with no milk added this has a great rich, chocolate-mint taste.<br /><br />Because it doesn't require milk, I can keep it at work for a warm-up drink on cold office days. I usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P6855Y">Aladdin 16-Ounce Recycled and Recyclable Tumbler, Lily</a> then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate.

review/text: I bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting.  We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it, I saw pieces of Candycane candy in the chocolate powder. I made it the way that they suggested, with hot water, not milk.  It was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  There were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop.  I am thrilled to see that they carry this on Amazon because I know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on Amazon is much less than I paid.

review/text: These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands, but I would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good.  We just had to order another case.  Try it with some coffee.  Mash it up in some vanilla ice cream. Seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude's first name.  First name only brands really cheese up the product.  How about "Cocoa Passions" or "Divine Cocoa" or even, "Serenity Now Cocoa".  Anything would Glam up the product name a little. I am a builder, would you buy an expensive house from "Kreg's Stately Mansions"? Nope.  Doesn't matter how choice the work is. I am sorry, Stephen, you do have a great product, I'll stop. Oh well, keep the prices low...Five stars, brother.

review/text: I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.
