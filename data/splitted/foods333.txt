review/text: Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan, 24-count K- cups for Keurig Brewers (pack of 2) is a delightful product. The K-cups are sturdy and they don't leak when you remove them from the brewer. The flavor is great and they arrive on time.

review/text: I was a little hesitant at first since they didnt have a small sampler of it.  The Keurig web site is always out of it.  But from the first cup to the last little bit in the mug it has proven to be worth the gamble.  In my opinion it is a very smooth coffee.  Perfect for those Saturday or Sunday Mornings sitting on the porch.  It has a nice flavor with a nice hint of pecan but not overpowering. Doesn't seem to leave a unpleasant aftertaste just a craving for another cup.  If you are on the fence and not sure, just jump off and give it a shot.  Worth the money.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee!
review/text: A few years ago, I worked in a bed and breakfast and one of my favorite parts was the southern pecan coffee. I have since been trying to find a coffee that is comparable. This is it! Like one of the other reviewers, I don't care for super strong coffee. This coffee has a very smooth flavor and the pecan flavor does not take over the coffee...the two work beautifully together!

So we turned around and bought two whole boxes of it!  Goes nice with my large mug!

review/summary: Love the smell & like the flavor
review/text: I gave this four stars based on the flavor (according to my own taste preference of course) but I would give ten stars to the aroma!  It fills the kitchen with such a wonderful scent.  Back to the flavor though, it's a gentle pecan taste with a just under medium roast flavor.  So to many I believe it would be considered weak.  You could brew a smaller cup or more likely if you like your coffee strong, you probably are not looking at this product anyway!  If you are looking for strong order a variety that is bold or extra bold.  I like to have a variety of K cups without paying the sampler pack prices and this fits the bill for my home.  I have started with a 50 pack of a known favorite and then 24 packs of other flavors that I think I would like to try and have to offer to company.<br /><br />UPDATE: After running through a number of varieties I can tell you we ran out of the Pecan pretty quick.  I still love the aroma and like the flavor and it's definitely one I would order again.

review/text: Green Mountain Coffee "Southern Pecan", for Keurig Brewers is an excellent medium brewed coffee.  I enjoy the "Southern Pecan" flavor that compliments a variety of foods and is a treat on its own.  Unlike some flavored coffees that claim to have flavor...I have found that "Green Mountain" pulls of the balance of richness, aroma, good taste and flavor.

review/summary: Great Coffee for a Flavored Coffee
review/text: This is a medium roasted coffee, those that call it a light roast must be used to a heavier tasting cup of coffee. When first brewed, it has a very pleasant nutty aroma that fills the room and gets your expectations going. I have the Keurig with 3 cup sizes, if you brew it on the smallest setting, it's like a little shot of nutty espresso (on the milder side)...on the second setting it's a more intense flavor that Starbucks people could probably relate to...on the largest setting it is ready for you to add what you desire and still get a very good, subtle nutty tasting, rich coffee. I add a bit of sugar while drinking it black and it's a delight...when you are in the mood for something different. I find I don't like it as much as my first cup of the day...but every once in a while I like a cup in the afternoon and this is where I find it stands out. Not a heavy, burnt tasting roast...milder than that heavy stuff and flavorful WITHOUT knocking you out with an added fake flavor that doesn't belong there...it seems to really go together, pecan & coffee. Let's just say it's a nice cup of coffee with a bit of a nutty tone...PS: I'm not a real lover of flavored coffees but this one is done right...on the lines of Island Coconut, who would think that coconut & coffee flavors would go pleasantly together?...but they do!

review/text: These bulbs are expensive. There's no way around it.<br /><br />That said, they've been better (subjectively) than any other bulb I've bought, and I've been buying CFLs for years. They've lasted much longer than other brands - both in areas where the lights stay on for long periods uninterrupted, and places like our kids' bathroom where the lights are turned on and off frequently. In fact, I don't recall replacing any since I bought my first package of six more than a year and a half ago. I can't say the same for other brands I've bought.<br /><br />They seem to come on quickly, at near or full brightness.<br /><br />Without measuring the lifetime of the bulb compared to others, I can't say with certainty they've been worth the money - judged solely on the cost per hour of use.<br /><br />But, I can tell you they've been less frustrating, which makes them worth the cost to me (personally).

review/summary: Better than no rhubarb pie
review/text: I was very hopeful about this pie filling, since I love rhubarb and can't get it since moving to the South (not unless I pay through the nose).  However, I've only opened one of the two jars I bought, so far, and that jar WAS a generous amount for filling an 8 or 9-inch pie, but had what I consider to be much too thick a consistency (possibly as a result of all the sugar and other sweeteners necessary for the preserving process? I don't know).<br /><br />In addition, I may've simply gotten one 'bad' jar, but the flavor seemed 'off' -- almost on the edge of fermentation.  I 'cut' the jar of pie filling with a pound of fresh strawberries and turned it into a decent-ish 10-inch strawberry-rhubarb pie, but it still doesn't taste quite right to me, and there's still that slight hint of fermentation.  I can eat it, but I'm not in any hurry to finish it off.<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable, since I've never had a canned rhubarb pie filling before (not even home-canned), but always used fresh or home-frozen rhubarb, going easy on the sugar in the recipe to preserve that mouth-watering tartness.  Whenever I've had access to lots of rhubarb, I prefer it straight, no strawberries or blueberries or raspberries mixed in (though those are all good combinations).<br /><br />Honestly, I'm beginning to think it might be worthwhile to pay over $4 a pound for a bit of fresh rhubarb in the store, which I can cut with the much-cheaper strawberries to make a semi-rhubarb pie.  But that's just my taste, and as I said, I might've simply gotten a 'bad batch'.

review/summary: Tasty Delicious Pie Filling
review/text: As soon as I received the rhubarb pie filling, I refrigerated it. I made the dough for the crust from a recipe from the Pie and Pastry Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum. I used the cream cheese based pastry for a two crust 9 inch pie. I prebaked the shell for 15 minutes at 425F. Then I added the rhubarb pie filling. I put a few tabs of butter on top. I then made a lattice with the leftover dough. Then I baked it for half an hour at 390F. I did not have to add anything to the pie filling. It tasted delicious as is. The result was a very tasty and easy to make rhubarb pie. It will certainly be comforting to eat rhubarb pie during these cold winter nights.

I ordered 4 jars and it cost $40 to ship to Hawaii. I could have gone to the post office and shipped it for a 3rd of that price.  The shipping cost was not posted until my order was finalized so I didn't know how much they were going to charge until it was too late.

(IF they have any in stock. And that's a big if.) And all I have to do is pour it out in my pie crust and bake so it couldn't be much easier.<br />It's so good!

review/summary: Absolutely the best !
review/text: I am originally from the Pittsburgh area, lived on a farm, my parents grew rhubarb. Moving to the south made it almost impossible to find rhubarb unless I actually ordered it from a grocery store. Most of the time when asking about rhubarb, nobody knew what it was. I found Barry Farm online (via Amazon)several years ago, and have ordered the pie filling eversince. My 3 boys are big fans of rhubarb pie and every Thanksgiving I make one for each of them. They look forward to those pies every year.I am thrilled at the ease it is to just pop the filling in a pie shell, add topping, and it's ready to go. Plus.....it's YUMMY !

I could of course compare it to my grandmother's pie and be critical, but instead just say that if you have not had rhubarb pie in a while, or never had it, this is one of the best and easiest<br />ways to re-introduce or introduce you to this wonderful pie.  My wife called Barry Farm prior to cooking the pie, and they were very nice and helpful with cooking and serving hints.<br /><br />Good filling, great customer service!  You'll love your pie.

review/summary: Can't blame the product
review/text: It smells and looks beautiful, but unless/until you try 100% cacao, you'll have no idea how bitter/tart it is.  So I ate a piece with a dried date and found it to be VERY good.  The flavor is pretty intense, so a little goes a long way.<br /><br />I tried my hand at making my own chocolate from this block. In hindsight, there were many things I could have done differently (it was gritty as the sugar hadn't dissolved enough), but amazingly, in spite of my efforts, the chocolate was STILL VERY GOOD and quite popular.  I definitely give that credit to the quality of the cacao and ingredients.<br /><br />Also the package is actually (3) 1-kilo blocks instead of 1 big block, so which is a lot less dramatic, but much easier to work with.  I keep mine in the freezer.

review/summary: Yummy, hearty cookie! It's hard to eat just one!
review/text: I am a HUGE fan of oatmeal cookies.  When Kashi introduced these cookies with Oatmeal Raisin and Flax I just had to try them.  Although there are only 8 cookies per package and a serving is considered 1 cookie (I hardly think so), these are wonderful, tasty, hearty and give the impression that you are eating real, whole food.  I think they are better than other types of cookies you can buy and they really are delicious if you love oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />As of this writing, these are .57 cents a cookie and that's a little pricey.  You can find better deals sometimes elsewhere.  I bought the Pack of 6 and enjoyed them for breakfast mostly (2-3 with coffee) were plenty filling.  I absolutely love this cookie.  I wish they would make them a little more affordable, change the serving size and find some way to lower the caloric value :)  Wishful thinking!  Still, I love them.  4 stars only because they are so pricey for 8 cookies.<br /><br />Maybe Kashi can find another packaging method and give more cookies or something.  Still, I'll be buying more.  They are absolutely the best!!!

review/summary: The best of the Kashi cookies in my opinion!
review/text: Okay, it's kashi, it's healthy, it's full of real food, in as much, these are more substantial (read thick and grainy) than a regular cookie...these are not going to taste like standard oatmeal raisin cookies...the cookies are rather dry (and i do have some concerns about the little packs in the boxes that keep the cookies ...umm fresh) I'm not sure how safe/healthy those are but i'm not a scientist so i'll leave it at that (I guess they are moisture control) anyhow, all in all these cookies are good for someone who want's a cookie but without the guilt factor. These are one at a time sized cookies, and I actually can't imagine wanting to eat more than one at a sitting anyhow because they are kind of hard to work through (See grainy/dry) but the flavor overall is good, I prefer this better than the dark chocolate or trail mix, I think the raisins add just a bit of moisture so this variety is a touch less dry, and also a tiny bit sweeter. Also, something to note, if you are buying kashi items in bulk be prepared to eat a lot of them and quickly as the expiration dates are usually no more than 2 or 3 months past purchse (afterall these don't have all the chemicals/preservatives of your typical quick foods. That being said, all in all, this is my favorite of the three kashi cookie varieties,and they are a healthy option for cookie lovers.

review/summary: Excellent Light Output - Perfect Full Spectrum White Light
review/text: These lights have exceptionally good light output. I bought these 30 Watt bulbs, but they were a little too bright when I used them in a light fixture with 5 lamp sockets. The 23 Watt bulbs I purchased afterwards are still rather bright in the same 5 socket light fixture, but acceptable. The light output will become a little less with time. These 30 Watt bulbs are excellent for a three lamp light fixture. When compared to an incandescent bulb, these appear to be pure white and the standard bulb a weak yellow glow by comparison. Once you adapt to these full spectrum bulbs, you cannot go back to standard incandescent bulbs. Now I am replacing incandescent bulbs in all areas of my new house except in areas of low usage or places the bulbs will not fit. These bulbs will fit in most fixtures, however. I am replacing the fixture in my garage to put some 45 Watt full spectrum bulbs into a cluster light fixture. I live in the Houston, Texas area so cold weather is not normally a problem. Fluorescent bulbs often are weak in light output in cold weather until they warm up after a few minutes. When warm, they work fine. I have not tried this particular bulb series in a cold soak environment yet. The payoff should come this summer when electric bills are at their peak. These bulbs are very efficient and produce a lot less heat than incandescent bulbs. I look forward to the day that LED bulbs become affordable and brighter, but for now, this is the way to go. Definitely avoid the so called warm white fluorescent bulbs in the stores. Order only full spectrum CFL bulbs or those rated 51K or 55K or anything in the 5000 to 6000 Kelvin light spectrum. I would avoid the bulbs in the 6000 Kelvin range. They probably have too much of a blue shift. The 51K or 5100 Kelvin bulbs are perfect. Then it is just a matter of selecting the wattage you want. For multiple bulb fixtures, the 23 Watt bulbs are usually perfect. For single bulb fixtures, you probably want a higher power bulb than these. I am using a 45 Watt 51K fluorescent bulb over my breakfast nook and it is just right. These full spectrum bulbs are great for SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) people like me. I get winter depression when it is cloudy and bleak for a long time. Normally Houston has plenty of sunshine, but this winter has been unusually cold. Well, at least I am not in the frozen north. This is quite a switch for me because I just moved from the San Francisco area.

review/text: I haven't met a CFL that I've liked, but this one I really don't like.  I use full spectrum incandescents, which give off a much more pleasant light. I installed this bulb and it turned my room into a cool, blue, unpleasant, underlit room.  I replaced a 100 watt incandescent and although this bulb claimed an equivalent output of a 125 watt bulb, it definitely does not provide the amount of light that my 100 watt bulbs put out.<br /><br />So for now, it's incandescents for me until LED lighting becomes affordable enough and I'll give that a try.<br /><br />Yes, I'll still try to use these for energy savings in places where I'm not so concerned with the quality of light (my garage, the porch light, a closet, etc.

review/text: Had a BBQ party with some friends - enjoyed both brisket and ribs.  Among the sauces were Rufus Teague, and The Salt Lick.  I have to say that Rufus Teague was a huge hit -- barely edges out this one.  However, the Salt Lick was exceptionally good -- easily 5 stars.  It's got a bit of a mustard kick to it.  Personally, a sauce that's overly sweet gets old quickly.  This one has adequate sweetness, but I consider is slightly more savory than sweet.  I appreciate the fact that it has far less sugar than most others, incl RT.  The texture is a bit thin, but it sticks well to food.<br /><br />FWIW - It paired much better with the ribs than the brisket, which is partly why RT won overall honors.

review/summary: Excellent gum, great flavor, no titanium dioxide
review/text: This is my second order.  I like this brand because it doesn't have titanium dioxide in it.  I like this company because they're up front in their ad if it has titanium dioxide - like they do on their Dental Defense gum is plainly stated in their ad that it contains titanium dioxide.<br /><br />The xylitol reduces bad breath and prevents tooth decay and gum disease and has no unhealthy sugar to cause inflammation in the body that promotes disease.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll be back for more of their great product.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I love the Yogi brand of Chai tea...whether it's the Redbush or Green tea.  It has so much more flavor than other brands of Chai tea and I have tried a ton of varieties.  I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.

review/summary: Its cheap, but it has too much added flavoring
review/text: No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.

review/text: Everytime I get this shipment delivered, the cans are broken and the food leaked out and there are bugs everywhere. I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up. This is the third shipment we received like this (I had one shipment damaged and had the shipments on automatic renew each month and the last shipments were damaged too) and I am fed up. I posted a comment to the seller about this after the frst shipment and never received a response and the problem keeps happening. SO NOT WORTH IT and I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! I am going to the local Walmart to get it there is not much of a difference in price and at least I know I am not getting bugs shipped to my home and having to throw out cans that are damaged. I cancelled my future shipments and DO NOT recommend anyone order this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Dog Food by the Case
review/text: I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: This is definitely my cup of Tea!!!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F5RRSC">Primula Products Flowering Tea Set</a>I'm a big Green Tea drinker. I usually made my tea with the loose tea leaves, but then a friend told me about blooming teas. I wasn't really expecting much but I liked the looks of the Tea Pot and figured I'd give it a try. Boy was I surprised!I dropped my Tea bulb in the Primula Tea Pot. I chose Camellia Joy which is Green Tea with Acaiberry. I poured hot water over the bulb and couldn't believe the beautiful flower that began to unfold in the Pot. It reminded me of watching those nature movies in Biology class so many years ago when they'd speed up the timed pictures to show a seed blossoming in fast motion! It was incredible to watch it bloom! I then poured myself a cup of the healthy steaming hot green tea and was pleasantly surprised at the aroma and light but flavorful taste. I poured hot water over the flower 3 more times and each cup tasted as delicious as the first. I've decided this will make a fabulous birthday present for my Mom and a great present for my mother in law come Christmas time.<br />But the best part is the  Tea Pot itself. It is made of a special glass that is able to withstand boiling hot water on the stove, or holding cold tea in the fridge.It doesn't crack with temperature change, it's light-weight yet sturdy, and I love the classic design and feel of it in my hand. I leave it out with the blooming flower still in in it as a centerpiece when my friends come over. It never fails that they notice it and ask me to demonstrate how it works. I love entertaining with it and make sure I keep plenty of the flowering bulbs on hand for those drop-ins.  And the glass infuser that comes with it is great as well. It sits down inside the Tea Pot and is perfect for making a cup of loose tea for a change. It brews right inside the Tea Pot and makes a perfect blend every time, without the loose tea leaves getting into my cup. Needless to say, if you love Tea, want to start trying Tea, or know of a Tea lover, this is the perfect gift for yourself or friends. I highly recommend it. The price is right and the value is extraordinary!

review/text: I purchased this product after having tried the white tea (with peach), which was very nice with a subtle aroma of peach. However, the green tea with jasmine (which comes with this tea pot) has a very heavy scent and really smells like some cheap perfume. Not at all like I expected, or like anything I would want to drink. Watching the flower open is still nice and the tea would probably work if you want to put it in a spray bottle and spritz some on behind the ears before going out. Just don't expect to actually drink the stuff.

They no longer are carrying it at our store so I had to go online to find it and I am buying it online.  I have a couple of other friends that I now have hooked on it as well.  Best tasting green tea ever!  Will continue to buy this item!

review/text: Well as everyone knows, green tea is super healthy and good, take 8 tea bags heat 4 cups water to nearly boiling and steep for 4 minutes, fill your tea pitcher half way with cool water and stir in 1/8 tsp of stevia add steeped tea and stir then rinse tea bags with fresh water and add to pitcher. Add ice and it's pure heaven!  so refreshing!

review/summary: Sweet - don't need much.
review/text: All you need with this is a sprinkle...if that.  It does sweeten everything - and is good if you have diabetes or just want to avoid sugar.  Too much and it turns bitter tasting on ya, so not too much.  Some people think there is an after taste...or an off taste - but I don't.  No, its not going to taste like a mouthful of real sugar...but it does add sweetness / like you know, diet coke is sweet but it not coke.  The powder can be messy, the drops are easier - but both cumbersome to carry around with you (big disadvantage).  The little packets of this (and they make them) contain maltodextrin - which I avoid...a filler with a high glycemic index (basically corn starch) so know that in advance.  And the packets some of them contain INULIN which is a fiber - and that can cause painful gas.  This is all I know - I hope its been helpful.  Should you try it?  Yeah.  Don't toss it after your first go'round with it though - give it another try and another until you learn how and when/where it will work best for you.  If you want to cook with this please learn about that on the web - I have no idea about measurement conversions for this.  Enjoy.
