review/summary: Perfect for Cookie Craving 3yr olds!
review/text: I loved how the cookie was nice and soft when I opened the packaging. It seemed to be made of fresher ingredients. I decided to split the cookie in two and let the kids each have one side. I had to split it because the package only had one cookie in it. My daughter devoured it, my son...he saw there were raisin's in it and freaked out. K ended up eating her brother's half as well. I was bugged for days by her for another cookie so she must have loved it since that's how 3yr olds express love for food! (I WANT MORE COOKIE!)<br />I didn't get a chance to personally try the cookie, but over all it seemed good and from a brand that I like and trust, it also smelled pretty yummy!

review/text: Quaker wins again with these delicious cookies.  I was particularly loving the individually wrapped aspect of the oatmeal raisin cookies.  I hate opening a box and having half of the cookies go stale because the air gets to them.  These are so easy to throw into your bag or just grab one when you want and they are always fresh, soft and yummy.

review/summary: Fantastic snack
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed trying out the Quaker soft-baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies as part of the Influenster program.  The cookie was moist, soft, chewy... everything an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  The taste was superb - just the right amount of cinnamon & nutmeg - and it was super filling and held me over perfectly until dinner time.  When I tried them out, I was 8 months pregnant and constantly hungry, so for a cookie to be able to hold me over for that long... color me impressed!

review/summary: Quaker Soft Batch Cookies are a hit in my book!
review/text: I received this product to test courtesy of Influenster and Quaker and I have to say they are a hit in my house. This was the first product we tried out of the 5 we were sent to test and it lasted less then ten minutes in my home. My toddler was anxious to give them a try and I have already purchased two more boxes since we tasted the first one. They will definitely be a staple product. I love that they are from a trusted brand and I love that they are made with whole grains and I can feel good about my snack choice!

review/text: This cookie package was featured at the local supermarket, so I picked up a pack for a road trip I was going on.  I liked the fact the cookie was soft (probably the reason the cookie was individually wrapped), and the taste was almost as good as homemade.<br /><br />Four solid stars for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie.  Just shop on price; if the price is good, you'll enjoy your treat.

I was so happy because that one big cookie was everything I have been looking for, not too sweet, not too bland, not salty, not too many rasins and most of all not many calories. The perfect snack, especially with a cup of tea and a book...

They are really great, and if you have tried their oatmeal breakfast bars these are kinda like them, but not as heavy!!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, individually-wrapped oatmeal cookies
review/text: These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).<br /><br />Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Fiber!  4g per cookie.<br />- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.<br />- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None really.<br /><br />Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: I am a cookie lover, so I was excited to get to try this product for free through the Amazon Vine program.  Unfortunately, these are just not very good.<br /><br />They are too crumbly, almost powdery, as if maybe they weren't baked enough.  The flavor is okay, but certainly nothing special.  They are soft, but the texture is not pleasant.<br /><br />They remind me of "Grandma's Cookies".  Except they are about half as good.

review/summary: Quality Cookie
review/text: My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies.

review/summary: Tasty, but not moist enough
review/text: These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something.

review/summary: Just ok, dry and crumbly
review/text: They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie.

review/summary: Soft but dry
review/text: One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these.

review/text: I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The Quaker Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.  This will be the ONLY type of soft cookie I will buy from here on out!  I love the quality of Quaker products!

As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!

review/text: These aren't bad for a packaged, commercial cookie. They don't taste fake, they aren't overly sweet, and they have a nice texture. My kids really liked them.

review/text: I never really liked oatmeal cookies but the commercial for the Quaker soft baked Oatmeal cookie bought me. I loved how soft it was and tasted just as fresh as a cookie that just cooled down out of the oven. I am addicted

review/summary: Awesome Goodness!
review/text: I recently got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies via Influenster in my Mom VocBox and that cookie didn't last 2 minutes in my home!  Once it came out of the box, it was out of the wrapper and I had to split it 3 ways cause the kids saw it and had to have some.  Love the soft, chewy goodness and the flavor is so great and pure.  We are headed out to get some more!<br />*I recieved this product compliments of Influenster however all opinions are my own.

review/summary: Just Like Mama Used to Make!
review/text: I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Quaker and Influenster. I didn't hardly get it out of the box before my 2 year old spied it and had to try it! We split the tasty cookie and both really enjoyed it. I have since bought some of the crunchy Quaker cookies which are really good too, but I really do like the soft, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies for my daughters. It's great afternoon snack and easy to pack in my purse for trips to the zoo or swimming. Also, since there Quaker cookies it's a brand I trust and have used for years so that makes me feel happy about the choice I'm making for my children.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious!!
review/text: As soon as I opened my Mom Vox Box, I pulled out this cookie. I LOVE oatmeal raisin and so does my 2 year old daughter, Lily. She started screaming, "cookie, cookie mama, cookie". So naturally I gave in. She liked it. She decided to eat it over her mac and cheese which is unusual for her! I did manage to steal a piece and it is amazingly good! I will definitely be buying these regularly!
